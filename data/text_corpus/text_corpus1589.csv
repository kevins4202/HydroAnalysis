application to the aquifer system underlain the city of miami beach at north of spain and the case study of the quaternary aquifer of el arish rafah egypt 2 optimization of pumping rates from coastal aquifers the management scenarios for controlling seawater intrusion are settled to either maximize the economic benefit from the pumped fresh water or maximize the total pumping rate from the wells benhashmi 2003 mathematically expressed the two objectives as maximizing the total benefit from pumped water 1 max z 1 i 1 n w q i b c l i h i maximizing total pumping rate from wells 2 max z 2 i 1 n w q i subject to q min i q i q max i i 1 n w x toe i x i i 1 n w where z 1 and z 2 objective functions of maximum benefit and maximum pumping rate respectively q i well pumping rate from well i b

w number of wells q min i q max i minimum and maximum permissible pumping rates from well i and finally x toe i intrusion length at y i where y i and x i are the y coordinate and horizontal coordinate of well i respectively 2 1 governing equations the governing equations describing flow in unconfined aquifers can be expressed as follow hunt 1983 fig 1 for freshwater zone i 3a δ x kh δ x h δ y kh δ

assumptions el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 first a sharp interface exists between the saltwater zone and the freshwater zone rather than a transition zone fig 1 second the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and steady state conditions are considered third the dupuit assumption is used to obtain two dimensional equations by averaging the flow equation in vertical direction fourth the interface location is deduced from the ghyben herzberg assumption finally a single potential theory approach strack 1976 is adopted to make use of a single governing potential equation across the two zones of the coastal aquifer strack 1976 transformed the nonlinear eqs 3a and 3b into linear form without any approximation by replacing the dependent variable h with potential φ accordingly eqs 3a and 3b for

decomposition method used to decrease the runtime of the optimization model can be found in el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 3 jellyfish search algorithm js the artificial jellyfish search optimization algorithm chou and truong 2020 is a new metaheuristic optimization technique which is inspired by the behavior of jellyfish in the ocean the algorithm balances between both the initial exploration of the search space followed by the exploitation to find the promising areas in the search space global optimum a time control function governs the switch between the two phases the controlling parameters of the algorithm are the population size and the number of iterations the algorithm can be summarized as follow 1 jellyfish follow either ocean current or move inside the swarm the ocean current is given by 5 trend 1 n pop trend i x e c μ x df 6 trend x β rand 0 1 μ where n pop is the number of jellyfish and x is the jellyfish currently with the best location in the swarm best location means best solution for the objective function e c is the factor governing the attraction μ is the mean location of all jellyfish and df is the difference between the current best location of the jellyfish the mean location of all jellyfish and β 0 is a distribution coefficient the new location of each jellyfish is given by 7 x i t 1 x i t rand 0 1 x β x rand 0 1 μ 3 1 jellyfish swarm movement of jellyfish in swarm is classified as either passive type a or active type b passive movement type a in the swarm initially occurs and can be expressed by 8 x i t 1 x i t γ rand 0 1 u b l b where u b and l b are the upper and lower bounds of search spaces respectively γ is a motion coefficient which is experimentally evaluated equal to unity over time type a motion switches into type b active motion where the direction of motion and the updated location of jellyfish which is considered as an effective exploitation of the local search space and can be expressed as 9 direction x j t x i t if f x i f x j x i t x j t if f x i f x j where f is an objective function of location x i 10 hence x i t 1 x i t step where step rand 0 1 direction 3 2 time control mechanism time control is the mechanism which switch between movement toward an ocean current exploration and movement within a jellyfish swarm exploitation the time mechanism is expressed by 11 c t 1 t max iter 2 rand 0 1 1 if c t 0 5 jellyfish follows ocean current else moves inside a swarm also if rand 0 1 1 c t jellyfish exhibit type a motion passive motion else exhibits type b motion active motion fig 2 summarizes the procedure of the jellyfish optimizer 4 model verification the simulation model integrated with the jellyfish search optimization algorithm is verified through application to the well known benchmark problem of the unconfined coastal aquifer which is considered as the main source of water supply for miami beach city in the northeast of spain benhachmi et al 2003 the aquifer is modeled with a hydraulic conductivity k 14 m day uniform discharge q u 1 2 m3 day unit width of the aquifer length along shoreline y d 5000 m depth of impervious bed from msl d 30 m depth perpendicular to shoreline 4500 m el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 the location of the aquifer wells is shown in fig 3 while table 1 shows the wells coordinates their allowable maximum and minimum pumping rates and their corresponding ground level several trial runs were performed for the different parameters of both pso and js executed in matlab 2019a to provide the optimal solutions for the model verification and the case study are shown in table 2 4 1 scenario 1 maximization of the economic benefit the management strategy for miami beach unconfined aquifer is settled to maximize the economic benefit from the pumped water and to minimize the corresponding lifting cost several trial runs were carried out corresponding to each optimization model as shown in table 3 the proposed jellyfish optimization algorithm js obtained an optimal solution for the net benefit scenario 1 of 24 93 d which is equivalent to that reached by both pso and sfla but outperformed the optimal solutions of both ga models 2004 and 2005 and pgsl 2019 the pumping rates corresponding to the maximum benefit for js pso and sfla which provided the optimal benefit were estimated at 3863 17 3859 1 and 3849 4 m3 d which represent about 64 38 64 31 and 64 15 of the total available aquifers capacity 4 2 scenario 2 maximization of the total pumping rate in this scenario the unconfined aquifer under miami beach is optimized for the objective of maximizing the total pumping rates of freshwater without saltwater intrusion eq 2 as shown in table 4 the optimal solution of total pumping rates in m3 d obtained by the different optimization algorithms considered in this study were estimated as 5544 62 js 5501 8 pso 5310 2 pgsl 5427 8 sfla 5116 1 ga 2005 and 5460 7 ga 2004 the results show the ability of the proposed js optimization model to provide the best optimal solution for scenario 2 compared to that obtained by the other optimization models under consideration it has to be noticed that the solution by abdel gawad and shamaa 2004 5 wells were intruded with saltwater 5 model performance the first step of the jellyfish optimization algorithm to reach the optimal solution in the huge search space is determined by the time control function eq 11 fig 4 illustrates the switch from moving towards the ocean current exploration phase co 0 5 to move inside the swarm co 0 5 where the jellyfish identifies the areas of best location inside the swarm to find the best solution convergence fig 5 shows the evolution curves of the jellyfish optimizer towards the optimal solution for both scenarios where rapid convergence is noticed 5 1 efficiency rate metric for the purpose of quantitative measures to assess the performance of the jellyfish optimization algorithm the efficiency rate metric first introduced by mora melia et al 2015 and later applied by el ghandour and el beltagi 2018 for pipe network optimization is proposed in this study the efficiency rate is a mathematical tool that relates the quality of the solution obtained to the computational effort that each evolutionary algorithm requires to find the final optimal solution and is expressed by 12 efficiency rate success rate η convergence the success rate is defined as the ratio between the number of trials each model succeeds to catch a value for the objective function greater than the maximum corresponding value recorded in literature to the total number of trials and η convergence is the ratio between number of objective function evaluations f e n to reach the optimum solution and total solution space which is set in this study at very large number 1012 for continuous decision variables as reported in el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 the maximum benefit and maximum pumping rate for miami aquifer were 24 93 d and 5427 8 m3 d respectively table 5 summarizes the values of the efficiency rate metric and the statistical measures adopted in this study to evaluate the performance of the jellyfish algorithm in comparison with pso sfla and pgsl for miami beach coastal aquifer fig 6 shows that the proposed js optimizer had the highest efficiency rates for both scenarios followed by pso from this table it is concluded that the jellyfish optimization model has the highest success rate of 100 for both scenarios compared to 90 0 00 and 70 10 for sfla and pgsl respectively this means that the jellyfish model is able to catch an optimal solution for the economic benefit and maximum pumping rate greater than the corresponding maximum values recorded in the literature for all the carried trial runs also the highest minimum and maximum values of the objective function of 24 79 and 5451 71 and 24 93 and 5544 17 were obtained for jellyfish compared to sfla and pgsl this means better ability for js over sfla and pgsl to reach the optimal solution within a relatively small range in the very large solution space it is also shown from the table that the smallest values of standard deviation of 0 03 and 27 93 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively were found for js although the js model has the same optimal solution of 24 93 as sfla its performance is better in terms of success rate minimum maximum standard deviation and efficiency rate 6 application of the developed model the optimization model js is applied to the case study of the quaternary aquifer in north sinai extending from el arish to rafah with the wells locations as shown in fig 7 as a case study the aquifer has a total length along and perpendicular to the shore line of 43200 m and 8150 m respectively and with an equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 33 m d and 40 m depth of impervious bed below the sea level el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 in the simulation optimization process applied to the aquifer the following assumptions are considered el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 1 vertical homogeneity is assumed by merging the three layers of the aquifer to constitute a single equivalent layer with an equivalent thickness and hydraulic conductivity 2 rainfall is the primary source of groundwater recharge with a maximum value of 3 10 3 m d in the north east and 1 2 10 7 m d in the southern boundary 3 the maximum and minimum allowable pumping rates for the wells are 10 000 m3 d and 120 m3 d respectively the x y coordinates of the aquifer 31 wells are shown in table 6 the aquifer is optimized according to scenario 2 for the objective of maximizing the total pumping rate from the pre existed system of wells the optimization results are shown in table 7 an optimal pumping rate of 55 619 43 m3 d is obtained using the jellyfish optimization model compared to 54 247 61 46 387 72 and 42 861 5 m3 d by pso pgsl and sfla respectively the table also showed that using the jellyfish optimization algorithm the total pumping is obtained from 26 wells out of the 31 wells corresponding to 21 19 and 9 working wells for pso pgsl and sfla respectively this may prevent the groundwater heads to fall below sea water and hence induce flow of denser seawater into the aquifer application of the proposed model to el arish rafah coastal aquifer outperformed pso pgsl and sfla optimization algorithms for optimal management of coastal aquifers with saltwater intrusion 7 conclusions in this paper a simulation optimization model is presented to assess different management scenarios for unconfined coastal aquifers with the constraint of saltwater intrusion a new meta heuristic optimization algorithm called jellyfish search js and particle swarm optimization pso are integrated with the numerical simulation model to search for the optimal solution of the different management strategies the main objective is to maximize the total benefit in one scenario and pumping rate in another scenario the model is verified through application to the unconfined aquifer beneath miami beach for both scenarios and to the case study of the quaternary aquifer of el arish rafah egypt to obtain the maximum pumping rate the results were then compared with those previously obtained by genetic algorithm ga probabilistic global search optimization algorithm lausanne pgsl and shuffled frog leaping optimization algorithm sfla the model performance in comparison with the other optimization algorithms is assessed using the efficiency rate metric and the statistical indices mean and standard deviation the optimal results of the js algorithm for the first scenario of miami beach is equivalent to that by pso and sfla but outperformed the other ga and pgsl algorithms furthermore the js reached the best optimal pumping rate for both aquifers based on the efficiency rate metric the model performance was assessed and found to be superior to all other algorithms considered in this study the proposed model proved to be an

application to the aquifer system underlain the city of miami beach at north of spain and the case study of the quaternary aquifer of el arish rafah egypt 2 optimization of pumping rates from coastal aquifers the management scenarios for controlling seawater intrusion are settled to either maximize the economic benefit from the pumped fresh water or maximize the total pumping rate from the wells benhashmi 2003 mathematically expressed the two objectives as maximizing the total benefit from pumped water 1 max z 1 i 1 n w q i b c l i h i maximizing total pumping rate from wells 2 max z 2 i 1 n

assumptions el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 first a sharp interface exists between the saltwater zone and the freshwater zone rather than a transition zone fig 1 second the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and steady state conditions are considered third the dupuit assumption is used to obtain two dimensional equations by averaging the flow equation in vertical direction fourth the interface location is deduced from the ghyben herzberg assumption finally a single potential theory approach strack 1976 is adopted to make use of a single governing potential equation across the two zones of the coastal aquifer strack 1976 transformed the nonlinear eqs 3a and 3b into linear form without any approximation by replacing the dependent variable h with potential φ accordingly eqs 3a and 3b for

decomposition method used to decrease the runtime of the optimization model can be found in el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 3 jellyfish search algorithm js the artificial jellyfish search optimization algorithm chou and truong 2020 is a new metaheuristic optimization technique which is inspired by the behavior of jellyfish in the ocean the algorithm balances between both the initial exploration of the search space followed by the exploitation to find the promising areas in the search space global optimum a time control function governs the switch between the two phases the controlling parameters of the algorithm are the population size and the number of iterations the algorithm can be summarized as follow 1 jellyfish follow either ocean current or move inside the swarm the ocean current is given by 5 trend 1 n pop trend i x e c μ x df 6 trend x β rand 0 1 μ where n pop is the number of jellyfish and x is the jellyfish currently with the best location in the swarm best location means best solution for the objective function e c is the factor governing the attraction μ is the mean location of all jellyfish and df is the difference between the current best location of the jellyfish the mean location of all jellyfish and β 0 is a distribution coefficient the new location of each jellyfish is given by 7 x i t 1 x i t rand 0 1 x β x rand 0 1 μ 3 1 jellyfish swarm movement of jellyfish in swarm is classified as either passive type a or active type b passive movement type a in the swarm initially occurs and can be expressed by 8 x i t 1 x i t γ rand 0 1 u b l b where u b and l b are the upper and lower bounds of search spaces respectively γ is a motion coefficient which is experimentally evaluated equal to unity over time type a motion switches into type b active motion where the direction of motion and the updated location of jellyfish which is considered as an effective exploitation of the local search space and can be expressed as 9 direction x j t x

mechanism which switch between movement toward an ocean current exploration and movement within a jellyfish swarm exploitation the time mechanism is expressed by 11 c t 1 t max iter 2 rand 0 1 1 if c t 0 5 jellyfish follows ocean current else moves inside a swarm also if rand 0 1 1 c t jellyfish exhibit type a motion passive motion else exhibits type b motion active motion fig 2 summarizes the procedure of the jellyfish optimizer 4 model verification the simulation model integrated with the jellyfish search optimization algorithm is verified through application to the well known benchmark problem of the unconfined coastal aquifer which is considered as the main source of water supply for miami beach city in the northeast of spain benhachmi et al 2003 the aquifer is modeled with a hydraulic conductivity k 14 m day uniform discharge q u 1 2 m3 day unit width of the aquifer length along shoreline y d 5000 m depth of impervious bed from msl d 30 m depth perpendicular to shoreline 4500 m el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 the location of the aquifer wells is shown in fig 3 while table 1 shows the wells coordinates their allowable maximum and minimum pumping rates and their corresponding ground level several trial runs were performed for the different parameters of both pso and js executed in matlab 2019a to provide the optimal solutions for the model verification and the case study are shown in table 2 4 1 scenario 1 maximization of the economic benefit the management strategy for miami beach unconfined aquifer is settled to maximize the economic benefit from the pumped water and to minimize the corresponding lifting cost several trial runs were carried out corresponding to each optimization model as shown in table 3 the proposed jellyfish optimization algorithm js obtained an optimal solution for the net benefit scenario 1 of 24 93 d which is equivalent to that reached by both pso and sfla but outperformed the optimal solutions of both ga models 2004 and 2005 and pgsl 2019 the pumping rates corresponding to the maximum benefit for js pso and sfla which provided the optimal benefit were estimated at 3863 17 3859 1 and 3849 4 m3 d which represent about 64 38 64 31 and 64 15 of the total available aquifers capacity 4 2 scenario 2 maximization of the total pumping rate in this scenario the unconfined aquifer under miami beach is optimized for the objective of maximizing the total pumping rates of freshwater without saltwater intrusion eq 2 as shown in table 4 the optimal solution of total pumping rates in m3 d obtained by the different optimization algorithms considered in this study were estimated as 5544 62 js 5501 8 pso 5310 2 pgsl 5427 8 sfla 5116 1 ga 2005 and 5460 7 ga 2004 the results show the ability of the proposed js optimization model to provide the best optimal solution for scenario 2 compared to that obtained by the other optimization models under consideration it has to be noticed that the solution by abdel gawad and shamaa 2004 5 wells were intruded with saltwater 5 model performance the first step of the jellyfish optimization algorithm to reach the optimal solution in the huge search space is determined by the time control function eq 11 fig 4 illustrates the switch from moving towards the ocean current exploration phase co 0 5 to move inside the swarm co 0 5 where the jellyfish identifies the areas of best location inside the swarm to find the best solution convergence fig 5 shows the evolution curves of the jellyfish optimizer towards the optimal solution for both scenarios where rapid convergence is noticed 5 1 efficiency rate metric for the purpose of quantitative measures to assess the performance of the jellyfish optimization algorithm the efficiency rate metric first introduced by mora melia et al 2015 and later applied by el ghandour and el beltagi 2018 for pipe network optimization is proposed in this study the efficiency rate is a mathematical tool that relates the quality of the solution obtained to the computational effort that each evolutionary algorithm requires to find the final optimal solution and is expressed by 12 efficiency rate success rate η convergence the success rate is defined as the ratio between the number of trials each model succeeds to catch a value for the objective function greater than the maximum corresponding value recorded in literature to the total number of trials and η convergence is the ratio between number of objective function evaluations f e n to reach the optimum solution and total solution space which is set in this study at very large number 1012 for continuous decision variables as reported in el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 the maximum benefit and maximum pumping rate for miami aquifer were 24 93 d and 5427 8 m3 d respectively table 5 summarizes the values of the efficiency rate metric and the statistical measures adopted in this study to evaluate the performance of the jellyfish algorithm in comparison with pso sfla and pgsl for miami beach coastal aquifer fig 6 shows that the proposed js optimizer had the highest efficiency rates for both scenarios followed by pso from this table it is concluded that the jellyfish optimization model has the highest success rate of 100 for both scenarios compared to 90 0 00 and 70 10 for sfla and pgsl respectively this means that the jellyfish model is able to catch an optimal solution for the economic benefit and maximum pumping rate greater than the corresponding maximum values recorded in the literature for all the carried trial runs also the highest minimum and maximum values of the objective function of 24 79 and 5451 71 and 24 93 and 5544 17 were obtained for jellyfish compared to sfla and pgsl this means better ability for js over sfla and pgsl to reach the optimal solution within a relatively small range in the very large solution space it is also shown from the table that the smallest values of standard deviation of 0 03 and 27 93 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively were found for js although the js model has the same optimal solution of 24 93 as sfla its performance is better in terms of success rate minimum maximum standard deviation and efficiency rate 6 application of the developed model the optimization model js is applied to the case study of the quaternary aquifer in north sinai extending from el arish to rafah with the wells locations as shown in fig 7 as a case study the aquifer has a total length along and perpendicular to the shore line of 43200 m and 8150 m respectively and with an equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 33 m d and 40 m depth of impervious bed below the sea level el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 in the simulation optimization process applied to the aquifer the following assumptions are considered el ghandour and el beltagi 2019 1 vertical homogeneity is assumed by merging the three layers of the aquifer to constitute a single equivalent layer with an equivalent thickness and hydraulic conductivity 2 rainfall is the primary source of groundwater recharge with a maximum value of 3 10 3 m d in the north east and 1 2 10 7 m d in the southern boundary 3 the maximum and minimum allowable pumping rates for the wells are 10 000 m3 d and 120 m3 d respectively the x y coordinates of the aquifer 31 wells are shown in table 6 the aquifer is optimized according to scenario 2 for the objective of maximizing the total pumping rate from the pre existed system of wells the optimization results are shown in table 7 an optimal pumping rate of 55 619 43 m3 d is obtained using the jellyfish optimization model compared to 54 247 61 46 387 72 and 42 861 5 m3 d by pso pgsl and sfla respectively the table also showed that using the jellyfish optimization algorithm the total pumping is obtained from 26 wells out of the 31 wells corresponding to 21 19 and 9 working wells for pso pgsl and sfla respectively this may prevent the groundwater heads to fall below sea water and hence induce flow of denser seawater into the aquifer application of the proposed model to el arish rafah coastal aquifer outperformed pso pgsl and sfla optimization algorithms for optimal management of coastal aquifers with saltwater intrusion 7 conclusions in this paper a simulation optimization model is presented to assess different management scenarios for unconfined coastal aquifers with the constraint of saltwater intrusion a new meta heuristic optimization algorithm called jellyfish search js and particle swarm optimization pso are integrated with the numerical simulation model to search for the optimal solution of the different management strategies the main objective is to maximize the total benefit in one scenario and pumping rate in another scenario the model is verified through application to the unconfined aquifer beneath miami beach for both scenarios and to the case study of the quaternary aquifer of el arish rafah egypt to obtain the maximum pumping rate the results were then compared with those previously obtained by genetic algorithm ga probabilistic global search optimization algorithm lausanne pgsl and shuffled frog leaping optimization algorithm sfla the model performance in comparison with the other optimization algorithms is assessed using the efficiency rate metric and the statistical indices mean and standard deviation the optimal results of the js algorithm for the first scenario of miami beach is equivalent to that by pso and sfla but outperformed the other ga and pgsl algorithms furthermore the js reached the best optimal pumping rate for both aquifers based on the efficiency rate metric the model performance was assessed and found to be superior to all other algorithms considered in this study the proposed model proved to be an effective and efficient tool for real groundwater management problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

century were investigated and the flow regime was characterized by using 27 indicators of hydrological alteration climate projections for the future 2030 2059 were used to predict potential cc impact on the flow regime the soil and water assessment tool swat model was run to simulate hydrology for the current and future scenarios new hydrological insights for the region a significant increase in temperature and a reduction in the number of days with temperatures below 0 c was recorded from 1958 to 2012 for the future climate model projections predicted an increase in the daily temperature and a decrease in rainfall 4 9 as compared with the baseline 1980 2009 as a result the model predicted reductions in the mean annual flow by up to 21 and 39 compared to the baseline and the historical period 1965 1996 respectively it also predicted a reduction in the maximum annual flow recorded over 90 consecutive days up to 18 and an extension of the no flowing phase by up to 12 days graphical

in small or medium basins with intermittent streams in order to investigate the relationship between climate and flow regime over the last century the main reason for the lack of long term analysis is the scarce availability of climatic and hydrological data or the high rate of missing data in the time series i e daily rainfall and temperature daily streamflow which is a common characteristic of intermittent river systems indeed intermittent rivers in the past were underrepresented in the monitoring networks and were often ungauged in the mediterranean region skoulikidis et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020 this study is a continuation of a previous study de girolamo et al 2017a carried out in the candelaro river basin apulia italy 2200 km2 that analyzed the impact of cc on water balance at the basin scale and the future alterations in flow regime in a few well preserved river reaches the previous study pointed out a future reduction of 7 18 in water resources availability at the basin scale with intermittent and ephemeral reaches showing more exacerbated alterations of the hydrological regime than perennial reaches hence a more detailed study at the sub basin scale was needed for supporting the water framework directive ec 2000 implementation since the reference conditions have to be redefined if a water body shifts from perennial to intermittent in addition the authors highlighted that further analyses of climate trends and associated streamflow alterations were needed at the outlet of this watershed in order to establish an appropriate environmental flow eflow that considers potential shifts from perennial to intermittent flow regimes ec 2015 arthington 2012 the overall objective of the present work was to analyze the impact of long term cc on the flow regime of the celone river apulia region italy the main tributary of the candelaro river the specific objectives were to i identify trends in rainfall and temperature over the past decades 1935 2012 ii analyze changes that occurred in the flow regime from 1954 to 1996 and iii analyze potential impacts of cc on the flow regime for the period 2030 2059 by using climate projections which are a combination of a global circulation model echam5 and three regional circulation models the study can help to identify the changes that occurred in the past century and to provide information that can be used for planning and managing future water resources in the celone basin and other similar basins 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the celone river basin located in the south of italy apulia region fig 1 the celone river is a tributary of the candelaro one of the most important rivers of the region overall the drainage area is 317 km2 and the length of the main stream is about 90 km only 4 of the area is urbanized the primary land use is extensive agriculture in the upper part of the basin and intensive agriculture in the lowlands the basin is characterized by a mean elevation of about 300 m a s l ranging from 0 to 1100 m a s l the average annual precipitation recorded in the basin during 1990 2009 was 625 mm annual rainfall varies with elevation from 840 mm in the mountainous area to 465 mm in the lowland rainfall is mostly concentrated during november may generally it is not uniformly distributed in the basin during june september rainfall is concentrated in a few extremely localized events that give rise to flash floods with a rapid increase in flow and a short lag time the mean annual temperature 1990 2009 recorded was 12 3 c and 16 1 c in mountain and lowland respectively in winter mainly in january and february snow falls on the upper part of the basin but no data are available due to lack of snow monitoring sites the geological structural setting of the area is characterized by two tectonic units unità della fossa bradanica e unità della daunia major bedrock lithological units that are flyschoid formations flysch della daunia green blue clays in the upper celone basin and alluvial deposits in the lowlands the prevalent soil textures are sandy clay loam 36 sandy clay 1 and clay 63 the river morphology is well preserved in the upper and middle course where incised channel and meandering along with braided branches are prevalent respectively generally during the dry season july november streamflow is very low or absent and some river segments of the first order and the reaches of the main course located in the alluvial plains run dry with at most isolated pools the streamflow regime ensues climatic seasonality with a pattern of a dry period characterized by flash flood events and wet season the river is classified intermittent by the river basin authority the hydrological pressures in the basin are point source discharges from wastewater treatment plants about 2500 equivalent inhabitants in the upper part of the basin water abstraction from the river and groundwater for agricultural water use in the lowland and a reservoir in the middle course the capaccio reservoir 41 25 30 n 15 25 25 e was built in 2000 for irrigation purposes collecting 25 82 million m3 at full capacity the celone stream is the main inflow into the reservoir 2 2 methodology the methodology fig 2 which is described in the following paragraphs comprised two steps 1 analysis of the climate and flow regime over the past decades and 2 analysis of the climate and flow regime for the baseline and future the first step 1 included the trend and change point detection in the time series of annual rainfall and annual temperature mean and minimum recorded over the past decades as well as flow regime alterations assessment using the indicators of hydrological alterations ihas computed with daily streamflow recorded in the past decades the analysis of trends in climate was carried out at two gauging stations located in the mountainous faeto gauge 866 m a s l and lowland area foggia istituto agronomico gauge 76 m a s l the coldest and hottest points of the study area respectively annual precipitation data were available for 1935 2012 at the faeto gauge and for 1949 2012 at the foggia istituto agronomico gauge the annual and monthly temperature minimum and mean data were available for the period 1958 2012 at the faeto gauge and 1949 2012 at the foggia istituto agronomico gauge missing data in the climatic time series were reconstructed as described in the following paragraphs before analyzing the trends the daily streamflow recorded from 1954 to 1995 at the gauging station celone ponte foggia 41 31 34 n 15 32 42 e downstream of the reservoir fig 1 and from 1965 to 1996 at the gauge celone san vincenzo 41 25 25 n 15 24 31 e upstream of the reservoir fig 2 with 14 and 15 6 of missing data respectively were used for assessing flow regime alterations in the second step 2 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold and fohrer 2005 was used to simulate the streamflow at daily time step the model was calibrated and validated 1990 1996 thereafter it was run for simulating streamflow for the baseline 1980 2009 and for the near future 2030 2059 by using the downscaled daily rainfall and temperature of three different climate projections as described in the following paragraph finally the flow regime alterations were assessed by comparing the ihas computed for the future projections with the corresponding ihas relative to the baseline 2 3 climate data projections the climate projections used in the present study were derived from the eu fp6 ensembles project kjellström et al 2013 van der linden and mitchell 2009 funded by the european commission ec the selected scenarios were based on the a1b emission scenario which forecasts an increase in population and economic growth until the mid 21st century and a decrease thereafter consequent to the adoption of more efficient technologies ipcc 2010 the projections are combinations of data derived from the echam5 model a global circulation model gcm with three regional circulation models rcms racmo2 rca3 0 remo developed by the royal netherlands meteorological institute knmi knmi racmo echam5 the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi smhi rca echam5 and the max planck institute mpi mpi remo echam5 respectively called hereafter knmi smhi mpi the climate projections of daily precipitations and minimum and maximum daily temperatures 25 km resolution were extracted as a grid covering the study area for two periods 1980 2009 and 2030 2059 the first period was used as a baseline to assess climate changes it was representative of the recent climate in the study area covering a wide range of climatic conditions severe droughts and cool seasons the downscaling was performed in accordance with the method reported by de girolamo et al 2017a based on the climatic stations present in the basin at the monthly time scale a simple ratio method was used for rainfall where for the ith month the average observed data from 1990 to 2000 was divided by the average gcm rcms data during the same period thereby obtaining the i monthly factor fi and then future daily gcm rcms data 2030 2059 was multiplied by the corresponding monthly factor fi to obtain downscaled future daily precipitation data abbaspour et al 2009 the future daily temperature data were downscaled by applying a nonlinear model fourth order polynomial regression equation to the future gcm rcms data the validation was carried out for the decade 2001 2010 de girolamo et al 2017a the model fitted the observations well r2 0 99 2 4 data reconstruction and trends in climatic time series over the past decades before assessing the trend in time series a check for missing data was carried out followed by data reconstruction in the study area the time series of annual precipitation and annual temperature mean and minimum were affected by missing data missing data is a hindrance to any reliable statistical analysis to address this issue and to reconstruct the time series the following multi step methodology was applied analysis of the missing data structure search for neighboring monitoring sites with respect to the site of interest to carry out the first reduction of missing data rate by means of a multiple regression analysis analysis of the mechanism of missingness lo presti et al 2008 application of one or more reconstruction methods and comparison for selecting the most reliable method three different data reconstruction approaches were applied and their respective results were compared for selecting the best suited approach for imputing the missing data the three approaches were i em multivariate expectation maximization algorithm for multivariate gaussian data ii mice multiple imputation chained equations based on the predictive mean matching method rubin 1986 and iii em cubist expectation maximization algorithm based on the cubist method feng et al 2020 van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 schafer 1997 the comparison of the three approaches was performed by means of two different methods in the first the main statistics of the original dataset mean and standard deviation were compared with the corresponding statistics of the three reconstructed datasets looking for the approach that modified the statistical parameters to a lesser extent the second approach considered the overall comparison between the original incomplete dataset and the rebuilt dataset in practice the density functions pdf of the incomplete and reconstructed datasets were computed and overlapped afterward the degree of overlapping of the pdfs was computed the approach that provided the best results was selected all the computations were performed in the r environment using the packages imputer mice and norm feng et al 2020 van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 schafer 1997 the trend analysis was carried out by means of the classical mann kendall test for the reconstructed datasets when the above reported methodology could not be applied and the conditions did not allow any reliable data reconstruction a linear regression model was applied to explore temporal trends in precipitation and temperature over the historical datasets then the f test was applied to assess whether the linear regression model was significant with respect to the considered dataset 2 4 1 trend in precipitation time series the time series of annual precipitation mm recorded at the faeto site which consisted of 94 records were affected by about 29 of missing data supplementary material s1 to fill the gaps the neighborhood gauging stations biccari orsara and troia located 8 13 km from faeto were used the pearson correlation between the rainfall data recorded at faeto and those recorded at biccari orsara and troia ranged from 0 5 to 0 71 confirming that those sites provided a good contribution for faeto data reconstruction by means of multiple regression the rate of missing data of biccari and orsara was below 5 and of troia was around 13 unfortunately since the supporting time series of faeto were themselves incomplete it was not possible to make a reliable analysis of the data missingness mechanisms therefore it was assumed that the mechanism was mar missing at random lo presti et al 2008 this assumption was not always practical but since the rate of missing data of biccari and orsara was almost negligible it was sustainable the precipitation time series at the foggia istituto agronomico site presented a missing data rate of 6 25 supplementary material s1 nevertheless the supporting time series of foggia osservatorio was complete the reported elements made it easy to reconstruct the series with expected results that were realistic and reliable at the same time 2 4 2 trend in temperature time series the time series of annual mean temperature recorded at the faeto gauge presented a missing data rate of about 44 supplementary material s1 the time series of supporting sites of biccari and troia from 1972 and 1989 respectively showed a missing data rate of 41 and 25 respectively the time series of minimum temperature related to january started in 1958 and was comprised 54 records with a missing data rate lesser than 15 unfortunately the neighboring sites time series were shorter therefore they were not used to fix faeto s missing data hence the trend was assessed by estimating by applying a linear regression model as aforementioned the time series of annual mean temperature recorded at the foggia istituto agronomico consisted of 57 records with a rate of missing data of 33 supplementary material s1 due to the high rate of missing data the reconstruction was not possible and the trend was assessed by applying a linear regression model as aforementioned 2 4 3 change point detection in climatic time series change point analysis is generally used for detecting changes that happen along the time series due to human or natural causes lindeløv 2020 in the present study change points were detected for the past decades the result provided the decomposition of the period covered by the time series into subsets each characterized by a stable behavior in this way the alternation among upward constant and downward oriented trends of the variable of interest were identified the change point was geometrically denoted as the first observation of a new segment in the piece wise polygonal that approximated the variable s behavior the type of change point searched in the present study was change in mean two approaches were used for assessing the change points over the period of interest bayesian and binary segmentation these approaches were implemented in r by libraries changepoint and mcp haynes et al 2014 lindeløv 2020 2 5 hydrological regime alterations the flow regime of the celone river at the san vincenzo and ponte foggia sites was characterized over the past decades 1965 1996 and 1954 1995 respectively for the baseline 1980 2009 and for the near future 2030 2059 by using 27 ihas richter et al 1996 oueslati et al 2015 d ambrosio et al 2017 as reported in the literature poff et al 1997 the ihas can describe all the components of the flow regime that have an ecological relevance magnitude it is the amount of water moving per unit time m3s 1 at any given time interval frequency it refers to how often a flow of a given magnitude recurs over a time interval duration it is the period of time associated with a specific flow condition day rate of change it refers to how quickly flow changes from one magnitude to another timing it is the date of flows of a defined magnitude julian date in this work for each year of the time series past baseline and future the following ihas were analyzed table 1 magnitude of the annual water conditions magnitude and timing of monthly water condition magnitude and duration of annual maximum and minimum water conditions recorded over consecutive days 1 3 7 30 90 day and magnitude of base flow the magnitude of baseflow was estimated as the ratio of minimum streamflow recorded over seven consecutive days and the mean annual flow the nature conservancy 2009 richter et al 1996 similarly the duration of the zero days the number of days with no flow and the timing of maximum and minimum flow were determined table 1 the ihas software developed by the us nature conservancy richter et al 1996 the nature conservancy 2009 was used to calculate the ihas based on the daily streamflow data non parametric analysis i e median and percentiles where no assumption was made about the distribution of data was performed to estimate representative annual values richter et al 1997 the degree of hydrological alteration was estimated for each iha as the ratio of the median value calculated for the future f to the median value for the baseline period b the hydrological alteration was classified as severe depletion if the ratio f b 0 1 high depletion if 0 1 f b 0 3 moderate depletion if 0 3 f b 1 moderate inflation if 1 f b 2 high inflation if 2 f b 3 and severe inflation if f b 3 zimmerman et al 2018 for each iha the range of variability approach rva richter et al 1996 was used to identify whether changes between the baseline and future time series were equally distributed or occurred more frequently either at the lower or higher limits of the distribution range to do this the entire range of variability of each indicator for the baseline was divided into three classes based on the percentiles values 33rd percentile values included in the range 34th 67th percentiles values 67th percentile for each class the hydrological alteration value was computed as follows future frequency baseline frequency baseline frequency a positive hydrological alteration value means that the frequency of values in the class has increased from the baseline to the future whereas a negative value means that the frequency of values has decreased at the celone ponte foggia gauge the hydrological alteration analysis was not conducted because the flow regime has experienced heavy alterations since the construction of the reservoir in 2000 de girolamo et al 2017b a linear regression model was applied to explore whether ihas were varying over time for the period of data available in addition the pearson correlation was computed to explore whether winter temperature and the presence of snow was associated with the subsequent dry phase in the flow regime to do so the number of days per year with temperature below zero was correlated with the date of min which represents the start of the dry phase and then with the zero days which represents the duration of the dry phase 2 6 modeling streamflow the swat2005 model version with arcgis interface arnold and fohrer 2005 neitsch et al 2001 was implemented to simulate streamflow for the baseline and future climate projections swat is a semi distributed model developed to assess the effects of anthropogenic pressures on water quality arnold et at 1998 d ambrosio et al 2020a malagó et al 2019 pulighe et al 2019 and the cc impact on water resources and flow regime e g brouziyne et al 2021a didovets et al 2021 piniewski et al 2018 the model is also widely used to predict the impact of best management practices on water bodies and soils in agricultural basins d ambrosio et al 2020b de girolamo and lo porto 2020 ricci et al 2020 the swat model set up requires daily climatic data at least rainfall and minimum and maximum temperature soil data texture and hydraulic parameters land use and management practices it works by dividing the basin into sub basins that are further divided into hydrological response units hrus which consist of homogeneous land use management and soil characteristics for each hru the evapotranspiration and runoff are computed in order to develop the water balance neitsch et al 2001 in the present study the current conditions climate and land use and management operations were simulated at daily time steps from 1990 to 2009 based on recorded data as reported in table ai annex a the time series of daily precipitation and daily temperature minimum and maximum were available at three gauging stations fig 1 the scs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 was adopted to calculate surface runoff and the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 was selected for estimating the potential evapotranspiration pet the sensitivity analysis sa with the lh oat approach developed by van griensven et al 2002 was performed before calibrating the model in order to assess the most sensitive parameters that influence hydrological processes among the most sensitive parameters were the following the initial scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 the depth from the soil surface to the bottom of the layer sol z mm the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn mm the available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc mmh2o mmsoil the soil evaporation compensation factor esco and the surface runoff lag time surlag days at the gauging station celone san vincenzo the swat cup abbaspour et al 2015 was used to refine calibrated parameters and to carry out the uncertainty analysis by using the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 procedure at ponte foggia gauge a manual calibration was performed this approach was preferred since the most sensitive parameters were known the model was calibrated and validated at celone s vincenzo over the periods 1990 1992 and 1995 1996 respectively and at celone ponte foggia over the periods 1990 1991 and 1994 respectively for a detailed description of the input data model setup calibration and validation procedures refer to de girolamo et al 2017a 2017b the initial range of the most sensitive parameters and their calibrated values are reported in table 2 after model calibration and validation three different simulations were performed by using downscaled climatic data from the above mentioned model projections knmi mpi smhi respectively to predict streamflow for baseline 1980 2009 and for future decades 2030 2059 the current land uses and management practices were considered to remain the same for the future scenarios we acknowledge that this assumption becomes a limitation of the present study and in general of the research works concerning cc impacts on water and agriculture since new land use systems that are more resilient to cc could be adopted the irrigation was set based on farmers interviews for the baseline and an increase in irrigation equal to the increase in pet 4 was computed for future scenarios at yearly time steps the performance of the swat model in simulating daily streamflow in the celone river basin for the current conditions was evaluated by using the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 positive pbias indicates model underestimation bias and a negative value indicate an overestimation of streamflow in their review moriasi et al 2012 defined the model performance for streamflow simulated on a monthly time step as satisfactory if nse and r2 0 5 pbias 25 arnold et al 2012 suggested that those ratings should be adjusted to be more or less strict based on project considerations and time step simulation i e yearly or daily respectively in the present paper considering the daily time step it was assumed as satisfactory if r2 0 5 nse 0 45 and pbias 0 27 de girolamo et al 2017b 3 results 3 1 trends in rainfall over the past decades the density distribution of original and reconstructed total annual rainfall data differed slightly among the three approaches used both for the faeto fig 3a and foggia istituto agronomico site fig 3b at the faeto site the em multivariate approach performed better 96 of overlapping than mice and em cubist for which the overlap between original and reconstructed data was 87 and 92 respectively at the foggia istituto agronomico site the em cubist approach outperformed the others 97 of overlapping fig 3b none of the reconstructed time series show serial autocorrelation the change points detected for the time series of the annual rainfall were the following 1936 1946 1968 and 1980 these values should be considered affected by a degree of uncertainty two subsets of particular interest or segments were individuated and analyzed for 1935 1979 and 1980 2012 at the faeto site the trend analysis stated that the segments are both characterized by a significant trend the first is downward fig 4a mann kendall test p value 0 042 and the second is upward fig 4b mann kendall test p value 0 022 the analysis of the whole faeto annual rainfall time series did not exhibit a significant trend at the foggia istituto agonomico the whole annual rainfall time series did not exhibit any significant trend the trend over the period 1949 1979 was not significant mann kendall test p value 0 21 fig 4c meanwhile over the period 1980 2012 a significant upward trend was predicted mann kendall test p value 0 005 fig 4d 3 2 trends in temperature over the past decades at the faeto site results showed a significant increase over time in annual mean temperature f test p value 4 88e 06 and minimum temperature f test p value 5 299e 05 the minimum temperature recorded in january at the faeto gauging station showed an upward significant tendency fig 5a f test p value 0 004 meanwhile the minimum temperature recorded in february did not show a significant trend the analysis also showed that the number of sub zero days at the faeto site significantly decreased over time f test p value 0 00099 fig 5b with a rate of 12 days per decade y 2400 7918 1 1956 x consequently we can infer that a shift of snowfall to rainfall was occurred when air temperatures were around zero at the foggia istituto agronomico site the trend in mean annual temperature was not significant over 1949 2010 r2 0 09 p value 0 081 notably this result is affected by a large uncertainty due to the significant amount of missing data of 33 3 3 future temperature and rainfall climate projections showed a general increase in temperature both for the daily minimum and maximum values as compared with the baseline values recorded at the gauging stations biccari troia and foggia 1980 2009 on a monthly basis the maximum daily temperature varied between 0 6 and 2 4 c in the analyzed gcm rcms a major increase in maximum temperature was predicted in summer july september fig 6 the increase in minimum temperature varied in the range 0 3 2 1 c with the highest divergence from the baseline in winter december february on a yearly basis the minimum daily temperature increased from 0 95 c knmi to 1 14 c mpi and the maximum daily temperature increased from 1 29 c knmi to 1 43 c mpi on a yearly basis for 2030 2059 all the models predicted a decrease in rainfall varying from 4 to 9 as compared with the baseline and a different distribution through the year with an important decrease from january to april and an increase in october and december fig 7 3 4 alteration of the hydrological regime over the past decades the celone river at the ponte foggia site showed clear changes in the flow regime over 1954 1995 shifting from perennial towards intermittent conditions the change point detected in the climatic time series 1968 was found also in the streamflow components the time series of zero days showed a significant trend f test p value 0 0001 with an upward orientation fig 8h an increase of 190 in the number of zero days was detected over 1969 1995 as compared with the previous 1954 1968 meanwhile the dry period started earlier by 18 days a significant trend f test p value 0 02 supplementary material s2 with a downward orientation was also detected in the mean annual streamflow monthly streamflow from september to february except november 1 30 90 days max 30 90 day min and baseflow r2 is reported in fig 8 for each iha meanwhile the timing of the extremely high flow events did not show a significant trend data not shown reductions in mean annual flow 27 base flow 99 30 day max and 90 day max 23 and 24 respectively were detected over 1969 1995 as compared with 1954 1968 a very high inter annual variability was recorded in the ihas fig 8 supplementary material s2 the flow regime at celone at san vincenzo site showed a shift towards drier conditions over 1965 1996 the number of zero days showed a statistical significant trend r2 0 39 f test p value 0 009 with an upward orientation 1 day max r2 0 22 f test p value 0 009 7 day max r2 0 20 f test p value 0 028 and 30 day max r2 0 20 f test p value 0 041 showed a statistical significant trend with downward orientation during the same period the timing of the extreme low and high flow events as well as the monthly flow baseflow and 1 3 7 30 90 day min did not show a statistically significant trend p value 0 05 a reductions in mean annual streamflow 24 30 day max 22 and 90 day max 24 and an increases in zero days 43 7 were detected after 1980 change point supplementary material s3 the pearson s correlation between the number of days for years with the temperature below zero at the faeto gauge and the date of min was positive and significant r 0 58 p value 0 01 this result clearly indicated that the temperature rise resulted in the early arrival of the dry phase in flow regime at both sites celone san vincenzo and celone ponte foggia the pearson s correlation between the number of days for the year with temperatures below zero at the faeto gauge and the zero days were quantitatively important 0 44 and 0 30 respectively but the correlations were not significant p value 0 1 3 5 modeling current and future flow regime 3 5 1 modeling current flow regime the model performances for streamflow simulations on the daily time scale ranged from satisfactory to good at the celone san vincenzo gauge and celone ponte foggia gauge arnold et al 2012 de girolamo et al 2017b table 3 generally simulated daily streamflow fit well the observed ones as expected the extremely low flow was affected by a large uncertainty green band in fig 9 the model overestimated the extremely low flow since the no flowing condition was of great importance when determining the ihas de girolamo et al 2017b suggested adjusting model output if necessary the authors identified a zero flow threshold which is the value of simulated streamflow that corresponds to no flow actual dry conditions comparing simulated and measured streamflow data during the driest year 1991 at the celone san vincenzo gauge in the present work the zero flow threshold identified by the authors 75 l s 1 at the celone san vincenzo was adopted to correctly predict the ihas related to periods of dryness thus the zero flow threshold was subtracted from the simulated values of streamflow before calculating the ihas with simulated data 3 5 2 modelling future flow regime and hydrological alterations at the celone san vincenzo at the celone san vincenzo site the results clearly indicated flow regime alterations in the near future 2030 2059 the median values of the ihas changed under all the analyzed future climate projections mpi knmi smhi supplementary material s4 s5 s6 the hydrological alteration ranged from 0 5 to 1 moderate depletion and from 1 to 1 4 moderate inflation depending on the iha and on the climate projection table 4 the mean annual flow is expected to decrease in the future by 3 smhi 11 knmi and 21 mpi as compared with the baseline the mean annual flow contraction observed was much larger when compared with the historical data 39 except in early winter the alterations of median monthly streamflow group 2 in table 4 were depletions some differences were detected among the climate projections especially in july and december when the coefficient of variation among model projections was 0 4 and 0 3 respectively the ihas of annual minimum water conditions group 3 in table 4 and base flow did not show alterations since these indicators were zero both for the baseline and for the future scenarios the results showed general depletion for the ihas of annual maximum water conditions group 4 in table 4 with a degree of alteration from 0 7 to 0 9 the alteration observed in the zero days was inflation table 4 that corresponded to an increase in the number of zero days of 15 for the knmi 12 days 5 for the smhi 4 days it was negligible for the mpi the results also showed a degree of hydrological alteration in the timing of the annual maximum flow date of max in table 4 quantified in 0 7 knmi and smhi and 1 4 mpi which was predicted to come earlier in the year 19 days knmi and smhi and later for the mpi 15 days delay the timing of the annual minimum flow date of min in table 4 was altered for the knmi for which it was predicted to come earlier in the year 11 days and negligible for mpi and smhi the results of the rva which detected the changes in frequency for each of the categories defined above high middle and low highlighted the following behavior for the future model predictions as compared with the baseline fig 10 greater occurrence of extremely high values of zero days positive values of the hydrological alteration from 0 1 to 0 5 in the high rva category were detected for mpi knmi smhi increase in the frequency of early occurrence of dry conditions over the year a positive hydrological alteration value of the low rva category for the date of min was detected both for smhi and knmi 0 3 and 0 6 respectively reduction in the frequency of the high values for 1 3 7 30 90 day max flow for mpi knmi and smhi negative values of hydrological alteration for the high rva category ranged from 0 2 to 0 6 alterations in the middle and low rva categories differed among the model predictions negligible hydrological alterations for 1 3 7 30 90 min flow except for knmi which showed a reduction in the frequency of high values negative values of hydrological alteration for the high rva category ranged from 0 2 to 0 6 hydrological alterations in monthly flow in all the rva categories with some differences among the climatic projections results indicated a general decrease in the frequency of high values of monthly flow negative values of hydrological alterations ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 for the high rva category in knmi and mpi and increase in the frequency of the low values in june and july for knmi and smhi 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on streamflow over the period 1954 1995 several studies have highlighted that the paucity of climatic and hydrological data is very common in the mediterranean region oueslati et al 2015 especially in river basins with intermittent river systems skoulikidis et al 2017 d ambrosio et al 2017 costigan et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020 stated that the number of perennial monitored streams included in the national or international databases is higher than intermittent rivers despite the latter are the prevalent waterways borg galea et al 2019 presented the difficulties in monitoring and mapping the spatio temporal variability of streamflow of mediterranean intermittent rivers the paucity of data is the main limitation of the present study the lack of data has been already identified as the main constraint for hydrological studies analyzing factors such as modeling de girolamo et al 2017b d ambrosio et al 2020b river type classification oueslati et al 2015 trends in streamflow tramblay et al 2020 and cc impacts on water resources de girolamo et al 2017a indeed cc detection needs analysis of long climatological data by means of several statistical procedures the statistical analysis becomes difficult whenever the available time series related to the area of interest are not sufficiently long and or missing data exceeds the critical threshold of 20 johnson 2003 the usual difficulties encountered for data reconstruction trend detection and change point analysis suffer from greater uncertainty when the above described adverse cases occur for the case at hand a detailed analysis has been possible only for faeto rainfall data which had a long time series 1935 2012 with a manageable rate of missing data 29 moreover some similar monitoring sites surrounding this site of interest helped during the data reconstruction phase the analysis of change points is generally difficult since the rainfall time series have an irregular pattern after a long calibration the optimal number of change points was identified 1936 1946 1968 and 1980 however these change points should be considered affected by a degree of uncertainty that could be very large i e the first change point should be considered varying in the interval 1920 1944 therefore the selection of change points should be carried out with particular caution completing the analysis with a visual inspection of the time series as pointed out by lindeløv 2020 despite the difficulties and limitations the present study identified an increase in the minimum and mean air temperature over the past decades 1949 2012 with some differences between lowland and headwater in the lowland from the period 1949 1979 to the period 1980 2012 the mean annual temperature was found to increase by 0 6 c in the mountainous area from 1958 to 2012 at the faeto gauge the mean temperature increased 0 6 c per decade and the number of days with temperatures below zero dramatically decreased 12 days per decade consequently a shift of snowfall to rainfall occurred when the air temperature was around zero with a reduction in the number of snowy days and snowmelt these results were in good agreement with previous studies www climatechangepost com italy climate change that reported at the national level a positive trend in mean temperature from 1980 to 2011 with a mean increase of 1 54 c with no significant difference between seasons in southern italy an increase in the number of warm days and a decrease in the number of cold and very cold days i e ice days were observed for 1951 2010 www climatechangepost com italy climate change this study confirms that climate is an important driver of flow regime since the changes in trend detected in climate over the past decades 1954 1995 resulted in changes in the streamflow dynamics the flow regime at the celone ponte foggia site showed a clear trend towards a depletion in magnitude annual flow 30 90 days max 30 90 days min baseflow the zero days increased 190 over 1969 1995 as compared with 1954 1968 meanwhile the date of min decreased indicating that the stream dried earlier in the year correlation analysis between the ihas and the number of days with temperatures below zero at the faeto site was carried out many of the relationships were found to be statistically insignificant and were thus excluded from the discussion the correlation between the number of days for year with the temperature below zero at the faeto gauge and the date of min was significant this result suggested that the snowmelt played an important role in the dry phase of the river indeed snow accumulation in winter and snowmelt in spring contribute to the streamflow in summer and are fundamental to sustain the low flow in the celone basin the temperature rise resulted in a reduction in the rate of snow and snowmelt contribution to streamflow which in turn resulted in the early arrival of the dry phase to our knowledge no study has analyzed the streamflow regime in relation to the climate in the area of neighboring basins that can confirm these results however the presence of many water mills in the upper celone valley in the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century pirozzoli and pirozzoli 2004 seems to confirm that much more water flowed in the past on the other hand the impact of land use change on flow regime is presumably limited as only afforestation in small areas in the mountainous part of the basin took place between 1950 and 1990 ursitti 2005 based on this trend we assumed in this study that no changes in land use for future decades will occur however more insights are needed to understand if illegal water abstraction from the river or from the groundwater could have contributed to the reduction of streamflow during summer in the lowland a recent study blöschl et al 2019 pointed out that cc in europe has led to changes in flood patterns magnitude timing and frequency the authors identified clear regional patterns of both increase and decrease in river flood discharge over the past five decades in europe which are manifestations of a change in the climate in their research blöschl et al 2019 studied the candelaro basin of which the celone is a sub basin and detected a negative rate of change in the mean annual flood discharge highest peak discharge recorded in each calendar year per decade from 12 to 24 the present study showed similar results in terms of reduction in 1 day max flow recorded over the past decades at the celone ponte foggia site 4 2 future impact of climate change on flow regime for the period 2030 2059 several sources of uncertainty exist when translating scenarios of cc in terms of impacts on natural resources the high sensitivity of the flow regime to cc necessitates a high accuracy in model projections hattermann et al 2018 several studies have shown differences among model projections for rainfall meanwhile there is not much disagreement in temperature increases ipcc 2013 in some large river basins i e nile niger mississippi and amazon the precipitation projections showed different trends hattermann et al 2018 vetter et al 2017 pointed out that global circulation models constituted the largest source of uncertainty when analyzing trends in river discharge hatterman et al 2018 found that a small increase in global temperature can have a significant impact on all flow regime components in almost all basins but its effect is often overwhelm by the uncertainty of the global circulation models related to the rainfall in the present work the swat model simulated changes in the flow regime components for all the analyzed model projections mpi knmi smhi a general agreement was found in the hydrological alterations among the climate model projections cv 0 2 some differences in the magnitude of monthly streamflow were detected indicating the uncertainty associated with the model projections i e cv 0 4 and cv 0 3 for july and december respectively this uncertainty is mainly attributed to the differences in the rainfall projections mpi knmi smhi in fig 7 although a certain degree of uncertainty may affect the results it can be concluded that all the analyzed model projections determined alterations in flow regime for the near future which were consistent with the tendency seen over the past decades the results clearly showed a shift toward drier conditions with a general reduction in streamflow and an extension of the dry period these conclusions are supported by several studies carried out in the basins under the mediterranean climate an extension of the dry period was identified under a future climate pattern by brounzyine et al 2021a who quantified the extension of the dry period in the bouregreg basin morocco aguibat ziar gauge to about 10 days 2035 2050 a significant reduction in annual values of maximum streamflow for different duration was predicted for the merguellil basin tunisia for the near future 2010 2039 and far future 2070 2099 by abouabdillah et al 2010 the frequency of extremely low flow was found to increase over time and the spring streamflow was found to decrease in the near future and far future in koiliaris river greece nerantzaki et al 2015 a reduction in annual mean streamflow 18 28 under future climate patterns 2021 2100 as compared with the past 1950 2015 was assessed by fonseca and santos 2019 in the tamega river basin portugal a reduction in the number of snowy days was predicted in chile due to cc by demaria et al 2013 it is well known that the hydrological regime strongly influences the sediment regime fortesa et al 2021 water quality d ambrosio et al 2020b and the ecological integrity in river ecosystems bunn and arthington 2002 poff et al 1997 hence the alterations in the hydrological regime due to cc could have several implications on water quality in terms of nutrients for instance the reduction in streamflow implies a diminished dilution capacity of the river indeed the low flow constitutes a critical condition for point source discharge assimilation in most of the intermittent streams de girolamo and lo porto 2020 d ambrosio et al 2020a the river channel morphology and physical habitat conditions could change as a result of the depletion magnitude of the maxima annual flow of various time duration 1 3 7 30 90 max flow and monthly flow arthington 2012 the differences in lentic and lotic habitats along the river reaches could affect invertebrate communities buffagni 2021 the flow related habitat conditions may greatly influence the interpretation of biological data e g biological metrics values and taxa occurrence hence the changes seen in the habitat conditions should be taken into account when assessing the ecological quality of the intermittent rivers buffagni et al 2020 4 3 climate change and environmental flow the results of the present study clearly indicate that cc affects water resources in the celone river basin with reductions in annual streamflow and changes in flow regime over the next decades the economic growth will presumably produce an increased water demand both for agriculture and human consumption thereby exacerbating the competition for water use hence more efficient water resources management is needed to balance the economic and social aspects stefanova et al 2019 and to maintain and restore the river ecosystems arthington 2012 in the study area we strongly suggest water resource managers include the eflow design and the water release downstream of the capaccio reservoir the eflow describes the quantity timing and quality of water flow needed to sustain the freshwater ecosystem and human beings that depend on these ecosystems brisbane declaration setting an eflow is a long and complex process that takes place in contrasting socioeconomic contexts arthington 2012 one of the most common approaches adopted for setting the eflow is the scenarios development where several scenarios environmental and economic are developed throughout a process of negotiation among the stakeholders based on the result of this study it is evident that the potential effect of cc must be incorporated in the scenario modeling when forecasting the eflow requirements thus it is necessary to include the low flow and flow intermittence to mimic the natural flow variability of the river in the eflow management and in general to include the changes in flow regime components expected for future decades supplementary material s7 to do this a periodic revision i e for 5 10 years of the environmental and socio economic impacts under cc should be carried out 5 conclusions this paper analyzed the impact of long term climate change on flow regimes in a mediterranean basin with an intermittent river system the climatic conditions and streamflow recorded in the celone river basin in the past century were accurately analyzed and the climate model projections for 2030 2059 were used in a hydrological model in order to identify changes in the flow regime the changes in temperature and rainfall that occurred over the past five decades in the celone river basin altered the flow regime the magnitude of mean annual flow decreased while the duration of the period without flow increased for the future the analyzed climate model projections confirmed the trend recorded in the past and in recent decades the flow regime in the near future will move toward drier conditions despite the limitations of the present study i e high rate of missing data uncertainty in model climate projections the results suggested that cc will have several implications on water resources and river ecosystems in the celone basin the apulia region is already facing a water shortage based on this study it is expected that in near future hydrological pressures will increase and consequently the water resource availability could decrease in view of these results water resources planning is essential in the competition for water uses and watershed management will assume a strategic role in maintaining a balance between the economic and social aspects and river ecosystem requirements the results also showed that cc will have implications on the eflow management making its definition more complex on the one hand the flow regime and river ecosystems are changing on the other hand new and contrasting socio economic aspects may arise due to the limited water resource availability further studies are needed to investigate the implications of the flow regime alterations due to cc on water quality river morphology and habitat conditions and to incorporate cc in the eflow design and management credit authorship contribution statement anna maria de girolamo conceptualization methodology software validation

7946,study region catchment in southern italy study focus the flow regime of intermittent rivers is very sensitive to anthropogenic pressures and climate change cc this study investigated the long term impact of cc on the flow regime of an intermittent river system the celone river s e italy under the mediterranean climate the trends in precipitation and temperature measured over the past century were investigated and the flow regime was characterized by using 27 indicators of hydrological alteration climate projections for the future 2030 2059 were used to predict potential cc impact on the flow regime the soil and water assessment tool swat model was run to simulate hydrology for the current and future scenarios new hydrological insights for the region a significant increase in temperature and a reduction in the number of days with temperatures below 0 c was recorded from 1958 to 2012 for the future climate model projections predicted an increase in the daily temperature and a decrease in rainfall 4 9 as compared with the baseline 1980 2009 as a result the model predicted reductions in the mean annual flow by up to 21 and 39 compared to the baseline and the historical period 1965 1996 respectively it also predicted a reduction in the maximum annual flow recorded over 90 consecutive days up to 18 and an extension of the no flowing phase by up to 12 days graphical

the characterization of hydrological processes in the semi arid basins have fallen behind that of more humid environments with perennial rivers skoulikidis et al 2017 some emerging questions in semi

on ecosystem dynamics the interaction between groundwater and surface water and physical factors controlling streamflow disconnection larned et al 2010 beetle moorcroft et al 2021 depending on the climate lithological and geological factors the spatio temporal pattern of flow and cessation of flow with a partial or complete dry channel may be extremely variable in space and time thus making it more difficult to determine the hydrological processes and nutrient and ecosystem dynamics costigan et al 2017 fortesa et al 2021 sauquet et al 2021 over the last century anthropogenic impacts have caused flow regime alterations in most of intermittent river systems acuña et al 2020 several authors have pointed out that the alterations of flow regime components i e magnitude timing duration frequency rate of change may have a profound impact on the function and structure of the ecosystem and riverine physical and chemical processes poff et al 1997 bunn and arthington 2002 in the near and far future cc will constitute an additional factor that upon interaction with anthropogenic pressures will contribute to altering the flow regime of intermittent river systems the multiple interactions between climate change land and water resources degradation desertification food security and the economic and social dimension will make governance and decision making particularly complex ipcc 2019 in this context the management of basins with intermittent rivers is a challenge for watershed managers magand et al 2020 ec 2009a 2009b based on the increased awareness of the importance of intermittent river systems and the relatively poor knowledge regarding cc impacts on their ecosystems several studies have been carried out to analyze the impact of cc on water resources at different spatial and time scales hadour et al 2020 didovets et al 2021 most of these studies have used hydrological models as tools for estimating water resources and alterations in flow regime brouziyne et al 2021a 2021b piniewski et al 2018 hattermann et al 2018 key results from case studies under the mediterranean climate showed a consistent decrease in water resources for the future garcia et al 2017 an increase in the frequency of minimum flow conditions brouziyne et al 2021a a shift in the location of the snow line to a higher elevation demaria et al 2013 and a reduction in dam storage tramblay et al 2013 as a consequence of the warmed climate in the 21st century giorgi and lionello 2008 to our knowledge no studies have analyzed the impact of long term cc on the streamflow in small or medium basins with intermittent streams in order to investigate the relationship between climate and flow regime over the last century the main reason for the lack of long term analysis is the scarce availability of climatic and hydrological data or the high rate of missing data in the time series i e daily rainfall and temperature daily streamflow which is a common characteristic of intermittent river systems indeed intermittent rivers in the past were underrepresented in the monitoring networks and were often ungauged in the mediterranean region skoulikidis et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020 this study is a continuation of a previous study de girolamo et al 2017a carried out in the candelaro river basin apulia italy 2200 km2 that analyzed the impact of cc on water balance at the basin scale and the future alterations in flow regime in a few well preserved river reaches the previous study pointed out a future reduction of 7 18 in water resources availability at the basin scale with intermittent and ephemeral reaches showing more exacerbated alterations of the hydrological regime than perennial reaches hence a more detailed study at the sub basin scale was needed for supporting the water framework directive ec 2000 implementation since the reference conditions have to be redefined if a water body shifts from perennial to intermittent in addition the authors highlighted that further analyses of climate trends and associated streamflow alterations were needed at the outlet of this watershed in order to establish an appropriate environmental flow eflow that considers potential shifts from perennial to intermittent flow regimes ec 2015 arthington 2012 the overall objective of the present work was to analyze the impact of long term cc on the flow regime of the celone river apulia region italy the main tributary of the candelaro river the specific objectives were to i identify trends in rainfall and temperature over the past decades 1935 2012 ii analyze changes that occurred in the flow regime from 1954 to 1996 and iii analyze potential impacts of cc on the flow regime for the period 2030 2059 by using climate projections which are a combination of a global circulation model echam5 and three regional circulation models the study can help to identify the changes that occurred in the past century and to provide information that can be used for planning and managing future water resources in the celone basin and other similar basins 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the celone river basin located in the south of italy apulia region fig 1 the celone river is a tributary of the candelaro one of the most important rivers of the region overall the drainage area is 317 km2 and the length of the main stream is about 90 km only 4 of the area is urbanized the primary land use is extensive agriculture in the upper part of the basin and intensive agriculture in the lowlands the basin is characterized by a mean elevation of about 300 m a s l ranging from 0 to 1100 m a s l the average annual precipitation recorded in the basin during 1990 2009 was 625 mm annual rainfall varies with elevation from 840 mm in the mountainous area to 465 mm in the lowland rainfall is mostly concentrated during november may generally it is not uniformly distributed in the basin during june september rainfall is concentrated in a few extremely localized events that give rise to flash floods with a rapid increase in flow and a short lag time the mean annual temperature 1990 2009 recorded was 12 3 c and 16 1 c in mountain and lowland respectively in winter mainly in january and february snow falls on the upper part of the basin but no data are available due to lack of snow monitoring sites the geological structural setting of the area is characterized by two tectonic units unità della fossa bradanica e unità della daunia major bedrock lithological units that are flyschoid formations flysch della daunia green blue clays in the upper celone basin and alluvial deposits in the lowlands the prevalent soil textures are sandy clay loam 36 sandy clay 1 and clay 63 the river morphology is well preserved in the upper and middle course where incised channel and meandering along with braided branches are prevalent respectively generally during the dry season july november streamflow is very low or absent and some river segments of the first order and the reaches of the main course located in the alluvial plains run dry with at most isolated pools the streamflow regime ensues climatic seasonality with a pattern of a dry period characterized by flash flood events and wet season the river is classified intermittent by the river basin authority the hydrological pressures in the basin are point source discharges from wastewater treatment plants about 2500 equivalent inhabitants in the upper part of the basin water abstraction from the river and groundwater for agricultural water use in the lowland and a reservoir in the middle course the capaccio reservoir 41 25 30 n 15 25 25 e was built in 2000 for irrigation purposes collecting 25 82 million m3 at full capacity the celone stream is the main inflow into the reservoir 2 2 methodology the methodology fig 2 which is described in the following paragraphs comprised two steps 1 analysis of the climate and flow regime over the past decades and 2 analysis of the climate and flow regime for the baseline and future the first step 1 included the trend and change point detection in the time series of annual rainfall and annual temperature mean and minimum recorded over the past decades as well as flow regime alterations assessment using the indicators of hydrological alterations ihas computed with daily streamflow recorded in the past decades the analysis of trends in climate was carried out at two gauging stations located in the mountainous faeto gauge 866 m a s l and lowland area foggia istituto agronomico gauge 76 m a s l the coldest and hottest points of the study area respectively annual precipitation data were available for 1935 2012 at the faeto gauge and for 1949 2012 at the foggia istituto agronomico gauge the annual and monthly temperature minimum and mean data were available for the period 1958 2012 at the faeto gauge and 1949 2012 at the foggia istituto agronomico gauge missing data in the climatic time series were reconstructed as described in the following paragraphs before analyzing the trends the daily streamflow recorded from 1954 to 1995 at the gauging station celone ponte foggia 41 31 34 n 15 32 42 e downstream of the reservoir fig 1 and from 1965 to 1996 at the gauge celone san vincenzo 41 25 25 n 15 24 31 e upstream of the reservoir fig 2 with 14 and 15 6 of missing data respectively were used for assessing flow regime alterations in the second step 2 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold and fohrer 2005 was used to simulate the streamflow at daily time step the model was calibrated and validated 1990 1996 thereafter it was run for simulating streamflow for the baseline 1980 2009 and for the near future 2030 2059 by using the downscaled daily rainfall and temperature of three different climate projections as described in the following paragraph finally the flow regime alterations were assessed by comparing the ihas computed for the future projections with the corresponding ihas relative to the baseline 2 3 climate data projections the climate projections used in the present study were derived from the eu fp6 ensembles project kjellström et al 2013 van der linden and mitchell 2009 funded by the european commission ec the selected scenarios were based on the a1b emission scenario which forecasts an increase in population and economic growth until the mid 21st century and a decrease thereafter consequent to the adoption of more efficient technologies ipcc 2010 the projections are combinations of data derived from the echam5 model a global circulation model gcm with three regional circulation models rcms racmo2 rca3 0 remo developed by the royal netherlands meteorological institute knmi knmi racmo echam5 the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi smhi rca echam5 and the max planck institute mpi mpi remo echam5 respectively called hereafter knmi smhi mpi the climate projections of daily precipitations and minimum and maximum daily temperatures 25 km resolution were extracted as a grid covering the study area for two periods 1980 2009 and 2030 2059 the first period was used as a baseline to assess climate changes it was representative of the recent climate in the study area covering a wide range of climatic conditions severe droughts and cool seasons the downscaling was performed in accordance with the method reported by de girolamo et al 2017a based on the climatic stations present in the basin at the monthly time scale a simple ratio method was used for rainfall where for the ith month the average observed data from 1990 to 2000 was divided by the average gcm rcms data during the same period thereby obtaining the i monthly factor fi and then future daily gcm rcms data 2030 2059 was multiplied by the corresponding monthly factor fi to obtain downscaled future daily precipitation data abbaspour et al 2009 the future daily temperature data were downscaled by applying a nonlinear model fourth order polynomial regression equation to the future gcm rcms data the validation was carried out for the decade 2001 2010 de girolamo et al 2017a the model fitted the observations well r2 0 99 2 4 data reconstruction and trends in climatic time series over the past decades before assessing the trend in time series a check for missing data was carried out followed by data reconstruction in the study area the time series of annual precipitation and annual temperature mean and minimum were affected by missing data missing data is a hindrance to any reliable statistical analysis to address this issue and to reconstruct the time series the following multi step methodology was applied analysis of the missing data structure search for neighboring monitoring sites with respect to the site of interest to carry out the first reduction of missing data rate by means of a multiple regression analysis analysis of the mechanism of missingness lo presti et al 2008 application of one or more reconstruction methods and comparison for selecting the most reliable method three different data reconstruction approaches were applied and their respective results were compared for selecting the best suited approach for imputing the missing data the three approaches were i em multivariate expectation maximization algorithm for multivariate gaussian data ii mice multiple imputation chained equations based on the predictive mean matching method rubin 1986 and iii em cubist expectation maximization algorithm based on the cubist method feng et al 2020 van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 schafer 1997 the comparison of the three approaches was performed by means of two different methods in the first the main statistics of the original dataset mean and standard deviation were compared with the corresponding statistics of the three reconstructed datasets looking for the approach that modified the statistical parameters to a lesser extent the second approach considered the overall comparison between the original incomplete dataset and the rebuilt dataset in practice the density functions pdf of the incomplete and reconstructed datasets were computed and overlapped afterward the degree of overlapping of the pdfs was computed the approach that provided the best results was selected all the computations were performed in the r environment using the packages imputer mice and norm feng et al 2020 van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 schafer 1997 the trend analysis was carried out by means of the classical mann kendall test for the reconstructed datasets when the above reported methodology could not be applied and the conditions did not allow any reliable data reconstruction a linear regression model was applied to explore temporal trends in precipitation and temperature over the historical datasets then the f test was applied to assess whether the linear regression model was significant with respect to the considered dataset 2 4 1 trend in precipitation time series the time series of annual precipitation mm recorded at the faeto site which consisted of 94 records were affected by about 29 of missing data supplementary material s1 to fill the gaps the neighborhood gauging stations biccari orsara and troia located 8 13 km from faeto were used the pearson correlation between the rainfall data recorded at faeto and those recorded at biccari orsara and troia ranged from 0 5 to 0 71 confirming that those sites provided a good contribution for faeto data reconstruction by means of multiple regression the rate of missing data of biccari and orsara was below 5 and of troia was around 13 unfortunately since the supporting time series of faeto were themselves incomplete it was not possible to make a reliable analysis of the data missingness mechanisms therefore it was assumed that the mechanism was mar missing at random lo presti et al 2008 this assumption was not always practical but since the rate of missing data of biccari and orsara was almost negligible it was sustainable the precipitation time series at the foggia istituto agronomico site presented a missing data rate of 6 25 supplementary material s1 nevertheless the supporting time series of foggia osservatorio was complete the reported elements made it easy to reconstruct the series with expected results that were realistic and reliable at the same time 2 4 2 trend in temperature time series the time series of annual mean temperature recorded at the faeto gauge presented a missing data rate of about 44 supplementary material s1 the time series of supporting sites of biccari and troia from 1972 and 1989 respectively showed a missing data rate of 41 and 25 respectively the time series of minimum temperature related to january started in 1958 and was comprised 54 records with a missing data rate lesser than 15 unfortunately the neighboring sites time series were shorter therefore they were not used to fix faeto s missing data hence the trend was assessed by estimating by applying a linear regression model as aforementioned the time series of annual mean temperature recorded at the foggia istituto agronomico consisted of 57 records with a rate of missing data of 33 supplementary material s1 due to the high rate of missing data the reconstruction was not possible and the trend was assessed by applying a linear regression model as aforementioned 2 4 3 change point detection in climatic time series change point analysis is generally used for detecting changes that happen along the time series due to human or natural causes lindeløv 2020 in the present study change points were detected for the past decades the result provided the decomposition of the period covered by the time series into subsets each characterized by a stable behavior in this way the alternation among upward constant and downward oriented trends of the variable of interest were identified the change point was geometrically denoted as the first observation of a new segment in the piece wise polygonal that approximated the variable s behavior the type of change point searched in the present study was change in mean two approaches were used for assessing the change points over the period of interest bayesian and binary segmentation these approaches were implemented in r by libraries changepoint and mcp haynes et al 2014 lindeløv 2020 2 5 hydrological regime alterations the flow regime of the celone river at the san vincenzo and ponte foggia sites was characterized over the past decades 1965 1996 and 1954 1995 respectively for the baseline 1980 2009 and for the near future 2030 2059 by using 27 ihas richter et al 1996 oueslati et al 2015 d ambrosio et al 2017 as reported in the literature poff et al 1997 the ihas can describe all the components of the flow regime that have an ecological relevance magnitude it is the amount of water moving per unit time m3s 1 at any given time interval frequency it refers to how often a flow of a given magnitude recurs over a time interval duration it is the period of time associated with a specific flow condition day rate of change it refers to how quickly flow changes from one magnitude to another timing it is the date of flows of a defined magnitude julian date in this work for each year of the time series past baseline and future the following ihas were analyzed table 1 magnitude of the annual water conditions magnitude and timing of monthly water condition magnitude and duration of annual maximum and minimum water conditions recorded over consecutive days 1 3 7 30 90 day and magnitude of base flow the magnitude of baseflow was estimated as the ratio of minimum streamflow recorded over seven consecutive days and the mean annual flow the nature conservancy 2009 richter et al 1996 similarly the duration of the zero days the number of days with no flow and the timing of maximum and minimum flow were determined table 1 the ihas software developed by the us nature conservancy richter et al 1996 the nature conservancy 2009 was used to calculate the ihas based on the daily streamflow data non parametric analysis i e median and percentiles where no assumption was made about the distribution of data was performed to estimate representative annual values richter et al 1997 the degree of hydrological alteration was estimated for each iha as the ratio of the median value calculated for the future f to the median value for the baseline period b the hydrological alteration was classified as severe depletion if the ratio f b 0 1 high depletion if 0 1 f b 0 3 moderate depletion if 0 3 f b 1 moderate inflation if 1 f b 2 high inflation if 2 f b 3 and severe inflation if f b 3 zimmerman et al 2018 for each iha the range of variability approach rva richter et al 1996 was used to identify whether changes between the baseline and future time series were equally distributed or occurred more frequently either at the lower or higher limits of the distribution range to do this the entire range of variability of each indicator for the baseline was divided into three classes based on the percentiles values 33rd percentile values included in the range 34th 67th percentiles values 67th percentile for each class the hydrological alteration value was computed as follows future frequency baseline frequency baseline frequency a positive hydrological alteration value means that the frequency of values in the class has increased from the baseline to the future whereas a negative value means that the frequency of values has decreased at the celone ponte foggia gauge the hydrological alteration analysis was not conducted because the flow regime has experienced heavy alterations since the construction of the reservoir in 2000 de girolamo et al 2017b a linear regression model was applied to explore whether ihas were varying over time for the period of data available in addition the pearson correlation was computed to explore whether winter temperature and the presence of snow was associated with the subsequent dry phase in the flow regime to do so the number of days per year with temperature below zero was correlated with the date of min which represents the start of the dry phase and then with the zero days which represents the duration of the dry phase 2 6 modeling streamflow the swat2005 model version with arcgis interface arnold and fohrer 2005 neitsch et al 2001 was implemented to simulate streamflow for the baseline and future climate projections swat is a semi distributed model developed to assess the effects of anthropogenic pressures on water quality arnold et at 1998 d ambrosio et al 2020a malagó et al 2019 pulighe et al 2019 and the cc impact on water resources and flow regime e g brouziyne et al 2021a didovets et al 2021 piniewski et al 2018 the model is also widely used to predict the impact of best management practices on water bodies and soils in agricultural basins d ambrosio et al 2020b de girolamo and lo porto 2020 ricci et al 2020 the swat model set up requires daily climatic data at least rainfall and minimum and maximum temperature soil data texture and hydraulic parameters land use and management practices it works by dividing the basin into sub basins that are further divided into hydrological response units hrus which consist of homogeneous land use management and soil characteristics for each hru the evapotranspiration and runoff are computed in order to develop the water balance neitsch et al 2001 in the present study the current conditions climate and land use and management operations were simulated at daily time steps from 1990 to 2009 based on recorded data as reported in table ai annex a the time series of daily precipitation and daily temperature minimum and maximum were available at three gauging stations fig 1 the scs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 was adopted to calculate surface runoff and the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 was selected for estimating the potential evapotranspiration pet the sensitivity analysis sa with the lh oat approach developed by van griensven et al 2002 was performed before calibrating the model in order to assess the most sensitive parameters that influence hydrological processes among the most sensitive parameters were the following the initial scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 the depth from the soil surface to the bottom of the layer sol z mm the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn mm the available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc mmh2o mmsoil the soil evaporation compensation factor esco and the surface runoff lag time surlag days at the gauging station celone san vincenzo the swat cup abbaspour et al 2015 was used to refine calibrated parameters and to carry out the uncertainty analysis by using the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 procedure at ponte foggia gauge a manual calibration was performed this approach was preferred since the most sensitive parameters were known the model was calibrated and validated at celone s vincenzo over the periods 1990 1992 and 1995 1996 respectively and at celone ponte foggia over the periods 1990 1991 and 1994 respectively for a detailed description of the input data model setup calibration and validation procedures refer to de girolamo et al 2017a 2017b the initial range of the most sensitive parameters and their calibrated values are reported in table 2 after model calibration and validation three different simulations were performed by using downscaled climatic data from the above mentioned model projections knmi mpi smhi respectively to predict streamflow for baseline 1980 2009 and for future decades 2030 2059 the current land uses and management practices were considered to remain the same for the future scenarios we acknowledge that this assumption becomes a limitation of the present study and in general of the research works concerning cc impacts on water and agriculture since new land use systems that are more resilient to cc could be adopted the irrigation was set based on farmers interviews for the baseline and an increase in irrigation equal to the increase in pet 4 was computed for future scenarios at yearly time steps the performance of the swat model in simulating daily streamflow in the celone river basin for the current conditions was evaluated by using the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 positive pbias indicates model underestimation bias and a negative value indicate an overestimation of streamflow in their review moriasi et al 2012 defined the model performance for streamflow simulated on a monthly time step as satisfactory if nse and r2 0 5 pbias 25 arnold et al 2012 suggested that those ratings should be adjusted to be more or less strict based on project considerations and time step simulation i e yearly or daily respectively in the present paper considering the daily time step it was assumed as satisfactory if r2 0 5 nse 0 45 and pbias 0 27 de girolamo et al 2017b 3 results 3 1 trends in rainfall over the past decades the density distribution of original and reconstructed total annual rainfall data differed slightly among the three approaches used both for the faeto fig 3a and foggia istituto agronomico site fig 3b at the faeto site the em multivariate approach performed better 96 of overlapping than mice and em cubist for which the overlap between original and reconstructed data was 87 and 92 respectively at the foggia istituto agronomico site the em cubist approach outperformed the others 97 of overlapping fig 3b none of the reconstructed time series show serial autocorrelation the change points detected for the time series of the annual rainfall were the following 1936 1946 1968 and 1980 these values should be considered affected by a degree of uncertainty two subsets of particular interest or segments were individuated and analyzed for 1935 1979 and 1980 2012 at the faeto site the trend analysis stated that the segments are both characterized by a significant trend the first is downward fig 4a mann kendall test p value 0 042 and the second is upward fig 4b mann kendall test p value 0 022 the analysis of the whole faeto annual rainfall time series did not exhibit a significant trend at the foggia istituto agonomico the whole annual rainfall time series did not exhibit any significant trend the trend over the period 1949 1979 was not significant mann kendall test p value 0 21 fig 4c meanwhile over the period 1980 2012 a significant upward trend was predicted mann kendall test p value 0 005 fig 4d 3 2 trends in temperature over the past decades at the faeto site results showed a significant increase over time in annual mean temperature f test p value 4 88e 06 and minimum temperature f test p value 5 299e 05 the minimum temperature recorded in january at the faeto gauging station showed an upward significant tendency fig 5a f test p value 0 004 meanwhile the minimum temperature recorded in february did not show a significant trend the analysis also showed that the number of sub zero days at the faeto site significantly decreased over time f test p value 0 00099 fig 5b with a rate of 12 days per decade y 2400 7918 1 1956 x consequently we can infer that a shift of snowfall to rainfall was occurred when air temperatures were around zero at the foggia istituto agronomico site the trend in mean annual temperature was not significant over 1949 2010 r2 0 09 p value 0 081 notably this result is affected by a large uncertainty due to the significant amount of missing data of 33 3 3 future temperature and rainfall climate projections showed a general increase in temperature both for the daily minimum and maximum values as compared with the baseline values recorded at the gauging stations biccari troia and foggia 1980 2009 on a monthly basis the maximum daily temperature varied between 0 6 and 2 4 c in the analyzed gcm rcms a major increase in maximum temperature was predicted in summer july september fig 6 the increase in minimum temperature varied in the range 0 3 2 1 c with the highest divergence from the baseline in winter december february on a yearly basis the minimum daily temperature increased from 0 95 c knmi to 1 14 c mpi and the maximum daily temperature increased from 1 29 c knmi to 1 43 c mpi on a yearly basis for 2030 2059 all the models predicted a decrease in rainfall varying from 4 to 9 as compared with the baseline and a different distribution through the year with an important decrease from january to april and an increase in october and december fig 7 3 4 alteration of the hydrological regime over the past decades the celone river at the ponte foggia site showed clear changes in the flow regime over 1954 1995 shifting from perennial towards intermittent conditions the change point detected in the climatic time series 1968 was found also in the streamflow components the time series of zero days showed a significant trend f test p value 0 0001 with an upward orientation fig 8h an increase of 190 in the number of zero days was detected over 1969 1995 as compared with the previous 1954 1968 meanwhile the dry period started earlier by 18 days a significant trend f test p value 0 02 supplementary material s2 with a downward orientation was also detected in the mean annual streamflow monthly streamflow from september to february except november 1 30 90 days max 30 90 day min and baseflow r2 is reported in fig 8 for each iha meanwhile the timing of the extremely high flow events did not show a significant trend data not shown reductions in mean annual flow 27 base flow 99 30 day max and 90 day max 23 and 24 respectively were detected over 1969 1995 as compared with 1954 1968 a very high inter annual variability was recorded in the ihas fig 8 supplementary material s2 the flow regime at celone at san vincenzo site showed a shift towards drier

were quantitatively important 0 44 and 0 30 respectively but the correlations were not significant p value 0 1 3 5 modeling current and future flow regime 3 5 1 modeling current flow regime the model performances for streamflow simulations on the daily time scale ranged from satisfactory to good at the celone san vincenzo gauge and celone ponte foggia gauge arnold et al 2012 de girolamo et al 2017b table 3 generally simulated daily streamflow fit well the observed ones as expected the extremely low flow was affected by a large uncertainty green band in fig 9 the model overestimated the extremely low flow since the no flowing condition was of great importance when determining the ihas de girolamo et al 2017b suggested adjusting model output if necessary the authors identified a zero flow threshold which is the value of simulated streamflow that corresponds to no flow actual dry conditions comparing simulated and measured streamflow data during the driest year 1991 at the celone san vincenzo gauge in the present work the zero flow threshold identified by the authors 75 l s 1 at the celone san vincenzo was adopted to correctly predict the ihas related to periods of dryness thus the zero flow threshold was subtracted from the simulated values of streamflow before calculating the ihas with simulated data 3 5 2 modelling future flow regime and hydrological alterations at the celone san vincenzo at the celone san vincenzo site the results clearly indicated flow regime alterations in the near future 2030 2059 the median values of the ihas changed under all the analyzed future climate projections mpi knmi smhi supplementary material s4 s5 s6 the hydrological alteration ranged from 0 5 to 1 moderate depletion and from 1 to 1 4 moderate inflation depending on the iha and on the climate projection table 4 the mean annual flow is expected to decrease in the future by 3 smhi 11 knmi and 21 mpi as compared with the baseline the mean annual flow contraction observed was much larger when compared with the historical data 39 except in early winter the alterations of median monthly streamflow group 2 in table 4 were depletions some differences were detected among the climate projections especially in july and december when the coefficient of variation among model projections was 0 4 and 0 3 respectively the ihas of annual minimum water conditions group 3 in table 4 and base flow did not show alterations since these indicators were zero both for the baseline and for the future scenarios the results showed general depletion for the ihas of annual maximum water conditions group 4 in table 4 with a degree of alteration from 0 7 to 0 9 the alteration observed in the zero days was inflation table 4 that corresponded to an increase in the number of zero days of 15 for the knmi 12 days 5 for the smhi 4 days it was negligible for the mpi the results also showed a degree of hydrological alteration in the timing of the annual maximum flow date of max in table 4 quantified in 0 7 knmi and smhi and 1 4 mpi which was predicted to come earlier in the year 19 days knmi and smhi and later for the mpi 15 days delay the timing of the annual minimum flow date of min in table 4 was altered for the knmi for which it was predicted to come earlier in the year 11 days and negligible for mpi and smhi the results of the rva which detected the changes in frequency for each of the categories defined above high middle and low highlighted the following behavior for the future model predictions as compared with the baseline fig 10 greater occurrence of extremely high values of zero days positive values of the hydrological alteration from 0 1 to 0 5 in the high rva category were detected for mpi knmi smhi increase in the frequency of early occurrence of dry conditions over the year a positive hydrological alteration value of the low rva category for the date of min was detected both for smhi and knmi 0 3 and 0 6 respectively reduction in the frequency of the high values for 1 3 7 30 90 day max flow for mpi knmi and smhi negative values of hydrological alteration for the high rva category ranged from 0 2 to 0 6 alterations in the middle and low rva categories differed among the model predictions negligible hydrological alterations for 1 3 7 30 90 min flow except for knmi which showed a reduction in the frequency of high values negative values of hydrological alteration for the high rva category ranged from 0 2 to 0 6 hydrological alterations in monthly flow in all the rva categories with some differences among the climatic projections results indicated a general decrease in the frequency of high values of monthly flow negative values of hydrological alterations ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 for the high rva category in knmi and mpi and increase in the frequency of the low values in june and july for knmi and smhi 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on streamflow over the period 1954 1995 several studies have highlighted that the paucity of climatic and hydrological data is very common in the mediterranean region oueslati et al 2015 especially in river basins with intermittent river systems skoulikidis et al 2017 d ambrosio et al 2017 costigan et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020 stated that the number of perennial monitored streams included in the national or international databases is higher than intermittent rivers despite the latter are the prevalent waterways borg galea et al 2019 presented the difficulties in monitoring and mapping the spatio temporal variability of streamflow of mediterranean intermittent rivers the paucity of data is the main limitation of the present study the lack of data has been already identified as the main constraint for hydrological studies analyzing factors such as modeling de girolamo et al 2017b d ambrosio et al 2020b river type classification oueslati et al 2015 trends in streamflow tramblay et al 2020 and cc impacts on water resources de girolamo et al 2017a indeed cc detection needs analysis of long climatological data by means of several statistical procedures the statistical analysis becomes difficult whenever the available time series related to the area of interest are not sufficiently long and or missing data exceeds the critical threshold of 20 johnson 2003 the usual difficulties encountered for data reconstruction trend detection and change point analysis suffer from greater uncertainty when the above described adverse cases occur for the case at hand a detailed analysis has been possible only for faeto rainfall data which had a long time series 1935 2012 with a manageable rate of missing data 29 moreover some similar monitoring sites surrounding this site of interest helped during the data reconstruction phase the analysis of change points is generally difficult since the rainfall time series have an irregular pattern after a long calibration the optimal number of change points was identified 1936 1946 1968 and 1980 however these change points should be considered affected by a degree of uncertainty that could be very large i e the first change point should be considered varying in the interval 1920 1944 therefore the selection of change points should be carried out with particular caution completing the analysis with a visual inspection of the time series as pointed out by lindeløv 2020 despite the difficulties and limitations the present study identified an increase in the minimum and mean air temperature over the past decades 1949 2012 with some differences between lowland and headwater in the lowland from the period 1949 1979 to the period 1980 2012 the mean annual temperature was found to increase by 0 6 c in the mountainous area from 1958 to 2012 at the faeto gauge the mean temperature increased 0 6 c per decade and the number of days with temperatures below zero dramatically decreased 12 days per decade consequently a shift of snowfall to rainfall occurred when the air temperature was around zero with a reduction in the number of snowy days and snowmelt these results were in good agreement with previous studies www climatechangepost com italy climate change that reported at the national level a positive trend in mean temperature from 1980 to 2011 with a mean increase of 1 54 c with no significant difference between seasons in southern italy an increase in the number of warm days and a decrease in the number of cold and very cold days i e ice days were observed for 1951 2010 www climatechangepost com italy climate change this study confirms that climate is an important driver of flow regime since the changes in trend detected in climate over the past decades 1954 1995 resulted in changes in the streamflow dynamics the flow regime at the celone ponte foggia site showed a clear trend towards a depletion in magnitude annual flow 30 90 days max 30 90 days min baseflow the zero days increased 190 over 1969 1995 as compared with 1954 1968 meanwhile the date of min decreased indicating that the stream dried earlier in the year correlation analysis between the ihas and the number of days with temperatures below zero at the faeto site was carried out many of the relationships were found to be statistically insignificant and were thus excluded from the discussion the correlation between the number of days for year with the temperature below zero at the faeto gauge and the date of min was significant this result suggested that the snowmelt played an important role in the dry phase of the river indeed snow accumulation in winter and snowmelt in spring contribute to the streamflow in summer and are fundamental to sustain the low flow in the celone basin the temperature rise resulted in a reduction in the rate of snow and snowmelt contribution to streamflow which in turn resulted in the early arrival of the dry phase to our knowledge no study has analyzed the streamflow regime in relation to the climate in the area of neighboring basins that can confirm these results however the presence of many water mills in the upper celone valley in the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century pirozzoli and pirozzoli 2004 seems to confirm that much more water flowed in the past on the other hand the impact of land use change on flow regime is presumably limited as only afforestation in small areas in the mountainous part of the basin took place between 1950 and 1990 ursitti 2005 based on this trend we assumed in this study that no changes in land use for future decades will occur however more insights are needed to understand if illegal water abstraction from the river or from the groundwater could have contributed to the reduction of streamflow during summer in the lowland a recent study blöschl et al 2019 pointed out that cc in europe has led to changes in flood patterns magnitude timing and frequency the authors identified clear regional patterns of both increase and decrease in river flood discharge over the past five decades in europe which are manifestations of a change in the climate in their research blöschl et al 2019 studied the candelaro basin of which the celone is a sub basin and detected a negative rate of change in the mean annual flood discharge highest peak discharge recorded in each calendar year per decade from 12 to 24 the present study showed similar results in terms of reduction in 1 day max flow recorded over the past decades at the celone ponte foggia site 4 2 future impact of climate change on flow regime for the period 2030 2059 several sources of uncertainty exist when translating scenarios of cc in terms of impacts on natural resources the high sensitivity of the flow regime to cc necessitates a high accuracy in model projections hattermann et al 2018 several studies have shown differences among model projections for rainfall meanwhile there is not much disagreement in temperature increases ipcc 2013 in some large river basins i e nile niger mississippi and amazon the precipitation projections showed different trends hattermann et al 2018 vetter et al 2017 pointed out that global circulation models constituted the largest source of uncertainty when analyzing trends in river discharge hatterman et al 2018 found that a small increase in global temperature can have a significant impact on all flow regime components in almost all basins but its effect is often overwhelm by the uncertainty of the global circulation models related to the rainfall in the present work the swat model simulated changes in the flow regime components for all the analyzed model projections mpi knmi smhi a general agreement was found in the hydrological alterations among the climate model projections cv 0 2 some differences in the magnitude of monthly streamflow were detected indicating the uncertainty associated with the model projections i e cv 0 4 and cv 0 3 for july and december respectively this uncertainty is mainly attributed to the differences in the rainfall projections mpi knmi smhi in fig 7 although a certain degree of uncertainty may affect the results it can be concluded that all the analyzed model projections determined alterations in flow regime for the near future which were consistent with the tendency seen over the past decades the results clearly showed a shift toward drier conditions with a general reduction in streamflow and an extension of the dry period these conclusions are supported by several studies carried out in the basins under the mediterranean climate an extension of the dry period was identified under a future climate pattern by brounzyine et al 2021a who quantified the extension of the dry period in the bouregreg basin morocco aguibat ziar gauge to about 10 days 2035 2050 a significant reduction in annual values of maximum streamflow for different duration was predicted for the merguellil basin tunisia for the near future 2010 2039 and far future 2070 2099 by abouabdillah et al 2010 the frequency of extremely low flow was found to increase over time and the spring streamflow was found to decrease in the near future and far future in koiliaris river greece nerantzaki et al 2015 a reduction in annual mean streamflow 18 28 under future climate patterns 2021 2100 as compared with the past 1950 2015 was assessed by fonseca and santos 2019 in the tamega river basin portugal a reduction in the number of snowy days was predicted in chile due to cc by demaria et al 2013 it is well known that the hydrological regime strongly influences the sediment regime fortesa et al 2021 water quality d ambrosio et al 2020b and the ecological integrity in river ecosystems bunn and arthington 2002 poff et al 1997 hence the alterations in the hydrological regime due to cc could have several implications on water quality in terms of nutrients for instance the reduction in streamflow implies a diminished dilution capacity of the river indeed the low flow constitutes a critical condition for point source discharge assimilation in most of the intermittent streams de girolamo and lo porto 2020 d ambrosio et al 2020a the river channel morphology and physical habitat conditions could change as a result of the depletion magnitude of the maxima annual flow of various time duration 1 3 7 30 90 max flow and monthly flow arthington 2012 the differences in lentic and lotic habitats along the river reaches could affect invertebrate communities buffagni 2021 the flow related habitat conditions may greatly influence the interpretation of biological data e g biological metrics values and taxa occurrence hence the changes seen in the habitat conditions should be taken into account when assessing the ecological quality of the intermittent rivers buffagni et al 2020 4 3 climate change and environmental flow the results of the present study clearly indicate that cc affects water resources in the celone river basin with reductions in annual streamflow and changes in flow regime over the next decades the economic growth will presumably produce an increased water demand both for agriculture and human consumption thereby exacerbating the competition for water use hence more efficient water resources management is needed to balance the economic and social aspects stefanova et al 2019 and to maintain and restore the river ecosystems arthington 2012 in the study area we strongly suggest water resource managers include the eflow design and the water release downstream of the capaccio reservoir the eflow describes the quantity timing and quality of water flow needed to sustain the freshwater ecosystem and human beings that depend on these ecosystems brisbane declaration setting an eflow is a long and complex process that takes place in contrasting socioeconomic contexts arthington 2012 one of the most common approaches adopted for setting the eflow is the scenarios development where several scenarios environmental and economic are developed throughout a process of negotiation among the stakeholders based on the result of this study it is evident that the potential effect of cc must be incorporated in the scenario modeling when forecasting the eflow requirements thus it is necessary to include the low flow and flow intermittence to mimic the natural flow variability of the river in the eflow management and in general to include the changes in flow regime components expected for future decades supplementary material s7 to do this a periodic revision i e for 5 10 years of the environmental and socio economic impacts under cc should be carried out 5 conclusions this paper analyzed the impact of long term climate change on flow regimes in a mediterranean basin with an intermittent river system the climatic conditions and streamflow recorded in the celone river basin in the past century were accurately analyzed and the climate model projections for 2030 2059 were used in a hydrological model in order to identify changes in the flow regime the changes in temperature and rainfall that occurred over the past five decades in the celone river basin altered the flow regime the magnitude of mean annual flow decreased while the duration of the period without flow increased for the future the analyzed climate model projections confirmed the trend recorded in the past and in recent decades the flow regime in the near future will move toward drier conditions despite the limitations of the present study i e high rate of missing data uncertainty in model climate projections the results suggested that cc will have several implications on water resources and river ecosystems in the celone basin the apulia region is already facing a water shortage based on this study it is expected that in near future hydrological pressures will increase and consequently the water resource availability could decrease in view of these results water resources planning is essential in the competition for water uses and watershed management will assume a strategic role in maintaining a balance between the economic and social aspects and river ecosystem requirements the results also showed that cc will have implications on the eflow management making its definition more complex on the one hand the flow regime and river ecosystems are changing on the other hand new and contrasting socio economic aspects may arise due to the limited water resource availability further studies are needed to investigate the implications of the flow regime alterations due to cc on water quality river morphology and habitat conditions and to incorporate cc in the eflow design and management credit authorship contribution statement anna maria de girolamo conceptualization methodology software validation

7947,study region the tibetan plateau known as the water tower of asia is the source of many rivers in asia and its water conservation function is the basis for the optimization of the ecological barrier and the water security of asian countries yet the tibetan plateau is also an ecologically fragile area facing numerous ecological issues and climate change risks so the response of the water conservation function to the changing environment has received much attention study focus this study systematically analyzed the variation trend of the water conservation function during 1961 2017 using the invest model simulations linear regression analysis and coefficients of variation new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the average annual water conservation of the tibetan plateau is about 256 billion m3 showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and the important areas scatter in the southeastern of the plateau such as the lower yarlung zangbo watershed the nujiang watershed and the yalong watershed the water conservation volume of the tibetan plateau was on the rise p 0 05 and there was spatial variability in the trends and coefficients of variation the increase of precipitation and ndvi leads to the overall increase in the water conservation of the tibetan plateau our findings could be used to fill the spatiotemporal variation gaps in

the tibetan plateau from 1961 to 2017 ga1 keywords the tibetan plateau water conservation function invest model spatiotemporal variation climate change 1 introduction ecosystem services are all direct and indirect benefits that people derive from nature which are the basic guarantee of human production and life and are closely related to human well being and sustainable development daily et al 1997 wallace et al 2007 as water is an important link between ecosystem processes and human activities water conservation function is an important ecological service function that plays a central role among various ecological services at the same time water is one of the most important natural resources for human survival development and production however the deterioration of the water environment and climate change have caused increasingly serious water resources problems and the increase in water demand from population growth and socio economic development has further exacerbated water scarcity tian et al 2020 water related ecosystem services have gained more attention and the study of water conservation function is becoming a common focus in the fields of ecology and hydrology brauman et al 2007 wen et al 2020 water conservation function refers to the process and ability of an ecosystem to retain water by intercepting infiltrating and storing precipitation in a certain spatial and temporal scale defined as annual scale in this paper through the forest canopy litter soil lakes and reservoirs etc which not only meets the ecosystem s demand for water but also provides water resources to the external and downstream regions hu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the main forms of the water conservation function include water supply runoff regulation flood storage water purification soil conservation and temperature regulation xu et al 2017 it is a complex and comprehensive concept which is the result of the combined effect of the ecosystem and hydrological processes under certain climatic conditions and is therefore influenced by various factors such as ecosystem type surface characteristics climatic conditions and human activities zhang et al 2010 šatalová and kenderessy 2017 it has been shown that climate change land use and vegetation cover are the main influencing factors of water conservation function leh et al 2013 hoyer et al 2014 climate change especially precipitation and evapotranspiration not only determines the amount of water that ecosystems can store but also affects the biophysical processes of ecosystems and directly influences the water conservation function chiang et al 2014 bai et al 2019 hu et al 2021 changes in land use could affect ecosystem patterns and local ecohydrological processes resulting in indirect impacts in some regions land use and vegetation cover are the dominant factors influencing the water conservation function j li et al 2021 m li et al 2021 wen et al 2020 wen et al 2019 the main influencing factors however are geographically diverse and the study of the spatiotemporal variation of the water conservation function under changing environments e g climate change vegetation cover change and land use change is also the focus of attention models which play an important role in the evaluation of water related ecological services can accurately simulate complex hydrological processes and quantify water related ecological services at different spatial and temporal scales such as soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 baker et al 2013 terrain lab chen et al 2005 integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest sharp et al 2018 benra et al 2021 artificial intelligence for ecosystem services aries villa et al 2014 etc among them the invest model is a visualization tool capable of quantitatively assessing ecosystem services under different scenarios compared to hydrological models the invest model enables quantitative assessment of water related ecosystem services based on fewer input data and requires less empirical knowledge moreover the invest model can assess multiple ecosystem services such as water yield water quality soil retention carbon storage biodiversity etc and integrates and weighs multiple ecosystem services to provide a basis for decision making nelson et al 2009 goldstein et al 2012 the water yield module which is based on the water balance principle can simulate annual water yield on a regional scale and express the results in the form of maps and has been widely used worldwide e g in the united states bai et al 2019 hamel et al 2015 africa leh et al 2013 europe redhead et al 2016 china z liu et al 2020 y y liu et al 2020 su et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 etc the tibetan plateau known as the roof of the world and the water tower of asia is an important river source and ecological source of china located in the interior of the asian continent as the source of many of asia s rivers it supports about 2 5 billion people in the downstream region and is related to the water resources security and management of neighboring countries yao et al 2019 z liu et al 2020 y y liu et al 2020 the tibetan plateau however is also a typical ecologically fragile area with ecological issues such as soil erosion grassland degradation desertification and geological hazards which make ecological restoration a challenge and constrain regional economic development furthermore the climate change vegetation change and population growth experienced in the tibetan plateau during the past decades have exacerbated the uncertainty of the water conservation function liu et al 2009 m yang et al 2019 d yang et al 2019 pang et al 2017 there are a series of studies on the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau during the past years which have made important contributions to integrated soil and water management and ecological construction yet there are still some gaps in the previous studies which can be summarized as two aspects firstly the study tends to focus on local areas such as the sanjiangyuan region pan et al 2015 yin et al 2016 wu et al 2016 cao et al 2020 the qilian mountains region niu et al 2018 hu et al 2016 and ecological reserves zhu et al 2021 there is a lack of evaluation of the water conservation function in the entire plateau secondly existing studies have not paid sufficient attention to the long term variation of water conservation function for example the study period is often less than 20 years and the time series is early however the long time series analysis is essential to identify the main influencing factors of water conservation function and to explore its response to the changing environment therefore it is necessary to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau under the background of climate change it is not only of great practical significance to the optimal allocation of water resources optimization of ecological barriers and coping with climate change risks but also provides a theoretical basis for understanding and application of the water conservation function in this study the invest model was used to simulate the annual water conservation function of the tibetan plateau from 1961 to 2017 and the spatial characteristics of the water conservation function were analyzed based on the multi year average results then the interannual variations of the water conservation function of the watershed were analyzed and the trends of water conservation function based on raster cells were analyzed by linear regression analysis and coefficient of variation finally the dominant influencing factors were analyzed and the possible contributors to the variation of water conservation function were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area the tibetan plateau is located in the interior of the asian continent with an average elevation of more than 4000 m a s l and an area of about 2 5 million km2 which is the highest and the most extensive plateau in the world cuo et al 2014 it has a complex geographical environment with a variety of landscapes such as mountains lakes rivers glaciers permafrost deserts and meadows the unique geographical environment has created a complex and diverse climate the southeastern of the plateau is relatively warm and humid while the northwestern is cold and arid with decreasing average annual precipitation from the southeast 1000 mm to the northwest 100 mm and the mean annual temperature is below 0 in most parts of the plateau kuang et al 2016 sun et al 2015 the tibetan plateau rich in glaciers permafrost and lakes is home to the richest reserves of solid water outside the arctic and antarctic yao et al 2019 and is also the most densely distributed lake region in asia with over 1500 lakes wan et al 2016 song et al 2014 as the water tower of asia it is the source of many major rivers in asia including the yangtze yellow river yarlung tsangpo salween and mekong rivers which feed billions of people in east and southeast asia zheng et al 2019 yao et al 2007 the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau is not only the basis of local ecosystem balance and sustainable development but also related to the total amount and allocation of water resources in surrounding countries and downstream areas the tibetan plateau however is extremely sensitive to climate change so the spatiotemporal variation of water conservation function in response to climate change is worth discussing the spatial distribution of major rivers lakes meteorological and hydrological stations on the tibetan plateau is shown in fig 1 the tibetan plateau is a vast spatial area with a complex and diverse geographical environment to more clearly analyze the various characteristics of the water conservation function in different regions this paper divides the plateau into 11 watersheds based on the dem information du et al 2017 the spatial distribution and basic information of the watersheds are shown in fig 1 and table 1 2 1 2 data the input data of the invest model include annual average precipitation annual average potential evapotranspiration soil depth vegetation available moisture content land use type watershed and subwatershed boundaries biophysical coefficient table and parameter z sharp et al 2018 the data needed for the calculation of water conservation are flow coefficient topographic index and soil saturation hydraulic conductivity in addition some other basic data such as runoff observation data temperature and ndvi were used to discuss the reasons for the change of water conservation function the data used in this study are summarized in table 2 2 2 methods 2 2 1 the invest water yield model based on the water balance principle parameters such as precipitation vegetation transpiration surface evaporation vegetation available water content and soil depth are used to simulate water yield which includes surface runoff soil water content litter retention and canopy interception the water yield module does not distinguish between surface water groundwater and baseflow and considers the difference in precipitation and actual evapotranspiration for each grid element as the water yield the calculation formulas are as follows 1 y x 1 a e t x p x p x 2 aet x p x 1 ω x r x 1 ω x r x 1 r x 3 ω x z a w c x p x 4 r x k c x e t 0 p x where y x represents the annual water yield of the grid cell mm p x represents the annual precipitation of the grid cell mm aet x represents the annual actual evapotranspiration of the grid cell mm the calculation is based on the budyko equation of water heat coupling equilibrium ω x represents the non physical parameter of soil properties under natural climatic conditions which is dimensionless r x is the budyko dryness index z is a seasonal constant with a value range of 1 30 awc x represents the available soil water content determined by soil texture and soil depth with a value range of 0 1 kc x represents the vegetation evapotranspiration coefficient e t 0 represents the potential evapotranspiration mm the penman monteith formula recommended by fao is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration over the tibetan plateau the calculation formula is as follows 5 e t 0 0 48 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e a e d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 g 0 38 t t 1 where r n is the net radiation mj m2 d δ is the slope of the tangent line of the saturation water pressure curve at

height of two meters m s g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d t 1 is the average temperature of the previous day 2 2 2 calculation of water conservation after the water yield is calculated using the invest model the water yield is corrected for topographic characteristics soil permeability and surface runoff flow coefficients to derive the water conservation volume yu et al 2012 07 j li et al 2021 m li et al 2021 which refers to the amount of water that infiltrates into the ground after precipitation subtracts evapotranspiration and surface runoff the calculation formulas are as follow 6 re t e n t i o n min 1 249 v min 1 0 9 t i 3 min 1 k s a t 300 y where retention represents water conservation volume mm v represents the velocity coefficient k sat represents the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity mm d ti represents the topographic index and can be calculated as follows 7 ti lg drainage a rea soil d epth percent s lope where drainage area represents the number of grids in the catchment area soil depth represents the soil depth mm percent slope represents the slope the water conservation coefficient is the ratio of water conservation to precipitation indicating the proportion of precipitation converted into water conservation which can reflect the influence of precipitation vegetation and surface characteristics on water conservation its value ranges from 0 to 1 and the higher values indicate that the ecosystem is more capable of intercepting and storing precipitation and has a higher water conservation capacity it can be calculated as follows 8 w c c retention p where w c c represents the water conservation coefficient re t e n t i o n represents the water conservation volume mm and p represents the precipitation mm 2 2 3 trend analysis the linear regression analysis which is usually used to obtain the trend variation of time series can reflect the spatial variation trend of the study area by calculating the interannual variation of each pixel liu et al 2014 the slope of the linear regression can comprehensively indicate the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and the least squares method is used to optimize the slope zhang and ye 2020 in this study it was used to reflect the variation trend of water conservation function during the study period when the slope is positive it indicates that the water conservation function trends to increase and larger values indicate a faster increase conversely when the slope is negative it indicates a decreasing trend of water conservation function the slope is calculated as follow 9 slope n i 1 n i w i i 1 n i i 1 n w i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where the slope represents the trend of the water conservation volume time series n represents the cumulative number of years in the study period i

coefficients corresponding to each land use type in the invest model are shown in table 3 the parameter z is an empirical constant representing regional precipitation distribution and hydrogeological characteristics in the range of 0 30 sharp et al 2018 cong et al 2020 the simulation accuracy of the invest model largely depends on the parameter z which is usually determined by comparing the simulated water yield with the observed runoff redhead et al 2016 m yang et al 2019 d yang et al 2019 we validated the parameter z based on the annual runoff observed at tangnaihai tuotuohe zhimenda xiangda nuxia and yingluoxia hydrological stations from 2000 to 2010 the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to measure the error between the simulated value and the observed value and the optimal z value was selected after many experiments when the z value is 6 the r is between 0 47 and 0 91 and the r of tangnaihai tuotuohe zhimenda and yingluoxia stations is above 0 7 the rmse of the simulation results was 0 43 10 26 billion m3 and the mae was 0 34 6 68 billion m3 the results show that the larger the value of the z parameter corresponds to the smaller simulated water yield and when the value of z is 6 the simulated water yield is closest to the observed runoff and the simulation effect of the model is the best fig 2 3 2 spatial patterns of annual average water yield and water conservation the average annual water yield from 1961 to 2017 was calculated based on the water yield module of the invest model and its spatial distribution pattern showed little changes during the study period the average annual water yield from 1961 to 2017 is shown in fig 3a showing a decreasing spatial distribution trend from southeast to northwest the average annual water yield varies significantly among different watersheds with the highest average annual water yield of 544 64 mm year in the mj watershed in the southeastern plateau and only 93 46 mm year in the in watershed in the northwestern plateau the high water yield areas are mainly located in the mr watershed 544 64 mm year dd watershed 519 26 mm year yl watershed 454 41 mm year and nj watershed 381 49 mm year fig 3a which are also the areas with the most abundant precipitation on the tibetan plateau with the mr watershed 964 07 mm year the dd watershed 898 58 mm year the yl watershed 818 37 mm year and the nj watershed 693 18 mm year fig 3c the median water yield areas are mainly located in the lower reaches of the yz watershed the middle and lower reaches of the js watershed the lc watershed the southern part of the yr watershed and the of watershed where the precipitation is relatively low the low value areas of water yield are located in the in watershed in the northwestern part of the tibetan plateau 93 46 mm year the ql watershed 157 64 mm year and the northern part of the yr watershed where precipitation is extremely low the spatial distribution of the average annual water conservation 1961 2017 varies greatly which is similar to the water yield showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest fig 3b the water conservation of the grid unit is between 0 and 1345 92 mm year and it varied significantly in different watersheds the high value areas of water conservation are mainly located in the dd watershed 224 02 mm year the mj watershed 225 93 mm year and the yl watershed 215 63 mm year which are also high value areas of water yield the low value areas of water conservation are mainly located in the northwestern and northern parts of the tibetan plateau such as the in watershed 40 3 mm year and the ql watershed 72 95 mm year the value of the water conservation coefficient on the tibetan plateau ranges from 0 06 to 0 80 with an average value of 0 22 fig 4 in the southeastern part of the plateau with abundant precipitation and high vegetation cover pang et al 2017 the water conservation coefficient is high with most areas exceeding 0 3 and some areas with water conservation coefficients as high as 0 8 while in the northwestern part of the plateau precipitation is scarce vegetation cover is low and desert is widespread in the qaidam basin the water conservation coefficient is extremely low indicating that the water conservation capacity of these areas is weak to identify the spatial distribution characteristics of water conservation important areas the mean annual water conservation of the past 57 years was classified by the natural breaks method in arcgis z liu et al 2020 y y liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the water conservation function was divided into 5 classes from low to high generally important area class i 0 53 mm slightly important area class ii 53 134 mm moderately important area class iii 134 235 mm highly important area class iv 235 401 mm and extremely important area class v 401 mm the area proportion and spatial distribution of water conservation importance grades are shown in fig 5 the area of generally and slightly important area of water conservation in the tibetan plateau is 39 and 32 respectively mainly distributed in the central and western parts the area of the extremely important area is 29 567 km2 accounting for only 1 which is scattered in the southeastern part of the plateau the proportion of the importance grade of water conservation in watersheds also showed great differences the highly and extremely important areas are mainly distributed in the dd watershed the mj watershed the yl watershed the nj watershed the lower reaches of the js watershed and the lower yz watershed these areas as important areas for water conservation function provide water for the production and living of most of the population in the plateau and are also the source of many rivers which should receive key attention and priority protection 3 3 trend analysis of water conservation the linear regression analysis method was used to analyze the spatial and temporal trends of water conservation function during 1961 2017 and the tendency was tested for significance fig 6a b c on the whole the proportion of grids with a slope greater than 0 is 75 32 among which the proportion of grids with a slope between 0 and 0 5 is 47 70 indicating a slightly increasing trend of water conservation function in most areas of the plateau these areas are mainly located in the inner plateau and the results of sun et al 2020 indicated that this region has become more humid since 1990 among them the slope of the of watershed in the south of the plateau is more than 3 which indicated that the water conservation of the region has increased obviously during the past 57 years however although most of the tibetan plateau showed an increasing trend in water conservation there are variations in the magnitude of the increase in different watersheds and even some watersheds showed a decreasing trend among them the watersheds where the proportion of grids with a slope greater than 0 are dd watershed in watershed js watershed of watershed ql watershed yl watershed and yz watershed indicating that the water conservation of these watersheds showed an increasing trend specifically the most significant increase was in of watershed and the largest proportion of the increasing area is in the ql watershed and in watershed fig 6 d the proportion of grids with a slope less than zero in the lc mj nj and yr watersheds exceeded 50 indicating that the water conservation in these regions was mainly decreasing among them the nj watershed decreased the most significantly and the mj watershed had the largest proportion of decreasing grid area it should be noted that there are extremely and highly important areas of water conservation in the mj and nj watershed so the downward trend of their water conservation should be of particular concern based on the results of the significance test and the slope calculated by the linear regression analysis method the tendency of change was divided into five classes extremely significant increase slope 0 p 0 01 relatively significant increase slope 0 0 01 p 0 05 no significant change p 0 05 relatively significant decrease slope 0 0 01 p 0 05 extremely significant decrease slope 0 p 0 01 table 4 fig 6 c the area of significant increasing accounted for 74 24 and the area of significant decreasing accounted for 25 01 which indicated that the trend of water conservation in the tibetan plateau was mainly increasing specifically the areas of significant decrease are mainly located in the southwestern margin the eastern and southeastern margins of the plateau such as the mj watershed the lower yl watershed the middle and lower reaches of the nj watershed and the lc watershed the cv values of the water conservation ranged from 0 to 7 55 with a mean value of 0 54 and 52 47 of the grids with cv values between 0 25 and 0 5 fig 6b the cv of the eastern plateau is relatively small which indicates that these areas have experienced little fluctuation over the past 57 years conversely the large values of the cv in the in watershed suggest to some extent that it may be the area with a greater degree of fluctuation it is inevitable however that the calculation of cv is influenced by the mean value of water conservation the northwestern part of the plateau especially the qaidam basin has extremely low mean values of water conservation which could result in high cv even for very small variations in water conservation fig 6e of attention are two regions with high values of cv in the eastern part of the plateau located near qinghai lake figs 6e 1 and downstream of the yz watershed figs 6e 2 respectively the fluctuations of water conservation in these regions are larger than those in the same climatic zone indicating that the fluctuations may be influenced by human activities and these regions are distributed with local economically developed cities xining lhasa and linzhi the average cv values of the 11 watersheds also showed some differences and the watersheds with larger cv values are in watershed 0 69 ql watershed 0 54 of watershed 0 46 and yz watershed 0 45 which may have experienced larger fluctuations during 1961 2017 fig 6f the magnitude of cv could indicate the degree of fluctuation of the water conservation in the past and areas with greater fluctuation are more likely to change in the future therefore when formulating future planning and protection policies emphasis should be placed on areas with a high degree of fluctuation 3 4 interannual variation of water conservation the interannual variation of the average annual water conservation of the tibetan plateau and the 11 watersheds during 1961 2017 is shown in fig 7 the average annual water conservation on the tibetan plateau was about 256 billion m3 1961 2017 with a significant increasing trend p 0 05 the slope of change is 4 694 108 m3 year with a maximum value of 322 317 billion m3 2008 and a minimum value of 205 685 billion m3 1972 the average annual water conservation of the watersheds varied widely with the high watershed being the in watershed 47 802 billion m3 and the yz watershed 42 534 billion m3 and the lowest being the mj watershed 5 892 billion m3 the interannual variation tendency of water conservation of watersheds was different the watersheds with significant increasing trends were the in watershed p 0 01 js watershed p 0 05 of watershed p 0 01 and ql watershed p 0 01 while the nj watershed showed a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 the interannual trends of water conservation in other watersheds did not pass the significance test of 0 05 indicating that the average annual water conservation in these regions has remained more or less constant over the past 57 years the in watershed and js watershed showed the most obvious rising trend with slopes of 3 984 108 m3 year and 0 77 108 m3 year respectively and the nj watershed showed a decreasing trend at a rate of 0 7953 108 m3 year which was similar to the results of the linear regression analysis based on the grid cells the variation of the average annual water conservation coefficient of the tibetan plateau and 11 watersheds during 1961 2017 is shown in fig 8 the average annual water conservation coefficient of the tibetan plateau was 0 22 1961 2017 with insignificant interannual variation trends and the maximum value of the water conservation coefficient was 0 24 2008 and the minimum value was 0 20 1972 the average annual water conservation coefficient varied widely among watersheds with the highest values in the nj watershed 0 28 lc watershed 0 27 and yl watershed 0 27 and the lowest values in the in watershed 0 15 and ql watershed 0 17 in terms of interannual variation trends four watersheds showed significant increasing or decreasing trends among them the in watershed p 0 01 and ql watershed p 0 05 showed a significant increasing trend with slopes of 4 23 10 4 and 3 54 10 4 respectively indicating that the water conservation function of these two watersheds gradually increased on the contrary the water conservation coefficients of the nj watershed p 0 01 and mj watershed p 0 05 showed a decreasing trend with rates of 4 48 10 4 and 2 96 10 4 per year respectively indicating to some extent that the water conservation function of these two watersheds was gradually weakening the watershed scale analysis not only reflects the differences in water conservation of watersheds but also identifies watersheds with the significantly changing trend providing some theoretical guidance for watershed scale water management based on the water conservation volume analysis we also discussed the interannual variation of the watershed scale water conservation coefficient compared with the water conservation volume the water conservation coefficients could more comprehensively reflect the differences in the water conservation function of watersheds on the one hand the statistics of water conservation volume of watersheds are affected by watershed areas and on the other hand it is more sensitive to precipitation it is noteworthy that although the average annual water conservation in js and of watershed showed a significant increasing trend their water conservation coefficients did not show a significant trend this implied that the increase of water conservation in these regions was mainly influenced by precipitation while there was no significant trend in the capacity of the ecosystem to capture water in addition although there was no significant trend in the average annual water conservation of the mj watershed its water conservation coefficient showed a significant decreasing trend which indicated that the ability of the watershed to retain and store precipitation has weakened and the water conservation capacity of the ecosystem has decreased 4 discussions 4 1 causes of water yield and water conservation water yield is closely related to climatic factors such as precipitation and actual evapotranspiration pessacg et al 2015 yang et al 2019 and the results of this study also support that the spatial distribution pattern of water yield is influenced by precipitation and actual evapotranspiration fig 3 precipitation on the tibetan plateau decreased from southeast to northwest tong et al 2014 and the northern and northwestern regions of the plateau have extremely low precipitation with annual average precipitation mostly below 100 mm tan et al 2020 yang et al 2011 and these regions are also the low value areas of water yield calculated in this study in addition to the water yield water conservation is also influenced by the topographic index and soil properties eq 6 the southeastern regions of the tibetan plateau have high values of water conservation and these regions are areas with high values of water yield as well as relatively flat topography and high vegetation cover during precipitation events the flat topography slows down the runoff velocity which in turn loosens the soil to increase precipitation infiltration and enhance the water conservation capacity 4 2 possible factors influencing the fluctuation of water conservation water conservation function is influenced by a variety of natural factors and human activities precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and other land surface processes directly affect the amount of water that can be conserved by ecosystems while vegetation cover topography soil properties and human activities indirectly affect water conservation by influencing ecohydrological processes such as runoff and infiltration to identify the main influencing factors of water conservation on the tibetan plateau the correlation of meteorological factors topography vegetation cover and soil properties with water conservation was analyzed fig 9 precipitation and ndvi showed a high positive correlation with water conservation while potential evapotranspiration and soil saturation hydraulic conductivity were negatively correlated with water conservation the spatial distribution pattern of water conservation on the tibetan plateau is similar to precipitation fig 3 b c indicating to some extent that precipitation is the principal influencing factor the interannual trends of annual average water conservation precipitation potential evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration and ndvi on the tibetan plateau are shown in fig 10 the average annual precipitation is 446 84 mm with an overall increasing trend at a rate of 0 63 mm a the average annual potential evapotranspiration is 647 42 mm showing a weak increasing trend at a rate of 0 29 mm a the average annual actual evapotranspiration is 239 74 mm showing a weak increasing trend the proportion of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation is 53 65 which indicates that about half of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere in the form of actual evapotranspiration the mean annual temperature is below 0 c in most areas of the tibetan plateau and the mean annual temperature shows a significantly increasing trend at a rate of 0 37 c 10a 1961 2017 the mean annual ndvi value was 0 36 1982 2017 showing an increasing trend at a rate of 9 10 4 a which indicates an increasing trend of vegetation cover in the tibetan plateau the average annual water conservation on the tibetan plateau is 99 24 mm accounting for 22 20 of precipitation which indicates that about 22 of precipitation is converted into water conservation the annual water conservation showed a weak increasing trend at a rate of 0 18 mm a with a minimum value of 65 03 mm 1967 and a maximum value of 145 67 mm 2005 the same years as the maximum and minimum values of precipitation occurred and its interannual trend was similar to precipitation fig 10 f e although there was an overall trend of increasing precipitation on the plateau the spatial pattern of precipitation change is variable with some areas in the east and southeast showing a decreasing trend with some areas becoming wetter and some becoming drier gao et al 2015 kuang et al 2016 chen et al 2013 tong et al 2014 which may be the reason for the decrease of water conservation in some watersheds in general the increase of precipitation and ndvi may be the main reason for the overall increase in the water conservation function of the plateau 4 3 uncertainty of water conservation there are certain uncertainties in the analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of water conservation on the tibetan plateau in this study which can be summarized in three main aspects the limitations of the invest model the accuracy of the model input data and the discussion of the driving factors firstly the invest model calculates water yield based on the water balance principle assuming that all water excluding evaporation losses reaches the watershed outlet sharp et al 2018 on the one hand the model simulates hydrological processes in an oversimplified manner ignoring the interaction between surface water and groundwater and on the other hand the model ignores the influence of human activities such as artificial water extraction it is worth noting that the water yield value of the lake area calculated by the invest model is zero which results in the water conservation of the lake area also being zero however this is not consistent with the connotation of the water conservation function which makes the simulation of water conservation in the tibetan plateau where lakes are widely distributed inaccurate especially in the tibetan plateau where permafrost is widespread mu et al 2020 the invest model cannot simulate the effects of freeze thaw processes on water conservation secondly there is a scarcity of high resolution representative data on the tibetan plateau for long time series for example meteorological observation data face the issues of scarce meteorological stations and uneven spatial distribution wang et al 2018 li et al 2020 and the time series of remote sensing data is too short therefore this paper can only carry out relevant research based on limited data and information thirdly the water conservation function is influenced by a combination of factors and there are certain shortcomings in the analysis of why water conservation has changed in this paper due to data constraints we did not deeply analyze the effects of soil properties vegetation communities and human activities on water conservation function and the effects of glacial meltwater were ignored moreover the tibetan plateau is vast and environmentally complex and the reasons for the changes in water conservation in different regions were not sufficiently explored 5 conclusions as the most typical ecologically fragile area on earth and the origin of numerous rivers in asia the tibetan plateau plays an important role in the optimization of ecological barriers and the allocation and management of water resources in asia additionally the tibetan plateau is one of the regions highly sensitive to climate change and its response to climate change is noteworthy however there is a lack of research on the water conservation function of the entire tibetan plateau and the spatial and temporal evolution of the water conservation function in the context of climate change is still unclear this paper quantitatively simulated the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau during 1961 2017 based on the invest model analyzed the spatiotemporal variation patterns of the water conservation function and then discussed the possible factors affecting its fluctuations the main results are as follows first of all the mean annual water conservation volume in the tibetan plateau is about 256 billion m3 showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest the important areas for water conservation function are mainly located in the southeastern where need sufficient attention and priority protection second the interannual variation in water conservation shows an increasing trend p 0 05 while the water conservation coefficient doesn t show a significant trend and the spatial pattern of slope and cv is variable specifically the lower reaches of the yz watershed show a declining trend and a high degree of fluctuation which we recommend prioritizing in ecological restoration and water resource management third precipitation and ndvi are the main influencing factors of water conservation and the increase in precipitation and ndvi may be the reasons for the increase of water conservation on the tibetan plateau during the past 57 years since the geography of the tibetan plateau is complex and the change in water conservation function is the result of multivariate integrated effects the causes of the changes in water conservation function will be further discussed in our next work in addition although the widely used invest model can simulate the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau it does not sufficiently consider lake permafrost and glacier which will be the focus of our future model improvement efforts credit authorship

7947,study region the tibetan plateau known as the water tower of asia is the source of many rivers in asia and its water conservation function is the basis for the optimization of the ecological barrier and the water security of asian countries yet the tibetan plateau is also an ecologically fragile area facing numerous ecological issues and climate change risks so the response of the water conservation function to the changing environment has received much attention study focus this study systematically analyzed the variation trend of the water conservation function during 1961 2017 using the invest model simulations linear regression analysis and coefficients of variation new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the average annual water conservation of the tibetan plateau is about 256 billion m3 showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and the important areas scatter in the southeastern of the plateau such as the lower yarlung zangbo watershed the nujiang watershed and the yalong watershed the water conservation volume of the tibetan plateau was on the rise p 0 05 and there was spatial variability in the trends and coefficients of variation the increase of precipitation and ndvi leads to the overall increase in the water conservation of the tibetan plateau our findings could be used to fill the spatiotemporal variation gaps in

and indirect benefits that people derive from nature which are the basic guarantee of human production and life and are closely related to human well being and sustainable development daily et al 1997 wallace et al 2007 as water is an important link between ecosystem processes and human activities water conservation function is an important ecological service function that plays a central role among various ecological services at the same time water is one of the most important natural resources for human survival development and production however the deterioration of the water environment and climate change have caused increasingly serious water resources problems and the increase in water demand from population growth and socio economic development has further exacerbated water scarcity tian et al 2020 water related ecosystem services have gained more attention and the study of water conservation function is becoming a common focus in the fields of ecology and hydrology brauman et al 2007 wen et al 2020 water conservation function refers to the process and ability of an ecosystem to retain water by intercepting infiltrating and storing precipitation in a certain spatial and temporal scale defined as annual scale in this paper through the forest canopy litter soil lakes and reservoirs etc which not only meets the ecosystem s demand for water but also provides water resources to the external and downstream regions hu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the main forms of the water conservation function include water supply runoff regulation flood storage water purification soil conservation and temperature regulation xu et al 2017 it is a complex and comprehensive concept which is the result of the combined effect of the ecosystem and hydrological processes under certain climatic conditions and is therefore influenced by various factors such as ecosystem type surface characteristics climatic conditions and human activities zhang et al 2010 šatalová and kenderessy 2017 it has been shown that climate change land use and vegetation cover are the main influencing factors of water conservation function leh et al 2013 hoyer et al 2014 climate change especially precipitation and evapotranspiration not only determines the amount of water that ecosystems can store but also affects the biophysical processes of ecosystems and directly influences the water conservation function chiang et al 2014 bai et al 2019 hu et al 2021 changes in land use could affect ecosystem patterns and local ecohydrological processes resulting in indirect impacts in some regions land use and vegetation cover are the dominant factors influencing the water conservation function j li et al 2021 m li et al 2021 wen et al 2020 wen et al 2019 the main influencing factors however are geographically diverse and the study of the spatiotemporal variation of the water conservation function under changing environments e g climate change vegetation cover change and land use change is also the focus of attention models which play an important role in the evaluation of water related ecological services can accurately simulate complex hydrological processes and quantify water related ecological services at different spatial and temporal scales such as soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 baker et al 2013 terrain lab chen et al 2005 integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest sharp et al 2018 benra et al 2021 artificial intelligence for ecosystem services aries villa et al 2014 etc among them the invest model is a visualization tool capable of quantitatively assessing ecosystem services under different scenarios compared to hydrological models the invest model enables quantitative assessment of water related ecosystem services based on fewer input data and requires less empirical knowledge moreover the invest model can assess multiple ecosystem services such as water yield water quality soil retention carbon storage biodiversity etc and integrates and weighs multiple ecosystem services to provide a basis for decision making nelson et al 2009 goldstein et al 2012 the water yield module which is based on the water balance principle can simulate annual water yield on a regional scale and express the results in the form of maps and has been widely used worldwide e g in the united states bai et al 2019 hamel et al 2015 africa leh et al 2013 europe redhead et al 2016 china z liu et al 2020 y y liu et al 2020 su et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 etc the tibetan plateau known as the roof of the world and the water tower of asia is an important river source and ecological source of china located in the interior of the asian continent as the source of many of asia s rivers it supports about 2 5 billion people in the downstream region and is related to the water resources security and management of neighboring countries yao et al 2019 z liu et al 2020 y y liu et al 2020 the tibetan plateau however is also a typical ecologically fragile area with ecological issues such as soil erosion grassland degradation desertification and geological hazards which make ecological restoration a challenge and constrain regional economic development furthermore the climate change vegetation change and population growth experienced in the tibetan plateau during the past decades have exacerbated the uncertainty of the water conservation function liu et al 2009 m yang et al 2019 d yang et al 2019 pang et al 2017 there are a series of studies on the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau during the past years which have made important contributions to integrated soil and water management and ecological construction yet there are still some gaps in the previous studies which can be summarized as two aspects firstly the study tends to focus on local areas such as the sanjiangyuan region pan et al 2015 yin et al 2016 wu et al 2016 cao et al 2020 the qilian mountains region niu et al 2018 hu et al 2016 and ecological reserves zhu et al 2021 there is a lack of evaluation of the water conservation function in the entire plateau secondly existing studies have not paid sufficient attention to the long term variation of water conservation function for example the study period is often less than 20 years and the time series is early however the long time series analysis is essential to identify the main influencing factors of water conservation function and to explore its response to the changing environment therefore it is necessary to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau under the background of climate change it is not only of great practical significance to the optimal allocation of water resources optimization of ecological barriers and coping with climate change risks but also provides a theoretical basis for understanding and application of the water conservation function in this study the invest model was used to simulate the annual water conservation function of the tibetan plateau from 1961 to 2017 and the spatial characteristics of the water conservation function were analyzed based on the multi year average results then the interannual variations of the water conservation function of the watershed were analyzed and the trends of water conservation function based on raster cells were analyzed by linear regression analysis and coefficient of variation finally the dominant influencing factors were analyzed and the possible contributors to the variation of water conservation function were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area the tibetan plateau is located in the interior of the asian continent with an average elevation of more than 4000 m a s l and an area of about 2 5 million km2 which is the highest and the most extensive plateau in the world cuo et al 2014 it has a complex geographical environment with a variety of landscapes such as mountains lakes rivers glaciers permafrost deserts and meadows the unique geographical environment has created a complex and diverse climate the southeastern of the plateau is relatively warm and humid while the northwestern is cold and arid with decreasing average annual precipitation from the southeast 1000 mm to the northwest 100 mm and the mean annual temperature is below 0 in most parts of the plateau kuang et al 2016 sun et al 2015 the tibetan plateau rich in glaciers permafrost and lakes is home to the richest reserves of solid water outside the arctic and antarctic yao et al 2019 and is also the most densely distributed lake region in asia with over 1500 lakes wan et al 2016 song et al 2014 as the water tower of asia it is the source of many major rivers in asia including the yangtze yellow river yarlung tsangpo salween and mekong rivers which feed billions of people in east and southeast asia zheng et al 2019 yao et al 2007 the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau is not only the basis of local ecosystem balance and sustainable development but also related to the total amount and allocation of water resources in surrounding countries and downstream areas the tibetan plateau however is extremely sensitive to climate change so the spatiotemporal variation of water conservation function in response to climate change is worth discussing the spatial distribution of major rivers lakes meteorological and hydrological stations on the tibetan plateau is shown in fig 1 the tibetan plateau is a vast spatial area with a complex and diverse geographical environment to more clearly analyze the various characteristics of the water conservation function in different regions this paper divides the plateau into 11 watersheds based on the dem information du et al 2017 the spatial distribution and basic information of the watersheds are shown in fig 1 and table 1 2 1 2 data the input data of the invest model

regression analysis which is usually used to obtain the trend variation of time series can reflect the spatial variation trend of the study area by calculating the interannual variation of each pixel liu et al 2014 the slope of the linear regression can comprehensively indicate the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and the least squares method is used to optimize the slope zhang and ye 2020 in this study it was used to reflect the variation trend of water conservation function during the study period when the slope is positive it indicates that the water conservation function trends to increase and larger values indicate a faster increase conversely when the slope is negative it indicates a decreasing trend of water conservation function the slope is calculated as follow 9 slope n i

coefficients corresponding to each land use type in the invest model are shown in table 3 the parameter z is an empirical constant representing regional precipitation distribution and hydrogeological characteristics in the range of 0 30 sharp et al 2018 cong et al 2020 the simulation accuracy of the invest model largely depends on the parameter z which is usually determined by comparing the simulated water yield with the observed runoff redhead et al 2016 m yang et al 2019 d yang et al 2019 we validated the parameter z based on the annual runoff observed at tangnaihai tuotuohe zhimenda xiangda nuxia and yingluoxia hydrological stations from 2000 to 2010 the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to measure the error between the simulated value and the observed value and the optimal z value was selected after many experiments when the z value is 6 the r is between 0 47 and 0 91 and the r of tangnaihai tuotuohe zhimenda and yingluoxia stations is above 0 7 the rmse of the simulation results was 0 43 10 26 billion m3 and the mae was 0 34 6 68 billion m3 the results show that the larger the value of the z parameter corresponds to the smaller simulated water yield and when the value of z is 6 the simulated water yield is closest to the observed runoff and the simulation effect of the model is the best fig 2 3 2 spatial patterns of annual average water yield and water conservation the average annual water yield from 1961 to 2017 was calculated based on the water yield module of the invest model and its spatial distribution pattern showed little changes during the study period the average annual water yield from 1961 to 2017 is shown in fig 3a showing a decreasing spatial distribution trend from southeast to northwest the average annual water yield varies significantly among different watersheds with the highest average annual water yield of 544 64 mm year in the mj watershed in the southeastern plateau and only 93 46 mm year in the in watershed in the northwestern plateau the high water yield areas are mainly located in the mr watershed 544 64 mm year dd watershed 519 26 mm year yl watershed 454 41 mm year and nj watershed 381 49 mm year fig 3a which are also the areas with the most abundant precipitation on the tibetan plateau with the mr watershed 964 07 mm year the dd watershed 898 58 mm year the yl watershed 818 37 mm year and the nj watershed 693 18 mm year fig 3c the median water yield areas are mainly located in the lower reaches of the yz watershed the middle and lower reaches of the js watershed the lc watershed the southern part of the yr watershed and the of watershed where the precipitation is relatively low the low value areas of water yield are located in the in watershed in the northwestern part of the tibetan plateau 93 46 mm year the ql watershed 157 64 mm year and the northern part of the yr watershed where precipitation is extremely low the spatial distribution of the average annual water conservation 1961 2017 varies greatly which is similar to the water yield showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest fig 3b the water conservation of the grid unit is between 0 and 1345 92 mm year and it varied significantly in different watersheds the high value areas of water conservation are mainly located in the dd watershed 224 02 mm year the mj watershed 225 93 mm year and the yl watershed 215 63 mm year which are also high value areas of water yield the low value areas of water conservation are mainly located in the northwestern and northern parts of the tibetan plateau such as the in watershed 40 3 mm year and the ql watershed 72 95 mm year the value of the water conservation coefficient on the tibetan plateau ranges from 0 06 to 0 80 with an average value of 0 22 fig 4 in the southeastern part of the plateau with abundant precipitation and high vegetation cover pang et al 2017 the water conservation coefficient is high with most areas exceeding 0 3 and some areas with water conservation coefficients as high as 0 8 while in the northwestern part of the plateau precipitation is scarce vegetation cover is low and desert is widespread in the qaidam basin the water conservation coefficient is extremely low indicating that the water conservation capacity of these areas is weak to identify the spatial distribution characteristics of water conservation important areas the mean annual water conservation of the past 57 years was classified by the natural breaks method in arcgis z liu et al 2020 y y liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the water conservation function was divided into 5 classes from low to high generally important area class i 0 53 mm slightly important area class ii 53 134 mm moderately important area class iii 134 235 mm highly important area class iv 235 401 mm and extremely important area class v 401 mm the area proportion and spatial distribution of water conservation importance grades are shown in fig 5 the area of generally and slightly important area of water conservation in the tibetan plateau is 39 and 32 respectively mainly distributed in the central and western parts the area of the extremely important area is 29 567 km2 accounting for only 1 which is scattered in the southeastern part of the plateau the proportion of the importance grade of water conservation in watersheds also showed great differences the highly and extremely important areas are mainly distributed in the dd watershed the mj watershed the yl watershed the nj watershed the lower reaches of the js watershed and the lower yz watershed these areas as important areas for water conservation function provide water for the production and living of most of the population in the plateau and are also the source of many rivers which should receive key attention and priority protection 3 3 trend analysis of water conservation the linear regression analysis method was used to analyze the spatial and temporal trends of water conservation function during 1961 2017 and the tendency was tested for significance fig 6a b c on the whole the proportion of grids with a slope greater than 0 is 75 32 among which the proportion of grids with a slope between 0 and 0 5 is 47 70 indicating a slightly increasing trend of water conservation function in most areas of the plateau these areas are mainly located in the inner plateau and the results of sun et al 2020 indicated that this region has become more humid since 1990 among them the slope of the of watershed in the south of the plateau is more than 3 which indicated that the water conservation of the region has increased obviously during the past 57 years however although most of the tibetan plateau showed an increasing trend in water conservation there are variations in the magnitude of the increase in different watersheds and even some watersheds showed a decreasing trend among them the watersheds where the proportion of grids with a slope greater than 0 are dd watershed in watershed js watershed of watershed ql watershed yl watershed and yz watershed indicating that the water conservation of these watersheds showed an increasing trend specifically the most significant increase was in of watershed and the largest proportion of the increasing area is in the ql watershed and in watershed fig 6 d the proportion of grids with a slope less than zero in the lc mj nj and yr watersheds exceeded 50 indicating that the water conservation in these regions was mainly decreasing among them the nj watershed decreased the most significantly and the mj watershed had the largest proportion of decreasing grid area it should be noted that there are extremely and highly important areas of water conservation in the mj and nj watershed so the downward trend of their water conservation should be of particular concern based on the results of the significance test and the slope calculated by the linear regression analysis method the tendency of change was divided into five classes extremely significant increase slope 0 p 0 01 relatively significant increase slope 0 0 01 p 0 05 no significant change p 0 05 relatively significant decrease slope 0 0 01 p 0 05 extremely significant decrease slope 0 p 0 01 table 4 fig 6 c the area of significant increasing accounted for 74 24 and the area of significant decreasing accounted for 25 01 which indicated that the trend of water conservation in the tibetan plateau was mainly increasing specifically the areas of significant decrease are mainly located in the southwestern margin the eastern and southeastern margins of the plateau such as the mj watershed the lower yl watershed the middle and lower reaches of the nj watershed and the lc watershed the cv values of the water conservation ranged from 0 to 7 55 with a mean value of 0 54 and 52 47 of the grids with cv values between 0 25 and 0 5 fig 6b the cv of the eastern plateau is relatively small which indicates that these areas have experienced little fluctuation over the past 57 years conversely the large values of the cv in the in watershed suggest to some extent that it may be the area with a greater degree of fluctuation it is inevitable however that the calculation of cv is influenced by the mean value of water conservation the northwestern part of the plateau especially the qaidam basin has extremely low mean values of water conservation which could result in high cv even for very small variations in water conservation fig 6e of attention are two regions with high values of cv in the eastern part of the plateau located near qinghai lake figs 6e 1 and downstream of the yz watershed figs 6e 2 respectively the fluctuations of water conservation in these regions are larger than those in the same climatic zone indicating that the fluctuations may be influenced by human activities and these regions are distributed with local economically developed cities xining lhasa and linzhi the average cv values of the 11 watersheds also showed some differences and the watersheds with larger cv values are in watershed 0 69 ql watershed 0 54 of watershed 0 46 and yz watershed 0 45 which may have experienced larger fluctuations during 1961 2017 fig 6f the magnitude of cv could indicate the degree of fluctuation of the water conservation in the past and areas with greater fluctuation are more likely to change in the future therefore when formulating future planning and protection policies emphasis should be placed on areas with a high degree of fluctuation 3 4 interannual variation of water conservation the interannual variation of the average annual water conservation of the tibetan plateau and the 11 watersheds during 1961 2017 is shown in fig 7 the average annual water conservation on the tibetan plateau was about 256 billion m3 1961 2017 with a significant increasing trend p 0 05 the slope of change is 4 694 108 m3 year with a maximum value of 322 317 billion m3 2008 and a minimum value of 205 685 billion m3 1972 the average annual water conservation of the watersheds varied widely with the high watershed being the in watershed 47 802 billion m3 and the yz watershed 42 534 billion m3 and the lowest being the mj watershed 5 892 billion m3 the interannual variation tendency of water conservation of watersheds was different the watersheds with significant increasing trends were the in watershed p 0 01 js watershed p 0 05 of watershed p 0 01 and ql watershed p 0 01 while the nj watershed showed a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 the interannual trends of water conservation in other watersheds did not pass the significance test of 0 05 indicating that the average annual water conservation in these regions has remained more or less constant over the past 57 years the in watershed and js watershed showed the most obvious rising trend with slopes of 3 984 108 m3 year and 0 77 108 m3 year respectively and the nj watershed showed a decreasing trend at a rate of 0 7953 108 m3 year which was similar to the results of the linear regression analysis based on the grid cells the variation of the average annual water conservation coefficient of the tibetan plateau and 11 watersheds during 1961 2017 is shown in fig 8 the average annual water conservation coefficient of the tibetan plateau was 0 22 1961 2017 with insignificant interannual variation trends and the maximum value of the water conservation coefficient was 0 24 2008 and the minimum value was 0 20 1972 the average annual water conservation coefficient varied widely among watersheds with the highest values in the nj watershed 0 28 lc watershed 0 27 and yl watershed 0 27 and the lowest values in the in watershed 0 15 and ql watershed 0 17 in terms of interannual variation trends four watersheds showed significant increasing or decreasing trends among them the in watershed p 0 01 and ql watershed p 0 05 showed a significant increasing trend with slopes of 4 23 10 4 and 3 54 10 4 respectively indicating that the water conservation function of these two watersheds gradually increased on the contrary the water conservation coefficients of the nj watershed p 0 01 and mj watershed p 0 05 showed a decreasing trend with rates of 4 48 10 4 and 2 96 10 4 per year respectively indicating to some extent that the water conservation function of these two watersheds was gradually weakening the watershed scale analysis not only reflects the differences in water conservation of watersheds but also identifies watersheds with the significantly changing trend providing some theoretical guidance for watershed scale water management based on the water conservation volume analysis we also discussed the interannual variation of the watershed scale water conservation coefficient compared with the water conservation volume the water conservation coefficients could more comprehensively reflect the differences in the water conservation function of watersheds on the one hand the statistics of water conservation volume of watersheds are affected by watershed areas and on the other hand it is more sensitive to precipitation it is noteworthy that although the average annual water conservation in js and of watershed showed a significant increasing trend their water conservation coefficients did not show a significant trend this implied that the increase of water conservation in these regions was mainly influenced by precipitation while there was no significant trend in the capacity of the ecosystem to capture water in addition although there was no significant trend in the average annual water conservation of the mj watershed its water conservation coefficient showed a significant decreasing trend which indicated that the ability of the watershed to retain and store precipitation has weakened and the water conservation capacity of the ecosystem has decreased 4 discussions 4 1 causes of water yield and water conservation water yield is closely related to climatic factors such as precipitation and actual evapotranspiration pessacg et al 2015 yang et al 2019 and the results of this study also support that the spatial distribution pattern of water yield is influenced by precipitation and actual evapotranspiration fig 3 precipitation on the tibetan plateau decreased from southeast to northwest tong et al 2014 and the northern and northwestern regions of the plateau have extremely low precipitation with annual average precipitation mostly below 100 mm tan et al 2020 yang et al 2011 and these regions are also the low value areas of water yield calculated in this study in addition to the water yield water conservation is also influenced by the topographic index and soil properties eq 6 the southeastern regions of the tibetan plateau have high values of water conservation and these regions are areas with high values of water yield as well as relatively flat topography and high vegetation cover during precipitation events the flat topography slows down the runoff velocity which in turn loosens the soil to increase precipitation infiltration and enhance the water conservation capacity 4 2 possible factors influencing the fluctuation of water conservation water conservation function is influenced by a variety of natural factors and human activities precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and other land surface processes directly affect the amount of water that can be conserved by ecosystems while vegetation cover topography soil properties and human activities indirectly affect water conservation by influencing ecohydrological processes such as runoff and infiltration to identify the main influencing factors of water conservation on the tibetan plateau the correlation of meteorological factors topography vegetation cover and soil properties with water conservation was analyzed fig 9 precipitation and ndvi showed a high positive correlation with water conservation while potential evapotranspiration and soil saturation hydraulic conductivity were negatively correlated with water conservation the spatial distribution pattern of water conservation on the tibetan plateau is similar to precipitation fig 3 b c indicating to some extent that precipitation is the principal influencing factor the interannual trends of annual average water conservation precipitation potential evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration and ndvi on the tibetan plateau are shown in fig 10 the average annual precipitation is 446 84 mm with an overall increasing trend at a rate of 0 63 mm a the average annual potential evapotranspiration is 647 42 mm showing a weak increasing trend at a rate of 0 29 mm a the average annual actual evapotranspiration is 239 74 mm showing a weak increasing trend the proportion of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation is 53 65 which indicates that about half of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere in the form of actual evapotranspiration the mean annual temperature is below 0 c in most areas of the tibetan plateau and the mean annual temperature shows a significantly increasing trend at a rate of 0 37 c 10a 1961 2017 the mean annual ndvi value was 0 36 1982 2017 showing an increasing trend at a rate of 9 10 4 a which indicates an increasing trend of vegetation cover in the tibetan plateau the average annual water conservation on the tibetan plateau is 99 24 mm accounting for 22 20 of precipitation which indicates that about 22 of precipitation is converted into water conservation the annual water conservation showed a weak increasing trend at a rate of 0 18 mm a with a minimum value of 65 03 mm 1967 and a maximum value of 145 67 mm 2005 the same years as the maximum and minimum values of precipitation occurred and its interannual trend was similar to precipitation fig 10 f e although there was an overall trend of increasing precipitation on the plateau the spatial pattern of precipitation change is variable with some areas in the east and southeast showing a decreasing trend with some areas becoming wetter and some becoming drier gao et al 2015 kuang et al 2016 chen et al 2013 tong et al 2014 which may be the reason for the decrease of water conservation in some watersheds in general the increase of precipitation and ndvi may be the main reason for the overall increase in the water conservation function of the plateau 4 3 uncertainty of water conservation there are certain uncertainties in the analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of water conservation on the tibetan plateau in this study which can be summarized in three main aspects the limitations of the invest model the accuracy of the model input data and the discussion of the driving factors firstly the invest model calculates water yield based on the water balance principle assuming that all water excluding evaporation losses reaches the watershed outlet sharp et al 2018 on the one hand the model simulates hydrological processes in an oversimplified manner ignoring the interaction between surface water and groundwater and on the other hand the model ignores the influence of human activities such as artificial water extraction it is worth noting that the water yield value of the lake area calculated by the invest model is zero which results in the water conservation of the lake area also being zero however this is not consistent with the connotation of the water conservation function which makes the simulation of water conservation in the tibetan plateau where lakes are widely distributed inaccurate especially in the tibetan plateau where permafrost is widespread mu et al 2020 the invest model cannot simulate the effects of freeze thaw processes on water conservation secondly there is a scarcity of high resolution representative data on the tibetan plateau for long time series for example meteorological observation data face the issues of scarce meteorological stations and uneven spatial distribution wang et al 2018 li et al 2020 and the time series of remote sensing data is too short therefore this paper can only carry out relevant research based on limited data and information thirdly the water conservation function is influenced by a combination of factors and there are certain shortcomings in the analysis of why water conservation has changed in this paper due to data constraints we did not deeply analyze the effects of soil properties vegetation communities and human activities on water conservation function and the effects of glacial meltwater were ignored moreover the tibetan plateau is vast and environmentally complex and the reasons for the changes in water conservation in different regions were not sufficiently explored 5 conclusions as the most typical ecologically fragile area on earth and the origin of numerous rivers in asia the tibetan plateau plays an important role in the optimization of ecological barriers and the allocation and management of water resources in asia additionally the tibetan plateau is one of the regions highly sensitive to climate change and its response to climate change is noteworthy however there is a lack of research on the water conservation function of the entire tibetan plateau and the spatial and temporal evolution of the water conservation function in the context of climate change is still unclear this paper quantitatively simulated the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau during 1961 2017 based on the invest model analyzed the spatiotemporal variation patterns of the water conservation function and then discussed the possible factors affecting its fluctuations the main results are as follows first of all the mean annual water conservation volume in the tibetan plateau is about 256 billion m3 showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest the important areas for water conservation function are mainly located in the southeastern where need sufficient attention and priority protection second the interannual variation in water conservation shows an increasing trend p 0 05 while the water conservation coefficient doesn t show a significant trend and the spatial pattern of slope and cv is variable specifically the lower reaches of the yz watershed show a declining trend and a high degree of fluctuation which we recommend prioritizing in ecological restoration and water resource management third precipitation and ndvi are the main influencing factors of water conservation and the increase in precipitation and ndvi may be the reasons for the increase of water conservation on the tibetan plateau during the past 57 years since the geography of the tibetan plateau is complex and the change in water conservation function is the result of multivariate integrated effects the causes of the changes in water conservation function will be further discussed in our next work in addition although the widely used invest model can simulate the water conservation function of the tibetan plateau it does not sufficiently consider lake permafrost and glacier which will be the focus of our future model improvement efforts credit authorship

7948,study region mediterranean catchment in algeria study focus a procedure to characterise the flow regimes of non perennial rivers in regions with limited data availability was defined the specific aims were to adapt the soil and water assessment tool swat for simulating time series of daily streamflow in a basin with a temporary river network and to characterise flow regime in a number of the river reaches an inexpensive streamflow monitoring program was implemented to collect a basic dataset to calibrate the hydrological model regional databases surveys and images from google earth were used to integrate the available data to set up the model flow regime was characterised by using a number of metrics describing the aquatic phases as flow pool and dry permanence new hydrological insights for the region this study provides a contribution to the unsolved question of the management of temporary rivers under the mediterranean climate the nil wadi is characterised by perennial and temporary flow regimes the analysed reaches were classified as intermittent pool and intermittent dry they showed alternate fluent af aquatic phase upstream and in the middle course and a gradient from af to fluent stagnant phases downstream the as oligorheic low flow or pools connected and arheic pools disconnected mainly occurred from may to october dry condition that includes the ass hyporheic and edaphic mainly occurred in summer graphical abstract ga1 keywords temporary river flow regime data scarcity swat model river classification mediterranean region 1 introduction the streamflow regime plays an important role in a river ecosystem influencing water chemistry morphological and physical factors and ecological functioning poff et al 1997 flow regime characterization is a fundamental stage for the river type classification and river basin management gallart et al 2016 munné et al 2021 prat et al 2014 sánchez montoya et al 2007 the reference status which is the un impacted or least impacted condition used as the baseline for the ecological status assessment varies across the river types pardo et al 2012 therefore a wrong river type classification may lead to an unreliable assessment of the ecological status of the river and to inadequate management operations fritz et al 2017 methodologies for characterising flow regime and its alterations are based on streamflow data recorded over a long period richter et al 1996 data requirements may be a limitation in several regions i e mediterranean basin where still exists a paucity of flow gauging stations and where the recorded data are generally poor i e short time series presence of gaps oueslati et al 2015 in the mediterranean region rivers characterised by non perennial flow regimes are the most common river systems skoulikidis et al 2017 and due to climate change the flow regime of several rivers could shift from perennial to intermittent conditions de girolamo et al 2017a de girolamo et al 2022 a few studies have explored the relationships between the duration of non flow events the biodiversity and ecosystem function only 4 of published studies in peer reviewed journals on temporary waterways have analysed the spatial and temporal effects of flow intermittency on river ecology acuña et al 2020 in the past decades temporary rivers were often excluded from the environmental management policies and from the monitoring plans leigh et al 2016 nikolaidis et al 2013 in most cases gauging stations have been installed along perennial reaches both for the perceived greater importance of the permanent reaches and because most of the instruments are unable to detect the extremely low flow near the zero flow conditions tramblay et al 2021 van meerveld et al 2020 zimmer et al 2020 more performant gauging stations need large expensive and very invasive structures to install the instruments in addition such gauges need specific and constant maintenance the high economic investments necessary for installing and maintaining the instruments have limited the implementation of monitoring plans especially in developing countries as a result long time series of streamflow are rarely available for temporary rivers ogie et al 2017 when flow data are unavailable or data quality is poor the characterization of the hydrological regime and the river type classification are challenges d ambrosio et al 2017 oueslati et al 2015 hydrological models such as hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1996 and soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 may be used to generate long term time series of daily or monthly streamflows also in ungauged basins meresa 2019 ricci et al 2020a sun et al 2015 however one of the main issues related to the modelling approach to generate daily streamflow time series derives from the necessity of input data i e land use soil profiles and hydrological characteristics digital elevation model weather data point sources discharges arnold et al 2012 data requirement which is very large for the majority of the hydrological models is a limit to modelling activities in several countries hydrological models

is reported in literature de girolamo et al 2017b guse et al 2015 in semiarid regions with intermittent river networks hydrological models generally overestimated the extremely low flow and showed a large uncertainty in simulating the low flow de girolamo et al 2015a in eco hydrological studies the extreme low flow quantification is very important since it determines the qualitative distribution

taxa and diversity than perennial rivers buffagni et al 2020 munné and prat 2011 simple approaches such as satellite images interviews pictures of the stream gallart et al 2017 munné et al 2021 and smartphone apps kampf et al 2018 can be used for identifying the dry conditions and for adapting hydrological models to simulate daily streamflow in temporary rivers defining correctly the zero flow period nevertheless to the best of our knowledge in the literature there are no studies that have provided a complete procedure to overcome the limited data availability and to address the model calibration of the extremely low flow with the final aim to predict time series of daily streamflow which is fundamental for eco hydrological characterization of flow regime the general aim of the present work was to define a procedure for characterising the flow regime of non perennial rivers in a semi arid region with limited data availability the specific aims were to i adapt the swat model for simulating time series of daily streamflow in a basin with limited data availability and with a temporary river network ii characterise flow regime in a number of river reaches of the nil wadi catchment algeria the results of the present study constitute a guide for addressing the problem of modelling streamflow in basins with temporary river systems in regions with limited data availability in addition results are very useful for the river ecologists in the ecological status assessment and may support water resources managers in watershed management 2 study area the nil wadi catchment is located in northeastern algeria fig 1a the outlet of the river is near the jijel town about 15 km fig 1b the drainage area is 304 22 km2 the basin is constituted by five sub watersheds

methods 3 1 data in the study area the availability of both areal data i e land use soils and the point data i e climatic soil hydrological properties was limited in order to build the swat geodatabase for the nil wadi catchment which was necessary to run the model the available data were integrated with data from international databases table 1 to calibrate the model a monitoring plan for measuring streamflow was carried out as described in the following paragraph the basin drainage area was defined by the swat model on the basis of the digital elevation model dem with a pixel of 30 m provided by the geological engineering laboratory lgg of the university of mohamed seddik benyahia jijel algeria the land use map was realised by combining data derived from the african land use map lum pixel of 20 m developed by the european space agency esa climate change initiative https www esa landcover cci org with data directly collected by lgg for each agricultural land use to better define the actual land uses data were integrated with the photo interpretation that was carried out by means of google earth pro 7 3 4 8248 2021 the database of soil properties was built based on the international soil reference and african soil properties maps provided by the international soil reference and information centre isric https www isric org projects soil property maps africa 250 m resolution which were derived from over 85 thousand samples hengl et al 2015 data of texture bulk density coarse fragments and organic carbon were extracted for five different soil depths the soil water characteristics tool saxton and rawls 2006 was used to determine the missing soil properties such as available water content hydraulic conductivity and bulk density soil texture was mainly sandy clay rich in organic matter in the upstream area of the basin and marl and sand with gravel 10 13 in lowland the coordinates of the discharge points inlets of the seven uwds were provided by lgg daily volumes discharged into the river network considered constant in the swat model set up were estimated by multiplying the per capita sewage contributed per day by the population where the sewage contributed per day was 80 of the water supply and water supply for inhabitant was 130 l day 1 results were found in good agreement with data reported for the wastewater treatment plant of the jijel city by the united nations environmental program unep for the assessment and control of marine pollution in the mediterranean medpol unep 2011 the time series of the climate data including daily rainfall mm daily maximum and minimum temperatures c and daily solar radiation were built for two weather stations from 01 01 1991 31 12 2020 by using different sources the time series of minimum and maximum daily temperature for the jijel achouat station 46 m a s l were built joining the data downloaded from the historic meteorological portal named historique météo pour le monde entier https www historique meteo net from january 2009 to december 2020 and the data from the global weather data for swat https globalweather tamu edu relative to the station 37063 from january 1991 to december 2008 a similar procedure was used for the col fedules station 891 m a s l where the daily data precipitation minimum and maximum temperature provided by the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh of jijel from 13 10 2019 31 12 2019 were integrated with data from the swat 36759 weather station from 01 01 1991 31 07 2014 the stations 37063 and 36759 were representative of the jijel achouat and col fedoules stations respectively differences 6 the global weather data for swat website is managed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfrs it provides high resolution global weather data derived from an interpolation of real data arranged on a grid of 38 km of resolution dile and srinivasan 2014 fuka et al 2013 the swat model attributes a climatic station to each subbasin with the centroid method which is based on the distance between the climatic station and the centroid of the subbasin since the weather gauging stations were located outside the basin to ensure good coverage of the climatic data within the basin coherent with the topography two transposed stations were created moving the stations internally to the basin area jijel achouat and col fedoules in fig 1 for each agricultural land use information about agricultural practices provided by lgg was integrated with data derived from literature and from the analysis of satellite images in particular for olives and citrus fruits prevalent crops the following tillage operations were adopted ploughing november soil milling january and harrowing may and july in swat auto irrigation was adopted setting deep aquifer as the water source similarly fertilizer application was set in auto specifying the type of fertilizer urea 15 15 15 harvest was set in autumn for olives and in winter for citrus fruits 3 1 1 determination of the streamflow using the float method streamflow measurement in a wadi cross section is a difficult task due to the rapid changes in streamflow e g flash flood events high inter annual variability of the streamflow and variation of the geometry of the river sections that may occur after floods however several techniques can be used for streamflow measurements that are based on different principles pagano et al 2020 2010 in this study given the absence of a hydrometric station in the basin the float technique was adopted the uncertainty associated with the measurement is about 10 dobriyal et al 2017 rantz 1982 a daily time step during rainy episodes and a wide time step 2 6 days in the periods between rainfall events were adopted for streamflow measurements the station to measure the streamflow was located near the outlet fig 1c it measured the global flow of the watershed except for the flow of the el kennar subbasin that was discharged downstream of the station the station was composed by two bridges overall length 138 m corresponding to the river width spaced 10 8 m apart which were used to measure the float travel time fig 2 and the geometry of the section of the wadi to minimize uncertainties wooden floats of the same dimension 10 10 2 cm were used for all the measurements during the monitoring plan 13 10 2019 23 10 2020 for each measurement campaign water velocity was determined for each subsection width 5 m then it was corrected by means of a reducing coefficient cr to convert surface velocity at subsection n vn surface to mean velocity vn eq 1 cr was assumed equal to 0 8 united states department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2001 1 vn vn surface cr the wadi streamflow was calculated by using the following equation eq 2 2 q 1 n v n s n where q is the total streamflow sn is the area of the subsection n 3 2 swat model configuration swat version 2015 was implemented to generate 20 years of daily streamflow data which were used to characterise the hydrological regime swat was run at daily time step for the period 1991 2020 with 9 years of warm up daily streamflow simulated at the selected river sections were aggregated at the monthly time scale for classifying the flow regime the swat model developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 is a semi distributed hydrological model commonly used to simulate streamflow sediment and nutrient loads at basin scale arnold et al 2012 borrelli et al 2021 d ambrosio et al 2020a the catchment delineation phase is fundamental to well represent the local variation of land use soil and slope while setting up the swat model considering the small number of land uses classes the basin was subdivided into 298 sub basins using a threshold of 50 ha to define the hydrologic response units hrus unique combination between land use soil and slope the threshold values of 10 10 and 20 were assumed for land use soil class and slope respectively obtaining 1074 hrus from this operation 12 land use classes were obtained forests greenhouses and orchards were prevalent and five soil types ranging from clay to loam agricultural practices i e tillage operations fertilization irrigation and inflow from uwds were also included in the model setup the surface runoff was estimated by using the modified soil conservation service curve number method united states department of agriculture soil conservation service 1972 and the hargreaves method was adopted for assessing the potential evapotranspiration pet hargreaves 1975 the latter method was selected since climatic data such as daily relative humidity wind velocity and solar radiation required for applying other methods e g penman monteith equation were not available more details about swat model and the theory of the processes modelled are reported in neitsch et al 2011 and abdelwahab et al 2018 3 2 1 model calibration the paucity and the lack of continuity of measured streamflow for the nil wadi made it necessary to use the full dataset for the calibration arsenault et al 2018 before calibrating the model the swat cup sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm was used to carry out the sensitivity analysis rouholahnejad et al 2012 arnold et al 2012 malagó et al 2017 the parameters related to the exchange of water between surface and groundwater were the most sensitive parameters table 2 the model was manually calibrated by modifying the sensitive parameters one at a time with the aim to improve the correspondence between the patterns of measured and simulated hydrographs ricci et al 2020b jeong et al 2010 tables ii in addition considering the aim of the present study the observed and the simulated flow duration curves fdc were compared in order to better identify the phases of the flow regime where measured streamflow qobs differed with simulated streamflow qsim i e high intermediate and low flow for successive adaptation of the model nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias were used to assess the model performances moriasi et al 2007 3 3 zero flow threshold typically hydrological models tend to overestimate the extremely low flow conditions kirkby et al 2011 in this work to understand if the low flow simulated by the model was realistic qsim and qobs were analysed by using the flow duration curve indeed in temporary rivers the low flow and dry phases assume great importance since these phases influence the biological community assemblage biological metrics that explain the richness of aquatic communities typically decline when flow intermittence increases regardless of the human pressures munné et al 2021 if qsim overestimates qobs the flow regime classification based on qsim could be incorrect de girolamo et al 2017b for this reason in the present work it was identified the zero flow zf threshold following the approach adopted by de girolamo et al 2015a to adapt the model zf threshold is the qsim that corresponds to the absence of streamflow this value is site specific it depends on the physical characteristics of the reach i e geology river bed hydraulic conductivity channel width vegetation and on the intrinsic limits of the conceptual model in a river reach once zf has been established simulated streamflow below the zf value is assumed to be zero to identify the zf threshold free historical satellite images were extracted from google earth for the entire river network in order to identify the perennial and temporary river reaches upstream along the nil wadi to its headwaters the river network was partially visible due to the presence of forest from the historical images the main course of the nil wadi where visible was found always in the flowing phase however field surveys and local citizen interviews revealed that some river reaches of the nil wadi were perennials due to the presence of natural springs and others were intermittent from satellite images and from field investigations the boukaraa and saayoud wadis showed a temporary character for the latter tributaries the images with no flow for the period 2019 were extracted for some selected river reaches and compared with the calibrated qsim in order to identify an average value of the zf threshold indeed several different values of zf were detected however taking into account the uncertainty in satellite image interpretation for each of the selected reaches the average of the values detected from june to september was assumed as the zf threshold lastly at the outlet of the river basin the zf threshold was computed as the sum of the zfs defined for the tributaries boukaraa and saayoud for each of the selected river reaches the zf was subtracted from the simulated streamflow for the period june to september before characterising the flow regime when the result of the subtraction was negative the streamflow was set to zero 3 4 characterising hydrological regime in recent years several methodologies have been developed to characterise flow regimes and to classify river types richter et al 1996 oueslati et al 2015 d ambrosio et al 2017 almost all the methodologies are based on a number of hydrological indicators his that are able to describe specific components of the flow regime i e duration magnitude rate of change timing predictability richter et al 1996 the his are computed by using time series of daily or monthly streamflow the nature conservancy 2009 for temporary rivers which are characterised by large inter annual variability in streamflow bisantino et al 2010 de girolamo et al 2015b fortesa et al 2021 at least 20 years of streamflow data should be used in order to include a variety of hydrological conditions i e wet and dry years de girolamo et al 2015c in the present work in order to support water resources managers and river ecologists in assessing the ecological status a new procedure for classifying river types and for characterising the flow regime was tested in the boukaraa basin three river reaches were selected where the new approach developed by gallart et al 2017 was applied by using the open source software trehs the approach was tested by using simulated streamflow data in addition the trehs was applied with observations from google earth the divergence between the two classifications of flow regime simulated and observed represented the uncertainty due to input data 3 4 1 estimating regime of temporary rivers when data are unavailable trehs tool gallart et al 2012 2016 developed the temporary rivers ecological and hydrological status trehs tool for assisting the operational implementation of the water framework directive wfd ec 2000 in temporary rivers the approach was specifically developed for characterizing flow regimes in ungauged or poorly gauged river basins trehs provides the temporary regime plot trs a fast graphical method to classify the flow regime of river reaches on the basis of their degree of temporariness through two metrics trs delineate the following classification perennial p perennial flowing except on rare occasions intermittent pools i p discontinuous flow with only pools in the dry season intermittent dry i d lack of surface water during dry season and ephemeral e episodic flow permanence two metrics are used as coordinate in the trs plot the flow permanence mf which is the long term mean annual relative number of months with the flow and the six month predictability of zero flow periods sd6 which is the difference of one minus the ratio between the multi annual frequency of occurrence of the zero flow months in the wet semester and the frequency of the zero flow months in the dry semester gallart et al 2012 both are computed on monthly streamflow data trehs also allows classifying flow regime of temporary rivers taking into account the aquatic phases such as flow permanence disconnected pools permanence and dry river bed permanence which are very important for aquatic life through mf and two additional metrics the dry channel permanence md which is the long term mean annual relative number of months without flow and the pool permanence mp which is the long term mean annual relative number of months when isolated pools occur md mf and mp reported on the three main axes in the triangular graph fpd classify temporary river regime into nine different aquatic phases regimes p quasi perennial qp alternate fluent af fluent stagnant fs stagnant st alternate stagnant as alternate al occasional oc episodic ep gallart et al 2017 finally based on the assumption that the flow regime is the most important variable influencing aquatic life and that it determines the occurrence of mesohabitats in a reach gallart et al 2012 2017 defined six mesohabitats called aquatic states ass hyperrheic flood eurheic high or normal flow oligorheic low flow or pools connected arheic flow almost zero or pools disconnected hyporheic absence of surface flow with the only hyporheic flow and edaphic surface and hyporheic flow absent hyporheic and edaphic may be resumed as dry since characterised by no flow the tool was tested in spain munné et al 2021 and the outputs were found very useful for adequately assessing hydrological and ecological status in temporary rivers allowing to distinguish different habitats according to biological community pattern for management purposes in the present work the ass were determined by using mf and sd6 and the streamflow threshold values between the different ass were defined with the aid of the fdcs and with field observations as described by gallart et al 2012 in particular the flow threshold value between the conditions defined hyperrheic and eurheic was assumed equal to qsim corresponding to 5 of exceedance frequency in the fdc the threshold between eurheic and oligorheic was assumed equal to qsim corresponding to the flex in the fdc meanwhile the other thresholds were defined based on field surveys 4 results 4 1 modelling streamflow the swat model was run from 2000 to 2020 on a daily scale for the calibration period october 2019 to october 2020 pbias was satisfactory 24 12 indicating an underestimation of streamflow moriasi et al 2007 r2 and nse were 0 40 and 0 35 respectively similar results were reported in mediterranean areas ricci et al 2018 and in small watersheds spruill et al 2000 these results were acceptable for daily streamflow simulations arnold et al 2012 and for regions with limited data availability zema et al 2016 since measured data were non continuous over the calibration period it was difficult to identify and compare all the hydrograph components i e rising limb falling limb fig 3a however the comparison between the measured and the simulated data fig 3a showed that the model was able to predict the highest peak flow with a slight overestimation october 2019 115 m3s 1 versus 118 m3s 1 the comparison of the fdcs qsim and qobs in fig 3b supplementary material s1 showed that the high flow 0 20 of flow exceedance was well simulated by the model as well as part of the normal flow 75 90 however the normal flow from 20 to 75 of flow exceedance was underestimated by the model meanwhile the low flow 90 100 of flow exceedance was overestimated taking into account the importance of the low flow and the dry phase for flow regime characterisation a correction of the qsim series before calculating hydrological metrics was adopted by subtracting the zf from the qsim from june to september as reported in the following paragraph from 2000 2020 at the basin scale the mean annual precipitation was 1005 mm the results confirmed that the mediterranean rainfall regime is highly variable from one year to another indeed total annual rainfall was 479 mm and 1431 mm in 2000 driest year and 2013 wettest year respectively these results highlighted that long time series should be used to characterise the flow regime in the mediterranean region the wet season started in september and ended in march rainfall often overcoming 100 mm from november to february the dry season started in may and ended in august july was the driest month mean monthly rainfall 19 94 mm the average yearly surface runoff was 244 mm 2 35 m3 s 1 24 3 of rainfall infiltration was 231 mm 22 9 of the rainfall evapotranspiration was 530 mm 52 8 of the rainfall and total water yield was 475 mm 47 36 of the rainfall 4 2 zero flow threshold google earth images were analysed from 2007 to 2020 fig 4 aiming at identifying where and when the river network was dry along the boukaraa wadi the total number of clear images was 24 the dry conditions were found all over along the main course of the boukaraa in ten images taken mostly from june to september nine supplementary material s2 a similar number of images 25 was extracted for the saayoud wadi but only seven images showed the dry conditions six of which were taken in summer data not shown the zf thresholds were define in three river reaches along the main stream of the boukaraa wadi r28 r121 r157 and on a river reach of the saayoud wadi fig 5 for the boukaraa the monthly zf thresholds ranged from 0 051 m3s 1 to 0 082 m3s 1 at the reach r157 where zf resulted 0 072 m3s 1 average value and from 0 066 m3s 1 to 0 098 m3s 1 at the reach r121 where zf resulted 0 084 m3s 1 average for the reach r28 which was located at the confluence with the nil wadi the average monthly zf resulted 0 084 m3s 1 the zf threshold estimated for the saayoud wadi r45 was 0 107 m3s 1 mean flow from june to september fig 5 this value was assumed also at the confluence with the nil wadi at the outlet of the nil wadi catchment zf was 0 192 m3s 1 computed as the sum of the zfs of the two tributaries boukaraa r28 and zf saayoud r45 supplementary material s3 the zf threshold was subtracted from the simulated streamflow at the corresponding river reaches from june to september to improve the simulated extreme low flow before classifying flow regime supplementary material s3 when the result of the subtraction was negative the streamflow was set equal to zero 4 3 hydrological regime the flow regime of the boukaraa was characterised in three selected reaches along the main course of the river r28 r121 r157 in fig 5 the flow regime of reach r28 and reach r121 was classified as i p both by using the qsim and the observations from google earth for evaluating the metrics mf and sd6 fig 6a the upstream reach r157 in fig 5 was classified as i p by using the observed data in computing the metrics and i d by using modeled data however over the long period the classification based on modeled data ranged from i d to i p the different classification may be explained by the different periods over which the metrics mf and sd6 were evaluated or it could be due to the overestimation of the zf threshold the values of the metric sd6 were equal to 1 for all the three reaches when using observed data fig 6a meanwhile the values computed on the basis of qsim were lower 0 67 0 94 these results can be explained by the exiguous number of google earth s images covering winter and spring seasons that could have determined the multi annual frequency of occurrence of the zero flow months in the wet semester equal to zero which in turn determined sd6 1 the values of the sd6 computed by using qsim were based on the long and continuous time series for which the frequency of zero flow months for the contiguous six wetter months was 0 based on the results of the present study it can be concluded that over the long period the boukaraa can be classified as an i p river except for the upstream river reaches that show a hydrological gradient from i p and i d supplementary material s5 s6 s7 the fpd plot in fig 6b was developed in order to show the aquatic phases such as flow disconnected pools and dry bed reaches located upstream and in the middle course r157 r121 showed alternate fluent aquatic phases af both by using qsim and observations from google earth meanwhile the downstream river segment r28 showed a gradient from af and fluent stagnant fs the ass were analysed in the three selected reaches along the main course of the boukaraa wadi r28 r121 r157 in fig 5 over the long period by using qsim data the flow threshold values between the diverse ass are summarised in table 3 as expected the frequency of occurrence of the ass through the year was similar in the three reaches fig 7 results showed that the as defined as hyperrheic flood occurred in winter january to april with the highest frequency in february 19 23 blue color in fig 7d e f from november to may the eurheic high or normal flow was the as with the highest frequency of occurrence 61 95 in all the selected reaches the ass oligorheic low flow or pools connected green in fig 7d e f and arheic flow almost zero or pools disconnected yellow in fig 7 mainly occurred from may to october the dry condition that includes hyporheic absence of surface flow with the only hyporheic flow and edaphic surface and hyporheic flow absent brown in fig 7d e f mainly occurred in summer with a very high frequency in august 66 70 annex a shows a collection of google earth images representing the ass for the analysed reaches supplementary materials s4 s5 s6 report the results of the trehs for the reaches r28 r121 r157 respectively the ecological status evaluation based on the wfd standard method which has been developed for perennial rivers needs samplings in eurheic or oligorheic states hence based on the results of the present study samplings are not recommended to be planned in summer for the reaches r121 and r157 since both reaches are usually dry when a reach is dry or when only pools are present biological methods are not applicable and therefore other methods must be applied i e hydrogeological and terrestrial fauna prat et al 2014 gallart et al 2017 munné et al 2021 5 discussion in the past decades the paucity of data for setting up the hydrological models constituted a limitation in modelling applications nowadays regional datasets such as the harmonised world soil database fischer et al 2008 global gridded soil hengl et al 2017 shuttle radar topography mission strm usgs eros archive 2000 global land cover esa 2017 national centers for environmental prediction ncep and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr weather data fuka et al 2013 may be used to integrate available data in countries with limited data availability in this work for the model set up the input files land use map soil map and hydraulic properties climate data were defined by merging the existing data recorded in the study area with the above mentioned regional datasets as reported through the paper table i the regional databases have allowed simulating flow regime and water balance in the nil wadi catchment which otherwise would not have been possible to predict however it is important to highlight that a lower statistical model performance is expected when using regional databases instead of measured data the results of the streamflow calibration showed a satisfactory value for pbias meanwhile r2 and nse were unsatisfactory according to the criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2007 which are the most common criteria adopted for perennial rivers and in general for well monitored areas however for mediterranean river basins hydrological processes prediction is a challenge due to the extremely low flow and to the intermittency of streamflow sachse et al 2017 for these reasons several authors reputed nse 0 35 as satisfactory values van liew and garbrecht 2003 zema et al 2016 the causes that could have determined the low performances in this work were examined in detail and are discussed below the swat model was calibrated by using the discrete data of the streamflow recorded with the float method dobriyal et al 2017 and hundt and blasch 2019 pointed out that this method could not correctly represent the actual streamflow especially when the velocity between the streamflow layers is turbulent it is reasonable to assume that flow measurements may be affected by a certain uncertainty degree that may have influenced the model performances it is well known that weather data i e location and the number of gauging stations play a key role in the hydrological modelling especially in mediterranean region where rainfall is characterised by a high spatial gradient and where the events are frequently localised in small areas convective regime abdelwahab et al 2016 fortesa et al 2021 ricci et al 2022 romano et al 2018 ehlers et al 2019 pointed out that model uncertainty increases with the decrease of the number of gauging stations in swat modelling applications the location of the weather stations is particularly important since the model attributes a unique weather station to each subbasin with the centroid method that is based on the distance between the station and the centroid of the subbasin hence when the number of rainfall gauges is limited as in the present case study the model can generate an incorrect distribution of the weather stations across the basin ruan et al 2016 abdelwahab et al 2018 indeed only two weather gauging stations which were located outside the watershed were available in the nil wadi to overcome this limit two transposed weather stations were created by changing the longitude of the real gauging stations in order to attribute the jijel achouat station 46 m a s l and the col fedoules station 891 m to the subbasins of the plain and hilly mountainous areas respectively for the nil wadi catchment an enhancement of the hydro meteorological monitoring network is desirable on a local and regional scale for a better management of the water resources the comparison of the fdcs designed with qsim and qobs showed that the low flow was overestimated by the model this result confirmed previous studies that identified the low flow as a critical point in hydrological modelling kirkby et al 2011 several factors such as topography water exchange between groundwater and surface water land management practices and model structure determine the low flow the quantification of low flow and duration of the dry condition is needed to manage water resources especially in semi arid river basins where specific measures are needed to mitigate the socioeconomic and ecological impacts of water shortages nicolle et al 2015 for this reason several studies have been carried out to improve the performance of the swat model in simulating the low flow for instance adopting a seasonal calibration scheme calibrating separately two seasons lévesque et al 2008 muleta 2012 ricci et al 2018 zangh et al 2015 or using a different cn in the dormant and growing season white et al 2009 guse et al 2013 modified the groundwater module since the groundwater and evaporation parameters were the main causes of the unsatisfactory performances of the swat model in simulating the low flow in lowland watersheds in the present work to improve the low flow simulation the approach based on the zf threshold was adopted de girolamo et al 2017b it consists of a simple correction of the streamflow subtracting the zf value from the simulated streamflow during the dry months from june to september the threshold identification is a difficult task and the zf values which are site specific can be affected by a large uncertainty in the present work google earth images turned out to be crucial in identifying the zf thresholds however some river reaches were covered by dense vegetation and the flow type conditions i e dry continuous flow could not be detected to overcome this limit local citizens should be involved in monitoring and in defining flow regime since they have a wide knowledge of the local environment for intermittent and ephemeral streams the contribution of volunteers in mapping the continuity of streamflow has already been adopted with success in some countries datry et al 2016 in addition new methods could be used to monitor the occurrence of water in some river sections such as low cost temperature or electrical conductivity sensors chapin et al 2014 gallart et al 2016 the implementation of the wfd in southern europe highlighted several difficulties in managing the temporary rivers since the intermittence of the streamflow has not been adequately considered in the wfd several authors pointed out that the biological community assemblages did not completely fit in temporary rivers and they suggest considering additional hydrological parameters to the river type classification defined in the wfd sánchez montoya et al 2007 munné and prat 2011 prat et al 2014 buffagni et al 2020 the new river type classification proposed by gallart et al 2012 2017 differentiates the river segments on the basis of the habitats that have importance for river ecology identifying those types of rivers such as stagnant st or alternate stagnant as that need new biological metrics for assessing ecological status the trehs software proved to be a useful tool that can be implemented also in regions with limited data availability by using simulated data and google earth images however the present work highlights that a long time series of streamflow is needed for characterising the flow regime of a temporary river since it has great inter annual variability in the mediterranean region in the study area the google earth images covered a long period 2007 2020 but their frequency was not uniform throughout the year in addition several images were not clear and therefore not included in this study the number of images and their dating may influence the river type classification the river reaches analysed in the boukaraa basin were classified as i p the classification obtained by using simulated data was in good agreement with observed ones except for the reach r157 which was classified as i p by using the observed data and i d by using modeled data the discrepancy in river type classification could partially be due to the small number of images and to the different periods that covered simulated and observed data respectively these results indicated that the flow regime classification may be affected by uncertainty when using trehs both with simulated streamflow data and with google earth images the ass frequency graphs elaborated for the boukaraa provided general information about the occurrence of the specific flow conditions in the selected river reaches that are fundamental for fixing the calendar of samplings based on the results it is not recommended to plan the samplings in summer for the reaches r121 and r157 since both reaches are usually dry the multiannual frequency of occurrence of the ass is an important piece of information that is necessary but not sufficient for a correct interpretation of the relationships between flow regime and biological communities development de girolamo et al 2015c at this aim it is required an analysis of the ass occurred a few weeks before the biological samplings buffagni et al 2020 the methodology presented in this study has great potential in water resources management in the next decades climate change population and economic growth will have a strong impact on water resources in mediterranean region with severe implications on the ecosystem environment and socio economic sectors the calibrated model may be used for assessing the potential impacts of climate change on water resources availability and on the flow regime indeed the model proved to be a fundamental tool for assessing the impact of water consumption on water bodies both in terms of quantity and quality boulay et al 2018 d ambrosio et al 2020b 6 conclusions temporary rivers are very common river systems in the mediterranean region and in view of climate change it is expected an increase of their extension in the future decades the management of temporary rivers has been identified as a challenge in several countries especially under the mediterranean climate in order to support critical issues in managing temporary rivers several studies and eu research projects have been carried out this study provides a contribution to the unsolved question of the management of temporary rivers the work addressed the flow regime characterization in regions with limited data availability and tested an approach for supporting river ecologists in the ecological status assessment results of the present work showed that in regions with limited data availability is possible to carry out eco hydrological studies integrating data from regional databases google earth images field surveys and modelling activities the swat model is able to simulate hydrology in temporary river systems but the extreme low flow and the absence of streamflow are critical points in simulating streamflow the model was adapted to better represent these phases of flow regime through the introduction of a threshold which was identified for a number of selected reaches with the aid of images from google earth and that was subtracted from the simulated streamflow values from june to september flow regime was characterised for supporting ecological status assessment by using a new approach that identified flowing pools and dry phases the trehs software proved to be a useful tool that can be implemented also in regions with limited data availability by using simulated data and google earth images it provides useful information to river ecologists for planning biological samplings and evaluating the ecological status of temporary rivers this work shows that coupling modelling and field activities it is possible to characterise flow regime also in case of limited data and economic resources however the river classification and flow regime characterization based on simulated streamflow and data from satellite images may be affected by uncertainty the latter can be reduced by involving local citizens and enhancing the hydro meteorological monitoring network on the local and regional scales further studies are needed to define the relationships between flow regime and biological communities development funding this work was supported by the italian ministry of university and research mur the general directorate of

7948,study region mediterranean catchment in algeria study focus a procedure to characterise the flow regimes of non perennial rivers in regions with limited data availability was defined the specific aims were to adapt the soil and water assessment tool swat for simulating time series of daily streamflow in a basin with a temporary river network and to characterise flow regime in a number of the river reaches an inexpensive streamflow monitoring program was implemented to collect a basic dataset to calibrate the hydrological model regional databases surveys and images from google earth were used to integrate the available data to set up the model flow regime was characterised by using a number of metrics describing the aquatic phases as flow pool and dry permanence new hydrological insights for the region this study provides a contribution to the unsolved question of the management of temporary rivers under the mediterranean climate the nil wadi is characterised by perennial and temporary flow regimes the analysed reaches were classified as intermittent pool and intermittent dry they showed alternate fluent af aquatic phase upstream and in the middle course and a gradient from af to fluent stagnant phases downstream the as oligorheic low flow or pools connected and arheic pools disconnected mainly occurred from may to october dry condition that includes the ass hyporheic and edaphic mainly occurred in summer graphical abstract ga1 keywords temporary river flow regime data scarcity swat model river classification mediterranean region 1 introduction the streamflow regime plays an important role in a river ecosystem influencing water chemistry morphological and physical factors and ecological functioning poff et al 1997 flow regime characterization is a fundamental stage for the river type classification and river basin management gallart et al 2016 munné et al 2021 prat et al 2014 sánchez montoya et al 2007 the reference status which is the un impacted or least impacted condition used as the baseline for the ecological status assessment varies across the river types pardo et al 2012 therefore a wrong river type classification may lead to an unreliable assessment of the ecological status of the river and to inadequate management operations fritz et al 2017 methodologies for characterising flow regime and its alterations are based on streamflow data recorded over a long period richter et al 1996 data requirements may be a limitation in several regions i e mediterranean basin where still exists a paucity of flow gauging stations and where the recorded data are generally poor i e short time series presence of gaps oueslati et al 2015 in the mediterranean region rivers characterised by non perennial flow regimes are the most common river systems skoulikidis et al 2017 and due to climate change the flow regime of several rivers could shift from perennial to intermittent conditions de girolamo et al 2017a de girolamo et al 2022 a few studies have explored the relationships between the duration of non flow events the biodiversity and ecosystem function only 4 of published studies in peer reviewed journals on temporary waterways have analysed the spatial and temporal effects of flow intermittency on river ecology acuña et al 2020 in the past decades temporary rivers were often excluded from the environmental management policies and from the monitoring plans leigh et al 2016 nikolaidis et al 2013 in most cases gauging stations have been installed along perennial reaches both for the perceived greater importance of the permanent reaches and because most of the instruments are unable to detect the extremely low flow near the zero flow conditions tramblay et al 2021 van meerveld et al 2020 zimmer et al 2020 more performant gauging stations need large expensive and very invasive structures to install the instruments in addition such gauges need specific and constant maintenance the high economic investments necessary for installing and maintaining the instruments have limited the implementation of monitoring plans especially in developing countries as a result long time series of streamflow are rarely available for temporary rivers ogie et al 2017 when flow data are unavailable or data quality is poor the characterization of the hydrological regime and the river type classification are challenges d ambrosio et al 2017 oueslati et al 2015 hydrological models such as hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1996 and soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 may be used to generate long term time series of daily or monthly streamflows also in ungauged basins meresa 2019 ricci et al 2020a sun et al 2015 however one of the main issues related to the modelling approach to generate daily streamflow time series derives from the necessity of input data i e land use soil profiles and hydrological characteristics digital elevation model weather data point sources discharges arnold et al 2012 data requirement which is very large for the majority of the hydrological models is a limit to modelling activities in several countries hydrological models have been successfully used to simulate hydrological processes in river basins with perennial rivers kannan et al 2018 meanwhile a limited number of modelling applications for eco hydrological studies is reported in literature de girolamo et al 2017b guse et al 2015 in semiarid regions with intermittent river networks hydrological models generally overestimated the extremely low flow and showed a large uncertainty in simulating the low flow de girolamo et al 2015a in eco hydrological studies the extreme low flow quantification is very important since it determines the qualitative distribution of flow within the river section i e flowing phase disconnected pools connected pools dry phase which in turn influences biological communities in temporary rivers bonada et al 2007 buffagni et al 2009 datry et al 2014 sabater et al 2017 soria et al 2017 stubbington et al 2017a b in these river systems when flow shifts between the lotic to lentic phase biological communities may be poorer in taxa and diversity than perennial rivers buffagni et al 2020 munné and prat 2011 simple approaches such as satellite images interviews pictures of the stream gallart et al 2017 munné et al 2021 and smartphone apps kampf et al 2018 can be used for identifying the dry conditions and for adapting hydrological models to simulate daily streamflow in temporary rivers defining correctly the zero flow period nevertheless to the best of our knowledge in the literature there are no studies that have provided a complete procedure to overcome the limited data availability and to address the model calibration of the extremely low flow with the final aim to predict time series of daily streamflow which is fundamental for eco hydrological characterization of flow regime the general aim of the present work was to define a procedure for characterising the flow regime of non perennial rivers in a semi arid region with limited data availability the specific aims were to i adapt the swat model for simulating time series of daily streamflow in a basin with limited data availability and with a temporary river network ii characterise flow regime in a number of river reaches of the nil wadi catchment algeria the results of the present study constitute a guide for addressing the problem of modelling streamflow in basins with temporary river systems in regions with limited data availability in addition results are very useful for the river ecologists in the ecological status assessment and may support water resources managers in watershed management 2 study area the nil wadi catchment is located in northeastern algeria fig 1a the outlet of the river is near the jijel town about 15 km fig 1b the drainage area is 304 22 km2 the basin is constituted by five sub watersheds

cobble and conglomerates marls in the west left bank of nil wadi and metamorphic grounds in the east right bank of saayoud wadi on the alluvial deposits old consolidated silty sand and recent dune formations coarse sand are present sandstone and clay formations outcropping are prevalent in the southern part of the plain blue marl deposits separate the saayoud wadi from the nil wadi catchment detrital deposits divide the nil wadi from the boukaraa wadi catchment and the grey marl and detrital deposits separate the boukaraa wadi from the tassift wadi catchment in the mountains surrounding the plain upstream area metamorphic formations schist mica schist gneiss and crystalline limestone are prevalent ehrmann 1928 baghdad et al 2017 the main stream which flows into the mediterranean sea is 35 km long with an average slope of 2 98 the elevation of the basin ranges from 0 to 1510 m a s l the nil wadi shows high flow in winter maximum flow 115 m3s 1 and low flow 0 1 m3s 1 or zero flow in summer drouiche et al 2021 the climate is typically mediterranean hot dry summers and cold humid winters at the jijel achouat meteorological station 46 m a s l 1988 2015 located at 0 7 km from the left boundary of the watershed fig 1b the average annual precipitation was about 1000 mm y 1 and the maximum and minimum monthly temperatures was 28 1 c august and 13 4 c january respectively in the river basin wastewater effluents from seven urban wastewater uwds are discharged directly into the hydrographic network the uwds constitute important hydrological pressures for the receiving river reaches especially in summer when the low flow components of the flow regime are altered i e duration timing magnitude of extreme low flow the main land uses are mixed mediterranean forest 57 of the entire basin area rangeland 10 agricultural productions 23 the urban areas and other minor land uses bare soil waters garrigue cover around 8 and 2 of the total basin area respectively 3 material and methods 3 1 data in the study area the availability of both areal data i e land use soils and the point data i e climatic soil hydrological properties was limited in order to build the swat geodatabase for the nil wadi catchment which was necessary to run the model the available data were integrated with data from international databases table 1 to calibrate the model a monitoring plan for measuring streamflow was carried out as described in the following paragraph the basin drainage area was defined by the swat model on the basis of the digital elevation model dem with a pixel of 30 m provided by the geological engineering laboratory lgg of the university of mohamed seddik benyahia jijel algeria the land use map was realised by combining data derived from the african land use map lum pixel of 20 m developed by the european space agency esa climate change initiative https www esa landcover cci org with data directly collected by lgg for each agricultural land use to better define the actual land uses data were integrated with the photo interpretation that was carried out by means of google earth pro 7 3 4 8248 2021 the database of soil properties was built based on the international soil reference and african soil properties maps provided by the international soil reference and information centre isric https www isric org projects soil property maps africa 250 m resolution which were derived from over 85 thousand samples hengl et al 2015 data of texture bulk density coarse fragments and organic carbon were extracted for five different soil depths the soil water characteristics tool saxton and rawls 2006 was used to determine the missing soil properties such as available water content hydraulic conductivity and bulk density soil texture was mainly sandy clay rich in organic matter in the upstream area of the basin and marl and sand with gravel 10 13 in lowland the coordinates of the discharge points inlets of the seven uwds were provided by lgg daily volumes discharged into the river network considered constant in the swat model set up were estimated by multiplying the per capita sewage contributed per day by the population where the sewage contributed per day was 80 of the water supply and water supply for inhabitant was 130 l day 1 results were found in good agreement with data reported for the wastewater treatment plant of the jijel city by the united nations environmental program unep for the assessment and control of marine pollution in the mediterranean medpol unep 2011 the time series of the climate data including daily rainfall mm daily maximum and minimum temperatures c and daily solar radiation were built for two weather stations from 01 01 1991 31 12 2020 by using different sources the time series of minimum and maximum daily temperature for the jijel achouat station 46 m a s l were built joining the data downloaded from the historic meteorological portal named historique météo pour le monde entier https www historique meteo net from january 2009 to december 2020 and the data from the global weather data for swat https globalweather tamu edu relative to the station 37063 from january 1991 to december 2008 a similar procedure was used for the col fedules station 891 m a s l where the daily data precipitation minimum and maximum temperature provided by the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh of jijel from 13 10 2019 31 12 2019 were integrated with data from the swat 36759 weather station from 01 01 1991 31 07 2014 the stations 37063 and 36759 were representative of the jijel achouat and col fedoules stations respectively differences 6 the global weather data for swat website is managed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfrs it provides high resolution global weather data derived from an interpolation of real data arranged on a grid of 38 km of resolution dile and srinivasan 2014 fuka et al 2013 the swat model attributes a climatic station to each subbasin with the centroid method which is based on the distance between the climatic station and the centroid of the subbasin since the weather gauging stations were located outside the basin to ensure good coverage of the climatic data within the basin coherent with the topography two transposed stations were created moving the stations internally to the basin area jijel achouat and col fedoules in fig 1 for each agricultural land use information about agricultural practices provided by lgg was integrated with data derived from literature and from the analysis of satellite images in particular for olives and citrus fruits prevalent crops the following tillage operations were adopted ploughing november soil milling january and harrowing may and july in swat auto irrigation was adopted setting deep aquifer as the water source similarly fertilizer application was set in auto specifying the type of fertilizer urea 15 15 15 harvest was set in autumn for olives and in winter for citrus fruits 3 1 1 determination of the streamflow using the float method streamflow measurement in a wadi cross section is a difficult task due to the rapid changes in streamflow e g flash flood events high inter annual variability of the streamflow and variation of the geometry of the river sections that may occur after floods however several techniques can be used for streamflow measurements that are based on different principles pagano et al 2020 2010 in this study given the absence of a hydrometric station in the basin the float technique was adopted the uncertainty associated with the measurement is about 10 dobriyal et al 2017 rantz 1982 a daily time step during rainy episodes and a wide time step 2 6 days in the periods between rainfall events were adopted for streamflow measurements the station to measure the streamflow was located near the outlet fig 1c it measured the global flow of the watershed except for the flow of the el kennar subbasin that was discharged downstream of the station the station was composed by two bridges overall length 138 m corresponding to the river width spaced 10 8 m apart which were used to measure the float travel time fig 2 and the geometry of the section of the wadi to minimize uncertainties wooden floats of the same dimension 10 10 2 cm were used for all the measurements during the monitoring plan 13 10 2019 23 10 2020 for each measurement campaign water velocity was determined for each subsection width 5 m then it was corrected by means of a reducing coefficient cr to convert surface velocity at subsection n vn surface to mean velocity vn eq 1 cr was assumed equal to 0 8 united states department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2001 1 vn vn surface cr the wadi streamflow was calculated by using the following equation eq 2 2 q 1 n v n s n where q is the total streamflow sn is the area of the subsection n 3 2 swat model configuration swat version 2015 was implemented to generate 20 years of daily streamflow data which were used to characterise the hydrological regime swat was run at daily time step for the period 1991 2020 with 9 years of warm up daily streamflow simulated at the selected river sections were aggregated at the monthly time scale for classifying the flow regime the swat model developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 is a semi distributed hydrological model commonly used to simulate streamflow sediment and nutrient loads at basin scale arnold et al 2012 borrelli et al 2021 d ambrosio et al 2020a the catchment delineation phase is fundamental to well represent the local variation of land use soil and slope while setting up the swat model considering the small number of land uses classes the basin was subdivided into 298 sub basins using a threshold of 50 ha to define the hydrologic response units hrus unique combination between land use soil and slope the threshold values of 10 10 and 20 were assumed for land use soil class and slope respectively obtaining 1074 hrus from this operation 12 land use classes were obtained forests greenhouses and orchards were prevalent and five soil types ranging from clay to loam agricultural practices i e tillage operations fertilization irrigation and inflow from uwds were also included in the model setup the surface runoff was estimated by using the modified soil conservation service curve number method united states department of agriculture soil conservation service 1972 and the hargreaves method was adopted for assessing the potential evapotranspiration pet hargreaves 1975 the latter method was selected since climatic data such as daily relative humidity wind velocity and solar radiation required for applying other methods e g penman monteith equation were not available more details about swat model and the theory of the processes modelled are reported in neitsch et al 2011 and abdelwahab et al 2018 3 2 1 model calibration the paucity and the lack of continuity of measured streamflow for the nil wadi made it necessary to use the full dataset for the calibration arsenault et al 2018 before calibrating the model the swat cup sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm was used to carry out the sensitivity analysis rouholahnejad et al 2012 arnold et al 2012 malagó et al 2017 the parameters related to the exchange of water between surface and groundwater were the most sensitive parameters table 2 the model was manually calibrated by modifying the sensitive parameters one at a time with the aim to improve the correspondence between the patterns of measured and simulated hydrographs ricci et al 2020b jeong et al 2010 tables ii in addition considering the aim of the present study the observed and the simulated flow duration curves fdc were compared in order to better identify the phases of the flow regime where measured streamflow qobs differed with simulated streamflow qsim i e high intermediate and low flow for successive adaptation of the model nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias were used to assess the model performances moriasi et al 2007 3 3 zero flow threshold typically hydrological models tend to overestimate the extremely low flow conditions kirkby et al 2011 in this work to understand if the low flow simulated by the model was realistic qsim and qobs were analysed by using the flow duration curve indeed in temporary rivers the low flow and dry phases assume great importance since these phases influence the biological community assemblage biological metrics that explain the richness of aquatic communities typically decline when flow intermittence increases regardless of the human pressures munné et al 2021 if qsim overestimates qobs the flow regime classification based on qsim could be incorrect de girolamo et al 2017b for this reason in the present work it was identified the zero flow zf threshold following the approach adopted by de girolamo et al 2015a to adapt the model zf threshold is the qsim that corresponds to the absence of streamflow this value is site specific it depends on the physical characteristics of the reach i e geology river bed hydraulic conductivity channel width vegetation and on the intrinsic limits of the conceptual model in a river reach once zf has been established simulated streamflow below the zf value is assumed to be zero to identify the zf threshold free historical satellite images were extracted from google earth for the entire river network in order to identify the perennial and temporary river reaches upstream along the nil wadi to its headwaters the river network was partially visible due to the presence of forest from the historical images the main course of the nil wadi where visible was found always in the flowing phase however field surveys and local citizen interviews revealed that some river reaches of the nil wadi were perennials due to the presence of natural springs and others were intermittent from satellite images and from field investigations the boukaraa and saayoud wadis showed a temporary character for the latter tributaries the images with no flow for the period 2019 were extracted for some selected river reaches and compared with the calibrated qsim in order to identify an average value of the zf threshold indeed several different values of zf were detected however taking into account the uncertainty in satellite image interpretation for each of the selected reaches the average of the values detected from june to september was assumed as the zf threshold lastly at the outlet of the river basin the zf threshold was computed as the sum of the zfs defined for the tributaries boukaraa and saayoud for each of the selected river reaches the zf was subtracted from the simulated streamflow for the period june to september before characterising the flow regime when the result of the subtraction was negative the streamflow was set to zero 3 4 characterising hydrological regime in recent years several methodologies have been developed to characterise flow regimes and to classify river types richter et al 1996 oueslati et al 2015 d ambrosio et al 2017 almost all the methodologies are based on a number of hydrological indicators his that are able to describe specific components of the flow regime i e duration magnitude rate of change timing predictability richter et al 1996 the his are computed by using time series of daily or monthly streamflow the nature conservancy 2009 for temporary rivers which are characterised by large inter annual variability in streamflow bisantino et al 2010 de girolamo et al 2015b fortesa et al 2021 at least 20 years of streamflow data should be used in order to include a variety of hydrological conditions i e wet and dry years de girolamo et al 2015c in the present work in order to support water resources managers and river ecologists in assessing the ecological status a new procedure for classifying river types and for characterising the flow regime was tested in the boukaraa basin three river reaches were selected where the new approach developed by gallart et al 2017 was applied by using the open source software trehs the approach was tested by using simulated streamflow data in addition the trehs was applied with observations from google earth the divergence between the two classifications of flow regime simulated and observed represented the uncertainty due to input data 3 4 1 estimating regime of temporary rivers when data are unavailable trehs tool gallart et al 2012 2016 developed the temporary rivers ecological and hydrological status trehs tool for assisting the operational implementation of the water framework directive wfd ec 2000 in temporary rivers the approach was specifically developed for characterizing flow regimes in ungauged or poorly gauged river basins trehs provides the temporary regime plot trs a fast graphical method to classify the flow regime of river reaches on the basis of their degree of temporariness through two metrics trs delineate the following classification perennial p perennial flowing except on rare occasions intermittent pools i p discontinuous flow with only pools in the dry season intermittent dry i d lack of surface water during dry season and ephemeral e episodic flow permanence two metrics are used as coordinate in the trs plot the flow permanence mf which is the long term mean annual relative number of months with the flow and the six month predictability of zero flow periods sd6 which is the difference of one minus the ratio between the multi annual frequency of occurrence of the zero flow months in the wet semester and the frequency of the zero flow months in the dry semester gallart et al 2012 both are computed on monthly streamflow data trehs also allows classifying flow regime of temporary rivers taking into account the aquatic phases such as flow permanence disconnected pools permanence and dry river bed permanence which are very important for aquatic life through mf and two additional metrics the dry channel permanence md which is the long term mean annual relative number of months without flow and the pool permanence mp which is the long term mean annual relative number of months when isolated pools occur md mf and mp reported on the three main axes in the triangular graph fpd classify temporary river regime into nine different aquatic phases regimes p quasi perennial qp alternate fluent af fluent stagnant fs stagnant st alternate stagnant as alternate al occasional oc episodic ep gallart et al 2017 finally based on the assumption that the flow regime is the most important variable influencing aquatic life and that it determines the occurrence of mesohabitats in a reach gallart et al 2012 2017 defined six mesohabitats called aquatic states ass hyperrheic flood eurheic high or normal flow oligorheic low flow or pools connected arheic flow almost zero or pools disconnected hyporheic absence of surface flow with the only hyporheic flow and edaphic surface and hyporheic flow absent hyporheic and edaphic may be resumed as dry since characterised by no flow the tool was tested in spain munné et al 2021 and the outputs were found very useful for adequately assessing hydrological and ecological status in temporary rivers allowing to distinguish different habitats according to biological community pattern for management purposes in the present work the ass were determined by using mf and sd6 and the streamflow threshold values between the different ass were defined with the aid of the fdcs and with field observations as described by gallart et al 2012 in particular the flow threshold value between the conditions defined hyperrheic and eurheic was assumed equal to qsim corresponding to 5 of exceedance frequency in the fdc the threshold between eurheic and oligorheic was assumed equal to qsim corresponding to the flex in the fdc meanwhile the other thresholds were defined based on field surveys 4 results 4 1 modelling streamflow the swat model was run from 2000 to 2020 on a daily scale for the calibration period october 2019 to october 2020 pbias was satisfactory 24 12 indicating an underestimation of streamflow moriasi et al 2007 r2 and nse were 0 40 and 0 35 respectively similar results were reported in mediterranean areas ricci et al 2018 and in small watersheds spruill et al 2000 these results were acceptable for daily streamflow simulations arnold et al 2012 and for regions with limited data availability zema et al 2016 since measured data were non continuous over the calibration period it was difficult to identify and compare all the hydrograph components i e rising limb falling limb fig 3a however the comparison between the measured and the simulated data fig 3a showed that the model was able to predict the highest peak flow with a slight overestimation october 2019 115 m3s 1 versus 118 m3s 1 the comparison of the fdcs qsim and qobs in fig 3b supplementary material s1 showed that the high flow 0 20 of flow exceedance was well simulated by the model as well as part of the normal flow 75 90 however the normal flow from 20 to 75 of flow exceedance was underestimated by the model meanwhile the low flow 90 100 of flow exceedance was overestimated taking into account the importance of the low flow and the dry phase for flow regime characterisation a correction of the qsim series before calculating hydrological metrics was adopted by subtracting the zf from the qsim from june to september as reported in the following paragraph from 2000 2020 at the basin scale the mean annual precipitation was 1005 mm the results confirmed that the mediterranean rainfall regime is highly variable from one year to another indeed total annual rainfall was 479 mm and 1431 mm in 2000 driest year and 2013 wettest year respectively these results highlighted that long time series should be used to characterise the flow regime in the mediterranean region the wet season started in september and ended in march rainfall often overcoming 100 mm from november to february the dry season started in may and ended in august july was the driest month mean monthly rainfall 19 94 mm the average yearly surface runoff was 244 mm 2 35 m3 s 1 24 3 of rainfall infiltration was 231 mm 22 9 of the rainfall evapotranspiration was 530 mm 52 8 of the rainfall and total water yield was 475 mm 47 36 of the rainfall 4 2 zero flow threshold google earth images were analysed from 2007 to 2020 fig 4 aiming at identifying where and when the river network was dry along the boukaraa wadi the total number of clear images was 24 the dry conditions were found all over along the main course of the boukaraa in ten images taken mostly from june to september nine supplementary material s2 a similar number of images 25 was extracted for the saayoud wadi but only seven images showed the dry conditions six of which were taken in summer data not shown the zf thresholds were define in three river reaches along the main stream of the boukaraa wadi r28 r121 r157 and on a river reach of the saayoud wadi fig 5 for the boukaraa the monthly zf thresholds ranged from 0 051 m3s 1 to 0 082 m3s 1 at the reach r157 where zf resulted 0 072 m3s 1 average value and from 0 066 m3s 1 to 0 098 m3s 1 at the reach r121 where zf resulted 0 084 m3s 1 average for the reach r28 which was located at the confluence with the nil wadi the average monthly zf resulted 0 084 m3s 1 the zf threshold estimated for the saayoud wadi r45 was 0 107 m3s 1 mean flow from june to september fig 5 this value was assumed also at the confluence with the nil wadi at the outlet of the nil wadi catchment zf was 0 192 m3s 1 computed as the sum of the zfs of the two tributaries boukaraa r28 and zf saayoud r45 supplementary material s3 the zf threshold was subtracted from the simulated streamflow at the corresponding river reaches from june to september to improve the simulated extreme low flow before classifying flow regime supplementary material s3 when the result of the subtraction was negative the streamflow was set equal to zero 4 3 hydrological regime the flow regime of the boukaraa was characterised in three selected reaches along the main course of the river r28 r121 r157 in fig 5 the flow regime of reach r28 and reach r121 was classified as i p both by using the qsim and the observations from google earth for evaluating the metrics mf and sd6 fig 6a the upstream reach r157 in fig 5 was classified as i p by using the observed data in computing the metrics and i d by using modeled data however over the long period the classification based on modeled data ranged from i d to i p the different classification may be explained by the different periods over which the metrics mf and sd6 were evaluated or it could be due to the overestimation of the zf threshold the values of the metric sd6 were equal to 1 for all the three reaches when using observed data fig 6a meanwhile the values computed on the basis of qsim were lower 0 67 0 94 these results can be explained by the exiguous number of google earth s images covering winter and spring seasons that could have determined the multi annual frequency of occurrence of the zero flow months in the wet semester equal to zero which in turn determined sd6 1 the values of the sd6 computed by using qsim were based on the long and continuous time series for which the frequency of zero flow months for the contiguous six wetter months was 0 based on the results of the present study it can be concluded that over the long period the boukaraa can be classified as an i p river except for the upstream river reaches that show a hydrological gradient from i p and i d supplementary material s5 s6 s7 the fpd plot in fig 6b was developed in order to show the aquatic phases such as flow disconnected pools and dry bed reaches located upstream and in the middle course r157 r121 showed alternate fluent aquatic phases af both by using qsim and observations from google earth meanwhile the downstream river segment r28 showed a gradient from af and fluent stagnant fs the ass were analysed in the three selected reaches along the main course of the boukaraa wadi r28 r121 r157 in fig 5 over the long period by using qsim data the flow threshold values between the diverse ass are summarised in table 3 as expected the frequency of occurrence of the ass through the year was similar in the three reaches fig 7 results showed that the as defined as hyperrheic flood occurred in winter january to april with the highest frequency in february 19 23 blue color in fig 7d e f from november to may the eurheic high or normal flow was the as with the highest frequency of occurrence 61 95 in all the selected reaches the ass oligorheic low flow or pools connected green in fig 7d e f and arheic flow almost zero or pools disconnected yellow in fig 7 mainly occurred from may to october the dry condition that includes hyporheic absence of surface flow with the only hyporheic flow and edaphic surface and hyporheic flow absent brown in fig 7d e f mainly occurred in summer with a very high frequency in august 66 70 annex a shows a collection of google earth images representing the ass for the analysed reaches supplementary materials s4 s5 s6 report the results of the trehs for the reaches r28 r121 r157 respectively the ecological status evaluation based on the wfd standard method which has been developed for perennial rivers needs samplings in eurheic or oligorheic states hence based on the results of the present study samplings are not recommended to be planned in summer for the reaches r121 and r157 since both reaches are usually dry when a reach is dry or when only pools are present biological methods are not applicable and therefore other methods must be applied i e hydrogeological and terrestrial fauna prat et al 2014 gallart et al 2017 munné et al 2021 5 discussion in the past decades the paucity of data for setting up the hydrological models constituted a limitation in modelling applications nowadays regional datasets such as the harmonised world soil database fischer et al 2008 global gridded soil hengl et al 2017 shuttle radar topography mission strm usgs eros archive 2000 global land cover esa 2017 national centers for environmental prediction ncep and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr weather data fuka et al 2013 may be used to integrate available data in countries with limited data availability in this work for the model set up the input files land use map soil map and hydraulic properties climate data were defined by merging the existing data recorded in the study area with the above mentioned regional datasets as reported through the paper table i the regional databases have allowed simulating flow regime and water balance in the nil wadi catchment which otherwise would not have been possible to predict however it is important to highlight that a lower statistical model performance is expected when using regional databases instead of measured data the results of the streamflow calibration showed a satisfactory value for pbias meanwhile r2 and nse were unsatisfactory according to the criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2007 which are the most common criteria adopted for perennial rivers and in general for well monitored areas however for mediterranean river basins hydrological processes prediction is a challenge due to the extremely low flow and to the intermittency of streamflow sachse et al 2017 for these reasons several authors reputed nse 0 35 as satisfactory values van liew and garbrecht 2003 zema et al 2016 the causes that could have determined the low performances in this work were examined in detail and are discussed below the swat model was calibrated by using the discrete data of the streamflow recorded with the float method dobriyal et al 2017 and hundt and blasch 2019 pointed out that this method could not correctly represent the actual streamflow especially when the velocity between the streamflow layers is turbulent it is reasonable to assume that flow measurements may be affected by a certain uncertainty degree that may have influenced the model performances it is well known that weather data i e location and the number of gauging stations play a key role in the hydrological modelling especially in mediterranean region where rainfall is characterised by a high spatial gradient and where the events are frequently localised in small areas convective regime abdelwahab et al 2016 fortesa et al 2021 ricci et al 2022 romano et al 2018 ehlers et al 2019 pointed out that model uncertainty increases with the decrease of the number of gauging stations in swat modelling applications the location of the weather stations is particularly important since the model attributes a unique weather station to each subbasin with the centroid method that is based on the distance between the station and the centroid of the subbasin hence when the number of rainfall gauges is limited as in the present case study the model can generate an incorrect distribution of the weather stations across the basin ruan et al 2016 abdelwahab et al 2018 indeed only two weather gauging stations which were located outside the watershed were available in the nil wadi to overcome this limit two transposed weather stations were created by changing the longitude of the real gauging stations in order to attribute the jijel achouat station 46 m a s l and the col fedoules station 891 m to the subbasins of the plain and hilly mountainous areas respectively for the nil wadi catchment an enhancement of the hydro meteorological monitoring network is desirable on a local and regional scale for a better management of the water resources the comparison of the fdcs designed with qsim and qobs showed that the low flow was overestimated by the model this result confirmed previous studies that identified the low flow as a critical point in hydrological modelling kirkby et al 2011 several factors such as topography water exchange between groundwater and surface water land management practices and model structure determine the low flow the quantification of low flow and duration of the dry condition is needed to manage water resources especially in semi arid river basins where specific measures are needed to mitigate the socioeconomic and ecological impacts of water shortages nicolle et al 2015 for this reason several studies have been carried out to improve the performance of the swat model in simulating the low flow for instance adopting a seasonal calibration scheme calibrating separately two seasons lévesque et al 2008 muleta 2012 ricci et al 2018 zangh et al 2015 or using a different cn in the dormant and growing season white et al 2009 guse et al 2013 modified the groundwater module since the groundwater and evaporation parameters were the main causes of the unsatisfactory performances of the swat model in simulating the low flow in lowland watersheds in the present work to improve the low flow simulation the approach based on the zf threshold was adopted de girolamo et al 2017b it consists of a simple correction of the streamflow subtracting the zf value from the simulated streamflow during the dry months from june to september the threshold identification is a difficult task and the zf values which are site specific can be affected by a large uncertainty in the present work google earth images turned out to be crucial in identifying the zf thresholds however some river reaches were covered by dense vegetation and the flow type conditions i e dry continuous flow could not be detected to overcome this limit local citizens should be involved in monitoring and in defining flow regime since they have a wide knowledge of the local environment for intermittent and ephemeral streams the contribution of volunteers in mapping the continuity of streamflow has already been adopted with success in some countries datry et al 2016 in addition new methods could be used to monitor the occurrence of water in some river sections such as low cost temperature or electrical conductivity sensors chapin et al 2014 gallart et al 2016 the implementation of the wfd in southern europe highlighted several difficulties in managing the temporary rivers since the intermittence of the streamflow has not been adequately considered in the wfd several authors pointed out that the biological community assemblages did not completely fit in temporary rivers and they suggest considering additional hydrological parameters to the river type classification defined in the wfd sánchez montoya et al 2007 munné and prat 2011 prat et al 2014 buffagni et al 2020 the new river type classification proposed by gallart et al 2012 2017 differentiates the river segments on the basis of the habitats that have importance for river ecology identifying those types of rivers such as stagnant st or alternate stagnant as that need new biological metrics for assessing ecological status the trehs software proved to be a useful tool that can be implemented also in regions with limited data availability by using simulated data and google earth images however the present work highlights that a long time series of streamflow is needed for characterising the flow regime of a temporary river since it has great inter annual variability in the mediterranean region in the study area the google earth images covered a long period 2007 2020 but their frequency was not uniform throughout the year in addition several images were not clear and therefore not included in this study the number of images and their dating may influence the river type classification the river reaches analysed in the boukaraa basin were classified as i p the classification obtained by using simulated data was in good agreement with observed ones except for the reach r157 which was classified as i p by using the observed data and i d by using modeled data the discrepancy in river type classification could partially be due to the small number of images and to the different periods that covered simulated and observed data respectively these results indicated that the flow regime classification may be affected by uncertainty when using trehs both with simulated streamflow data and with google earth images the ass frequency graphs elaborated for the boukaraa provided general information about the occurrence of the specific flow conditions in the selected river reaches that are fundamental for fixing the calendar of samplings based on the results it is not recommended to plan the samplings in summer for the reaches r121 and r157 since both reaches are usually dry the multiannual frequency of occurrence of the ass is an important piece of information that is necessary but not sufficient for a correct interpretation of the relationships between flow regime and biological communities development de girolamo et al 2015c at this aim it is required an analysis of the ass occurred a few weeks before the biological samplings buffagni et al 2020 the methodology presented in this study has great potential in water resources management in the next decades climate change population and economic growth will have a strong impact on water resources in mediterranean region with severe implications on the ecosystem environment and socio economic sectors the calibrated model may be used for assessing the potential impacts of climate change on water resources availability and on the flow regime indeed the model proved to be a fundamental tool for assessing the impact of water consumption on water bodies both in terms of quantity and quality boulay et al 2018 d ambrosio et al 2020b 6 conclusions temporary rivers are very common river systems in the mediterranean region and in view of climate change it is expected an increase of their extension in the future decades the management of temporary rivers has been identified as a challenge in several countries especially under the mediterranean climate in order to support critical issues in managing temporary rivers several studies and eu research projects have been carried out this study provides a contribution to the unsolved question of the management of temporary rivers the work addressed the flow regime characterization in regions with limited data availability and tested an approach for supporting river ecologists in the ecological status assessment results of the present work showed that in regions with limited data availability is possible to carry out eco hydrological studies integrating data from regional databases google earth images field surveys and modelling activities the swat model is able to simulate hydrology in temporary river systems but the extreme low flow and the absence of streamflow are critical points in simulating streamflow the model was adapted to better represent these phases of flow regime through the introduction of a threshold which was identified for a number of selected reaches with the aid of images from google earth and that was subtracted from the simulated streamflow values from june to september flow regime was characterised for supporting ecological status assessment by using a new approach that identified flowing pools and dry phases the trehs software proved to be a useful tool that can be implemented also in regions with limited data availability by using simulated data and google earth images it provides useful information to river ecologists for planning biological samplings and evaluating the ecological status of temporary rivers this work shows that coupling modelling and field activities it is possible to characterise flow regime also in case of limited data and economic resources however the river classification and flow regime characterization based on simulated streamflow and data from satellite images may be affected by uncertainty the latter can be reduced by involving local citizens and enhancing the hydro meteorological monitoring network on the local and regional scales further studies are needed to

7949,study region eight rivers regulated by large dams located in three hydro climatic zones along the chilean latitudinal gradient study focus we performed a multi temporal scale analysis of flow records and we used data from official gauging stations to characterise the non altered and the altered river regimes to determine the magnitude and persistence of the hydrological alteration downstream from large dams in chile these analyses provide relevant information to improve the understanding of such alterations and a conceptual basis for assessing future impacts as the country plans to build a series of large dams in the coming years new hydrological insights for the region the mean annual runoff was reduced in all the study rivers the monthly flows of the rivers from the northern arid zone were the most affected by the dams the magnitude and frequency of floods decreased in all the study rivers moreover northern drier river systems did not recover their hydrological conditions in the distance downstream of the dams probably due to transmission losses and water extractions and diversions in contrast southern rivers partially recovered their flow regimes with distance downstream mainly due to the inflows from permanent non regulated tributaries so far this is the first study in chile that comprehensively analyses the hydrological effects of large dams

et al 2014 in chile there is a north south climate transition from arid to semi arid to mediterranean and to a humid temperate condition miller 1976 this transition results from the latitudinal gradient that influences changes in ocean and atmospheric temperatures through the main modes of variability such as the el niño southern oscillation enso responsible for the variability of year by year rainfall rutllant and fuenzalida 1991 or the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which generates interdecadal variability garreaud et al 2009 climate projections and simulations for chile forecast a decrease in rainfall especially for the north central area and therefore also a decrease of the total water availability garreaud et al 2017 boisier et al 2018 in the climate transition between the arid north and the temperate humid south there are 26 large reservoirs i e with a capacity 20 hm3 dga 2016 which results in a total storage capacity of approximately 12 900 hm3 i e 1 hm3 1 106 m3 corresponding to 1 4 of the country s total annual runoff the north central area 28 s 36 s concentrates an important part of the chilean irrigated agriculture whereas in the south central area 35 s 42 s more than 70 of the country s hydropower is generated muñoz et al 2016 the effects of regulation are also related to the progressive changes in water availability and water and soil use in the basin and their management in chile unlike in other countries private water rights are granted generating a supply demand market donoso 2006 in addition besides the chilean water authority other institutions courts of justice livestock agricultural service have the power to grant water rights as well as far as we know hydrological alteration downstream from large dams has not been assessed in chile yet and only one study focuses on the morphological effects of rivers affected by dams alcayaga et al 2019 in this context the main objective of this work is to determine the magnitude of the hydrological changes generated by large reservoirs in chile the overarching hypothesis of the study is that the magnitude of impacts at the various temporal scales follows a latitudinal thus climatic gradient along the study area with the dammed rivers in the driest zones being impacted more in comparison with their humid counterparts we acknowledge that other factors such as land use change or for instance the evaporation from reservoirs also influence the hydrological response of river systems particularly at the annual scale water budget the present work may constitute the basis for a further analysis of these other topics which are however out of the scope of this paper to further develop the main objective as well as to test the hypothesis two specific objectives are addressed i to determine whether the patterns of change relate to the location latitude hence climate of the different basins and ii to analyse the recovery of river regime components downstream from reservoirs in relation to inflows from tributaries as a further step to tackle the objectives we quantified the changes in the hydrological regime due to the presence of dams at different time scales annual monthly daily flood all this in eight rivers located in seven basins distributed in a latitudinal gradient between the antofagasta and the biobío regions fig 1 the comparison between altered and non altered flows in gauging stations close to dams contributed to the response of the specific objective i while the analysis of discharge data series from tributaries downstream from the dam contributed to the development of the specific objective ii 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in chilean rivers regulated by large reservoirs with storage capacities 20 hm3 located between 23º s and 38 s fig 1 left despite all the data series from chilean rivers regulated by large dams were initially gathered some of them were discarded from the analyses because flow records were too short and or incomplete hence the final database for this study was composed by eight rivers from north to south loa copiapó huasco elqui teno bullileo cato and biobío the first seven except for the elqui are regulated by only one reservoir whereas the elqui and biobío rivers are regulated by two and three reservoirs respectively the cato is in addition a particular case i e it is regulated by the digua reservoir and receives water through an artificial channel the digua canal this channel has a flow capacity of 25 m3 s 1 and diverts water from the longaví river to fill the reservoir between may and september to feed demands at the beginning of the irrigation season october to december the basins are distributed in three of the four so called climate macrozones as established by the dirección general de aguas of chile dga 2016 the loa copiapó huasco and elqui rivers are located in the northern zone characterised by an arid to semi arid climate with little rainfall increasing in a southerly direction and a mean annual precipitation of 87 mm yr 1 in the andean upper basins the teno cato and bullileo rivers are in the central zone with a mediterranean climate and a mean annual precipitation of 943 mm yr 1 concentrated in winter and a prolonged 7 to 8 month dry season the biobío river is in the southern zone which is characterised by a temperate rainy to rainy maritime climate with abundant precipitation increasing to the south mean 2420 mm yr 1 there are no rivers regulated by such large dams south of the biobío historical precipitation data from 7 rainfall stations located near the reservoirs records available in cr 2 climate explorer http www cr2 cl camels cl last accessed march 2018 alvarez garreton et al 2018 do not show significant trends in the study period see table s1 in supplementary material so precipitation is not considered an influential factor on the observed flow trends moreover the interannual variability and the alternation between dry and wet periods are also intrinsic characteristics of these climatic macrozones in chile and they are well represented in the study periods selected for the hydrological analysis carried out in this study see fig s1 in supplementary material the loa river has a pluvial regime influenced by summer rains december to march vuille 1999 associated with the so called bolivian winter the copiapó huasco and elqui rivers have a mixed regime snow fed in the upper basin and pluvial in the lower part of the basin without a clear predominance between river regimes however in the fluviometric gauges selected for this study the largest flows occur in early summer november to december because of the snowmelt in the andes mountains and therefore they are considered to have a snow fed regime the teno river has a nivo pluvial regime while the bullileo and cato rivers have a clear pluvial regime finally the biobío has two flow peaks the largest in the winter months june to september and the second in the summer months december to march therefore it corresponds to a pluvial nival regime masiokas et al 2019 basin areas range between 6331 km2 and 33 081 km2 all basins have granted water rights which implies consumptive water diversions for irrigation and mining the latter mainly in the northern zone and water resources to grant new rights are still available the reservoirs were built between 1937 and 2004 and their storage capacity varies between 22 hm3 the conchi in the loa river and 1174 hm3 the ralco in the biobío river stored water is mostly used for irrigation and only the biobío reservoirs ralco pangue and angostura are intended for hydroelectric power generation see more details in table 1 changes in the hydrology of the biobío river were examined only until 2013 because data recorded after the construction of the third dam angostura 2014 was too short to be included in the analyses table 1 2 2 data collection and analysis daily flow records were obtained from the chilean dirección general de aguas database www dga cl analyses were carried out comparing flow data measured for the same time periods obtained in gauging stations upstream and downstream from the dam spatial analysis hereafter in both the loa and copiapó rivers as well as comparing the flows recorded in different time periods at the same gauging station before and after the construction of the dam i e pre dam and post dam temporal analysis hereafter in the huasco elqui teno bullileo and biobío rivers table 1 to analyse the data and interpret the results we grouped the rivers according to the previously described hydro climatic zones the cato river which is regulated by a reservoir fed by an artificial channel was analysed independently and not included in the regionalisation of the rivers by hydro climatic zones finally and in order to assess the differences between the results obtained through the two approximations a comparison between the spatial analysis and the temporal analysis was performed for the huasco and elqui rivers table 1 the study rivers were chosen according to the quality of the flow records from the gauging stations based on two strict selection criteria i e to be considered gauging stations must have i at least 95 of the daily data in each hydrological year from april 1 to march 31 in the southern hemisphere and ii have records of at least 5 years in length it is important to remark thus that despite the inevitable gaps and the relatively short length of some of the series all the available data in chile has been used to undertake the present analysis see fig s2 supplementary material the analyses of discharge series recorded at gauging stations located downstream of the reservoirs were carried out to assess whether the river systems partially or completely recover to pre construction hydrological conditions the number of gauging stations selected to assess the recovery downstream depended on the availability of flow records for the same periods table 2 2 3 degree of regulation to characterise the degree of alteration of the river regime downstream from a reservoir the impoundment ratio ir index proposed by batalla et al 2004 was used the ir is calculated as the ratio between the capacity of the reservoir and the annual runoff of the upstream basin it is a dimensionless value that is equivalent to the average time in years of water residence in the reservoir i e an ir 1 indicates that the capacity of the reservoir is greater than the average annual runoff and the dams have a hyper annual regulation capacity for the rivers regulated by more than one reservoir the sum of individual storage capacities was considered for the spatial analyses in this study the capacity of the reservoir used to calculate the ir corresponds to the total capacity as we were not able to subtract the dead storage capacity of the reservoirs information not available for this reason the ir might amplify the potential effects of a dam on a river s hydrology it is also worth to remark that ir measures the maximum possible impact of the dam on the river rather than the actual impact of the dam owing its particular operational processes the former basically depends on dams dimension whereas the latter varies according to the actual operations of the dam i e water level hence volume fluctuation across the year ir is thus a fix metric and works independently of dam operation this way it can be used as a bases for comparison elsewhere regardless climate and particular characteristics and functioning of the dam keeping its power as a general and comparable dam impact descriptor 2 4 indicators of hydrological change at multiple scales the indexes and variables used to analyse the hydrological alteration due to dams have been adopted from previous articles batalla et al 2004 kondolf and batalla 2005 piqué et al 2016 a summary of the applicability of these indexes and their implications for river processes and ecology is included in table 3 2 4 1 annual scale for the analysis of the annual changes the mean annual runoff r hm3 yr 1 for the non altered and altered flow series was calculated and the percentage of change was determined as follows eq 1 1 δ r altered r non altered r non altered x 100 to assess whether changes in runoff are statistically significant non parametric tests were applied accepting an error of 5 the mann whitney test wilcoxon w was used to compare two periods while the kruskal wallis test was used to compare three periods as in the case of the biobío river a year by year comparison using eq 1 was made for the mean annual runoff changes just for the rivers spatially analysed loa and copiapó rivers the comparison was made only for the years where discharge data were simultaneously available for the upstream and downstream gauges from each considered dam furthermore changes in the flow regimes m3 s 1 were evaluated by means of a correlation coefficient which allows the determination of the degree of alteration of the monthly flow pattern between altered and non altered flow series eq 2 2 ɸ pre post σ pre post σ pre x σ post where σpre post is the covariance between the non altered and altered mean monthly flows m3 s 1 σpre is the standard deviation of the non altered mean monthly flow m3 s 1 and σpre is the standard deviation of the altered mean monthly flow m3 s 1 this coefficient varies between 1 and 1 i e a value equal to 1 indicates a complete reversal of the flow regime while a value equal to 1 indicates that there is no change in the monthly discharge q distribution 2 4 2 monthly scale the percentage of change between the non altered and altered mean maximum monthly specific q m3 s 1 km 2 for each month was calculated using eq 3 3 δ q altered q non altered q non altered x 100 mean maximum monthly specific discharges are the mean value of the maximum flows per unit area measured in a specific month in all the water years of each altered and non altered period 2 4 3 daily scale to assess changes on a daily scale flow duration curves were elaborated for each discharge record and representative discharges m3 s 1 equalling or exceeding the discharge 5 16 50 85 and 95 of the time p5 p16 p50 p84 and p95 percentiles respectively were derived as examples p95 corresponds to a discharge that equalled or exceeded the discharge 95 of the time and exemplifies a low flow p50 represents the median of the discharges and p5 represents high or flood flow events to assess the variability of the discharges non altered altered and their alteration due to the presence of reservoirs the standard deviation in relation to the mean discharge was calculated through the fsd flow standard deviation variability index see details in batalla et al 2004 4 fsd p 84 p 16 p 95 p 5 p 50 indicating that the higher the fsd the more variability exists between daily flow data 2 4 4 flood scale in order to determine the changes in the magnitude and frequency of floods discharges m3 s 1 associated with characteristic return periods of 2 5 and 10 years were estimated these relatively low flood magnitudes are generally the most affected by river regulation and are those that define the formation and dynamism of the channels and their ability to transport sediments batalla et al 2004 piqué et al 2016 frequency analyses were performed by means of the gumbel probability function pizarro et al 2014 using the hydrological analysis software retorno2 http www flumen upc edu es documentacion software developed by the universitat politècnica de catalunya with the estimated q for the different return periods the δ dimensional index was calculated batalla et al 2004 5 δ q a l t e r e d q n o n a l t e r e d where δ 1 indicates that there are no changes in the magnitude of flows and the lower the value of δ the greater the changes 3 results 3 1 hydrological changes downstream from dams the impoundment ratio ir index varied between 0 01 and 1 16 table 4 although the ir did not follow a clear latitudinal pattern the highest values were found generally in the northern zone between 0 49 and 1 16 the irs of the central zone rivers i e the teno and bullileo were 0 06 and 0 13 respectively in the case of the biobío river the only analysed river in the southern zone the ir was 0 01 considering the first constructed reservoir pangue year 1996 i e the post1 period in table 4 whereas after the construction of the second reservoir ralco year 2004 i e the post2 period in table 4 the ir increased to 0 08 together with an increase in the total storage capacity after the closure of the dam high flows p5 were reduced in six of the seven rivers except the loa as shown in daily flow duration curves low flows p95 declined in the loa copiapó and teno rivers and increased in the huasco elqui and bullileo rivers after the dam closures fig 2 in the case of the biobío river low flows decreased only after the closure of the first dam pangue 1996 post1 and increased after the closure of the second dam ralco 2004 post2 fig 2 3 1 1 changes at the annual scale the mean annual runoff was reduced in the 7 rivers between 0 37 and 55 5 table 4 and in general no north south pattern was observed according to the wilcoxon and kruskal wallis tests the changes were statistically significant when the reduction in runoff exceeded ca 25 the copiapó northern zone bullileo central zone and biobío southern zone rivers showed statistically significant reductions table 4 in the latter case after the construction of the first reservoir pangue 1996 post1 the mean annual runoff was reduced by 20 from 2114 mm yr 1 to 1698 mm yr 1 and after the construction of the second reservoir ralco 2004 post2 the mean annual runoff was further reduced by 25 from 2114 mm yr 1 to 1574 mm yr 1 see fig s3 in supplementary material the interannual variation in the mean annual runoff between the upstream and downstream gauging stations of the reservoir in the loa river mainly showed a reduction in downstream runoff between ca 1 and 29 although in two years 1990 and 2005 the mean annual runoff was higher downstream in the loa a significant positive linear relationship p value 0 05 was found between the mean annual upstream runoff and the mean annual downstream runoff which explained 68 of the variability in the mean annual downstream runoff in the case of the copiapó the mean annual runoff downstream of the reservoir was reduced in all years reductions between 4 and 88 in this river a non statistically significant relationship was found between the mean annual analysis spatial runoff see fig s4 in supplementary material 3 1 2 changes at the monthly scale the alteration of monthly discharges m3 s 1 according to the ɸ pre post index was greater in the northern rivers with values between 0 04 and 0 89 table 5 the rivers of the central zone teno and bullileo had ɸ pre post of 0 98 and 0 76 respectively in the case of the biobío the modification of the monthly regime was relatively low after the construction of the first reservoir pangue 1996 post1 the value of ɸ pre post was 0 96 and with the construction of the second reservoir ralco 2004 post2 the index ɸ pre post was reduced to 0 92 table 5 it should be noted that there is no reversion in the monthly regime in the studied rivers a positive statistically significant linear relation p 0 05 was found between the latitude of the basins and the ɸ pre post index fig 3a the closer to the wet southern zone the lower the impact on the monthly regime a negative linear relationship was generated between the ir independent variable and ɸ pre post index dependent variable being non significant for individual river values fig 3b and significant considering zone averages fig 3c in general the higher the degree of regulation ir the lower the value of ɸ pre post the maximum monthly specific discharges m3 s 1 km 2 were reduced by between 2 and 88 in all the study rivers mainly between april and september autumn winter table 5 in the north the highest reductions were found in the loa in june 59 and march 59 and in the copiapó in june 59 and may 58 in the central zone the highest reduction occurred in the bullileo in may 88 and june 82 in the south the biobío showed the highest reductions in may and june 65 and 48 respectively post2 in general the loa north copiapó north and bullileo centre rivers recorded five months with reductions of more than 50 in monthly maximum specific discharges conversely in the northern zone there was an increase in the maximum monthly unit discharges in the spring months october december and in the summer months january march in the loa and elqui rivers in the central zone the maximum increase in monthly flows took place in the bullileo in february 203 and march 218 whereas in the southern zone biobío the increase varied between months in general the increase did not exceed 11 3 1 3 changes at the daily scale the flow standard deviation fsd under non altered conditions ranged between 1 8 and 18 whereas it varied between 2 9 and 7 1 under altered flow conditions two of the four rivers in the northern zone showed less flow variability after the dam closure as did the two rivers in the central zone the biobío showed greater flow variability after the closure of the first dam mostly related to the reduction of the base flow pangue 1996 post1 afterwards i e after the construction of the second dam the flow variability newly decreased a fact that can be associated with the increment of the base flow in the case of high flows they were reduced after the construction of both dams table 5 the huasco north and bullileo centre rivers greatly reduced the variability of flow after the dam closure and conversely the teno river centre showed the lowest flow variability 3 1 4 changes of flood frequency and magnitude the alteration in the magnitude and frequency of the floods also did not follow a north to south pattern the seven rivers showed a reduction in the magnitude of q 2 after the construction of the reservoirs which ranged from δ 0 34 to δ 0 90 i e a decrease of 66 10 respectively a reduction in the magnitude of q 5 after the construction of the reservoirs also occurred in the seven rivers and ranged from δ 0 36 to δ 0 92 i e a decrease of 64 8 respectively and similar changes were found in the magnitude of q 10 the bullileo river centre was the most affected with values of δ 0 34 for q 2 and δ 0 36 for q 5 and q 10 i e decreases of 66 and 64 respectively table 6 and see table 2 supplementary material the biobío river south was the only river that showed an increase in the magnitudes of q 5 and q 10 and this happened with the construction in 1996 of the first reservoir pangue 1996 post1 in contrast after the construction of the second reservoir ralco 2004 post2 q 5 and q 10 were reduced 3 2 hydrological changes in a dammed river fed by an artificial channel the mean annual runoff in the cato river increased significantly p value 0 05 from 1000 mm to 1965 mm 96 after the construction of the digua reservoir the digua reservoir generated a reversion in the monthly regime of the cato ɸ pre post 0 72 before the construction of the reservoir the higher mean monthly flows m3 s 1 were during the winter months june august fig 4a while after construction the maximum q occurred in the spring summer months november february doubling the flows recorded in winter months the cato showed a lower flow variability after the construction of the digua reservoir fsd pre dam 14 83 fsd post dam 12 18 the flow duration curve indicates that the reservoir generated an increase in flows that equalled or exceeded the flow 60 of the time and a decrease in low flows i e those that equalled or exceeded the flow 84 of the time fig 4b after the construction of the reservoir floods with return periods of 2 5 and 10 years decreased the flood with a return period of 10 years was the most affected and reduced from 87 m3 s 1 to 40 m3 s 1 a reduction of 54 floods with return periods of 5 and 2 years were reduced from 40 m3 s 1 to 24 m3 s 1 and from 68 m3 s 1 to 34 m3 s 1 respectively i e δ 5 0 58 a reduction of 42 and δ 2 0 60 a reduction of 40 3 3 downstream recovery discharge records at the various locations downstream from the dams showed the recovery of the mean annual q in five rivers in the loa river northern zone the loa3 station located 70 km downstream from loa2 displayed an increase in mean annual q compared to the latter i e from 0 72 m3 s 1 to 1 4 m3 s 1 in the copiapó a mean annual q recovery was also observed at the cop3 station compared to the cop2 station 25 km far downstream with an average annual q increased from 1 01 m3 s 1 to 2 24 m3 s 1 it is worth noticing that in both the loa and copiapó rivers the lowest annual mean flows were found at the lowermost downstream station in the huasco and elqui rivers a progressive decrease in the mean annual flows was observed in the downstream stations moving from 4 55 m3 s 1 at hua1 to 1 68 m3 s 1 at hua2 and from 8 04 m3 s 1 at elq1 to 4 62 m3 s 1 at elq2 respectively in the rivers of the central teno and bullileo and southern biobío zones a progressive recovery of the mean annual q with distance downstream of the dams was newly observed see table 3 in supplementary material in three of the four rivers in the northern zone the effects of the dam on the monthly flow distribution were progressively attenuated downstream fig 5a d despite the recovery in the monthly pattern shown by the ɸ pre post index in three of the rivers in the northern zone the absolute values of the monthly discharge did not recover to the pre dam values and remained low in the downstream direction the elqui showed a persistent effect of the dam on the monthly flow distribution i e ɸ pre post was 0 49 at elq1 and 0 47 at elq2 located at 4 km and 45 km downstream the dam respectively the teno showed no changes between ten1 and ten2 45 km and 46 km downstream from the dam in the monthly flow distribution ten1 ɸ pre post 0 97 and ten2 ɸ pre post 0 96 fig 5e conversely in the bullileo a recovery of the monthly regime was observed downstream from the dam i e bull1 and bull2 4 km and 45 km downstream the dam showed ɸ pre post values of 0 66 and 0 89 respectively fig 5f indicating an important recovery of the pre dam conditions finally in the biobío no changes were observed in the distribution of the monthly flows between the two stations closest to the dam i e ɸ pre post 0 92 in both bio1 and bio 2 located 60 km and 126 km downstream from the dam respectively curiously at bio3 located 226 km downstream from the dam a slightly lower value ɸ pre post 0 87 was found fig 5g which might reflect local impacts not detected in this study the downstream recovery of floods with return periods of 2 5 and 10 years varied between the rivers and the hydro climatic zones rivers in the north should be considered individually since no patterns were observed in the loa a recovery of q 2 occurred downstream from the dam in contrast loa3 70 km downstream from the wall showed a decrease of q 5 and q 10 years compared to loa2 0 3 km downstream from the wall in the copiapó a recovery was observed for the three return periods at cop3 25 km downstream from the wall whereas at cop4 134 km downstream a decrease in the flood magnitude was observed i e from 3 95 to 0 83 m3 s 1 for q2 from 11 03 to 4 42 m3 s 1 for q5 and from 15 72 to 6 81 m3 s 1 for q10 see table 3 supplementary material similarly in the same zone the huasco also showed a progressive decrease in the magnitude of floods for the three return periods in the two downstream distance stations the elqui presented a slight increase in the magnitudes of q 2 q 5 and q 10 between elq1 and elq2 4 km and 45 km downstream from the wall finally in the central and southern zone the teno bullileo and biobío rivers displayed a progressive downstream recovery in the magnitude of floods for the three return periods 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological changes downstream from dams along the latitudinal gradient the impoundment ratio ir table 4 varied between 0 01 and 1 16 1 in six of the seven rivers studied thus indicating an intra annual regulation as suggested by batalla et al 2004 annual runoff in the rivers from the drier northern zone was highly variable and discharge records from the periods before the construction of dams showed that runoff was lower than the mean annual runoff in 65 of the years dams seemed to generate in these cases a multiannual regulation storing water during humid years or multi year periods to be used later in the drier ones although the ir was higher in the northern rivers there is not a clear latitudinal pattern from the dry north to the humid south this latitudinal gradient in chile could be comparable to the hydro climatic longitudinal gradient that batalla et al 2004 described for the ebro river in the iberian peninsula from the less regulated humid atlantic zones in the northwest to the higher regulated catchments in the drier mediterranean areas in the southeast the fact that central and southern zones were underrepresented in our study in chile in terms of dammed rivers could explain the lack of such a geographical pattern the comparison of flow records from the unaltered and altered periods showed that the mean annual runoff decreased downstream of the dams in three rivers corroborating findings by xu et al 2007 dai and liu 2013 and piqué et al 2016 in our case the magnitude of the decrease in each river could not be fully explained nor correlated to the magnitude of the ir or the climate in addition precipitation trend analyses did not show statistically significant decreases in precipitation in the different catchments during the study period so it also cannot be used to explain such decreases after dams were closed the three rivers that had a significant reduction in mean annual runoff i e the copiapó bullileo and biobío could not even be grouped according to latitudinal position drainage area or storage capacity other factors such as evaporation from reservoirs and groundwater losses to neighbouring catchments may also affect river flows with or without dams the fact that there is only one river in the southern zone likely limited the latitudinal interpretation of the percentage of change in the mean annual runoff due to the construction of reservoirs in addition to the effect of the reservoir the reduction in annual runoff could be linked to intensive human activities zhao et al 2014 such as land use change and water diversions and extractions zimmermann et al 2006 2017 in the case of the studied rivers in chile water diversions related to pre existing water rights exacerbated hydrological changes downstream from dams which will be discussed later the magnitude of the alteration in the monthly runoff ɸ pre post index showed a declining trend with the ir despite being statistically non significant similar relations were found in the ebro basin spain batalla et al 2004 in the coastal basins of california kondolf and batalla 2005 and in basins of the nw mediterranean region piqué et al 2016 see fig 3d for comparison the rivers in our study showed a lower impact of dams on the monthly flow pattern than the cases already mentioned for instance no negative values of ɸ pre post were found moreover the positive and significant trend r2 0 63 p 0 05 between the ɸ pre post index and the latitudinal gradient see fig 3a indicated that the impact on the monthly regimes ɸ pre post becomes less marked in rivers in the mediterranean and the southern humid climate zones this fact can probably be explained by the fact that water resources in the rivers of the central and southern zones were more abundant and constant through time hence requiring lower regulation than in the drier north similar findings were reported by batalla et al 2004 for the ebro river indeed changes in seasonality may be especially important due to its effects on river ecosystems affecting water physico chemical characteristics temperature nutrients etc and natural communities riparian vegetation fish invertebrates structure and functioning in addition dam management in relation to water availability might also influence the observed river response for example in basins with glaciers the months with the highest natural flow are those months in which the demand for water is also the highest therefore the greater the water releases the smaller the change in the river regime the daily variability of the flows was reduced after the closure of the dam in four rivers two in the north and two in the central zone this fact could mainly be explained by the decrease in the high flows q5 irrigation reservoirs as they are in these cases tend to reduce high flows to store water that will be subsequently released in seasons when the irrigation demand is higher magilligan and nislow 2005 zhao et al 2014 in the two rivers located in the lowest latitudes far north the durations of low flows q95 were even lower than those from upstream of the dams there was no single answer regarding what happened with such low flows and even previously reported results are contradictory for example piqué et al 2016 reported that low flows generally increased after the construction of a dam in the rivers of the nw mediterranean region ne spain and s france while batalla et al 2004 stated that low flows q95 were reduced by half on average in the rivers of the ebro sub basins the reduction in the magnitude and frequency of annual floods after dam closure is widely documented williams and wolman 1984 kondolf and matthews 1991 ligon et al 1995 graf 2006 petts and gurnell 2013 in our study all rivers except for the biobío showed such a reduction affecting especially the magnitude of the most frequent floods q 2 the biobío pre dam post dam analysis showed a slight increase in the magnitude of the less frequent floods q 5 and q 10 after the construction of the pangue reservoir 1996 but with the construction of the ralco reservoir 2004 a decrease in the magnitude of the flows was observed this decrease could be explained because the storage capacity of the ralco reservoir was ten times larger than the storage capacity of the pangue reservoir piqué et al 2016 reported that the orb aude and tét rivers in the south of france showed increases in the magnitude and frequency of downstream flooding because of the management of the dam and the influx of unregulated tributaries between upstream and downstream discharge gauging stations similarly lópez et al 2004 pointed out that in some cases reservoirs operated to generate hydroelectricity release peak flows that could reach a magnitude similar to that of natural conditions this could explain why only in the biobío was an increase in the magnitude of floods observed considering that it is the only reservoir in this study intended for hydroelectricity generation finally in the cato river where the digua reservoir is fed by water supplied from an artificial channel a significant increase in mean annual runoff was observed after the closure of the dam which also generated a high degree of alteration of the monthly regime the digua reservoir increases its level between may and september in order to subsequently release water between november and february to meet demands during the irrigation season interestingly despite the digua reservoir an increase in mean annual runoff in the cato river and a decrease in the magnitude and frequency of the q 2 q 5 and q 10 floods was observed similarly to the other study rivers 4 2 downstream recovery no recovery of the mean annual flow was observed in the northern rivers downstream from the dams except for in the loa there the recovery between loa2 and loa3 located 0 3 and 70 3 km downstream of the conchi dam shall be attributed to the entrance of the river salado whose headwaters are in the andes however further downstream from loa3 a clear decrease in the mean annual flow occurred in turn the copiapó huasco and elqui rivers had no important tributaries downstream from the dams and the contribution of several flashy ephemeral streams was not sufficient to recover the mean annual flow the lack of recovery of the mean annual flow in all these rivers could also be primarily attributed to losses by flow transmission through the drainage network a common phenomenon in arid areas where as indicated tributaries could not maintain the runoff of the main channel and much of the water contribution was lost by infiltration puigdefábregas 2001 in contrast perennial tributaries help the central and southern teno bullileo and biobío rivers to increase their flow downstream from dams thus contributing to the recovery of the annual flow the loa copiapó and huasco rivers showed a recovery of the monthly regime downstream from the dams despite the fact that mean monthly flows decreased substantially in the loa the largest flows occur during summer december to march due to rains in the high mountains associated to the so called bolivian winter dga 2014 in the copiapó huasco and elqui the largest flows occur during the spring and summer months because of snowmelt occurring in the andean headwaters however in low elevation areas rivers experience small peak discharges in the cold season june to september due to rains that activate the flow of ephemeral streams favier et al 2009 masiokas et al 2019 rains in such areas could also explain the reversion in the monthly regime in the elqui river between the elq1 and elq2 stations ɸ pre post 0 47 which might not be attributable to the influence of the upstream dam i e elq1 is located in the middle part of the basin and therefore it has a snow fed regime influenced by the el toro and laguna tributaries zavala and trigos 2008 whereas elq2 is located at the river mouth where winter rains activate flashy ephemeral streams the teno in the central zone did not show changes in the monthly regime downstream from the dams gauging stations are rather close to each other 1 km apart and the entrance of the claro river between them with a flow similar to the teno does not alter the monthly pattern of the river mainstem in the case of the bullileo river a recovery of the monthly regime was observed which can be attributed to the entrance of the longaví a tributary whose headwaters are located in the andean mountains finally in the biobío the ɸ pre post index decreased downstream showing an alteration of the monthly regime which did not experience a recovery as the river moved away from dams we hypothesised that changes in the flow pattern are due to the changing nature of the flow regime of the river in the various areas in the catchment and less due to the influence of the dams i e on the one hand the upper middle part of the basin had a pluvio nival regime two peaks with winter rains and spring summer snowmelt and on the other the lower part presents a pluvial regime higher flows in the rainier months june and july the flood magnitude for the selected return periods q 2 q 5 and q 10 increased downstream from the dams in the four rivers with pluvial and nivo pluvial regimes i e the loa north teno bullileo centre and biobío south and the increase was even higher farthest downstream from the dams close to their mouths at the pacific unregulated tributaries which maintain a natural flow regime contribute to the downstream recovery of the magnitude and frequency of floods piqué et al 2016 it is important to note however that the recovery was smaller in the northern zone compared to the southern one a fact that may again be associated with the flashier and irregular contribution of ephemeral tributaries as well as with the more intensive use of water in the northern rivers as in the case of the huasco and elqui arumí et al 2016 an example of no flood recovery was the copiapó which shows a lower q 2 even 130 km downstream 4 3 comparison between spatial and temporal analysis the use of both methods i e before and after the disturbance and upstream and downstream from the disturbance presents a certain inconvenience rangecroft et al 2019 differences between the two methods could be related for instance to the granting of water rights in the river segment between the gauging stations chosen for the spatial analysis and or in the course of time between the series used in the temporal analysis as an example the comparison of the spatial analysis vs the temporal analysis in the huasco and the elqui northern rivers yielded different results when changes in the mean annual runoff were examined in both rivers the reduction in runoff presented differences of over 20 between the different forms of analysis however the reduction in runoff was greater when using the spatial analysis table 7 there are in the northernmost of water rights groundwater extractions that can have a direct influence on the total annual runoff in the spatial approach the fact that in the huasco and elqui rivers one and twenty consumptive water rights respectively were granted upstream from the dams after their construction may have affected the reduction in the annual runoff in fact the elqui river experienced a higher reduction in annual runoff than the huasco the results for monthly regime analyses and daily variability were similar using the two methods table 7 this is probably related to the fact that the ɸ pre post index and the standard deviation of daily flows were less sensitive compared to the annual change the percentage of the change in the mean annual runoff as the mean annual runoff could be affected by temperature which might significantly alter the water balance between different locations along the drainage network piqué et al 2016 the before and after approach could be affected by changes in climate during the study period e g wet periods and droughts as indicated by peñas et al 2016 in this study we did not include specific analyses of climate variability to distinguish wet and dry periods therefore we could not conclude that the observed changes respond to climate fluctuations 4 4 dams water management and flow regimes in chile the results presented here indicate that flow regimes in regulated rivers in chile are affected to greater or lesser extents by the construction and operation of large dams in addition as stated there are other factors that also influenced river hydrology water extractions for instance diverting water through a canal reduced the annual runoff after water rights were granted i e in a recent study muñoz et al 2020 reported a direct relation between flow water diversion through a canal and the granting of water rights in the petorca river in the central zone nor far from our study river the elqui the results of our study might be biased somehow at least in relation to the annual runoff since there was a gap between the granting of water rights and the time when this information became available in the public databases of dga in addition the degree of flow changes in the study rivers and other rivers might increase in the future due to the cumulative effects of the mega drought that is currently affecting chile garreaud et al 2019 the precipitation deficit has resulted in reduced water storage volumes especially in the northern zone there except for the conchi reservoir in the loa the mean stored volume over the last 10 years in the copiapó huasco and elqui rivers is between 31 and 59 of the total capacity of the reservoirs under these conditions the need for flow regulation increases with a detrimental effect on the downstream flow regimes finally climate simulations indicate future reductions in precipitation mostly affecting central chile garreaud et al 2019 a fact that was part of the basis of the decision to build twenty six new reservoirs in the period 2015 2025 mostly to meet irrigation demands the dimensioning in terms of the ir and operational design of these new dams should carefully consider not only the downstream hydrologic effects such as the ones described here but even more acutely those that impact the bio physical structure functioning of the affected fluvial corridors 5 conclusions the results in chilean rivers confirm previous studies worldwide indicating that regulation by large dams inevitably affects the fluvial regime to different degrees of alteration this mainly depends on the size and use of reservoirs the hydro climatic conditions of the basin and the demand for water the main findings can be summarised as follows 1 the impoundment ratio ir the ratio between the reservoir capacity and mean annual runoff does not follow a latitudinal pattern from the dry north to humid south as was the case in other studies but in any case the highest ir values are found in the drier northern rivers 2 the mean annual runoff was reduced in all the study rivers and the monthly flows of the rivers in the northern arid zone were the most affected by dams at the annual scale the northern rivers did not recover their hydrological conditions downstream of dams but the southern rivers did recover mainly because of the inflows from permanent tributaries 3 the magnitude and frequency of floods also decreased in the study rivers but no statistical relation was found between such a reduction and the degree of regulation as stated in the manuscript this work has a series of limitations inherent to most hydroclimatic studies which can be summarised as i the uneven length of flow series used in the analysis which may influence the results and their interpretation despite we have shown that analysed data encompasses a series of dry and wet cycles and ii the potential influence of others factors such as land use change and evaporation from reservoirs which may affect mostly the annual water budget of the study catchments and to a much lesser extent the rest of the addressed hydrological scales i e seasonality flood frequency and magnitude finally and from a broader perspective ours is the first study in chile to analyse the hydrological effects of reservoirs on a wide geographical scale despite the observed variability of dam effects at the various temporal scales and the fact that the initial hypothesis cannot be fully corroborated i e dams effects do not strictly follow a latitudinal gradient these types of analyses provide relevant information to improve the understanding of the extent of flow changes in regulated rivers and they offer guidance to assess future impacts as the country plans to build a series of large dams in the years to come the design in terms of the ir and the operation of such new dams will have to consider that climate simulations indicate future reductions in precipitation mostly in central chile and assess not only the downstream hydrologic effects but also those over the whole fluvial ecosystem moreover this work may open a way to use this or similar conceptual and methodological frameworks to

7949,study region eight rivers regulated by large dams located in three hydro climatic zones along the chilean latitudinal gradient study focus we performed a multi temporal scale analysis of flow records and we used data from official gauging stations to characterise the non altered and the altered river regimes to determine the magnitude and persistence of the hydrological alteration downstream from large dams in chile these analyses provide relevant information to improve the understanding of such alterations and a conceptual basis for assessing future impacts as the country plans to build a series of large dams in the coming years new hydrological insights for the region the mean annual runoff was reduced in all the study rivers the monthly flows of the rivers from the northern arid zone were the most affected by the dams the magnitude and frequency of floods decreased in all the study rivers moreover northern drier river systems did not recover their hydrological conditions in the distance downstream of the dams probably due to transmission losses and water extractions and diversions in contrast southern rivers partially recovered their flow regimes with distance downstream mainly due to the inflows from permanent non regulated tributaries so far this is the first study in chile that comprehensively analyses the hydrological effects of large dams

traditionally driven dam construction river regulation by dams as well as the different uses of water alters hydrological and sedimentary regimes and the ecology of rivers downstream e g williams and wolman 1984 richter et al 1996 stanford et al 1996 kondolf 1997 magilligan and nislow 2001 kondolf et al 2014 according to poff et al 1997 there are five components of the hydrological regime that controls the ecological integrity of a river system i e the magnitude frequency duration time and rate of change through their influence on other primary components moreover the disruption of these flow components through the construction and operation of dams occur at different temporal scales from the flood to the interannual scale e g batalla et al 2004 piqué et al 2016 and has in turn cascading effects on sediment erosion transport and deposition processes e g petts 1980 brandt 2000 vericat and batalla 2006 lobera et al 2016 piqué et al 2016 affecting the morphology and habitat of the river system ligon et al 1995 batalla et al 2006 reservoirs usually cause a reduction in the magnitude and frequency of floods thus affecting the overall energy balance of the fluvial system e g batalla et al 2004 graf 2006 fitzhugh and vogel 2011 and decrease annual discharges piqué et al 2016 in addition dams modify the bedload and the suspended sediment loads e g kondolf 1997 kondolf and batalla 2005 vericat et al 2006 gabbud and lane 2016 as a high percentage of sediment is retained in reservoirs e g smith and mohrig 2017 brignoli et al 2017 béjar et al 2018 of particular importance for river ecology is the alteration that dams cause on the seasonal flow regime e g petts 1984 belmar et al 2010 natural variability of seasonal and monthly flows sustains habitat suitability for aquatic ecosystems and water for terrestrial organisms and plants and controls water temperature oxygen levels and photosynthesis e g the nature conservancy 2009 thus alterations in the flow regime may induce changes not only in the aquatic ecosystems but also in the terrestrial ones piqué et al 2016 changes are particularly acute in river systems where seasonal trends are highly marked and ecosystems are adapted to such large hydrological fluctuations as those typical of the mediterranean regions batalla et al 2004 kondolf and batalla 2005 the alteration of the hydrological regime is traditionally quantified through indices e g the impoundment ratio index as per batalla et al 2004 and other statistical indicators that allow the comparison of the unaltered discharges with the altered ones e g before and after the construction of a reservoir and or upstream and downstream from flow records richter et al 1996 batalla et al 2004 the knowledge and quantification of the degree of hydrological alteration through indices has allowed mitigation measures to be established in river systems that have been modified by upstream dams e g batalla and vericat 2009 gabbud and lane 2016 flow regulation is directly controlled by the size of the reservoir storage capacity and its main water uses e g irrigation hydroelectricity e g abam 1999 lópez et al 2004 in general the greater the capacity of the reservoir relative to the natural river water flow i e water yield or runoff the greater its effect on hydrology batalla et al 2004 in addition the geographical location size and relief of the basin as well as the hydro climatic conditions of each region have an important role being able to reduce or exacerbate the effects of hydrological regulation batalla et al 2004 haghighi et al 2014 in chile there is a north south climate transition from arid to semi arid to mediterranean and to a humid temperate condition miller 1976 this transition results from the latitudinal gradient that influences changes in ocean and atmospheric temperatures through the main modes of variability such as the el niño southern oscillation enso responsible for the variability of year by year rainfall rutllant and fuenzalida 1991 or the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which generates interdecadal variability garreaud et al 2009 climate projections and simulations for chile forecast a decrease in rainfall especially for the north central area and therefore also a decrease of the total water availability garreaud et al 2017 boisier et al 2018 in the climate transition between the arid north and the temperate humid south there are 26 large reservoirs i e with a capacity 20 hm3 dga 2016 which results in a total storage capacity of approximately 12 900 hm3 i e 1 hm3 1 106 m3 corresponding to 1 4 of the country s total annual runoff the north central area 28 s 36 s concentrates an important part of the chilean irrigated agriculture whereas in the south central area 35 s 42 s more than 70 of the country s hydropower is generated muñoz et al 2016 the effects of regulation are also related to the progressive changes in water availability and water and soil use in the basin and their management in chile unlike in other countries private water rights are granted generating a supply demand market donoso 2006 in addition besides the chilean water authority other institutions courts of justice livestock agricultural service have the power to grant water rights as well as far as we know hydrological alteration downstream from large dams has not been assessed in chile yet and only one study focuses on the morphological effects of rivers affected by dams alcayaga et al 2019 in this context the main objective of this work is to determine the magnitude of the hydrological changes generated by large reservoirs in chile the overarching hypothesis of the study is that the magnitude of impacts at the various temporal scales follows a latitudinal thus climatic gradient along the study area with the dammed rivers in the driest zones being impacted more in comparison with their humid counterparts we acknowledge that other factors such as land use change or for instance the evaporation from reservoirs also influence the hydrological response of river systems particularly at the annual scale water budget the present work may constitute the basis for a further analysis of these other topics which are however out of the scope of this paper to further develop the main objective as well as to test the hypothesis two specific objectives are addressed i to determine whether the patterns of change relate to the location latitude hence climate of the different basins and ii to analyse the recovery of river regime components downstream from reservoirs in relation to inflows from tributaries as a further step to tackle the objectives we quantified the changes in the hydrological regime due to the presence of dams at different time scales annual monthly daily flood all this in eight rivers located in seven basins distributed in a latitudinal gradient between the antofagasta and the biobío regions fig 1 the comparison between altered and non altered flows in gauging stations close to dams contributed to the response of the specific objective i while the analysis of discharge data series from tributaries downstream from the dam contributed to the development of the specific objective ii 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in chilean rivers regulated by large reservoirs with storage capacities 20 hm3 located between 23º s and 38 s fig 1 left despite all the data series from chilean rivers regulated by large dams were initially gathered some of them were discarded from the analyses because flow records were too short and or incomplete hence the final database for this study was composed by eight rivers from north to south loa copiapó huasco elqui teno bullileo cato and biobío the first seven except for the elqui are regulated by only one reservoir whereas the elqui and biobío rivers are regulated by two and three reservoirs respectively the cato is in addition a particular case i e it is regulated by the digua reservoir and receives water through an artificial channel the digua canal this channel has a flow capacity of 25 m3 s 1 and diverts water from the longaví river to fill the reservoir between may and september to feed demands at the beginning of the irrigation season october to december the basins are distributed in three of the four so called climate macrozones as established by the dirección general de aguas of chile dga 2016 the loa copiapó huasco and elqui rivers are located in the northern zone characterised by an arid to semi arid climate with little rainfall increasing in a southerly direction and a mean annual precipitation of 87 mm yr 1 in the andean upper basins the teno cato and bullileo rivers are in the central zone with a mediterranean climate and a mean annual precipitation of 943 mm yr 1 concentrated in winter and a prolonged 7 to 8 month dry season the biobío river is in the southern zone which is characterised by a temperate rainy to rainy maritime climate with abundant precipitation increasing to the south mean 2420 mm yr 1 there are no rivers regulated by such large dams south of the biobío historical precipitation data from 7 rainfall stations located near the reservoirs records available in cr 2 climate explorer http www cr2 cl camels cl last accessed march 2018 alvarez garreton et al 2018 do not show significant trends in the study period see table s1 in supplementary material so precipitation is not considered an influential factor on the observed flow trends moreover the interannual variability and the alternation between dry and wet periods are also intrinsic characteristics of these climatic macrozones in chile and they are well represented in the study periods selected for the hydrological analysis carried out in this study see fig s1 in supplementary material the loa river has a pluvial regime influenced by summer rains december to march vuille 1999 associated with the so called bolivian winter the copiapó huasco and elqui rivers have a mixed regime snow fed in the upper basin and pluvial in the lower part of the basin without a clear predominance between river regimes however in the fluviometric gauges selected for this study the largest flows occur in early summer november to december because of the snowmelt in the andes mountains and therefore they are considered to have a snow fed regime the teno river has a nivo pluvial regime while the bullileo and cato rivers have a clear pluvial regime finally the biobío has two flow peaks the largest in the winter months june to september and the second in the summer months december to march therefore it corresponds to a pluvial nival regime masiokas et al 2019 basin areas range between 6331 km2 and 33 081 km2 all basins have granted water rights which implies consumptive water diversions for irrigation and mining the latter mainly in the northern zone and water resources to grant new rights are still available the reservoirs were built between 1937 and 2004 and their storage capacity varies between 22 hm3 the conchi in the loa river and 1174 hm3 the ralco in the biobío river stored water is mostly used for irrigation and only the biobío reservoirs ralco pangue and angostura are intended for hydroelectric power generation see more details in table 1 changes in the hydrology of the biobío river were examined only until 2013 because data recorded after the construction of the third dam angostura 2014 was too short to be included in the analyses table 1 2 2 data collection and analysis daily flow records were obtained from the chilean dirección general de aguas database www dga cl analyses were carried out comparing flow data measured for the same time periods obtained in gauging stations upstream and downstream from the dam spatial analysis hereafter in both the loa and copiapó rivers as well as comparing the flows recorded in different time periods at the same gauging station before and after the construction of the dam i e pre dam and post dam temporal analysis hereafter in the huasco elqui teno bullileo and biobío rivers table 1 to analyse the data and interpret the results we grouped the rivers according to the previously described hydro climatic zones the cato river which is regulated by a reservoir fed by an artificial channel was analysed independently and not included in the regionalisation of the rivers by hydro climatic zones finally and in order to assess the differences between the results obtained through the two approximations a comparison between the spatial analysis and the temporal analysis was performed for the huasco and elqui rivers table 1 the study rivers were chosen according to the quality of the flow records from the gauging stations based on two strict selection criteria i e to be considered gauging stations must have i at least 95 of the daily data in each hydrological year from april 1 to march 31 in the southern hemisphere and ii have records of at least 5 years in length it is important to remark thus that despite the inevitable gaps and the relatively short length of some of the series all the available data in chile has been used to undertake the present analysis see fig s2 supplementary material the analyses of discharge series recorded at gauging stations located downstream of the reservoirs were carried out to assess whether the river systems partially or completely recover to pre construction hydrological conditions the number of gauging stations selected to assess the recovery downstream depended on the availability of flow records for the same periods table 2 2 3 degree of regulation to characterise the degree of alteration of the river regime downstream from a reservoir the impoundment ratio ir index proposed by batalla et al 2004 was used the ir is calculated as the ratio between the capacity of the reservoir and the annual runoff of the upstream basin it is a dimensionless value that is equivalent to the average time in years of water residence in the reservoir i e an ir 1 indicates that the capacity of the reservoir is greater than the average annual runoff and the dams have a hyper annual regulation capacity for the rivers regulated by more than one reservoir the sum of individual storage capacities was considered for the spatial analyses in this study the capacity of the reservoir used to calculate the ir corresponds to the total capacity as we were not able to subtract the dead storage capacity of the reservoirs information not available for this reason the ir might amplify the potential effects of a dam on a river s hydrology it is also worth to remark that ir measures the maximum possible impact of the dam on the river rather than the actual impact of the dam owing its particular operational processes the former basically depends on dams dimension whereas the latter varies according to the actual operations of the dam i e water level hence volume fluctuation across the year ir is thus a fix metric and works independently of dam operation this way it can be used as a bases for comparison elsewhere regardless climate and particular characteristics and functioning of the dam keeping its power as a general and comparable dam impact descriptor 2 4 indicators of hydrological change at multiple scales the indexes and variables used to analyse the hydrological alteration due to dams have been adopted from previous articles batalla et al 2004 kondolf and batalla 2005 piqué et al 2016 a summary of the applicability of these indexes and their implications for river processes and ecology is included in table 3 2 4 1 annual scale for the analysis of the annual changes the mean annual runoff r hm3 yr 1 for the non altered and altered flow series was calculated and the percentage of change was determined as follows eq 1 1 δ r altered r non altered r non altered x 100 to assess whether changes in runoff are statistically significant non parametric tests were applied accepting an error of 5 the mann whitney test wilcoxon w was used to compare two periods while the kruskal wallis test was used to compare three periods as in the case of the biobío river a year by year comparison using eq 1 was made for the mean annual runoff changes just for the rivers spatially analysed loa and copiapó rivers the comparison was made only for the years where discharge data were simultaneously available for the upstream and downstream gauges from each considered dam furthermore changes in the flow regimes m3 s 1 were evaluated by means of a correlation coefficient which allows the determination of the degree of alteration of the monthly flow pattern between altered and non altered flow series eq 2 2 ɸ pre post σ pre post σ pre x σ post where σpre post is the covariance between the non altered and altered mean monthly flows m3 s 1 σpre is the standard deviation of the non altered mean monthly flow m3 s 1 and σpre is the standard deviation of the altered mean monthly flow m3 s 1 this coefficient varies between 1 and 1 i e a value equal to 1 indicates a complete reversal of the flow regime while a value equal to 1 indicates that there is no change in the monthly discharge q distribution 2 4 2 monthly scale the percentage of change between the non altered and altered mean maximum monthly specific q m3 s 1 km 2 for each month was calculated using eq 3 3 δ q altered q non altered q non altered x 100 mean maximum monthly specific discharges are the mean value of the maximum flows per unit area measured in a specific month in all the water years of each altered and non altered period 2 4 3 daily scale to assess changes on a daily scale flow duration curves were elaborated for each discharge record and representative discharges m3 s 1 equalling or exceeding the discharge 5 16 50 85 and 95 of the time p5 p16 p50 p84 and p95 percentiles respectively were derived as examples p95 corresponds to a discharge that equalled or exceeded the discharge 95 of the time and exemplifies a low flow p50 represents the median of the discharges and p5 represents high or flood flow events to assess the variability of the discharges non altered altered and their alteration due to the presence of reservoirs the standard deviation in relation to the mean discharge was calculated through the fsd flow standard deviation variability index see details in batalla et al 2004 4 fsd p 84 p 16 p 95 p 5 p 50 indicating that the higher the fsd the more variability exists between daily flow data 2 4 4 flood scale in order to determine the changes in the magnitude and frequency of floods discharges m3 s 1 associated with characteristic return periods of 2 5 and 10 years were estimated these relatively low flood magnitudes are generally the most affected by river regulation and are those that define the formation and dynamism of the channels and their ability to transport sediments batalla et al 2004 piqué et al 2016 frequency analyses were performed by means of the gumbel probability function pizarro et al 2014 using the hydrological analysis software retorno2 http www flumen upc edu es documentacion software developed by the universitat politècnica de catalunya with the estimated q for the different return periods the δ dimensional index was calculated batalla et al 2004 5 δ q a l t e r e d q n o n a l t e r e d where δ 1 indicates that there are no changes in the magnitude of flows and the lower the value of δ the greater the changes 3 results 3 1 hydrological changes downstream from dams the impoundment ratio ir index varied between 0 01 and 1 16 table 4 although the ir did not follow a clear latitudinal pattern the highest values were found generally in the northern zone between 0 49 and 1 16 the irs of the central zone rivers i e the teno and bullileo were 0 06 and 0 13 respectively in the case of the biobío river the only analysed river in the southern zone the ir was 0 01 considering the first constructed reservoir pangue year 1996 i e the post1 period in table 4 whereas after the construction of the second reservoir ralco year 2004 i e the post2 period in table 4 the ir increased to 0 08 together with an increase in the total storage capacity after the closure of the dam high flows p5 were reduced in six of the seven rivers except the loa as shown in daily flow duration curves low flows p95 declined in the loa copiapó and teno rivers and increased in the huasco elqui and bullileo rivers after the dam closures fig 2 in the case of the biobío river low flows decreased only after the closure of the first dam pangue 1996 post1 and increased after the closure of the second dam ralco 2004 post2 fig 2 3 1 1 changes at the annual scale the mean annual runoff was reduced in the 7 rivers between 0 37 and 55 5 table 4 and in general no north south pattern was observed according to the wilcoxon and kruskal wallis tests the changes were statistically significant when the reduction in runoff exceeded ca 25 the copiapó northern zone bullileo central zone and biobío southern zone rivers showed statistically significant reductions table 4 in the latter case after the construction of the first reservoir pangue 1996 post1 the mean annual runoff was reduced by 20 from 2114 mm yr 1 to 1698 mm yr 1 and after the construction of the second reservoir ralco 2004 post2 the mean annual runoff was further reduced by 25 from 2114 mm yr 1 to 1574 mm yr 1 see fig s3 in supplementary material the interannual variation in the mean annual runoff between the upstream and downstream gauging stations of the reservoir in the loa river mainly showed a reduction in downstream runoff between ca 1 and 29 although in two years 1990 and 2005 the mean annual runoff was higher downstream in the loa a significant positive linear relationship p value 0 05 was found between the mean annual upstream runoff and the mean annual downstream runoff which explained 68 of the variability in the mean annual downstream runoff in the case of the copiapó the mean annual runoff downstream of the reservoir was reduced in all years reductions between 4 and 88 in this river a non statistically significant relationship was found between the mean annual analysis spatial runoff see fig s4 in supplementary material 3 1 2 changes at the monthly scale the alteration of monthly discharges m3 s 1 according to the ɸ pre post index was greater in the northern rivers with values between 0 04 and 0 89 table 5 the rivers of the central zone teno and bullileo had ɸ pre post of 0 98 and 0 76 respectively in the case of the biobío the modification of the monthly regime was relatively low after the construction of the first reservoir pangue 1996 post1 the value of ɸ pre post was 0 96 and with the construction of the second reservoir ralco 2004 post2 the index ɸ pre post was reduced to 0 92 table 5 it should be noted that there is no reversion in the monthly regime in the studied rivers a positive statistically significant linear relation p 0 05 was found between the latitude of the basins and the ɸ pre post index fig 3a the closer to the wet southern zone the lower the impact on the monthly regime a negative linear relationship was generated between the ir independent variable and ɸ pre post index dependent variable being non significant for individual river values fig 3b and significant considering zone averages fig 3c in general the higher the degree of regulation ir the lower the value of ɸ pre post the maximum monthly specific discharges m3 s 1 km 2 were reduced by between 2 and 88 in all the study rivers mainly between april and september autumn winter table 5 in the north the highest reductions were found in the loa in june 59 and march 59 and in the copiapó in june 59 and may 58 in the central zone the highest reduction occurred in the bullileo in may 88 and june 82 in the south the biobío showed the highest reductions in may and june 65 and 48 respectively post2 in general the loa north copiapó north and bullileo centre rivers recorded five months with reductions of more than 50 in monthly maximum specific discharges conversely in the northern zone there was an increase in the maximum monthly unit discharges in the spring months october december and in the summer months january march in the loa and elqui rivers in the central zone the maximum increase in monthly flows took place in the bullileo in february 203 and march 218 whereas in the southern zone biobío the increase varied between months in general the increase did not exceed 11 3 1 3 changes at the daily scale the flow standard deviation fsd under non altered conditions ranged between 1 8 and 18 whereas it varied between 2 9 and 7 1 under altered flow conditions two of the four rivers in the northern zone showed less flow variability after the dam closure as did the two rivers in the central zone the biobío showed greater flow variability after the closure of the first dam mostly related to the reduction of the base flow pangue 1996 post1 afterwards i e after the construction of the second dam the flow variability newly decreased a fact that can be associated with the increment of the base flow in the case of high flows they were reduced after the construction of both dams table 5 the huasco north and bullileo centre rivers greatly reduced the variability of flow after the dam closure and conversely the teno river centre showed the lowest flow variability 3 1 4 changes of flood frequency and magnitude the alteration in the magnitude and frequency of the floods also did not follow a north to south pattern the seven rivers showed a reduction in the magnitude of q 2 after the construction of the reservoirs which ranged from δ 0 34 to δ 0 90 i e a decrease of 66 10 respectively a reduction in the magnitude of q 5 after the construction of the reservoirs also occurred in the seven rivers and ranged from δ 0 36 to δ 0 92 i e a decrease of 64 8 respectively and similar changes were found in the magnitude of q 10 the bullileo river centre was the most affected with values of δ 0 34 for q 2 and δ 0 36 for q 5 and q 10 i e decreases of 66 and 64 respectively table 6 and see table 2 supplementary material the biobío river south was the only river that showed an increase in the magnitudes of q 5 and q 10 and this happened with the construction in 1996 of the first reservoir pangue 1996 post1 in contrast after the construction of the second reservoir ralco 2004 post2 q 5 and q 10 were reduced 3 2 hydrological changes in a dammed river fed by an artificial channel the mean annual runoff in the cato river increased significantly p value 0 05 from 1000 mm to 1965 mm 96 after the construction of the digua reservoir the digua reservoir generated a reversion in the monthly regime of the cato ɸ pre post 0 72 before the construction of the reservoir the higher mean monthly flows m3 s 1 were during the winter months june august fig 4a while after construction the maximum q occurred in the spring summer months november february doubling the flows recorded in winter months the cato showed a lower flow variability after the construction of the digua reservoir fsd pre dam 14 83 fsd post dam 12 18 the flow duration curve indicates that the reservoir generated an increase in flows that equalled or exceeded the flow 60 of the time and a decrease in low flows i e those that equalled or exceeded the flow 84 of the time fig 4b after the construction of the reservoir floods with return periods of 2 5 and 10 years decreased the flood with a return period of 10 years was the most affected and reduced from 87 m3 s 1 to 40 m3 s 1 a reduction of 54 floods with return periods of 5 and 2 years were reduced from 40 m3 s 1 to 24 m3 s 1 and from 68 m3 s 1 to 34 m3 s 1 respectively i e δ 5 0 58 a reduction of 42 and δ 2 0 60 a reduction of 40 3 3 downstream recovery discharge records at the various locations downstream from the dams showed the recovery of the mean annual q in five rivers in the loa river northern zone the loa3 station located 70 km downstream from loa2 displayed an increase in mean annual q compared to the latter i e from 0 72 m3 s 1 to 1 4 m3 s 1 in the copiapó a mean annual q recovery was also observed at the cop3 station compared to the cop2 station 25 km far downstream with an average annual q increased from 1 01 m3 s 1 to 2 24 m3 s 1 it is worth noticing that in both the loa and copiapó rivers the lowest annual mean flows were found at the lowermost downstream station in the huasco and elqui rivers a progressive decrease in the mean annual flows was observed in the downstream stations moving from 4 55 m3 s 1 at hua1 to 1 68 m3 s 1 at hua2 and from 8 04 m3 s 1 at elq1 to 4 62 m3 s 1 at elq2 respectively in the rivers of the central teno and bullileo and southern biobío zones a progressive recovery of the mean annual q with distance downstream of the dams was newly observed see table 3 in supplementary material in three of the four rivers in the northern zone the effects of the dam on the monthly flow distribution were progressively attenuated downstream fig 5a d despite the recovery in the monthly pattern shown by the ɸ pre post index in three of the rivers in the northern zone the absolute values of the monthly discharge did not recover to the pre dam values and remained low in the downstream direction the elqui showed a persistent effect of the dam on the monthly flow distribution i e ɸ pre post was 0 49 at elq1 and 0 47 at elq2 located at 4 km and 45 km downstream the dam respectively the teno showed no changes between ten1 and ten2 45 km and 46 km downstream from the dam in the monthly flow distribution ten1 ɸ pre post 0 97 and ten2 ɸ pre post 0 96 fig 5e conversely in the bullileo a recovery of the monthly regime was observed downstream from the dam i e bull1 and bull2 4 km and 45 km downstream the dam showed ɸ pre post values of 0 66 and 0 89 respectively fig 5f indicating an important recovery of the pre dam conditions finally in the biobío no changes were observed in the distribution of the monthly flows between the two stations closest to the dam i e ɸ pre post 0 92 in both bio1 and bio 2 located 60 km and 126 km downstream from the dam respectively curiously at bio3 located 226 km downstream from the dam a slightly lower value ɸ pre post 0 87 was found fig 5g which might reflect local impacts not detected in this study the downstream recovery of floods with return periods of 2 5 and 10 years varied between the rivers and the hydro climatic zones rivers in the north should be considered individually since no patterns were observed in the loa a recovery of q 2 occurred downstream from the dam in contrast loa3 70 km downstream from the wall showed a decrease of q 5 and q 10 years compared to loa2 0 3 km downstream from the wall in the copiapó a recovery was observed for the three return periods at cop3 25 km downstream from the wall whereas at cop4 134 km downstream a decrease in the flood magnitude was observed i e from 3 95 to 0 83 m3 s 1 for q2 from 11 03 to 4 42 m3 s 1 for q5 and from 15 72 to 6 81 m3 s 1 for q10 see table 3 supplementary material similarly in the same zone the huasco also showed a progressive decrease in the magnitude of floods for the three return periods in the two downstream distance stations the elqui presented a slight increase in the magnitudes of q 2 q 5 and q 10 between elq1 and elq2 4 km and 45 km downstream from the wall finally in the central and southern zone the teno bullileo and biobío rivers displayed a progressive downstream recovery in the magnitude of floods for the three return periods 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological changes downstream from dams along the latitudinal gradient the impoundment ratio ir table 4 varied between 0 01 and 1 16 1 in six of the seven rivers studied thus indicating an intra annual regulation as suggested by batalla et al 2004 annual runoff in the rivers from the drier northern zone was highly variable and discharge records from the periods before the construction of dams showed that runoff was lower than the mean annual runoff in 65 of the years dams seemed to generate in these cases a multiannual regulation storing water during humid years or multi year periods to be used later in the drier ones although the ir was higher in the northern rivers there is not a clear latitudinal pattern from the dry north to the humid south this latitudinal gradient in chile could be comparable to the hydro climatic longitudinal gradient that batalla et al 2004 described for the ebro river in the iberian peninsula from the less regulated humid atlantic zones in the northwest to the higher regulated catchments in the drier mediterranean areas in the southeast the fact that central and southern zones were underrepresented in our study in chile in terms of dammed rivers could explain the lack of such a geographical pattern the comparison of flow records from the unaltered and altered periods showed that the mean annual runoff decreased downstream of the dams in three rivers corroborating findings by xu et al 2007 dai and liu 2013 and piqué et al 2016 in our case the magnitude of the decrease in each river could not be fully explained nor correlated to the magnitude of the ir or the climate in addition precipitation trend analyses did not show statistically significant decreases in precipitation in the different catchments during the study period so it also cannot be used to explain such decreases after dams were closed the three rivers that had a significant reduction in mean annual runoff i e the copiapó bullileo and biobío could not even be grouped according to latitudinal position drainage area or storage capacity other factors such as evaporation from reservoirs and groundwater losses to neighbouring catchments may also affect river flows with or without dams the fact that there is only one river in the southern zone likely limited the latitudinal interpretation of the percentage of change in the mean annual runoff due to the construction of reservoirs in addition to the effect of the reservoir the reduction in annual runoff could be linked to intensive human activities zhao et al 2014 such as land use change and water diversions and extractions zimmermann et al 2006 2017 in the case of the studied rivers in chile water diversions related to pre existing water rights exacerbated hydrological changes downstream from dams which will be discussed later the magnitude of the alteration in the monthly runoff ɸ pre post index showed a declining trend with the ir despite being statistically non significant similar relations were found in the ebro basin spain batalla et al 2004 in the coastal basins of california kondolf and batalla 2005 and in basins of the nw mediterranean region piqué et al 2016 see fig 3d for comparison the rivers in our study showed a lower impact of dams on the monthly flow pattern than the cases already mentioned for instance no negative values of ɸ pre post were found moreover the positive and significant trend r2 0 63 p 0 05 between the ɸ pre post index and the latitudinal gradient see fig 3a indicated that the impact on the monthly regimes ɸ pre post becomes less marked in rivers in the mediterranean and the southern humid climate zones this fact can probably be explained by the fact that water resources in the rivers of the central and southern zones were more abundant and constant through time hence requiring lower regulation than in the drier north similar findings were reported by batalla et al 2004 for the ebro river indeed changes in seasonality may be especially important due to its effects on river ecosystems affecting water physico chemical characteristics temperature nutrients etc and natural communities riparian vegetation fish invertebrates structure and functioning in addition dam management in relation to water availability might also influence the observed river response for example in basins with glaciers the months with the highest natural flow are those months in which the demand for water is also the highest therefore the greater the water releases the smaller the change in the river regime the daily variability of the flows was reduced after the closure of the dam in four rivers two in the north and two in the central zone this fact could mainly be explained by the decrease in the high flows q5 irrigation reservoirs as they are in these cases tend to reduce high flows to store water that will be subsequently released in seasons when the irrigation demand is higher magilligan and nislow 2005 zhao et al 2014 in the two rivers located in the lowest latitudes far north the durations of low flows q95 were even lower than those from upstream of the dams there was no single answer regarding what happened with such low flows and even previously reported results are contradictory for example piqué et al 2016 reported that low flows generally increased after the construction of a dam in the rivers of the nw mediterranean region ne spain and s france while batalla et al 2004 stated that low flows q95 were reduced by half on average in the rivers of the ebro sub basins the reduction in the magnitude and frequency of annual floods after dam closure is widely documented williams and wolman 1984 kondolf and matthews 1991 ligon et al 1995 graf 2006 petts and gurnell 2013 in our study all rivers except for the biobío showed such a reduction affecting especially the magnitude of the most frequent floods q 2 the biobío pre dam post dam analysis showed a slight increase in the magnitude of the less frequent floods q 5 and q 10 after the construction of the pangue reservoir 1996 but with the construction of the ralco reservoir 2004 a decrease in the magnitude of the flows was observed this decrease could be explained because the storage capacity of the ralco reservoir was ten times larger than the storage capacity of the pangue reservoir piqué et al 2016 reported that the orb aude and tét rivers in the south of france showed increases in the magnitude and frequency of downstream flooding because of the management of the dam and the influx of unregulated tributaries between upstream and downstream discharge gauging stations similarly lópez et al 2004 pointed out that in some cases reservoirs operated to generate hydroelectricity release peak flows that could reach a magnitude similar to that of natural conditions this could explain why only in the biobío was an increase in the magnitude of floods observed considering that it is the only reservoir in this study intended for hydroelectricity generation finally in the cato river where the digua reservoir is fed by water supplied from an artificial channel a significant increase in mean annual runoff was observed after the closure of the dam which also generated a high degree of alteration of the monthly regime the digua reservoir increases its level between may and september in order to subsequently release water between november and february to meet demands during the irrigation season interestingly despite the digua reservoir an increase in mean annual runoff in the cato river and a decrease in the magnitude and frequency of the q 2 q 5 and q 10 floods was observed similarly to the other study rivers 4 2 downstream recovery no recovery of the mean annual flow was observed in the northern rivers downstream from the dams except for in the loa there the recovery between loa2 and loa3 located 0 3 and 70 3 km downstream of the conchi dam shall be attributed to the entrance of the river salado whose headwaters are in the andes however further downstream from loa3 a clear decrease in the mean annual flow occurred in turn the copiapó huasco and elqui rivers had no important tributaries downstream from the dams and the contribution of several flashy ephemeral streams was not sufficient to recover the mean annual flow the lack of recovery of the mean annual flow in all these rivers could also be primarily attributed to losses by flow transmission through the drainage network a common phenomenon in arid areas where as indicated tributaries could not maintain the runoff of the main channel and much of the water contribution was lost by infiltration puigdefábregas 2001 in contrast perennial tributaries help the central and southern teno bullileo and biobío rivers to increase their flow downstream from dams thus contributing to the recovery of the annual flow the loa copiapó and huasco rivers showed a recovery of the monthly regime downstream from the dams despite the fact that mean monthly flows decreased substantially in the loa the largest flows occur during summer december to march due to rains in the high mountains associated to the so called bolivian winter dga 2014 in the copiapó huasco and elqui the largest flows occur during the spring and summer months because of snowmelt occurring in the andean headwaters however in low elevation areas rivers experience small peak discharges in the cold season june to september due to rains that activate the flow of ephemeral streams favier et al 2009 masiokas et al 2019 rains in such areas could also explain the reversion in the monthly regime in the elqui river between the elq1 and elq2 stations ɸ pre post 0 47 which might not be attributable to the influence of the upstream dam i e elq1 is located in the middle part of the basin and therefore it has a snow fed regime influenced by the el toro and laguna tributaries zavala and trigos 2008 whereas elq2 is located at the river mouth where winter rains activate flashy ephemeral streams the teno in the central zone did not show changes in the monthly regime downstream from the dams gauging stations are rather close to each other 1 km apart and the entrance of the claro river between them with a flow similar to the teno does not alter the monthly pattern of the river mainstem in the case of the bullileo river a recovery of the monthly regime was observed which can be attributed to the entrance of the longaví a tributary whose headwaters are located in the andean mountains finally in the biobío the ɸ pre post index decreased downstream showing an alteration of the monthly regime which did not experience a recovery as the river moved away from dams we hypothesised that changes in the flow pattern are due to the changing nature of the flow regime of the river in the various areas in the catchment and less due to the influence of the dams i e on the one hand the upper middle part of the basin had a pluvio nival regime two peaks with winter rains and spring summer snowmelt and on the other the lower part presents a pluvial regime higher flows in the rainier months june and july the flood magnitude for the selected return periods q 2 q 5 and q 10 increased downstream from the dams in the four rivers with pluvial and nivo pluvial regimes i e the loa north teno bullileo centre and biobío south and the increase was even higher farthest downstream from the dams close to their mouths at the pacific unregulated tributaries which maintain a natural flow regime contribute to the downstream recovery of the magnitude and frequency of floods piqué et al 2016 it is important to note however that the recovery was smaller in the northern zone compared to the southern one a fact that may again be associated with the flashier and irregular contribution of ephemeral tributaries as well as with the more intensive use of water in the northern rivers as in the case of the huasco and elqui arumí et al 2016 an example of no flood recovery was the copiapó which shows a lower q 2 even 130 km downstream 4 3 comparison between spatial and temporal analysis the use of both methods i e before and after the disturbance and upstream and downstream from the disturbance presents a certain inconvenience rangecroft et al 2019 differences between the two methods could be related for instance to the granting of water rights in the river segment between the gauging stations chosen for the spatial analysis and or in the course of time between the series used in the temporal analysis as an example the comparison of the spatial analysis vs the temporal analysis in the huasco and the elqui northern rivers yielded different results when changes in the mean annual runoff were examined in both rivers the reduction in runoff presented differences of over 20 between the different forms of analysis however the reduction in runoff was greater when using the spatial analysis table 7 there are in the northernmost of water rights groundwater extractions that can have a direct influence on the total annual runoff in the spatial approach the fact that in the huasco and elqui rivers one and twenty consumptive water rights respectively were granted upstream from the dams after their construction may have affected the reduction in the annual runoff in fact the elqui river experienced a higher reduction in annual runoff than the huasco the results for monthly regime analyses and daily variability were similar using the two methods table 7 this is probably related to the fact that the ɸ pre post index and the standard deviation of daily flows were less sensitive compared to the annual change the percentage of the change in the mean annual runoff as the mean annual runoff could be affected by temperature which might significantly alter the water balance between different locations along the drainage network piqué et al 2016 the before and after approach could be affected by changes in climate during the study period e g wet periods and droughts as indicated by peñas et al 2016 in this study we did not include specific analyses of climate variability to distinguish wet and dry periods therefore we could not conclude that the observed changes respond to climate fluctuations 4 4 dams water management and flow regimes in chile the results presented here indicate that flow regimes in regulated rivers in chile are affected to greater or lesser extents by the construction and operation of large dams in addition as stated there are other factors that also influenced river hydrology water extractions for instance diverting water through a canal reduced the annual runoff after water rights were granted i e in a recent study muñoz et al 2020 reported a direct relation between flow water diversion through a canal and the granting of water rights in the petorca river in the central zone nor far from our study river the elqui the results of our study might be biased somehow at least in relation to the annual runoff since there was a gap between the granting of water rights and the time when this information became available in the public databases of dga in addition the degree of flow changes in the study rivers and other rivers might increase in the future due to the cumulative effects of the mega drought that is currently affecting chile garreaud et al 2019 the precipitation deficit has resulted in reduced water storage volumes especially in the northern zone there except for the conchi reservoir in the loa the mean stored volume over the last 10 years in the copiapó huasco and elqui rivers is between 31 and 59 of the total capacity of the reservoirs under these conditions the need for flow regulation increases with a detrimental effect on the downstream flow regimes finally climate simulations indicate future reductions in precipitation mostly affecting central chile garreaud et al 2019 a fact that was part of the basis of the decision to build twenty six new reservoirs in the period 2015 2025 mostly to meet irrigation demands the dimensioning in terms of the ir and operational design of these new dams should carefully consider not only the downstream hydrologic effects such as the ones described here but even more acutely those that impact the bio physical structure functioning of the affected fluvial corridors 5 conclusions the results in chilean rivers confirm previous studies worldwide indicating that regulation by large dams inevitably affects the fluvial regime to different degrees of alteration this mainly depends on the size and use of reservoirs the hydro climatic conditions of the basin and the demand for water the main findings can be summarised as follows 1 the impoundment ratio ir the ratio between the reservoir capacity and mean annual runoff does not follow a latitudinal pattern from the dry north to humid south as was the case in other studies but in any case the highest ir values are found in the drier northern rivers 2 the mean annual runoff was reduced in all the study rivers and the monthly flows of the rivers in the northern arid zone were the most affected by dams at the annual scale the northern rivers did not recover their hydrological conditions downstream of dams but the southern rivers did recover mainly because of the inflows from permanent tributaries 3 the magnitude and frequency of floods also decreased in the study rivers but no statistical relation was found between such a reduction and the degree of regulation as stated in the manuscript this work has a series of limitations inherent to most hydroclimatic studies which can be summarised as i the uneven length of flow series used in the analysis which may influence the results and their interpretation despite we have shown that analysed data encompasses a series of dry and wet cycles and ii the potential influence of others factors such as land use change and evaporation from reservoirs which may affect mostly the annual water budget of the study catchments and to a much lesser extent the rest of the addressed hydrological scales i e seasonality flood frequency and magnitude finally and from a broader perspective ours is the first study in chile to analyse the hydrological effects of reservoirs on a wide geographical scale despite the observed variability of dam effects at the various temporal scales and the fact that the initial hypothesis cannot be fully corroborated i e dams effects do not strictly follow a latitudinal gradient these types of analyses provide relevant information to improve the understanding of the extent of flow changes in regulated rivers and they offer guidance to assess future impacts as the country plans to build a series of large dams in the years to come the design in terms of the ir and the operation of such new dams will have to consider that climate simulations indicate future reductions in precipitation mostly in central chile and assess not only the downstream hydrologic effects but also those over the whole fluvial ecosystem moreover this work may open a way to use this or similar conceptual and methodological frameworks to
