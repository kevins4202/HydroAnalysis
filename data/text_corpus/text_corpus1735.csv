8675,rain gardens are an established element of water sensitive urban infrastructure however information on people s preferences for such systems is lacking to understand whether people express willingness to pay for such systems and whether estimates are transferable between locations we conducted choice experiments in sydney and melbourne we found that people are willing to pay for rain gardens the marginal willingness to pay for different features is similar in both locations but the transfer of compensating surplus values between locations still generates transfer errors the implications of transfer errors are investigated using a benefit cost analysis of a rain garden installation keywords benefit transfer choice experiment non market values rain gardens water sensitive urban designs 1 introduction decentralised stormwater management technologies such as rain gardens are important elements of urban water sensitive infrastructure in australia the us singapore and many other countries rain gardens are low maintenance self watering gardens designed to receive rainwater from surrounding areas such as roofs paved areas and roads they are planted with trees and or shrubs often native and covered with a bark mulch layer or ground cover 1 rain gardens usually include infiltration trenches and bio retentions systems to filter pollution out of the water with widespread implementation rain gardens could reduce flood frequency 2 reduce pollution load and improve the microclimate through capturing stormwater close to its source 3 besides stormwater management benefits rain gardens provide aesthetic cultural and biodiversity services to urban residents deciding on investing in water sensitive urban infrastructures requires information on all benefits including the social values that this infrastructure can provide while there is a good understanding of the environmental benefits of rain gardens and their values information on the intangible benefits of rain gardens to residents is lacking in the absence of markets for intangible benefits non market valuation techniques can be used to understand community preferences 4 discrete choice experiments are one non market valuation technique that allows economic values for the characteristics of a good that is not traded in the market such as an environmental good to be estimated the technique involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios described by several attributes the choices are used to determine respondents preferences for the trade offs between different attributes and attribute levels 5 6 another non market valuation technique is benefit transfer the benefit transfer technique allows estimating the economic value of goods or services by transferring with appropriate adjustments information available from studies already completed in one location or context to another location or context 7 there are some examples of non market valuation methods being used to estimate the value of decentralised stormwater management systems bowman tyndall et al 8 used a contingent valuation survey method in ames ia usa and found that the mean maximum willingness to pay for a rain garden was us 1396 9 used a choice experiment to estimate people s willingness to pay for stormwater management services in champaign urbana usa and found that people were willing to pay to reduce flood frequency especially in the case of basement flooding but the value of flood reduction depended on their past exposure to flooding 10 found that in the baltimore washington corridor usa people were willing to pay on average about us 72 per square meter of a rain garden installed on their properties 11 estimated people s willingness to pay for different services obtained from public stormwater management options in sydney and melbourne australia but did not study any specific design features of the stormwater management options 12 identified several benefits of rain gardens from a community survey in adelaide australia which included an aesthetically pleasing appearance mitigation of local flooding calming traffic and attractiveness to environmentally conscious homebuyers however they did not quantify the economic value of these benefits overall we are not aware of any study that has quantified the social benefits of rain gardens and their design features we contribute to this literature by estimating the willingness to pay for the design features of rain gardens on public spaces in sydney and melbourne and testing the validity of benefit transfer mechanisms for the stormwater management systems in both sydney and melbourne the two most populated australian cities rain gardens are a widely accepted element of stormwater management infrastructure we use a choice experiment to examine five design features of rain garden projects the number of rain gardens on an extended curb the presence of rain gardens between the footpath and the curb rain gardens with and without trees rain gardens well maintained or not and rain gardens bordered with hedge plants or not the results provide information on whether people have preferences for different features of rain gardens and the relative strength of their preferences another contribution of our study is to demonstrate the importance of incorporating non market values in the formal benefit cost analysis of rain garden projects there are a few studies that have included non market benefits in the benefit cost analysis of water sensitive systems and practices for example in los angeles california usa 13 use the benefit transfer method to incorporate non market values into their benefit cost analysis of several stormwater quality management options they find the benefit cost ratios are all close to zero and argue that a quick benefit cost study with benefit transfer values is useful as it can identify projects that either unambiguously do or do not make sense for middle ground projects further primary analysis is required carter and keeler 14 incorporate some social benefits in their evaluation of green roofs in athens georgia usa for social benefits the study relies primarily on secondary sources benefit transfer the study identified that in this case rather than the inclusion of non market benefits a decrease in construction costs and an increase in construction warranty length is required to make widespread adoption of green roofs a better option than traditional approaches polyakov fogarty et al 15 compare the costs and amenity benefits of a living stream project in perth western australia they report benefit cost ratios bcr of between 1 6 and 4 2 depending on the assumed discount rate and extent of the amenity benefit which is estimated via the hedonic price method nordman isely et al 16 estimate net present values for a range of green infrastructure options in grand rapids michigan usa they use the benefit transfer method to incorporate non market values for the base case scenario they find positive npvs for porous asphalt rain gardens street trees and conserving natural areas and negative npvs for green roofs and infiltrating bioretention 17 present three examples of benefit cost analysis of water sensitive city projects in australia where the benefit cost ratio is greater than one each example relies at least in part on benefit transfer for non market values and in each example the value of improved aesthetics and or improved ecological stream health is a major component of the total benefits we contribute to the relatively limited literature on the benefit cost analysis of rain gardens in three ways first we estimate the marginal willingness to pay for different rain garden design features information on social preferences for various design features provides planners and engineers with the knowledge that will allow them to implement rain garden designs that are not only functionally sound but also socially preferred second using the method developed by morrison bennett et al 18 we estimate the total value of rain garden projects and explore the differences between the two cities finally using a stylised example we conduct a benefit cost analysis for rain garden installations where we also consider the pollution removal benefits of rain gardens such comprehensive analysis contributes to the growing literature on understanding the benefits of implementing decentralised stormwater management systems such as rain gardens 2 materials and methods 2 1 questionnaire development the questionnaires were developed in several stages first we held a series of consultation meetings with experts from the city of sydney and melbourne water 2014 2015 to identify the list of relevant attributes and design the first draft of the questionnaire next in march 2016 we conducted two focus group discussions to test the preliminary questionnaire internal testing within the university of western australia took place in april 2016 the final stage of the development process was the release of a pilot of the questionnaire in may 2016 based on this process we identified five rain garden features as relevant attributes number of rain gardens on an extended curb the presence of rain gardens between the footpath and the curb the presence of trees on rain gardens maintenance level of rain gardens and whether rain gardens are bordered with hedge plants or not we developed different levels of individual attributes each respondent was shown images of the attributes and attribute levels see fig s1 the questionnaire consists of three sections the first section contains information and questions related to stormwater management and rain gardens including questions about respondents awareness and experience with stormwater management options the second section includes the choice sets see fig s2 for an example each choice set consists of two options with different combinations of features of rain garden designs and additional costs and an opt out option where no rain garden is constructed and residents incur no additional costs the third section includes a set of debriefing questions to obtain information on respondents uncertainty in answering questions decision heuristics used and socio demographic characteristics we designed the survey using an s efficiency criterion 19 implemented via the ngene software 20 the design includes 24 choice sets blocked into four groups of six we obtained the required priors from the pilot study conducted in may 2016 2 2 econometric model to estimate the willingness to pay directly we have implemented a willingness to pay space model this type of model is commonly used to estimate non market values 21 24 below we describe the wtp space model in our survey s context following the notation of 22 we assume that respondent i derives utility u i t j from selecting alternative j in choice set t the utility is separable in price p i t j a vector of non priced attributes such as different features of a rain garden x i t j and an additional effect associated with the alternative specific constant asc captured by an alternative specific dummy o i t j in our design the opt out does not reflect a situation where no option is selected but rather a case where there is a clearly defined streetscape equivalent to one where all of the attributes in the choice set are set to their zero levels one approach to estimation would be to impose the constraint that the utility associated with the status quo is zero and rain gardens are defined relative to that however it may be the case that respondents bring additional unobserved perceptions about rain gardens that are not captured by the attributes as described we allow for this by including an asc defined as equal to one for the non status quo alternatives the model can then be written as 1 u i t j α i p i t j β i x i t j γ i o i t j ε i t j where α i is an individual specific parameter for the price β i is a vector of individual specific parameters related to non price attributes γ i is the individual specific parameter for the asc option and ε i t j is an error term that is assumed to be drawn from a gumbel distribution the variance of ε i t j is respondent specific such that var ε i t j μ i 2 π 2 6 where μ i is the scale parameter for respondent i by dividing both sides of equation 1 by the scale parameter it is possible to obtain the scale free equivalent expansion 2 u i t j α i μ i p i t j β i μ i x i t j γ i μ i o i t j ε i t j now let the utility coefficients be defined as λ i α i μ i θ i β i μ i and ϕ i γ i μ i such that equation 2 can be written as 3 u i t j λ i p i t j θ i x i t j ϕ i o i t j ε i t j the implied individual specific estimated wtp is the ratio of the attribute s coefficient to the price coefficient so for attribute w i θ i λ i and the value of the asc is y i ϕ i λ i using this definition equation 3 can be re written to derive utility in willingness to pay space as 4 u i t j λ i p i t j λ i w i x i t j λ i y i o i t j ε i t j where w i is the individual specific wtp estimate and y i is the individual specific implicit price for the asc dummy for estimation we follow the standard convention and use the negative of the cost coefficient and assume it is log normally distributed all coefficients other than cost are assumed to be normally distributed random parameters are assumed to be correlated the model is estimated using maximum likelihood following 23 3 data to recruit representative samples in terms of age and income from sydney and melbourne we hired a professional survey company we collected 958 completed questionnaires via online surveys in june july 2016 and table 1 provides complete descriptive statistic information on the sample table 1 shows that across the two cities there were no statistically significant differences in socio economic characteristics and attitudes except for the support for two statements rain gardens should be part of larger stormwater management options and if there are cheaper options for stormwater management than rain gardens agencies should use them respondents from sydney showed higher support for these statements but the differences are small from a practical point of view the responses to the choice sets were also reasonably similar between the two groups except the answer to the question of whether or not respondents considered their financial circumstances when completing the survey a relatively higher proportion of respondents considered their financial circumstances in melbourne 81 compared to the respondents in sydney 74 but in both cases the proportion considering their financial circumstances is high 4 result the modelling strategy adopted is to estimate individual models for the sydney and melbourne samples and then formally test whether they can be combined into a single model the models included only the choice set attributes and no socio demographic interactions to avoid identifying local optima a large number of draws might be required therefore we have experimented with 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 halton draws it has been observed that the city specific models stabilise between 2000 and 2500 draws whereas the pooled model stabilises between 1000 and 1500 therefore in the paper we have reported results based on 2500 draws for the city specific models and 1500 draws for the pooled model all estimations employed the mixlogitwtp command in stata 16 23 the results are organised into two main sections people s willingness to pay for different rain garden features and testing of equivalency of compensating surplus 4 1 residents willingness to pay for different rain garden features the estimates from willingness to pay space models for the two city specific samples and the pooled data are shown in table 2 a likelihood ratio test was used to examine if the samples could be pooled the relevant lr test statistic for the pooled model was 25 54 p 0 10 which suggests that at 10 level of significance it is not possible to reject the null that the preference parameters are the same for the two samples while assuming that the error variance is also the same across samples and so we proceed with a discussion of the pooled model results results from the pooled model show that when evaluated at the mean of the random parameter distribution people had a preference for an increase in the number of rain gardens the mean wtp in aud for one rain garden was 11 41 year hh in terms of location rain gardens located between the footpath and the curb are preferred 8 90 year hh there is a preference to have rain gardens with borders made of hedge plants wtp was 5 59 year hh on the other hand respondents had negative preferences for the presence of trees inside a rain garden 8 54 year hh the mean wtp for the asc option was observed 84 18 year hh we interpret this as strong evidence of a community preference for rain gardens as indicated by the sd parameters there is substantial preference heterogeneity for different rain garden features across the respondents to understand the extent of heterogeneity we calculated the proportion of respondents with positive values for each attribute 1 1 as noted by a reviewer the estimate of the proportion may be sensitive to the accuracy of the assumption of a normal distribution of the parameter table s1 results for the pooled model suggest that a substantial majority of respondents had positive preferences for the number of rain gardens on extended curbs 100 and for the rain gardens bordered with hedge plants 76 similarly 70 of the respondents had positive preferences for rain gardens between the footpath and the curb on the other hand 49 of the respondents preferred well maintained rain gardens and only 32 of the respondents preferred trees inside a rain garden in addition to the high wtp value found for the asc option the proportion of respondents that preferred this option was also high 84 this is further evidence that there is broad community support for rain garden projects as mentioned above the lr test established the similarities in preferences between the two locations however policymakers are often more interested in the total value of a project as such information can be used in benefit cost analysis we therefore examine the equivalence of the total value of rain garden projects across the two cities 4 2 the equivalence of compensating surpluses in the context of environmental goods compensating surplus is generally understood to represent the change in income required to maintain utility at a given level following a change in environmental quality in this application we follow van bueren and bennett 25 and define the total benefit of a rain garden project calculated from the various attribute levels and implicit price for these levels as the approximate measure of compensating surplus specifically we calculate the compensating surplus in three steps in the first step we generate project profiles due to a large number of feasible combinations of different levels of attributes it is common practice is to test the variation in compensating surplus for a randomly selected subset of projects 11 18 26 if there are true preference differences across only a subset of attributes with this approach it is possible that some combinations where there are real differences are not considered to avoid this issue we have generated project profiles involving all possible combinations of levels of different attributes in total there are 56 possible project profiles in the second step following johnston and duke 27 we generate wtp distributions specifically 1000 random draws of implicit price or marginal wtp estimates were simulated based on the krinsky robb method 28 using the parameter vector and associated covariance matrix in the final step we have calculated the total value of individual projects as a linear combination of the values for individual attributes in calculating the total value for the project it is necessary to decide whether to include the value of the asc coefficient depending on what is being valued some studies have included the value of the asc in the calculation of the total value of a project while others have not morrison bennett et al 18 suggest that if the asc reflects a green glow associated with an environmental change then it does not represent a part of the true value of the project and hence should not be included in the benefit transfer calculation however if the asc coefficient does represent some unobservable component of utility from the project then it could be argued that it should be included although with the further caveat that should only be the case where one believes these unobservable components are similar across sites brent gangadharan et al 11 did not include the value of the asc option because they valued heterogeneous projects morrison bennett et al 18 included the value of the opt out option because they valued similar projects improvement of wetlands however they note that this implies the relatively strong assumption that the value of the unobserved portion of projects being valued is the same across locations in our example the asc coefficient is the wtp for a rain garden project without features described by attributes and we have measured values for a very well defined project as such we have estimated the total value of individual projects including the value of the asc in fig 1 the distributions of simulated pair wise total values for individual projects in both locations are presented and as can be seen all point lie above the 45 degree line which indicates that the total value is always higher for the sydney sample for a given project for ease of comparison the mean median and inter quartile range of the compensating surplus estimates are shown in table 3 the difference in mean estimates was 44 which from a practical point of view is large to test whether the difference is statistically significant we use the test proposed by poe giraud et al 29 which is a one sided test of significance based on the complete combinatorial test to implement this test we first calculated the differences between all the possible combinations of simulated wtps of the two locations the result from the formal poe test shows that the total values of the two locations are statistically different at the 5 level of significance 5 policy implications of benefit cost analysis the comparison of compensating surpluses presented in section 4 2 indicates that the differences in total values between the cities are statistically significant however it is unclear whether such differences would influence the overall assessment i e benefit cost analysis of a policy to invest in rain garden projects we therefore examine the implications of using transferred values in a benefit cost analysis 30 31 the context we consider to understand the implication of transfer errors is a benefit cost analysis bca of installing a hypothetical rain garden in a sub catchment in sydney benefits to two groups of stakeholders are considered households living adjacent to a rain garden and people who benefit from removing pollutants from stormwater we do not assume any particular characteristics of the potential beneficiaries and consider three scenarios in the first scenario we use the true willingness to pay estimates for sydney additionally we included the value of removing pollutants from stormwater in sydney as part of the overall assessment of the benefit other types of potential benefits such as a potential flood mitigation benefit and a biodiversity benefit are not included in the analysis due to lack of data in the second scenario we included the value of removing pollutants but use transferred unadjusted willingness to pay estimates from melbourne rather than the sydney specific estimate in the third scenario we included only the pollution removal benefit but no social preference data in all three scenarios the implicit assumption is that in the absence of a rain garden the authority would implement a traditional stormwater drainage system that would not have any amenity value and a minimal pollution removal capacity at the local level the comparison of scenarios 1 and 2 provides information on the impact of benefit transfer errors and the comparison of scenarios 1 and 3 provides information on the importance of including social preference information in a formal benefit cost analysis of water sensitive urban design technologies the extent of the benefit of removing pollutants from stormwater depends on the rain garden size the pollutant load in the area and the effective filtration rate the value of removing pollutant load via a rain garden can be calculated as follows let s denote the service area of one m2 of a rain garden in the sub catchment q κ ζ denote the load for pollutant κ expressed in kg of pollutant per m2 at time ζ e κ ζ denote the effective filtration rate for pollutant κ and b κ ζ denote the price or environmental value associated with removing a kg of pollutant κ the annual value of the environmental benefit due to one m2 of a rain garden at time ζ is then v ζ κ q κ ζ e κ ζ b κ ζ s where the net present value npv of this benefit can be obtained by summing the annual benefits over the effective life of the rain garden and applying an appropriate discount rate n p v v ζ v ζ 1 r ζ where r denotes the discount rate based on the discussion in department of water 32 we set s 20 such that one m2 of rain garden can effectively filter the pollutant load over the 20 m2 surface area rain gardens can remove a range of pollutants including heavy metals and pathogens 33 but here we focus on the ability of rain gardens to remove total nitrogen in the sample sub catchment the annual total nitrogen load is 2 29 g per m2 34 the pollutant removal capacity of a rain garden is based on derry macnamara et al 35 which reports sydney specific information and this study estimates total nitrogen removal efficiency of between 26 and 68 with a mean of 47 these values define the low high and base case removal efficiency scenarios respectively the cost of removing pollutants with an alternative method is used as the basis for determining the monetary value of pollution removal the value of nitrogen removal was obtained from the department of environment and conservation 36 which provides information on the cost of removing pollutants for sydney using a hypothetical constructed wetland the relevant value expressed in 2016 aud per kg of nitrogen removed was 674 kg we use this as the base case value and set the low and high pollution value scenarios at 25 of this value the social values of rain gardens are based on the compensating surplus estimates as detailed in table 3 the median compensating surplus was used as the base value and the values for the first and third quartiles were used for the low and high value scenarios respectively to aggregate the social value we multiply the social value estimate by the number of households within the catchment of a rain garden which was assumed to be within 50 m of a rain garden based on spatial analysis of a random sample of actual rain gardens in sydney it was found that the number of households within 50 m varied between 12 and 60 with a mean of 36 these values define the low high and base case population scenarios respectively the cost of installing rain gardens was derived from brinckerhoff 37 for the base case cost scenario the cost of installing a rain garden was set at 1269 per m2 2016 adjusted which includes the capital cost of all associated work maintenance cost was set at 41 20 per m2 2016 adjusted we assume maintenance costs are 50 higher for the first two years of a rain garden s useful life due to vegetation establishment costs the low and high cost scenarios were also based on brinckerhoff 37 and for the low cost scenario the capital cost is 846 per m2 and for the high cost scenario the capital cost is 2962 per m2 the respective low and high annual maintenance cost values are 24 82 and 88 21 per m2 respectively and as per the base case maintenance costs are 50 higher in the first two years for the evaluation we estimate the impact of transfer errors on the benefit cost ratio bcr and net present value npv for bcr values greater than one indicate that the total benefits of rain gardens are greater than the total cost for npv values greater than zero indicate positive net benefit of a project we estimate the bcr and npv for the full set of factorial combinations 2 187 of the following factors table 4 the cost of construction low base and high removal efficiency low base and high the value of pollution removal low base and high the social value low base and high the population level low base and high the discount rate 3 6 and 9 and the effective life 10 years 20 years and 30 years practice regarding the discount rate assumption is highly varied across developed countries 38 in light of this we use discount rates of 3 6 and 9 with 6 used as the reference rate and refer readers to table s2 to see the impact of using higher 9 and lower 3 discount rates by considering this wide range of combinations we are trying to explore what we think is the likely maximum possible range for the bcr and npv for projects that might be considered to test the policy impact of using the benefits transfer method we estimate the bcrs and npvs for these combinations for three social value scenarios table 5 in scenario 1 the bcrs for the 2187 combinations were calculated with the wtp estimates from sydney the true wtp estimates and the summary statistics are presented in table 5 the last column in table 5 shows the proportion of times the bcr was above one and in 26 of the cases the bcr exceeded one in scenario 2 wtp estimates from melbourne transferred values were used to calculate the relevant bcrs by comparing the results the extent of error due to using transferred values i e using melbourne data for a sydney location can be understood it can be seen that the proportion of combinations where the bcr was above one was 11 in scenario 2 in other words the proportion of scenarios when the bcr is above one dropped by 15 points when transferred values melbourne are used finally in scenario 3 where information on social preferences is not included no scenario has a bcr above one this shows the importance of considering non market values while assessing water sensitive projects additional analysis of the impact of other key variables is presented in table s2 considering the range of results more generally it could be argued that overall the extent of the error due to using transferred values is modest but real for benefit cost analysis we suggest that incorrectly concluding a project has a net benefit when the truth is that it does not type i error is a more costly mistake than failing to identify a project that does have a net positive benefit type ii error so while in this specific case the error is towards lower bcr values we think in general the result suggests using a higher threshold than one is an appropriate strategy to use for project evaluation when using benefit transfer values such an approach will mitigate against type i errors at the cost of higher type ii errors for a scenario such as transferring values for a well defined project such as a rain garden across cities that are broadly similar in characteristics then a threshold value of around one and a half rather than one might be seen as a reasonable rule of thumb where the difference between the transfer target sites is greater a higher threshold for concluding a net benefit say two could be used 6 conclusion in this paper we make two contributions first we have estimated the non market values of different design features of rain gardens for melbourne and sydney and this is the first study to estimate such values for the australian context based on the pooled model results presented in table 2 the willingness to pay for a rain garden project with three rain gardens on an extended curb a rain garden between the footpath and the curb no tree inside the rain gardens which are bordered with hedge plants is 133 per annum per household for households within 50 m of the rain garden we interpret this as evidence of community preference for rain gardens in australia s two largest cities our second contribution is on the extent of benefit transfer errors when evaluating water sensitive urban design projects we have provided a comprehensive assessment of the benefit transfer method including an assessment of preference homogeneity and equivalency of compensating surplus our analysis showed that the willingness to pay estimates are largely transferable between melbourne and sydney however the transfer of compensating surplus and benefit cost analysis of a hypothetical rain garden showing that some benefit transfer errors do emerge even when transferring values between two similar cities such variation in results indicates the importance of the types of analysis being undertaken where non market values are used if policymakers are interested in understanding social preferences for different rain garden design options then the results suggest it is acceptable to transfer wtp estimates between the two locations however if the objective is to use the wtp estimates in formal benefit cost analysis caution is required as a practical strategy when using benefit transfer for wsud project assessments we suggest using a critical bcr higher than one such an approach protects against incorrectly determining that a project has net benefits when it does not at the cost of failing to identify some projects that do have positive net benefits author statement md sayed iftekhar conceptualization methodology data analysis writing

8675,rain gardens are an established element of water sensitive urban infrastructure however information on people s preferences for such systems is lacking to understand whether people express

choice experiments are one non market valuation technique that allows economic values for the characteristics of a good that is not traded in the market such as an environmental good to be estimated the technique involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios described by several attributes the choices are used to determine respondents preferences for the trade offs between different attributes and attribute levels 5 6 another non market valuation technique is benefit transfer the benefit transfer technique allows estimating the economic value of goods or services by transferring with appropriate adjustments information available from studies already completed in one location or context to another location or context 7 there are some

10 found that in the baltimore washington corridor usa people were willing to pay on average about us 72 per square meter of a rain garden installed on their properties 11 estimated people s willingness to pay for different services obtained from public stormwater management options in sydney and melbourne australia but did not study any specific design features of the stormwater management options 12 identified several benefits of rain gardens from a community survey in adelaide australia which included an aesthetically pleasing appearance mitigation of local flooding calming traffic and attractiveness to environmentally conscious homebuyers however they did not quantify the economic value of these benefits overall we are not aware of any study that has quantified the social benefits of rain gardens and their design features we contribute to this literature by estimating the willingness to pay for the design features of rain gardens on public spaces in sydney and melbourne and testing the validity of benefit transfer mechanisms for the stormwater management systems in both sydney and melbourne the two most populated australian cities rain gardens are a widely accepted element of stormwater management infrastructure we use a choice experiment to examine five design features of rain garden projects the number of rain gardens on an extended curb the presence of rain gardens between the footpath and the curb rain gardens with and without trees rain gardens well maintained or not and rain gardens bordered with hedge plants or not the results provide information on whether people have preferences for different features of rain gardens and the relative strength of their preferences another contribution of our study is to demonstrate the importance of incorporating non market values in the formal benefit cost analysis of rain garden projects there are a few studies that have included non market benefits in the benefit cost analysis of water sensitive systems and practices for example in los angeles california usa 13 use the benefit transfer method to incorporate non market values into their benefit cost analysis of several stormwater quality management options they find the benefit cost ratios are all close to zero and argue that a quick benefit cost study with benefit transfer values is useful as it can identify projects that either unambiguously do or do not make sense for middle ground projects further primary analysis is required carter and keeler 14 incorporate some social benefits in their evaluation of green roofs in athens georgia usa for social benefits the study relies primarily on secondary sources benefit transfer the study identified that in this case rather than the inclusion of non market benefits a decrease in construction costs and an increase in construction warranty length is required to make widespread adoption of green roofs a better option than traditional approaches polyakov fogarty et al 15 compare the costs and amenity benefits of a living stream project in perth western australia they report benefit cost ratios bcr of between 1 6 and 4 2 depending on the assumed discount rate and extent of the amenity benefit which is estimated via the hedonic price method nordman isely et al 16 estimate net present values for a range of green infrastructure options in grand rapids michigan usa they use the benefit transfer method to incorporate non market values for the base case scenario they find positive npvs for porous asphalt rain gardens street trees and conserving natural areas and negative npvs for green roofs and infiltrating bioretention 17 present three examples of benefit cost analysis of water sensitive city projects in australia where the benefit cost ratio is greater than one each example relies at least in part on benefit transfer for non market values and in each example the value of improved aesthetics and or improved ecological stream health is a major component of the total benefits we contribute to the relatively limited literature on the benefit cost analysis of rain gardens in three ways first we estimate the marginal willingness to pay for different rain garden design features information on social preferences for various design features provides planners and engineers with the knowledge that will allow them to implement rain garden designs that are not only functionally sound but also socially preferred second using the method developed by morrison bennett et al 18 we estimate the total value of rain garden projects and explore the differences between the two cities finally using a stylised example we conduct a benefit cost analysis for rain garden installations where we also consider the pollution removal benefits of rain gardens such comprehensive analysis contributes to the growing literature on understanding the benefits of implementing decentralised stormwater management systems such as rain gardens 2 materials and methods 2 1 questionnaire development the questionnaires were developed in several stages first we held a series of consultation meetings with experts from the city of sydney and melbourne water 2014 2015 to identify the list of relevant attributes and design the first draft of the questionnaire next in march 2016 we conducted two focus group discussions to test the preliminary questionnaire internal testing within the university of western australia took place in april 2016 the final stage of the development process was the release of a pilot of the questionnaire in may 2016 based on this process we identified five rain garden features as relevant attributes number of rain gardens on an extended curb the presence of rain gardens between the footpath and the curb the presence of trees on rain gardens maintenance level of rain gardens and whether rain gardens are bordered with hedge plants or not we developed different levels of individual attributes each respondent was shown images of the attributes and attribute levels see fig s1 the questionnaire consists of three sections the first section contains information and questions related to stormwater management and rain gardens including questions about respondents awareness and experience with stormwater management options the second section includes the choice sets see fig s2 for an example each choice set consists of two options with different combinations of features of rain garden designs and additional costs and an opt out option where no rain garden is constructed and residents incur no additional costs the third section includes a set of debriefing questions to obtain information on respondents uncertainty in answering questions decision heuristics used and socio demographic characteristics we designed the survey using an s efficiency criterion 19 implemented via the ngene software 20 the design includes 24 choice sets blocked into four groups of six we obtained the required priors from the pilot study conducted in may 2016 2 2 econometric model to estimate the willingness to pay directly we have implemented a willingness to pay space model this type of model is commonly used to estimate non market values 21 24 below we describe the wtp space model in our survey s context following the notation of 22 we assume that respondent i derives utility u i t j from selecting alternative j in choice set t the utility is separable in price p i t j a vector of non priced attributes such as different features of a rain garden x i t j and an additional effect associated with the alternative specific constant asc captured by an alternative specific dummy o i t j in our design the opt out does not reflect a situation where no option is selected but rather a case where there is a clearly defined streetscape equivalent to one where all of the attributes in the choice set are set to their zero levels one approach to estimation would be to impose the constraint that the utility associated with the status quo is zero and rain gardens are defined relative to that however it may be the case that respondents bring additional unobserved perceptions about rain gardens that are not captured by the attributes as described we allow for this by including an asc defined as equal to one for the non status quo alternatives the model can then be written as 1 u i t j α i p i t j β i x i t j γ i o i t j ε i t j where α i is an individual specific parameter for the price β i is a vector of individual specific parameters related to non price attributes γ i is the individual specific parameter for the asc option and ε i t j is an error term that is assumed to be drawn from a gumbel distribution the variance of ε i t j is respondent specific such that var ε i t j μ i 2 π 2 6 where μ i is the scale parameter for respondent i by dividing both sides of equation 1 by the scale parameter it is possible to obtain the scale free equivalent expansion 2 u i t j α i μ i p i t j β i μ i x i t j γ i μ i o i t j ε i t j now let the utility coefficients be defined as λ i α i μ i θ i β i μ i and ϕ i γ i μ i such that equation 2 can be written as 3 u i t j λ i p i t j θ i x i t j ϕ i o i t j ε i t j the implied individual specific estimated wtp is the ratio of the attribute s coefficient to the price coefficient so for attribute w i θ i λ i and the value of the asc is y i ϕ i λ i using this definition equation 3 can be re written to derive utility in willingness to pay space as 4 u i t j λ i p i t j λ i w i x i t j λ i y i o i t j ε i t j where w i is the individual specific wtp estimate and y i is the individual specific implicit price for the asc dummy for estimation we follow the standard convention and use the negative of the cost coefficient and assume it is log normally distributed all coefficients other than cost are assumed to be normally distributed random parameters are assumed to be correlated the model is estimated using maximum likelihood following 23 3 data to recruit representative samples in terms of age and income from sydney and melbourne we hired a professional survey company we collected 958 completed questionnaires via online surveys in june july 2016 and table 1 provides complete descriptive statistic information on the sample table 1 shows that across the two cities there were no statistically significant differences in socio economic characteristics and attitudes except for the support for two statements rain gardens should be part of larger stormwater management options and if there are cheaper options for stormwater management than rain gardens agencies should use them respondents from sydney showed higher support for these statements but the differences are small from a practical point of view the responses to the choice sets were also reasonably similar between the two groups except the answer to the question of whether or not respondents considered their financial circumstances when completing the survey a relatively higher proportion of respondents considered their financial circumstances in melbourne 81 compared to the respondents in sydney 74 but in both cases the proportion considering their financial circumstances is high 4 result the modelling strategy adopted is to estimate individual models for the sydney and melbourne samples and then formally test whether they can be combined into a single model the models included only the choice set attributes and no socio demographic interactions to avoid identifying local optima a large number of draws might be required therefore we have experimented with 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 halton draws it has been observed that the city specific models stabilise between 2000 and 2500 draws whereas the pooled model stabilises between 1000 and 1500 therefore in the paper we have reported results based on 2500 draws for the city specific models and 1500 draws for the pooled model all estimations employed the mixlogitwtp command in stata 16 23 the results are organised into two main sections people s willingness to pay for different rain garden features and testing of equivalency of compensating surplus 4 1 residents willingness to pay for different rain garden features the estimates from willingness to pay space models for the two city specific samples and the pooled data are shown in table 2 a likelihood ratio test was used to examine if the samples could be pooled the relevant lr test statistic for the pooled model was 25 54 p 0 10 which suggests that at 10 level of significance it is not possible to reject the null that the preference parameters are the same for the two samples while assuming that the error variance is also the same across samples and so we proceed with a discussion of the pooled model results results from the pooled model show that when evaluated at the mean of the random parameter distribution people had a preference for an increase in the number of rain gardens the mean wtp in aud for one rain garden was 11 41 year hh in terms of location rain gardens located between the footpath and the curb are preferred 8 90 year hh there is a preference to have rain gardens with borders made of hedge plants wtp was 5 59 year hh on the other hand respondents had negative preferences for the presence of trees inside a rain garden 8 54 year hh the mean wtp for the asc option was observed 84 18 year hh we interpret this as strong evidence of a community preference for rain gardens as indicated by the sd parameters there is substantial preference heterogeneity for different rain garden features across the respondents to understand the extent of heterogeneity we calculated the proportion of respondents with positive values for each attribute 1 1 as noted by a reviewer the estimate of the proportion may be sensitive to the accuracy of the assumption of a normal distribution of the parameter table s1 results for the pooled model suggest that a substantial majority of respondents had positive preferences for the number of rain gardens on extended curbs 100 and for the rain gardens bordered with hedge plants 76 similarly 70 of the respondents had positive preferences for rain gardens between the footpath and the curb on the other hand 49 of the respondents preferred well maintained rain gardens and only 32 of the respondents preferred trees inside a rain garden in addition to the high wtp value found for the asc option the proportion of respondents that preferred this option was also high 84 this is further evidence that there is broad community support for rain garden projects as mentioned above the lr test established the similarities in preferences between the two locations however policymakers are often more interested in the total value of a project as such information can be used in benefit cost analysis we therefore examine the equivalence of the total value of rain garden projects across the two cities 4 2 the equivalence of compensating surpluses in the context of environmental goods compensating surplus is generally understood to represent the change in income required to maintain utility at a given level following a change in environmental quality in this application we follow van bueren and bennett 25 and define the total benefit of a rain garden project calculated from the various attribute levels and implicit price for these levels as the approximate measure of compensating surplus specifically we calculate the compensating surplus in three steps in the first step we generate project profiles due to a large number of feasible combinations of different levels of attributes it is common practice is to test the variation in compensating surplus for a randomly selected subset of projects 11 18 26 if there are true preference differences across only a subset of attributes with this approach it is possible that some combinations where there are real differences are not considered to avoid this issue we have generated project profiles involving all possible combinations of levels of different attributes in total there are 56 possible project profiles in the second step following johnston and duke 27 we generate wtp distributions specifically 1000 random draws of implicit price or marginal wtp estimates were simulated based on the krinsky robb method 28 using the parameter vector and associated covariance matrix in the final step we have calculated the total value of individual projects as a linear combination of the values for individual attributes in calculating the total value for the project it is necessary to decide whether to include the value of the asc coefficient depending on what is being valued some studies have included the value of the asc in the calculation of the total value of a project while others have not morrison bennett et al 18 suggest that if the asc reflects a green glow associated with an environmental change then it does not represent a part of the true value of the project and hence should not be included in the benefit transfer calculation however if the asc coefficient does represent some unobservable component of utility from the project then it could be argued that it should be included although with the further caveat that should only be the case where one believes these unobservable components are similar across sites brent gangadharan et al 11 did not include the value of the asc option because they valued heterogeneous projects morrison bennett et al 18 included the value of the opt out option because they valued similar projects improvement of wetlands however they note that this implies the relatively strong assumption that the value of the unobserved portion of projects being valued is the same across locations in our example the asc coefficient is the wtp for a rain garden project without features described by attributes and we have measured values for a very well defined project as such we have estimated the total value of individual projects including the value of the asc in fig 1 the distributions of simulated pair wise total values for individual projects in both locations are presented and as can be seen all point lie above the 45 degree line which indicates that the total value is always higher for the sydney sample for a given project for ease of comparison the mean median and inter quartile range of the compensating surplus estimates are shown in table 3 the difference in mean estimates was 44 which from a practical point of view is large to test whether the difference is statistically significant we use the test proposed by poe giraud et al 29 which is a one sided test of significance based on the complete combinatorial test to implement this test we first calculated the differences between all the possible combinations of simulated wtps of the two locations the result from the formal poe test shows that the total values of the two locations are statistically different at the 5 level of significance 5 policy implications of benefit cost analysis the comparison of compensating surpluses presented in section 4 2 indicates that the differences in total values between the cities are statistically significant however it is unclear whether such differences would influence the overall assessment i e benefit cost analysis of a policy to invest in rain garden projects we therefore examine the implications of using transferred values in a benefit cost analysis 30 31 the context we consider to understand the implication of transfer errors is a benefit cost analysis bca of installing a hypothetical rain garden in a sub catchment in sydney benefits to two groups of stakeholders are considered households living adjacent to a rain garden and people who benefit from removing pollutants from stormwater we do not assume any particular characteristics of the potential beneficiaries and consider three scenarios in the first scenario we use the true willingness to pay estimates for sydney additionally we included the value of removing pollutants from stormwater in sydney as part of the overall assessment of the benefit other types of potential benefits such as a potential flood mitigation benefit and a biodiversity benefit are not included in the analysis due to lack of data in the second scenario we included the value of removing pollutants but use transferred unadjusted willingness to pay estimates from melbourne rather than the sydney specific estimate in the third scenario we included only the pollution removal benefit but no social preference data in all three scenarios the implicit assumption is that in the absence of a rain garden the authority would implement a traditional stormwater drainage system that would not have any amenity value and a minimal pollution removal capacity at the local level the comparison of scenarios 1 and 2 provides information on the impact of benefit transfer errors and the comparison of scenarios 1 and 3 provides information on the importance of including social preference information in a formal benefit cost analysis of water sensitive urban design technologies the extent of the benefit of removing pollutants from stormwater depends on the rain garden size the pollutant load in the area and the effective filtration rate the value of removing pollutant load via a rain garden can be calculated as follows let s denote the service area of one m2 of a rain garden in the sub catchment q κ ζ denote the load for pollutant κ expressed in kg of pollutant per m2 at time ζ e κ ζ denote the effective filtration rate for pollutant κ and b κ ζ denote the price or environmental value associated with removing a kg of pollutant κ the annual value of the environmental benefit due to one m2 of a rain garden at time ζ is then v ζ κ q κ ζ e κ ζ b κ ζ s where the net present value npv of this benefit can be obtained by summing the annual benefits over the effective life of the rain garden and applying an appropriate discount rate n p v v ζ v ζ 1 r ζ where r denotes the discount rate based on the discussion in department of water 32 we set s 20 such that one m2 of rain garden can effectively filter the pollutant load over the 20 m2 surface area rain gardens can remove a range of pollutants including heavy metals and pathogens 33 but here we focus on the ability of rain gardens to remove total nitrogen in the sample sub catchment the annual total nitrogen load is 2 29 g per m2 34 the pollutant removal capacity of a rain garden is based on derry macnamara et al 35 which reports sydney specific information and this study estimates total nitrogen removal efficiency of between 26 and 68 with a mean of 47 these values define the low high and base case removal efficiency scenarios respectively the cost of removing pollutants with an alternative method is used as the basis for determining the monetary value of pollution removal the value of nitrogen removal was obtained from the department of environment and conservation 36 which provides information on the cost of removing pollutants for sydney using a hypothetical constructed wetland the relevant value expressed in 2016 aud per kg of nitrogen removed was 674 kg we use this as the base case value and set the low and high pollution value scenarios at 25 of this value the social values of rain gardens are based on the compensating surplus estimates as detailed in table 3 the median compensating surplus was used as the base value and the values for the first and third quartiles were used for the low and high value scenarios respectively to aggregate the social value we multiply the social value estimate by the number of households within the catchment of a rain garden which was assumed to be within 50 m of a rain garden based on spatial analysis of a random sample of actual rain gardens in sydney it was found that the number of households within 50 m varied between 12 and 60 with a mean of 36 these values define the low high and base case population scenarios respectively the cost of installing rain gardens was derived from brinckerhoff 37 for the base case cost scenario the cost of installing a rain garden was set at 1269 per m2 2016 adjusted which includes the capital cost of all associated work maintenance cost was set at 41 20 per m2 2016 adjusted we assume maintenance costs are 50 higher for the first two years of a rain garden s useful life due to vegetation establishment costs the low and high cost scenarios were also based on brinckerhoff 37 and for the low cost scenario the capital cost is 846 per m2 and for the high cost scenario the capital cost is 2962 per m2 the respective low and high annual maintenance cost values are 24 82 and 88 21 per m2 respectively and as per the base case maintenance costs are 50 higher in the first two years for the evaluation we estimate the impact of transfer errors on the benefit cost ratio bcr and net present value npv for bcr values greater than one indicate that the total benefits of rain gardens are greater than the total cost for npv values greater than zero indicate positive net benefit of a project we estimate the bcr and npv for the full set of factorial combinations 2 187 of the following factors table 4 the cost of construction low base and high removal efficiency low base and high the value of pollution removal low base and high the social value low base and high the population level low base and high the discount rate 3 6 and 9 and the effective life 10 years 20 years and 30 years practice regarding the discount rate assumption is highly varied across developed countries 38 in light of this we use discount rates of 3 6 and 9 with 6 used as the reference rate and refer readers to table s2 to see the impact of using higher 9 and lower 3 discount rates by considering this wide range of combinations we are trying to explore what we think is the likely maximum possible range for the bcr and npv for projects that might be considered to test the policy impact of using the benefits transfer method we estimate the bcrs and npvs for these combinations for three social value scenarios table 5 in scenario 1 the bcrs for the 2187 combinations were calculated with the wtp estimates from sydney the true wtp estimates and the summary statistics are presented in table 5 the last column in table 5 shows the proportion of times the bcr was above one and in 26 of the cases the bcr exceeded one in scenario 2 wtp estimates from melbourne transferred values were used to calculate the relevant bcrs by comparing the results the extent of error due to using transferred values i e using melbourne data for a sydney location can be understood it can be seen that the proportion of combinations where the bcr was above one was 11 in scenario 2 in other words the proportion of scenarios when the bcr is above one dropped by 15 points when transferred values melbourne are used finally in scenario 3 where information on social preferences is not included no scenario has a bcr above one this shows the importance of considering non market values while assessing water sensitive projects additional analysis of the impact of other key variables is presented in table s2 considering the range of results more generally it could be argued that overall the extent of the error due to using transferred values is modest but real for benefit cost analysis we suggest that incorrectly concluding a project has a net benefit when the truth is that it does not type i error is a more costly mistake than failing to identify a project that does have a net positive benefit type ii error so while in this specific case the error is towards lower bcr values we think in general the result suggests using a higher threshold than one is an appropriate strategy to use for project evaluation when using benefit transfer values such an approach will mitigate against type i errors at the cost of higher type ii errors for a scenario such as transferring values for a well defined project such as a rain garden across cities that are broadly similar in characteristics then a threshold value of around one and a half rather than one might be seen as a reasonable rule of thumb where the difference between the transfer target sites is greater a higher threshold for concluding a net benefit say two could be used 6 conclusion in this paper we make two contributions first we have estimated the non market values of different design features of rain gardens for melbourne and sydney and this is the first study to estimate such values for the australian context based on the pooled model results presented in table 2 the willingness to pay for a rain garden project with three rain gardens on an extended curb a rain garden between the footpath and the curb no tree inside the rain gardens which are bordered with hedge plants is 133 per annum per household for households within 50 m of the rain garden we interpret this as evidence of community preference for rain gardens in australia s two largest cities our second contribution is on the extent of benefit transfer errors when evaluating water sensitive urban design projects we have provided a comprehensive assessment of the benefit transfer method including an assessment of preference homogeneity and equivalency of compensating surplus our analysis showed that the willingness to pay estimates are largely transferable between melbourne and sydney however the transfer of compensating surplus and benefit cost analysis of a hypothetical rain garden showing that some benefit transfer errors do emerge even when transferring values between two similar cities such variation in results indicates the importance of the types of analysis being undertaken where non market values are used if policymakers are interested in understanding social preferences for different rain garden design options then the results suggest it is acceptable to transfer wtp estimates between the two locations however if the objective is to use the wtp estimates in formal benefit cost analysis caution is required as a practical strategy when using benefit transfer for wsud project assessments we suggest using a critical bcr higher than one such an approach protects against incorrectly determining that a project has net benefits when it does not at the cost of failing to identify some projects that do have positive net benefits author statement md sayed iftekhar conceptualization methodology data analysis writing

8676,health outcomes can be remarkably dependent on the quality of drinking water this study employs primary survey data collected in may 10 july 27 2016 to investigate the effects of water quality measured by the presence of the escherichia coli e coli bacteria on the health outcomes of households in nepal the health outcomes are based on the self reported health status as well as the actual health condition of the members of the household the novel contribution of this paper is that we investigate the health impacts of water quality by considering water quality itself as an intermediary process that could be affected by factors like household s cleanliness behaviors and hygienic infrastructures using a control function approach to account for potential endogeneity issues the results indicate a significant effect of e coli on the health status of individuals findings indicate the difference in expected diarrheal incidence to be about 0 913 units higher when e coli is present in households drinking water the impact of e coli is evident in both the self reported health status and the actual health outcome and the results hold across various empirical models and specifications from a policy perspective our results indicate the pressing need for policymakers to implement water quality tracking programs and also to raise awareness among households regarding adequate cleanliness practices and hygiene infrastructures keywords self reported health status water quality number of diarrheal incidences e coli cleanliness behavior hygiene infrastructure control function approach jel classification i12 q5 1 introduction drinking water can significantly affect health outcomes because of its direct use on our daily life the adverse impacts on the health outcomes are perhaps more acute in developing nations as majority of the households there tend to store water in potable containers this behavior is driven by factors such as irregular water supply and high level of water pollution in these countries which compels the households to stockpile drinking water for later use however inadequate practices of cleanliness behavior and lack of hygienic infrastructure particularly during transporting or when storing the water have been found to be a frequent source of contamination of households drinking water 1 3 poor water quality will in turn have a negative impact on the health outcome of people for instance a report published by the world health organization 4 indicated that improved water supply alone could reduce diarrhea related morbidity incidences by 6 25 while the negative relationship between drinking water quality and health outcomes have been documented and well understood the health implications of poor water quality are not directly observable and can potentially occur via intermediary processes one intermediary process could be the level of microbial contamination in the drinking water that can transpire as a result of households poor cleanliness behavior and inadequate hygienic infrastructures this study employs primary survey data collected from siddharthanagar nepal in 2016 to explore the relationship between households health outcomes cleanliness behavior and hygienic infrastructures by introducing an intermediary process the level of contaminants in the households drinking water nepal is a developing nation situated in south asia with a rapidly increasing population of 28 million people 5 the water quality concerns in nepal stem from inadequate access to safe drinking water to the surging population in the country it is estimated that only 27 of the population have access to safely managed water supply free from contamination in nepal 6 in addition to improved water sources another source of concern stems from the lack of access to proper sanitation facilities according to unicef 7 over 33 of the total population in nepal do not have access to improved sanitation which further elevates the chances of microbiological contamination in drinking water the extent of water pollution and waterborne diseases are also propelled by a lack of cleanliness behavior practiced at the household level while handwashing is considered a crucial cleanliness practice only 40 of the population in nepal have access to handwashing facility with soap and water at home 6 these existing shortcomings have collectively contributed to poor water quality and almost 82 of households in nepal are considered to be at risk of microbial contamination in drinking water 7 an inevitable outcome of microbial contamination in drinking water is the prevalence of waterborne diseases like diarrhea which is evidently high in nepal the country faces a soaring rate of diarrhea related morbidity incidences and about 5 91 of deaths in the country were attributed to diarrheal incidences in 2017 8 poor health outcomes will also reduce labor productivity and ultimately create a significant toll on the economy of the country the economic burden of poor health stemming from water quality issues could be devastating to developing nations like nepal where the per capita gdp is usd 1043 11 9 our study area siddharthanagar is considered as a gateway to lumbini the birthplace of buddhism this region sees a large influx of tourists that come to visit lumbini every year and the local economy of siddharthanagar is highly dependent on the tourism sector in a study by murphy et al 10 on travelers diarrhea they find a significant impact of contaminants in water on the prevalence of diarrhea among tourists in nepal 2 2 since tourists often stay in hotels the concept of travelers diarrhea might not seem relevant in our study where we are investigating the impact of hygiene infrastructure and cleanliness behaviors on e coli level however the transmission of diarrhea from e coli to tourists is equally likely from the hotels if the staffs in these hotels do not follow adequate hygiene and cleanliness practices poor water quality and the associated health concerns can thus also be detrimental to the economy in the siddharthanagar region as such there is a dire need for effective water handling policies to be implemented in siddharthangar and nepal in general which can only be possible if relevant studies on water handling behaviors are carried out this study employs a conceptual framework of health production function to analyze the impact of drinking water quality on health outcomes among households in siddharthanagar nepal studies on water handling behavior and health outcomes are not new and there are a number of studies centered around this topic however most past studies on water quality behaviors have either only investigated the impact of water quality on health outcomes 11 15 or studied the effect of cleanliness behavior and hygienic infrastructures on health outcomes 16 20 the novel contribution of this study is that we deviate from these past studies and instead focus on the effect of water quality on health outcomes by considering water quality level itself as an intermediary process that could be affected by households cleanliness behavior and hygienic infrastructures the water quality level in our study is based on the level of microbial contamination measured in terms of the presence of total coliform bacteria in the drinking water total coliform bacteria are a group of easily cultured organisms and are frequently used to indicate the level of water quality 21 coliforms are widely used to indicate water quality levels as they are easy to isolate are present in larger numbers and they usually survive longer in an aquatic environment than viruses parasites and other types of bacteria escherichia coli e coli is a species of fecal coliform bacteria that has a direct link to water quality 22 and it is used as a measure of microbial contamination of water quality level in this study the level of e coli 3 3 most of the e coli is harmless and does not cause any harm in this research we refer to e coli 0157 h7 which causes the most outbreaks and health hazard in the households drinking water is scientifically tested with the presence of the e coli bacteria indicating that water has potentially been exposed to feces and immediate risk to human health exists 23 drinking water quality could be affected by a myriad of factors two such being the household s cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures consequently a direct estimation of the effect of e coli on health outcomes could suffer from potential endogeneity issues due to omitted variable bias to circumvent endogeneity concerns this study employs a control function cf 24 approach to control for possible endogeneity of e coli in the drinking water the results from the ordered probit model indicates a significant interrelation between the e coli in drinking water and households self reported health status results suggest that households with the presence of e coli bacteria in their water were more likely to report poor health status this finding was consistent under self reported health status and also when we examined the actual health outcomes of the individuals the negative binomial estimates show that the difference in the expected incidences of diarrhea to be 0 913 units higher when e coli is present in drinking water furthermore the results remain robust under various model specifications and even when the sample is investigated separately by looking only at the children population the adult population and when we focused only on the urban sample from a policy perspective the results in this study suggest a need to implement water quality tracking programs to increase investment in raising awareness regarding cleanliness practices via social media campaigns and school level curriculums and to subsidize costs of acquiring hygienic infrastructures like flush toilet and tube well systems all of which could drastically lower water related concerns in the siddharthanagar municipality 2 literature review self reported health has been widely used as an indicator of health outcomes in primary survey studies 25 the reported health behavior of an individual however can be influenced by numerous factors they are exposed to such as environmental amenities and socioeconomic status 26 28 past literature on health behavior have indicated a substantial and significant relationship between self reported health and water quality for instance kile et al 29 found a positive relationship between arsenic exposure in drinking water and self reported nausea during pregnancy among a cohort of pregnant women in bangladesh napier et al 30 investigated the association between fecal indicator bacteria and self reported illness among swimmers in the united states u s beaches and reported a similar positive relationship between the two however one caveat with these studies is that they assume self reported health status as an exogenous variable self reported health however could be influenced by multiple factors varying at the individual level which creates a bias in the reporting if not properly accounted for 31 this paper explores the interconnection between households hygienic behavior and infrastructures health outcomes and microbial contamination in their drinking water the health outcome is measured in terms of the self reported health status and also on the frequency of diarrhea occurrences in the household we incorporate the occurrence of diarrhea as an additional indicator of health status to overcome the issue of potential bias resulting from employing self reported health status in regards to the relationship between hygienic behavior infrastructures and health outcomes there are several studies that have highlighted the direct effect of factors such as improved hygienic practices and infrastructure on diarrheal incidences among the various possible cleanliness practices hand washing has been found to significantly reduce the incidence of diarrheal diseases 16 20 likewise hygiene infrastructure within and outside the household is another factor that could have a considerable effect on health outcomes a number of studies have attributed households hygienic behavior to health outcomes 20 32 33 trinies et al 34 found that in addition to hygienic behaviors inside the household school based water sanitation and hygiene wash interventions could also reduce diarrhea and respiratory infection among students access to the safe water source is another crucial factor that has been attributed to reducing diarrheal incidences 35 36 similarly other factors such as the gender and age of the child the level of education of the mother whether the mother has had any immunization and the type of living area of the household have all been found to affect diarrheal incidence rates 37 the prevalence of diarrheal incidence is frequently a direct consequence of microbial contamination in drinking water the contamination of drinking water could result from a multitude of factors such as poor water handling behavior the source of drinking water or the cleanliness behavior of the household 1 3 38 39 in regards to the cleanliness behavior of the households the process of handwashing and the type of handwashing water are also significantly associated with e coli contamination 40 41 daneshmand et al 40 identified that animal ownership also increases e coli contamination in soil and e coli in the soil are correlated with contamination on hands before washing finally the duration of storage as well as the material of the storage vessel can both also affect the quality of the drinking water 42 43 the scope of our study fits in with the recent literature on health outcomes and hygienic behavior as we demonstrate a complete scenario of the system discussed above we investigate the effect of hygienic behavior and infrastructures on health outcomes by exploring the intermediary process of microbial contamination in the drinking water the contributions of our study are on several fronts waterborne diseases like diarrhea have had a significant toll on the health of the labor force and the economy in nepal yet there are very few studies that have addressed the association between hygiene behavior contamination and health problems kunwar bohara 44 investigated whether the deviation between households perception of their water quality and the objective water quality level could affect their water handling behaviors in siddharthanagar nepal while their study highlights the transmission route between household behavior and water contamination the impact on health outcomes itself is excluded acharaya et al 45 find poor water handling practices and partial breastfeeding to be the major risk factors towards the burden of diarrhea in nepal karki et al 46 identified factors such as knowledge and practice education malnutrition and floods to be an important determinant of diarrhea in mid western nepal the latter two studies highlight the direct relationship between health outcomes and behaviors however the intermediary process i e microbial contamination is ignored this study is one of the few to investigate the relationship between hygiene behavior and health outcomes by introducing an intermediary process and is the only study in the context of nepal second our paper relies on scientifically gathered data on water quality to measure the intermediary process thereby presenting a more robust and methodical approach to incorporate this information in the health outcomes literature third we employ a number of econometric techniques to analyze the data which makes our findings and the resulting policy implications more robust overall this study provides evidence that better hygienic infrastructure and cleanliness behaviors reduce microbial contamination and increases water quality level which ultimately mitigates potential health risks 3 data collection method this study uses primary survey data that was collected to explore the water handling behavior of households from the rupandehi district in the terai region of nepal the survey was conducted in the urban city of siddharthanagar and two its adjacent rural settlements basantapur and bagaha vdc s 4 4 vdc refers to village development committee this is the lowest administrative strata in nepal the survey took place between may 10 july 27 2016 and was done using in person interviews 5 5 the full survey consisted of questions to understand the environmental and health concerns as well as the water handling information of households in nepal a more detail information on the survey methods and other relevant information is presented in kunwar bohara 44 and kunwar et al 47 the survey protocol included expert interviews with water management officials focus group discussions debriefing sessions a pilot survey and the final survey the households were selected using stratified random sampling and were interviewed to assess their knowledge attitudes and practices regarding water use and hygiene behaviors in the urban and rural communities in addition to the in person household interviews a water quality test was carried out on 314 households to measure the presence of the e coli bacteria on the household s drinking water the water sample collected from the households were taken to a laboratory to carry out the testing of e coli bacteria at the end of each day after completing the survey interviews the test to detect the e coli bacteria was conducted using a single use disposable testing kit developed by the lamotte company 6 6 available at http www lamotte com en drinking water microbiological testing 4 3616 uv html a sample of 10 ml water was taken from the potable container where households stored their drinking water a sterile water sampling bag with a dechlorinating agent 2 2197 was provided with the test kit to collect the sample and neutralize 7 7 water samples with chlorine residuals tend to suppress the growth of coliform bacteria when used with this kit that is why a sterile water sampling bag with a dechlorinating agent 2 2197 is provided to collect the sample and neutralize any chlorine which may be present in the water any chlorine which may be present in the water after collection the sample water was sealed and incubated in an oven at a temperature of 35 degree celsius in the tubes provided with the test kit package a uv light was then used to test the presence of the e coli bacteria in the water after a period of 48 h the presence of e coli is confirmed if the water sample fluoresced with exposure to the uv light fig 1 shows the testing procedure of the e coli bacteria in the water sample 3 1 variable description 3 1 1 outcome variables this study uses two outcome variables the first dependent variable self reported health status self is a categorical variable measured on three levels the individuals were asked to rate their health status and the response was measured as poor 1 medium 2 and good 3 the other dependent variable actual health outcome is a count variable measured in terms of the number of household members affected by diarrhea during the last 30 days the actual health outcome was recorded on three categories child adult and both this research uses both indicators of health i e self reported health status and actual health outcome to increase robustness in the measurement of health outcomes self reported health status is a subjective concept and can vary between individuals even among those that have a similar health condition i e the issue of bias from multiple factors we argue that the latter measure mentioned above the count of household members affected by diarrheal incidences has the potential to fit as a more accurate outcome variable compared to the self reported health 3 1 2 behavior and infrastructural practices the variables used to capture the behavioral and infrastructural practices include hand washing utensils washing deep tubewell and flush toilet deep tubewell 8 8 deep tubewell is considered as one of the safest sources of water in the study area a deep hole is drilled into the ground usually more than 150 m with a hand pump attached to the top unhcr 48 this source of water is considered safe because of the depth from which the water is extracted at a level of 150 m it is very unlikely any contaminants can survive and the water is also free from any human activity is a binary variable that equals 1 if the household relies on a deep tubewell as their primary source of water and 0 for all other sources of water flush toilet is another binary variable that equals 1 if the household has a flush toilet system in their dwelling if the respondent washes their hand each time after using the toilet then hand washing takes a value of 1 otherwise it takes a value of 0 utensils washing refers to the utensil washing behavior of the households water storage container if the respondent washes their water storage container once a day then it is coded as 1 otherwise it takes a value of 0 households usually tend to store water in their container on a one day cycle and clean the containers before pouring water into it the water sample to conduct the e coli test was thus collected from the container where the households stored their water rather than from the point source itself while we did not use the water sample from the point source for the e coli test previous studies have suggested that e coli contamination is equally likely to occur from water storage containers 49 the variable of interest in our study is e coli which equals 1 if the sampled water from a household tested positive for fecal contamination and 0 if it did not test positive 3 1 3 averting behavior we used the water boiling habits of the households to capture their averting behavior boil is a binary variable that equals 1 if the household boils their water before drinking and 0 for everything else this variable has been used to capture the averting mechanism practiced by the households to reduce the e coli risk in the drinking water 3 1 4 socioeconomic and demographic the socio demographic variables are captured by age gender education level household income and the water boiling behavior of the households age is a continuous variable and represents the age of the respondent while agesq is the quadratic specification of the age variable male is a binary variable which equals 1 if the respondent is a male education is a categorical variable that ranges from 1 to 4 where 4 is the highest level of education reached the categories for education are defined as less than 10th grade 1 equal to or above 10th grade and completed 12th grade 2 completion of bachelor s degree 3 and completion of master s degree 4 the income variable captures the total household income and is derived using an asset index following the methodology by kunwar bohara 44 this index comprises of 5 quintiles with the highest quintile representing the richest households and lowest quintile for the poorest households table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the households that responded to the survey about 55 percent of the respondents reported their health status as medium while only 18 described themselves as being in a good status the mean level of self reported health for the entire sample is 1 90 which suggests that most of the individuals considered themselves to be relatively healthy the number of children affected by diarrhea is captured by the child variable and its average value equals 0 17 the mean for the number of adults affected by diarrhea adult is also 0 17 although the standard deviation is much higher compared to child the data indicates that 35 of the households drinking water tested positive for the e coli bacteria nicholson et al 50 also found that 24 of households in nepal were tested positive for e coli contamination on their drinking water see table 2 we used four variables to characterize the cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure of households on average about 50 of the households used deep tubewell as a source of water in their homestead and 64 of households use the flush toilet system 9 9 the percentage of households using flush toilet might seem a little high in the context of developing countries however our survey includes data from one municipality and 2 vdc s the municipality experiences a better standard of living due to higher household income and the overall livelihood status compared to the two vdcs due to the proportional weight sampling while undertaking the survey a large portion of the observation were drawn from the municipality hence we see a high number of households employing the flush toilet system for their sanitation facility a large percentage of the respondents 71 wash hands after using the toilet each time and 61 of households wash their drinking water storage utensils every day the average age of the respondents is 42 27 the majority of the respondents were male with the ratio of male to female percentage in the survey being 74 26 in terms of the education level more than half of the respondents 54 14 have not completed their 10th grade education in high school about 7 of the respondents have completed their bachelor s degree while only 2 87 have obtained a master s degree the distribution of education level of the sample in this study is relatively similar to other developing nations 51 the mean level of income quintile is 3 19 which indicates a moderate income level of households on average the left panel in fig 2 displays the relationship between average self reported health status and the e coli contamination in the drinking water the figure indicates a negative relationship on average between self reported health status and bacterial contamination in the drinking water this indicates a better worse health status is associated with an absence presence of e coli contamination in drinking water when we consider the number of household members affected by diarrhea a similar pattern is evident from the right panel of fig 2 a higher percentage of diarrheal incidence is associated with e coli contamination in the drinking water the chi square test supports the result from fig 2 and suggests a significant dependence between self reported health and e coli with a p value of 0 009 the chi square test and the corresponding p value also reveals a significant association when we consider diarrheal incidences in the household fig 3 depicts the relationship between the level of e coli in the drinking water and the share of households practicing cleanliness behavior and using hygiene infrastructures it is apparent that households with no bacterial contamination in their water practice have a higher level of cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure 4 empirical analysis this section describes the empirical methods employed to estimate the effect of e coli on health outcomes the empirical specification below is motivated by the conceptual framework of the health production function approach first proposed by grossman 52 according to this approach the health outcome h is assumed to depend on the water quality e which itself depends on the cleanliness behavior b and infrastructure i of the household the health outcomes of individual i is assumed to be a function of the level of e coli the socioeconomic and demographic factors and takes the following specification 1 h i β 0 x i β e i γ η i ε i where h i denotes the outcome variables which comprises of i self reported health status of the individuals and ii the number of household members affected by diarrheal incidences in the past 30 days e i is a dichotomous variable that captures the outcome of the e coli contamination test in the drinking water and x is the vector of the socioeconomic and demographic factors which includes the respondents age gender education level and the household income β 0 β η i and γ are the parameters to be estimated and ε i captures the error term since the survey area encompassed one municipality urban and two vdc s rural the parameter η i is used as the urban rural fixed effect to account for the variability in location 10 10 the settlement characteristics of the urban area is much different than rural areas we expect that the coefficients will have variability based on the difference of location we add an urban rural fixed effect to control for this variability the parameter β 0 is the intercept of the model β is a vector of coefficients which measures the change in h i due to a change in the socioeconomic and demographic factors and γ stands for the impact on health outcomes from a change in the e coli level the focus of this study is on measuring the causal effect of the level of e coli bacteria in drinking water on health outcomes as has been highlighted earlier e coli contamination in drinking water can occur from multiple factors 11 11 other factors that can affect the e coli contamination in drinking water are mode of transportation from source point to storage 3 animal ownership 40 natural factor such as precipitation 53 etc two of them being cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures in fact past studies have shown a direct relation between e coli and cleanliness behavior 54 56 these findings however neither confirm nor invalidate the argument that cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures can also affect health outcomes this idea sets the premise of our research we argue that the impact of cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure on health outcomes can be established via an intermediary process of bacterial contamination in the drinking water we use the e coli level in drinking water as a mediator to link the interdependence between cleanliness behavior hygiene infrastructure and health outcomes however the exogenous use of e coli in equation 1 can potentially deliver inconsistent estimates furthermore it is also possible that unobservables like the public drinking water source might influence the outcome of e coli level among households that depend on it relative to those that use other water sources 57 12 12 in our sample 16 of the households obtain water for the public tap as suggested from the previous literature this can also affect the formation of e coli which does not fall in the cleanliness behavior of hygiene infrastructure practiced by the households in other words e coli may increase as a result of water quality in the water drinking system not households behavior consequently this can be a source of omitted variable bias and resulting endogeneity these arguments collectively establish that the e coli variable might suffer from an endogeneity issue failing to account for endogeneity can result in a biased outcome as it violates the first ordinary least squares ols assumption c o v e i ε i 0 58 to incorporate the potential for endogeneity issues in our data equation 1 is reconstructed by a two stage reduced form system and estimated by a control function cf approach the first stage can be stated as 2 e i α 0 x i β z i δ η i v i where α 0 is the constant z is a vector comprising of variables to capture the behavioral utensils washing hand washing and infrastructural deep tubewell flush toilet factors and v i is the error term the variables comprising in vector z are employed only in equation 2 hence it identifies the specification of the second stage regression the dependent variable in the first stage in equation 2 is a dichotomous variable and is estimated by a probit model however the dependent variables of the second stage in equation 1 are categorical self reported health status and count number of household members affected by diarrheal diseases variables therefore a two stage least square 2sls approach does not account for all these issues and is unable to produce consistent estimates 58 accordingly a cf approach is employed to overcome this limitation the relation between the two error terms is specified by a linear relationship to capture the possible endogeneity as stated below 3 ε i v i θ τ i where θ captures the marginal effect of v i on ε i τ i follows a normal distribution τ i n 0 1 with the condition e v i τ i 0 given the linear relationship between the error terms and an assumption of independence between x z and v i the cf approach estimates the presence of e coli by a probit model the probit model can be specified as 4 p e i 1 x z φ α 0 x i β z i δ η i φ ω k where k is a vector containing the variables from x and z a generalized residual is calculated after estimating equation 4 by the following formula 5 g i e i λ ω k 1 e i λ ω k where λ ω k is the inverse mills ratio imr and is given by φ ω k φ ω k φ φ the imr is included to control for the possible endogeneity of the e coli variable 24 once the generalized residual function is calculated equation 1 can now be re written as 6 h i β 0 x i β e i γ g i σ η i μ i here g i is the generalized residual σ measures the magnitude of the possible endogeneity and μ i is the error term the generalized residual g i also serves as an explanatory 13 13 the rationale behind this residual plugging in approach is to establish an uncorrelation with ei and ϵi because ϵi and vi are uncorrelated with k τi is also uncorrelated with k consequently τi is also uncorrelated with ei if this relationship holds ϵi can t influence ei therefore we can get valid and consistent estimates from equation 6 given the assumption c o v e i μ i 0 holds variable and we assume that c o v e i μ i 0 the main rationale for the inclusion of the generalized residual is to control for the possible endogeneity of e coli the identification requirement for the cf approach is nonzero 14 14 a simple f test of joint significance is used to test this requirement and presented in the result section furthermore the estimated value of σ produces a heteroskedasticity robust hausman test statistic which determines the possible endogeneity of e coli coefficients of z in the first stage regression i e δ 0 in equation 2 ordered probit regression is used to estimate the self reported health status and a negative binomial model is employed to estimate the actual health outcome while using the number of affected members by the diarrheal disease across households we control for the number of household members as an exposure variable in the negative binomial model 58 59 the negative binomial model takes the following specification 7 μ i e x p ln n u m b e r o f h h m e m b e r β 0 x i β e i γ g i σ η i where μ i is the mean of h i all regression models presented in this study are estimated with and without urban rural level fixed effects in addition to the two stage estimation an ols estimation is also reported as an additional robustness check 5 results and discussion this study focuses on the effect of e coli contamination in drinking water on the health outcomes in the context of a developing country our findings are in line with the existing research on health status and bacterial contamination and we further add upon the past literature by highlighting the role of intermediary processes in explaining health outcomes table 2 presents the probit estimation and the marginal effects for the effect of cleanliness behavior hygiene infrastructure and socioeconomic factors on e coli contamination these estimates correspond to the result of equation 2 in the empirical analysis section columns 1 and 2 present the result of the probit estimation while columns 3 and 4 show their respective marginal effects we account for the urban rural fixed effect in column 1 while column 2 excludes the urban rural fixed effect the results from both columns in table 2 confirm the finding in figure 3 an increase in the practice of cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure decreases the likelihood of e coli contamination in the drinking water 15 15 we also performed a multicollinearity test by estimating the variance inflating factor vif for the explanatory variables of this regression the vif test did not indicate any significant dependence among explanatory variables the vif s for each variable were at the accepted standard vif 10 the variables capturing the cleanliness behaviors and hygiene infrastructures are significant and suggest a negative effect of bacterial contamination in drinking water moreover these effects are consistent across both the urban and rural areas as evident from the fixed effects in table 2 utensils washing has the largest marginal effect among the cleanliness and infrastructural factors the probability of bacterial formation in the drinking water decreases by 26 percentage points if households wash their drinking water storage utensils every day on the other hand the source of the drinking water deep tubewell has the least impact on bacterial contamination the probability of e coli contamination decreases by 11 percentage points if households use water from deep tubewell for drinking purpose a similar result was found by ostwald et al 60 in understanding the factors behind fecal contamination in drinking water in lima peru their results identified that post source contamination of drinking water was largely influenced by the hygiene behaviors of the households brick et al 42 also found a similar result where they identify that contamination chances in drinking water increases during the storage periods in table 2 we also find that the boiling behavior of the household is negatively 16 16 in a related study to ours kunwar and bohara 44 find that households with absence of e coli in their drinking water were more likely to boil their water the direction between e coli and boiling behavior in our study and the study by kunwar and bohara 44 is similar although we do not find the relationship to be significant this might be because we seek to understand the factors that affect e coli contamination whereas the other study looks at factors that affect water averting behaviors thus it is possible that households that do not have e coli are those that are more likely to boil their water whereas households that boil their water may or may not have e coli contamination associated with e coli contamination however the variable itself is not significant the boiling behavior of the household has not been seen as a significant factor affecting e coli level in other studies too ostwald et al 60 find no significant association between boiling behavior of the households in lima peru and the level of e coli contamination in their drinking water the socioeconomic variables 17 17 though education is significant in first stage regression it is not significant in any specifications on the main regression this result is unexpected and not easily explainable given the scope of this study thus the significance of the education variable is not discussed for the most part are not significant and do not suggest any potential effect on the formation of e coli bacteria in drinking water the findings of the impact of e coli on health outcomes and their associated marginal effects are presented in table 3 table 7 these estimates correspond to the result of equation 6 in the empirical analysis section table 3 presents the ordered probit estimates of the health outcome when we consider the self reported health status the respondents self reported health is captured by the categorical variable self column 1 in table 3 uses only the e coli variable and does not control for any other factors or the fixed effect whereas columns 2 and 3 present the full model with the full controls 18 18 in table 3 we wanted to show that e coli has a significant effect on health status even if we don t control for other variables consequently we estimate with all the variables in the second column and still find the significance of e coli in this way we can conclude the robustness of the result found the latter two columns 2 and 3 also use a generalized residual calculated from the first stage the results indicate a negative and significant relationship of e coli contamination with self reported health an increase in the likelihood of e coli contamination in drinking water reduces the likelihood that respondents report their health as good overall our result suggests that the variables capturing the cleanliness behaviors and hygiene infrastructures are significant and suggest a negative effect of bacterial contamination a finding that has been established in other studies too for instance kile et al 29 investigate the linkages between drinking water quality and self reported maternal health in bangladesh unlike our study which uses e coli contamination in the drinking water their study used arsenic exposure to drinking water as an indicator of water quality and their findings indicated a significant deterioration of self reported maternal health status from exposure to arsenic contamination among the socio demographic factors in table 3 household income is the only significant variable and suggests that households with higher income are likely to rate their health as better while the findings from tables 2 and 3 indicate clear linkages between hygienic behavior bacterial contamination and health outcome the self reported health ranking used to capture the health outcome so far is a subjective measure and can lead to biased results due to heterogeneity among the individuals 19 19 since boiling is not the main concern in this study we did not include it under cleanliness behavior or hygienic infrastructure column 1 presents the result of the probit model of e coli formation in drinking water with an urban rural fixed effect the dependent variable is the dichotomous e coli variable column 2 presents the results without a fixed effect column 3 presents the marginal effect of the probit results of column 1 column 4 presents the marginal effect of the probit results of column 2 the marginal effect is calculated for continuous variable by p r e c o l i 1 x k φ x β β k and p r e c o l i 1 x k φ x 1 β φ x 0 β for binary variable here φ is the standard normal p d f and φ is the c d f 58 column 1 presents the ordered probit estimates of self reported health status with only e coli as the independent variable self is the dependent variable column 2 presents the estimates for self with the full control variables gfe 1 is the generalized residual calculated from the column 1 of table 2 which includes a fixed effect column 3 presents the result without a fixed effect gr 2 is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 of table 2 both gfe and gr follow the formula of equation 5 in the empirical section to account for the potential biases in the measurement of health outcome a negative binomial model is also estimated where we employ the prevalence of diarrhea as an indicator of health in relation to the quality of drinking water table 4 shows the negative binomial estimation of the number of household members affected by diarrheal incidence in the past 30 days across three categories child adult and both these coefficients in table 4 also capture the marginal effects we use the number of household members as an exposure variable in each of the three models all specifications in table 4 indicate a strong positive association between the number of people affected by diarrhea in each category and e coli contamination in their drinking water the likelihood of e coli in the drinking water increases the expected incidences significantly across all specifications columns 1 3 and 5 in table 4 show the negative binomial estimate of the child adult and both respectively by controlling for the urban rural fixed effect while columns 2 4 and 6 do not account for the urban rural fixed effect due to the unavailability of the child s age and gender the variables to capture the age and gender of the child i e age agesq and male are excluded from the analysis the result in column 1 suggests that the difference in the expected incidences is about 0 932 units higher when e coli is present in the water among the children group the difference in expected incidences is expected to be 0 967 units higher when we consider the adults whereas the difference in the expected incidences is expected to be 0 913 units higher when the outcomes for adults and children are combined a similar finding has been established in other studies as well amr yassin 61 found a strong association between e coli in the water system and diarrheal incidence in both historical and self reported data among households in the gaza strip palestine other studies that have found parallel results to ours include those by ercumen et al 14 and fagerli et al 15 among other factors associated with e coli contamination the variable boil has the expected sign in every specification but it is significant only for adults the variables that capture the age sex and education level are not significant in determining the diarrheal prevalence while the income variable suggests a negative relationship across the adult and both categories the parameter gfe in table 4 is the generalized residual calculated from column 1 in table 2 and it includes the fixed effect the parameter gr is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 in table 2 gno is the generalized residual which is calculated by excluding the age agesq and male variables and by incorporating the fixed effect lastly the parameter gnofe is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male and without incorporating the fixed effect these generalized residual coefficients provide the heteroskedasticity robust hausman test for endogeneity a failure to reject the null hypothesis of the endogeneity of e coli indicates the consistency of our estimates our results remain consistent even when excluding the fixed effect in column 2 4 and 6 which validates the robustness of the findings each column in table 4 also reports a chi square value which is the output of the likelihood ratio test for comparison between the poisson and the negative binomial process we reject the null hypothesis of poisson regression based on the p value of the likelihood ratio test in each column thereby validating the negative binomial model as the proper estimation strategy for our data 20 20 we have also estimated the equation with an urban dummy variable location 1 if it is urban location 0 if it is rural instead of using the fixed effects this approach also does not change the result in terms of the coefficient value or significance level for this reason we decided to keep the fixed effect in all the tables after table 4 we wanted to check whether the result is sensitive to the urban vs rural distinction as it is not we proceeded with only a fixed effect columns 1 3 and 5 show the negative binomial estimate of the child adult and both respectively using the urban rural fixed effect columns 2 4 and 6 show the negative binomial estimate of the child adult and both respectively without the urban rural fixed effect child adult and both are the dependent variables gfe 1 is the generalized residual calculated from column 1 of table 2 which includes a fixed effect gr 4 is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 of table 2 gno 2 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child but including the fixed effect gnofe 3 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child and without the fixed effect all the generalized residuals are calculated from equation 5 of the empirical section the coefficients are on a natural logarithm scale these coefficients are also the marginal effects table 5 shows the output for the marginal effects of the ordered probit and the negative binomial estimates columns 1 3 present the estimates for the self reported health status self for the three categories poor medium and good while columns 4 6 present the marginal effects of the negative binomial model for the child adult and both samples the result in table 5 provides clear evidence of negative association between e coli and self reported health as the health ranking of the respondent increases the change in the predicted probability of reporting the health status as good decreases significantly by 10 percentage points the effect on the medium category decreases by two 21 21 the effect in the medium category is small because it indicates the net effect of e coli increase the 2 percent change addresses the net change in the predicted probability of moving to medium from the good category and then to the poor category as e coli increases percentage points although the variable itself is not significant in the lowest category the effect on the poor category increases by 13 percentage points which is positive and significant the survey area in this study includes an urban municipality and two rural vdc s with a substantial portion of the data drawn from the urban area i e siddharthanagar municipality of the 314 observations 266 observations 84 are drawn from the municipality and 48 observations from the bashantapur and bagha vdc s in addition to a large sample of the respondents belonging to the urban area the amount of bacterial contamination in drinking water is also high in the urban area out of 266 observations 95 households 35 drinking water tested positive for e coli contamination while only 31 tested positive in the rural areas as a robustness check we estimate the effect of e coli on only the urban sample to observe the consistency of our results we follow the same estimation methodology in the urban sample that was used for the entire study area since the marginal effects of the ordered probit estimates show the precise effect we present the marginal effects in each category for estimation consistency the number of hh member is still used as the exposure variable in all the negative binomial models presented in table 6 column 1 3 shows the marginal effect of self in three different categories such as poor 1 medium 2 and good 3 column 4 6 shows the marginal effect of the negative binomial models fixed effect is considered in all the models gfe 1 is the generalized residual calculated from the column 1 of table 2 which includes a fixed effect gno 2 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child but including the fixed effect all the generalized residuals are calculated from equation 5 of empirical section column 1 3 shows the marginal effect of self in three different categories such as poor 1 medium 2 and good 3 based on the samples collected from the siddharthanagar municipality column 4 6 shows the marginal effect of the negative binomial models gr 1 is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 of table 2 gnofe 2 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child and without the fixed effect the general findings in table 6 are similar to the results in table 5 and supports the consistency of our results even when the siddharthanagar sample is considered by itself the change in the predicted probability on each category for self reported health is consistent between table 5 and 6 however the difference in the expected incidence in the siddharthanagar sample is dissimilar when compared to the results of the entire sample for instance the impact on the number of children affected by diarrhea in siddharthanagar is lower than the entire sample while the impact on the number of adults shows a larger estimate the chi square statistic and the corresponding p value indicates the fit of the data by a negative binomial process as mentioned earlier several past studies have indicated a direct association between e coli contamination and health outcomes although these studies do not account for any intermediary process 11 15 as another robustness check for the validity of the results and also to confirm the findings of previous research we estimate the direct association between e coli contamination and health outcomes without controlling for the endogeneity of the e coli variable this is done by directly estimating equation 1 by employing the ordered probit and the negative binomial model and the output is shown in table 7 the general results are still consistent and support the main findings of the paper the likelihood of e coli contamination in drinking water reduces the self reported health status and increases the expected incidence of diarrhea among the household members similar to the previous findings only the boil variable is significant and only in the adult regression and income is significant with the expected sign column 1 presents the ordered probit estimates of self reported health status self is the dependent variable column 2 4 presents the estimates for child adult and both by negative binomial models constant 1 and constant 2 are the two constants of the ordered probit model where constant is the constant for the negative binomial model we have used both self reported health and the number of household members affected by diarrheal incidences as indicators of the health status the results show consistency between the two indicators of health status as indicated earlier self reported health status suffers from the limitation of bias while reporting it 62 63 however studies 64 65 have also shown concordance between generic self reported health and a specific measure the results from negative binomial regressions from this study also suggest that self reported health could be used as an indicator of health due to the consistency of results since the measurement between the two health indicators is different in this study we do not discuss whether the estimates of e coli from the ordered probit and negative binomial regressions can be used as substitutes the negative binomial estimates show a higher value of the difference between the expected incidences for adults than child tables 4 and 7 this suggests that e coli contamination has a higher impact on the health of an adult than a child research has shown that intestinal parasites such as giardia are dominant in causing diarrhea than bacterial contamination such as e coli among children sherchand et al 66 investigated the stool sample of 440 diarrheal child patients in nepal and found that intestinal parasites 36 5 and pathogenic bacteria 20 were the cause of most of the diarrheal infections among the pathogenic bacteria the predominant bacteria were shigella species 36 8 vibrio species 26 3 escherichia coli 22 8 and salmonella species 14 03 respectively their finding further supports our results of low impact on a child from e coli contamination since other parasites may play a dominant role in the prevalence of diarrhea compared to adults moreover as a measure of another robustness check we used the number of child and the number of adults as exposure variables and re estimated the regressions of child and adult in each of the specifications in tables 4 7 we find the consistency of the results in terms of the sign of coefficients and level of significance however we do not report the results here to limit the length of the paper finally the results from this study also indicate that boiling the water alone may not protect from e coli contamination whereas washing utensils could have a significant impact on reducing bacterial contamination in drinking water among other covariates the marginal effect of income income is significant with the expected sign on categories poor and good table 5 the predicted probability for self reported health status self decreases by five percentage points if the household is considered poor while it increases by four percentage points if the household income is considered good 6 conclusions this study investigated the linkages between water quality level and two measures of health outcomes self reported health status and the number of household members affected by diarrheal diseases the novel contribution of this paper is that we introduce an intermediary process to understand the relationship between water quality level and health status the study is carried out in three locations in the rupandehi district of nepal the results not only confirm prior findings on the significant linkage between health outcomes and drinking water contamination but also extend the understanding of factors pertaining to e coli formation in the drinking water more specifically our analyses from the primary survey data collected suggest that a better hygiene infrastructure and cleanliness behavior reduces the likelihood of e coli contamination b higher likelihood of e coli presence significantly decreases the self reported health status c higher likelihood of e coli presence also significantly increases the number of diarrheal incidences furthermore the outcome variables are estimated by accounting for the endogeneity of e coli the results remain consistent across the various specifications carried out to test the robustness of our findings while the general results from this paper suggest a link between health outcomes water quality and cleanliness and hygienic behaviors these findings should still be taken with caution for one although we accounted for the potential endogeneity of the e coli variable the results might still be sensitive to unobservables despite the several validities and robustness checks conducted incorporating other variables in the estimation of e coli was not possible since data was not collected on other possible sources of e coli contamination similarly information on the child s age and gender could also have explained more of the actual outcome but it was outside the scope of the study due to the limitation 22 22 while we do not think the central result of the study would differ incorporating the children s gender and age would probably make the findings more robust and comparison of the result between the two sub groups adults and children would be more comparable since both groups would have similar control variables to capture the variations of the data the findings from this study can nevertheless provide substantial guidance to the siddharthangar municipality for appropriate policy formulation to alleviate health hazards from water related issues one policy measure that could be implemented is to begin regular monitoring of the water quality level of the water sources which would make the municipal authorities more informed and better prepared to take protective actions to make the drinking water safe for households in addition to municipalities monitoring the water sources an alternative approach could be to train the households themselves to measure their water quality so they too can make informed decisions this could be done by implementing programs such as citizen science 23 23 in fact the nepal study center at the university of new mexico had recently implemented a citizen science program where the local volunteers in siddharthanagar were trained to measure the contaminants in the nearby danda river this type of program could be extended to the household level as well more information on this project can be found on kunwar et al 47 and also on https foxc01 wixsite com yogdan projects initiatives that allows the general people to become more aware and engaged to learn further about water cleansing behaviors and the risks of contaminants in their water the results from this study could be instrumental in furthering research on water quality and health status in the developing world for instance based on our findings a randomized control trial rct study could be carried out to analyze impacts on health status from changes in behavior and infrastructure among households with varying levels of information dissemination about their drinking water quality levels our study finds that cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures are the mitigating factors for reducing the outbreak of e coli contamination in drinking water hence another policy could be targeted towards nudging cleanliness habits while handling water which could reduce health hazards from diarrheal incidences investment in raising awareness through social media campaigns and developing school level curriculums on cleanliness practices hygiene infrastructure and water quality could all also aid in developing health knowledge among the general population finally the construction of hygienic infrastructures such as deep tubewell and flush toilet incurs a significant amount of cost to the households subsidizing the costs of these infrastructures could induce a larger number of households to use them which would thereby safeguard the entire community from health hazards like diarrheal incidences credit authorship

8676,health outcomes can be remarkably dependent on the quality of drinking water this study employs primary survey data collected in may 10 july 27 2016 to investigate the effects of water quality measured by the presence of the escherichia coli e coli bacteria on the health outcomes of households in nepal the health outcomes are based on the self reported health status as well as the actual health condition of the members of the household the novel contribution of this paper is that we investigate the health impacts of water quality by considering water quality itself as an intermediary process that could be affected by factors like household s cleanliness behaviors and hygienic infrastructures using a control function approach to account for potential endogeneity issues the results indicate a significant effect of e coli on the health status of individuals findings indicate the difference in expected diarrheal incidence to be about 0 913 units higher when e coli is present in households drinking water the impact of e coli is evident in both the self reported health status and the actual health outcome and the results hold across various empirical models and specifications from a policy perspective our results indicate the pressing need for policymakers to implement water quality tracking programs and also to raise awareness among households regarding adequate cleanliness practices and hygiene infrastructures keywords self reported health status water quality number of diarrheal incidences e coli cleanliness behavior hygiene infrastructure control function approach jel classification i12 q5 1 introduction drinking water can significantly affect health outcomes because of its direct use on our daily life the adverse impacts on the health outcomes are perhaps more acute in developing nations as majority of the households there tend to store water in potable containers this behavior is driven by factors such as irregular water supply and high level of water pollution in these countries which compels the households to stockpile drinking water for later use however inadequate practices of cleanliness behavior and lack of hygienic infrastructure particularly during transporting or when storing the water have been found to be a frequent source of contamination of households drinking water 1 3 poor water quality will in turn have a negative impact on the health outcome of people for instance a report published by the world health organization 4 indicated that improved water supply alone could reduce diarrhea related morbidity incidences by 6 25 while the negative relationship between drinking water quality and health outcomes have been documented and well understood the health implications of poor water quality are not directly observable and can potentially occur via intermediary processes one intermediary process could be the level of microbial contamination in the drinking water that can transpire as a result of households poor cleanliness behavior and inadequate hygienic infrastructures this study employs primary survey data collected from siddharthanagar nepal in 2016 to explore the relationship between households health outcomes cleanliness behavior and hygienic infrastructures by introducing an intermediary process the level of contaminants in the households drinking water nepal is a developing nation situated in south asia with a rapidly increasing population of 28 million people 5 the water quality concerns in nepal stem from inadequate access to safe drinking water to the surging population in the country it is estimated that only 27 of the population have access to safely managed water supply free from contamination in nepal 6 in addition to improved water sources another source of concern stems from the lack of access to proper sanitation facilities according to unicef 7 over 33 of the total population in nepal do not have access to improved sanitation which further elevates the chances of microbiological contamination in drinking water the extent of water pollution and waterborne diseases are also propelled by a lack of cleanliness behavior practiced at the household level while handwashing is considered a crucial cleanliness practice only 40 of the population in nepal have access to handwashing facility with soap and water at home 6 these existing shortcomings have collectively contributed to poor water quality and almost 82 of households in nepal are considered to be at risk of microbial contamination in drinking water 7 an inevitable outcome of microbial contamination in drinking water is the prevalence of waterborne diseases like diarrhea which is evidently high in nepal the country faces a soaring rate of diarrhea related morbidity incidences and about 5 91 of deaths in the country were attributed to diarrheal incidences in 2017 8 poor health outcomes will also reduce labor productivity and ultimately create a significant toll on the economy of the country the economic burden of poor health stemming from water quality issues could be devastating to developing nations like nepal where the per capita gdp is usd 1043 11 9 our study area siddharthanagar is considered as a gateway to lumbini the birthplace of buddhism this region sees a large influx of tourists that come to visit lumbini every year and the local economy of siddharthanagar is highly dependent on the tourism sector in a study by murphy et al 10 on travelers diarrhea they find a significant impact of contaminants in water on the prevalence of diarrhea among tourists in nepal 2 2 since tourists often stay in hotels the concept of travelers diarrhea might not seem relevant in our study where we are investigating the impact of hygiene infrastructure and cleanliness behaviors on e coli level however the transmission of diarrhea from e coli to tourists is equally likely from the hotels if the staffs in these hotels do not follow adequate hygiene and cleanliness practices poor water quality and the associated health concerns can thus also be detrimental to the economy in the siddharthanagar region as such there is a dire need for effective water handling policies to be implemented in siddharthangar and nepal in general which can only be possible if relevant studies on water handling behaviors are carried out this study employs a conceptual framework of health production function to analyze the impact of drinking water quality on health outcomes among households in siddharthanagar nepal studies on water handling behavior and health outcomes are not new and there are a number of studies centered around this topic however most past studies on water quality behaviors have either only investigated the impact of water quality on health outcomes 11 15 or studied the effect of cleanliness behavior and hygienic infrastructures on health outcomes 16 20 the novel contribution of this study is that we deviate from these past studies and instead focus on the effect of water quality on health outcomes by considering water quality level itself as an intermediary process that could be affected by households cleanliness behavior and hygienic infrastructures the water quality level in our study is based on the level of microbial contamination measured in terms of the presence of total coliform bacteria in the drinking water total coliform bacteria are a group of easily cultured organisms and are frequently used to indicate the level of water quality 21 coliforms are widely used to indicate water quality levels as they are easy to isolate are present in larger numbers and they usually survive longer in an aquatic environment than viruses parasites and other types of bacteria escherichia coli e coli is a species of fecal coliform bacteria that has a direct link to water quality 22 and it is used as a measure of microbial contamination of water quality level in this study the level of e coli 3 3 most of the e coli is harmless and does not cause any harm in this research we refer to e coli 0157 h7 which causes the most outbreaks and health hazard in the households drinking water is scientifically tested with the presence of the e coli bacteria indicating that water has potentially been exposed to feces and immediate risk to human health exists 23 drinking water quality could be affected by a myriad of factors two such being the household s cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures consequently a direct estimation of the effect of e coli on health outcomes could suffer from potential endogeneity issues due to omitted variable bias to circumvent endogeneity concerns this study employs a control function cf 24 approach to control for possible endogeneity of e coli in the drinking water the results from the ordered probit model indicates a significant interrelation between the e coli in drinking water and households self reported health status results suggest that households with the presence of e coli bacteria in their water were more likely to report poor health status this finding was consistent under self reported health status and also when we examined the actual health outcomes of the individuals the negative binomial estimates show that the difference in the expected incidences of diarrhea to be 0 913 units higher when e coli is present in drinking water furthermore the results remain robust under various model specifications and even when the sample is investigated separately by looking only at the children population the adult population and when we focused only on the urban sample from a policy perspective the results in this study suggest a need to implement water quality tracking programs to increase investment in raising awareness regarding cleanliness practices via social media campaigns and school level curriculums and to subsidize costs of acquiring hygienic infrastructures like flush toilet and tube well systems all of which could drastically lower water related concerns in the siddharthanagar municipality 2 literature review self reported health has been widely used as an indicator of health outcomes in primary survey studies 25 the reported health behavior of an individual however can be influenced by numerous factors they are exposed to such as environmental amenities and socioeconomic status 26 28 past literature on health behavior have indicated a substantial and significant relationship between self reported health and water quality for instance kile et al 29 found a positive relationship between arsenic exposure in drinking water and self reported nausea during pregnancy among a cohort of pregnant women in bangladesh napier et al 30 investigated the association between fecal indicator bacteria and self reported illness among swimmers in the united states u s beaches and reported a similar positive relationship between the two however one caveat with these studies is that they assume self reported health status as an exogenous variable self reported health however could be influenced by multiple factors varying at the individual level which creates a bias in the reporting if not properly accounted for 31 this paper explores the interconnection between households hygienic behavior and infrastructures health outcomes and microbial contamination in their drinking water the health outcome is measured in terms of the self reported health status and also on the frequency of diarrhea occurrences in the household we incorporate the occurrence of diarrhea as an additional indicator of health status to overcome the issue of potential bias resulting from employing self reported health status in regards to the relationship between hygienic behavior infrastructures and health outcomes there are several studies that have highlighted the direct effect of factors such as improved hygienic practices and infrastructure on diarrheal incidences among the various possible cleanliness practices hand washing has been found to significantly reduce the incidence of diarrheal diseases 16 20 likewise hygiene infrastructure within and outside the household is another factor that could have a considerable effect on health outcomes a number of studies have attributed households hygienic behavior to health outcomes 20 32 33 trinies et al 34 found that in addition to hygienic behaviors inside the household school based water sanitation and hygiene wash interventions could also reduce diarrhea and respiratory infection among students access to the safe water source is another crucial factor that has been attributed to reducing diarrheal incidences 35 36 similarly other factors such as the gender and age of the child the level of education of the mother whether the mother has had any immunization and the type of living area of the household have all been found to affect diarrheal incidence rates 37 the prevalence of diarrheal incidence is frequently a direct consequence of microbial contamination in drinking water the contamination of drinking water could result from a multitude of factors such as poor water handling behavior the source of drinking water or the cleanliness behavior of the household 1 3 38 39 in regards to the cleanliness behavior of the households the process of handwashing and the type of handwashing water are also significantly associated with e coli contamination 40 41 daneshmand et al 40 identified that animal ownership also increases e coli contamination in soil and e coli in the soil are correlated with contamination on hands before washing finally the duration of storage as well as the material of the storage vessel can both also affect the quality of the drinking water 42 43 the scope of our study fits in with the recent literature on health outcomes and hygienic behavior as we demonstrate a complete scenario of the system discussed above we investigate the effect of hygienic behavior and infrastructures on health outcomes by exploring the intermediary process of microbial contamination in the drinking water the contributions of our study are on several fronts waterborne diseases like diarrhea have had a significant toll on the health of the labor force and the economy in nepal yet there are very few studies that have addressed the association between hygiene behavior contamination and health problems kunwar bohara 44 investigated whether the deviation between households perception of their water quality and the objective water quality level could affect their water handling behaviors in siddharthanagar nepal while their study highlights the transmission route between household behavior and water contamination the impact on health outcomes itself is excluded acharaya et al 45 find poor water handling practices and partial breastfeeding to be the major risk factors towards the burden of diarrhea in nepal karki et al 46 identified factors such as knowledge and practice education malnutrition and floods to be an important determinant of diarrhea in mid western nepal the latter two studies highlight the direct relationship between health outcomes and behaviors however the intermediary process i e microbial contamination is ignored this study is one of the few to investigate the relationship between hygiene behavior and health outcomes by introducing an intermediary process and is the only study in the context of nepal second our paper relies on scientifically gathered data on water quality to measure the intermediary process thereby presenting a more robust and methodical approach to incorporate this information in the health outcomes literature third we employ a number of econometric techniques to analyze the data which makes our findings and the resulting policy implications more robust overall this study provides evidence that better hygienic infrastructure and cleanliness behaviors reduce microbial contamination and increases water quality level which ultimately mitigates potential health risks 3 data collection method this study uses primary survey data that was collected to explore the water handling behavior of households from the rupandehi district in the terai region of nepal the survey was conducted in the urban city of siddharthanagar and two its adjacent rural settlements basantapur and bagaha vdc s 4 4 vdc refers to village development committee this is the lowest administrative strata in nepal the survey took place between may 10 july 27 2016 and was done using in person interviews 5 5 the full survey consisted of questions to understand the environmental and health concerns as well as the water handling information of households in nepal a more detail information on the survey methods and other relevant information is presented in kunwar bohara 44 and kunwar et al 47 the survey protocol included expert interviews with water management officials focus group discussions debriefing sessions a pilot survey and the final survey the households were selected using stratified random sampling and were interviewed to assess their knowledge attitudes and practices regarding water use and hygiene behaviors in the urban and rural communities in addition to the in person household interviews a water quality test was carried out on 314 households to measure the presence of the e coli bacteria on the household s drinking water the water sample collected from the households were taken to a laboratory to carry out the testing of e coli bacteria at the end of each day after completing the survey interviews the test to detect the e coli bacteria was conducted using a single use disposable testing kit developed by the lamotte company 6 6 available at http www lamotte com en drinking water microbiological testing 4 3616 uv html a sample of 10 ml water was taken from the potable container where households stored their drinking water a sterile water sampling bag with a dechlorinating agent 2 2197 was provided with the test kit to collect the sample and neutralize 7 7 water samples with chlorine residuals tend to suppress the growth of coliform bacteria when used with this kit that is why a sterile water sampling bag with a dechlorinating agent 2 2197 is provided to collect the sample and neutralize any chlorine which may be present in the water any chlorine which may be present in the water after collection the sample water was sealed and incubated in an oven at a temperature of 35 degree celsius in the tubes provided with the test kit package a uv light was then used to test the presence of the e coli bacteria in the water after a period of 48 h the presence of e coli is confirmed if the water sample fluoresced with exposure to the uv light fig 1 shows the testing procedure of the e coli bacteria in the water sample 3 1 variable description 3 1 1 outcome variables this study uses two outcome variables the first dependent variable self reported health status self is a categorical variable measured on three levels the individuals were asked to rate their health status and the response was measured as poor 1 medium 2 and good 3 the other dependent variable actual health outcome is a count variable measured in terms of the number of household members affected by diarrhea during the last 30 days the actual health outcome was recorded on three categories child adult and both this research uses both indicators of health i e self reported health status and actual health outcome to increase robustness in the measurement of health outcomes self reported health status is a subjective concept and can vary between individuals even among those that have a similar health condition i e the issue of bias from multiple factors we argue that the latter measure mentioned above the count of household members affected by diarrheal incidences has the potential to fit as a more accurate outcome variable compared to the self reported health 3 1 2 behavior and infrastructural practices the variables used to capture the behavioral and infrastructural practices include hand washing utensils washing deep tubewell and flush toilet deep tubewell 8 8 deep tubewell is considered as one of the safest sources of water in the study area a deep hole is drilled into the ground usually more than 150 m with a hand pump attached to the top unhcr 48 this source of water is considered safe because of the depth from which the water is extracted at a level of 150 m it is very unlikely any contaminants can survive and the water is also free from any human activity is a binary variable that equals 1 if the household relies on a deep tubewell as their primary source of water and 0 for all other sources of water flush toilet is another binary variable that equals 1 if the household has a flush toilet system in their dwelling if the respondent washes their hand each time after using the toilet then hand washing takes a value of 1 otherwise it takes a value of 0 utensils washing refers to the utensil washing behavior of the households water storage container if the respondent washes their water storage container once a day then it is coded as 1 otherwise it takes a value of 0 households usually tend to store water in their container on a one day cycle and clean the containers before pouring water into it the water sample to conduct the e coli test was thus collected from the container where the households stored their water rather than from the point source itself while we did not use the water sample from the point source for the e coli test previous studies have suggested that e coli contamination is equally likely to occur from water storage containers 49 the variable of interest in our study is e coli which equals 1 if the sampled water from a household tested positive for fecal contamination and 0 if it did not test positive 3 1 3 averting behavior we used the water boiling habits of the households to capture their averting behavior boil is a binary variable that equals 1 if the household boils their water before drinking and 0 for everything else this variable has been used to capture the averting mechanism practiced by the households to reduce the e coli risk in the drinking water 3 1 4 socioeconomic and demographic the socio demographic variables are captured by age gender education level household income and the water boiling behavior of the households age is a continuous variable and represents the age of the respondent while agesq is the quadratic specification of the age variable male is a binary variable which equals 1 if the respondent is a male education is a categorical variable that ranges from 1 to 4 where 4 is the highest level of education reached the categories for education are defined as less than 10th grade 1 equal to or above 10th grade and completed 12th grade 2 completion of bachelor s degree 3 and completion of master s degree 4 the income variable captures the total household income and is derived using an asset index following the methodology by kunwar bohara 44 this index comprises of 5 quintiles with the highest quintile representing the richest households and lowest quintile for the poorest households table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the households that responded to the survey about 55 percent of the respondents reported their health status as medium while only 18 described themselves as being in a good status the mean level of self reported health for the entire sample is 1 90 which suggests that most of the individuals considered themselves to be relatively healthy the number of children affected by diarrhea is captured by the child variable and its average value equals 0 17 the mean for the number of adults affected by diarrhea adult is also 0 17 although the standard deviation is much higher compared to child the data indicates that 35 of the households drinking water tested positive for the e coli bacteria nicholson et al 50 also found that 24 of households in nepal were tested positive for e coli contamination on their drinking water see table 2 we used four variables to characterize the cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure of households on average about 50 of the households used deep tubewell as a source of water in their homestead and 64 of households use the flush toilet system 9 9 the percentage of households using flush toilet might seem a little high in the context of developing countries however our survey includes data from one municipality and 2 vdc s the municipality experiences a better standard of living due to higher household income and the overall livelihood status compared to the two vdcs due to the proportional weight sampling while undertaking the survey a large portion of the observation were drawn from the municipality hence we see a high number of households employing the flush toilet system for their sanitation facility a large percentage of the respondents 71 wash hands after using the toilet each time and 61 of households wash their drinking water storage utensils every day the average age of the respondents is 42 27 the majority of the respondents were male with the ratio of male to female percentage in the survey being 74 26 in terms of the education level more than half of the respondents 54 14 have not completed their 10th grade education in high school about 7 of the respondents have completed their bachelor s degree while only 2 87 have obtained a master s degree the distribution of education level of the sample in this study is relatively similar to other developing nations 51 the mean level of income quintile is 3 19 which indicates a moderate income level of households on average the left panel in fig 2 displays the relationship between average self reported health status and the e coli contamination in the drinking water the figure indicates a negative relationship on average between self reported health status and bacterial contamination in the drinking water this indicates a better worse health status is associated with an absence presence of e coli contamination in drinking water when we consider the number of household members affected by diarrhea a similar pattern is evident from the right panel of fig 2 a higher percentage of diarrheal incidence is associated with e coli contamination in the drinking water the chi square test supports the result from fig 2 and suggests a significant dependence between self reported health and e coli with a p value of 0 009 the chi square test and the corresponding p value also reveals a significant association when we consider diarrheal incidences in the household fig 3 depicts the relationship between the level of e coli in the drinking water and the share of households practicing cleanliness behavior and using hygiene infrastructures it is apparent that households with no bacterial contamination in their water practice have a higher level of cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure 4 empirical analysis this section describes the empirical methods employed to estimate the effect of e coli on health outcomes the empirical specification below is motivated by the conceptual framework of the health production function approach first proposed by grossman 52 according to this approach the health outcome h is assumed to depend on the water quality e which itself depends on the cleanliness behavior b and infrastructure i of the household the health outcomes of individual i is assumed to be a function of the level of e coli the socioeconomic and demographic factors and takes the following specification 1 h i β 0 x i β e i γ η i ε i where h i denotes the outcome variables which comprises of i self reported health status of the individuals and ii the number of household members affected by diarrheal incidences in the past 30 days e i is a dichotomous variable that captures the outcome of the e coli contamination test in the drinking water and x is the vector of the socioeconomic and demographic factors which includes the respondents age gender education level and the household income β 0 β η i and γ are the parameters to be estimated and ε i captures the error term since the survey area encompassed one municipality urban and two vdc s rural the parameter η i is used as the urban rural fixed effect to account for the variability in location 10 10 the settlement characteristics of the urban area is much different than rural areas we expect that the coefficients will have variability based on the difference of location we add an urban rural fixed effect to control for this variability the parameter β 0 is the intercept of the model β is a vector of coefficients which measures the change in h i due to a change in the socioeconomic and demographic factors and γ stands for the impact on health outcomes from a change in the e coli level the focus of this study is on measuring the causal effect of the level of e coli bacteria in drinking water on health outcomes as has been highlighted earlier e coli contamination in drinking water can occur from multiple factors 11 11 other factors that can affect the e coli contamination in drinking water are mode of transportation from source point to storage 3 animal ownership 40 natural factor such as precipitation 53 etc two of them being cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures in fact past studies have shown a direct relation between e coli and cleanliness behavior 54 56 these findings however neither confirm nor invalidate the argument that cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures can also affect health outcomes this idea sets the premise of our research we argue that the impact of cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure on health outcomes can be established via an intermediary process of bacterial contamination in the drinking water we use the e coli level in drinking water as a mediator to link the interdependence between cleanliness behavior hygiene infrastructure and health outcomes however the exogenous use of e coli in equation 1 can potentially deliver inconsistent estimates furthermore it is also possible that unobservables like the public drinking water source might influence the outcome of e coli level among households that depend on it relative to those that use other water sources 57 12 12 in our sample 16 of the households obtain water for the public tap as suggested from the previous literature this can also affect the formation of e coli which does not fall in the cleanliness behavior of hygiene infrastructure practiced by the households in other words e coli may increase as a result of water quality in the water drinking system not households behavior consequently this can be a source of omitted variable bias and resulting endogeneity these arguments collectively establish that the e coli variable might suffer from an endogeneity issue failing to account for endogeneity can result in a biased outcome as it violates the first ordinary least squares ols assumption c o v e i ε i 0 58 to incorporate the potential for endogeneity issues in our data equation 1 is reconstructed by a two stage reduced form system and estimated by a control function cf approach the first stage can be stated as 2 e i α 0 x i β z i δ η i v i where α 0 is the constant z is a vector comprising of variables to capture the behavioral utensils washing hand washing and infrastructural deep tubewell flush toilet factors and v i is the error term the variables comprising in vector z are employed only in equation 2 hence it identifies the specification of the second stage regression the dependent variable in the first stage in equation 2 is a dichotomous variable and is estimated by a probit model however the dependent variables of the second stage in equation 1 are categorical self reported health status and count number of household members affected by diarrheal diseases variables therefore a two stage least square 2sls approach does not account for all these issues and is unable to produce consistent estimates 58 accordingly a cf approach is employed to overcome this limitation the relation between the two error terms is specified by a linear relationship to capture the possible endogeneity as stated below 3 ε i v i θ τ i where θ captures the marginal effect of v i on ε i τ i follows a normal distribution τ i n 0 1 with the condition e v i τ i 0 given the linear relationship between the error terms and an assumption of independence between x z and v i the cf approach estimates the presence of e coli by a probit model the probit model can be specified as 4 p e i 1 x z φ α 0 x i β z i δ η i φ ω k where k is a vector containing the variables from x and z a generalized residual is calculated after estimating equation 4 by the following formula 5 g i e i λ ω k 1 e i λ ω k where λ ω k is the inverse mills ratio imr and is given by φ ω k φ ω k φ φ the imr is included to control for the possible endogeneity of the e coli variable 24 once the generalized residual function is calculated equation 1 can now be re written as 6 h i β 0 x i β e i γ g i σ η i μ i here g i is the generalized residual σ measures the magnitude of the possible endogeneity and μ i is the error term the generalized residual g i also serves as an explanatory 13 13 the rationale behind this residual plugging in approach is to establish an uncorrelation with ei and ϵi because ϵi and vi are uncorrelated with k τi is also uncorrelated with k consequently τi is also uncorrelated with ei if this relationship holds ϵi can t influence ei therefore we can get valid and consistent estimates from equation 6 given the assumption c o v e i μ i 0 holds variable and we assume that c o v e i μ i 0 the main rationale for the inclusion of the generalized residual is to control for the possible endogeneity of e coli the identification requirement for the cf approach is nonzero 14 14 a simple f test of joint significance is used to test this requirement and presented in the result section furthermore the estimated value of σ produces a heteroskedasticity robust hausman test statistic which determines the possible endogeneity of e coli coefficients of z in the first stage regression i e δ 0 in equation 2 ordered probit regression is used to estimate the self reported health status and a negative binomial model is employed to estimate the actual health outcome while using the number of affected members by the diarrheal disease across households we control for the number of household members as an exposure variable in the negative binomial model 58 59 the negative binomial model takes the following specification 7 μ i e x p ln n u m b e r o f h h m e m b e r β 0 x i β e i γ g i σ η i where μ i is the mean of h i all regression models presented in this study are estimated with and without urban rural level fixed effects in addition to the two stage estimation an ols estimation is also reported as an additional robustness check 5 results and discussion this study focuses on the effect of e coli contamination in drinking water on the health outcomes in the context of a developing country our findings are in line with the existing research on health status and bacterial contamination and we further add upon the past literature by highlighting the role of intermediary processes in explaining health outcomes table 2 presents the probit estimation and the marginal effects for the effect of cleanliness behavior hygiene infrastructure and socioeconomic factors on e coli contamination these estimates correspond to the result of equation 2 in the empirical analysis section columns 1 and 2 present the result of the probit estimation while columns 3 and 4 show their respective marginal effects we account for the urban rural fixed effect in column 1 while column 2 excludes the urban rural fixed effect the results from both columns in table 2 confirm the finding in figure 3 an increase in the practice of cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructure decreases the likelihood of e coli contamination in the drinking water 15 15 we also performed a multicollinearity test by estimating the variance inflating factor vif for the explanatory variables of this regression the vif test did not indicate any significant dependence among explanatory variables the vif s for each variable were at the accepted standard vif 10 the variables capturing the cleanliness behaviors and hygiene infrastructures are significant and suggest a negative effect of bacterial contamination in drinking water moreover these effects are consistent across both the urban and rural areas as evident from the fixed effects in table 2 utensils washing has the largest marginal effect among the cleanliness and infrastructural factors the probability of bacterial formation in the drinking water decreases by 26 percentage points if households wash their drinking water storage utensils every day on the other hand the source of the drinking water deep tubewell has the least impact on bacterial contamination the probability of e coli contamination decreases by 11 percentage points if households use water from deep tubewell for drinking purpose a similar result was found by ostwald et al 60 in understanding the factors behind fecal contamination in drinking water in lima peru their results identified that post source contamination of drinking water was largely influenced by the hygiene behaviors of the households brick et al 42 also found a similar result where they identify that contamination chances in drinking water increases during the storage periods in table 2 we also find that the boiling behavior of the household is negatively 16 16 in a related study to ours kunwar and bohara 44 find that households with absence of e coli in their drinking water were more likely to boil their water the direction between e coli and boiling behavior in our study and the study by kunwar and bohara 44 is similar although we do not find the relationship to be significant this might be because we seek to understand the factors that affect e coli contamination whereas the other study looks at factors that affect water averting behaviors thus it is possible that households that do not have e coli are those that are more likely to boil their water whereas households that boil their water may or may not have e coli contamination associated with e coli contamination however the variable itself is not significant the boiling behavior of the household has not been seen as a significant factor affecting e coli level in other studies too ostwald et al 60 find no significant association between boiling behavior of the households in lima peru and the level of e coli contamination in their drinking water the socioeconomic variables 17 17 though education is significant in first stage regression it is not significant in any specifications on the main regression this result is unexpected and not easily explainable given the scope of this study thus the significance of the education variable is not discussed for the most part are not significant and do not suggest any potential effect on the formation of e coli bacteria in drinking water the findings of the impact of e coli on health outcomes and their associated marginal effects are presented in table 3 table 7 these estimates correspond to the result of equation 6 in the empirical analysis section table 3 presents the ordered probit estimates of the health outcome when we consider the self reported health status the respondents self reported health is captured by the categorical variable self column 1 in table 3 uses only the e coli variable and does not control for any other factors or the fixed effect whereas columns 2 and 3 present the full model with the full controls 18 18 in table 3 we wanted to show that e coli has a significant effect on health status even if we don t control for other variables consequently we estimate with all the variables in the second column and still find the significance of e coli in this way we can conclude the robustness of the result found the latter two columns 2 and 3 also use a generalized residual calculated from the first stage the results indicate a negative and significant relationship of e coli contamination with self reported health an increase in the likelihood of e coli contamination in drinking water reduces the likelihood that respondents report their health as good overall our result suggests that the variables capturing the cleanliness behaviors and hygiene infrastructures are significant and suggest a negative effect of bacterial contamination a finding that has been established in other studies too for instance kile et al 29 investigate the linkages between drinking water quality and self reported maternal health in bangladesh unlike our study which uses e coli contamination in the drinking water their study used arsenic exposure to drinking water as an indicator of water quality and their findings indicated a significant deterioration of self reported maternal health status from exposure to arsenic contamination among the socio demographic factors in table 3 household income is the only significant variable and suggests that households with higher income are likely to rate their health as better while the findings from tables 2 and 3 indicate clear linkages between hygienic behavior bacterial contamination and health outcome the self reported health ranking used to capture the health outcome so far is a subjective measure and can lead to biased results due to heterogeneity among the individuals 19 19 since boiling is not the main concern in this study we did not include it under cleanliness behavior or hygienic infrastructure column 1 presents the result of the probit model of e coli formation in drinking water with an urban rural fixed effect the dependent variable is the dichotomous e coli variable column 2 presents the results without a fixed effect column 3 presents the marginal effect of the probit results of column 1 column 4 presents the marginal effect of the probit results of column 2 the marginal effect is calculated for continuous variable by p r e c o l i 1 x k φ x β β k and p r e c o l i 1 x k φ x 1 β φ x 0 β for binary variable here φ is the standard normal p d f and φ is the c d f 58 column 1 presents the ordered probit estimates of self reported health status with only e coli as the independent variable self is the dependent variable column 2 presents the estimates for self with the full control variables gfe 1 is the generalized residual calculated from the column 1 of table 2 which includes a fixed effect column 3 presents the result without a fixed effect gr 2 is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 of table 2 both gfe and gr follow the formula of equation 5 in the empirical section to account for the potential biases in the measurement of health outcome a negative binomial model is also estimated where we employ the prevalence of diarrhea as an indicator of health in relation to the quality of drinking water table 4 shows the negative binomial estimation of the number of household members affected by diarrheal incidence in the past 30 days across three categories child adult and both these coefficients in table 4 also capture the marginal effects we use the number of household members as an exposure variable in each of the three models all specifications in table 4 indicate a strong positive association between the number of people affected by diarrhea in each category and e coli contamination in their drinking water the likelihood of e coli in the drinking water increases the expected incidences significantly across all specifications columns 1 3 and 5 in table 4 show the negative binomial estimate of the child adult and both respectively by controlling for the urban rural fixed effect while columns 2 4 and 6 do not account for the urban rural fixed effect due to the unavailability of the child s age and gender the variables to capture the age and gender of the child i e age agesq and male are excluded from the analysis the result in column 1 suggests that the difference in the expected incidences is about 0 932 units higher when e coli is present in the water among the children group the difference in expected incidences is expected to be 0 967 units higher when we consider the adults whereas the difference in the expected incidences is expected to be 0 913 units higher when the outcomes for adults and children are combined a similar finding has been established in other studies as well amr yassin 61 found a strong association between e coli in the water system and diarrheal incidence in both historical and self reported data among households in the gaza strip palestine other studies that have found parallel results to ours include those by ercumen et al 14 and fagerli et al 15 among other factors associated with e coli contamination the variable boil has the expected sign in every specification but it is significant only for adults the variables that capture the age sex and education level are not significant in determining the diarrheal prevalence while the income variable suggests a negative relationship across the adult and both categories the parameter gfe in table 4 is the generalized residual calculated from column 1 in table 2 and it includes the fixed effect the parameter gr is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 in table 2 gno is the generalized residual which is calculated by excluding the age agesq and male variables and by incorporating the fixed effect lastly the parameter gnofe is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male and without incorporating the fixed effect these generalized residual coefficients provide the heteroskedasticity robust hausman test for endogeneity a failure to reject the null hypothesis of the endogeneity of e coli indicates the consistency of our estimates our results remain consistent even when excluding the fixed effect in column 2 4 and 6 which validates the robustness of the findings each column in table 4 also reports a chi square value which is the output of the likelihood ratio test for comparison between the poisson and the negative binomial process we reject the null hypothesis of poisson regression based on the p value of the likelihood ratio test in each column thereby validating the negative binomial model as the proper estimation strategy for our data 20 20 we have also estimated the equation with an urban dummy variable location 1 if it is urban location 0 if it is rural instead of using the fixed effects this approach also does not change the result in terms of the coefficient value or significance level for this reason we decided to keep the fixed effect in all the tables after table 4 we wanted to check whether the result is sensitive to the urban vs rural distinction as it is not we proceeded with only a fixed effect columns 1 3 and 5 show the negative binomial estimate of the child adult and both respectively using the urban rural fixed effect columns 2 4 and 6 show the negative binomial estimate of the child adult and both respectively without the urban rural fixed effect child adult and both are the dependent variables gfe 1 is the generalized residual calculated from column 1 of table 2 which includes a fixed effect gr 4 is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 of table 2 gno 2 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child but including the fixed effect gnofe 3 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child and without the fixed effect all the generalized residuals are calculated from equation 5 of the empirical section the coefficients are on a natural logarithm scale these coefficients are also the marginal effects table 5 shows the output for the marginal effects of the ordered probit and the negative binomial estimates columns 1 3 present the estimates for the self reported health status self for the three categories poor medium and good while columns 4 6 present the marginal effects of the negative binomial model for the child adult and both samples the result in table 5 provides clear evidence of negative association between e coli and self reported health as the health ranking of the respondent increases the change in the predicted probability of reporting the health status as good decreases significantly by 10 percentage points the effect on the medium category decreases by two 21 21 the effect in the medium category is small because it indicates the net effect of e coli increase the 2 percent change addresses the net change in the predicted probability of moving to medium from the good category and then to the poor category as e coli increases percentage points although the variable itself is not significant in the lowest category the effect on the poor category increases by 13 percentage points which is positive and significant the survey area in this study includes an urban municipality and two rural vdc s with a substantial portion of the data drawn from the urban area i e siddharthanagar municipality of the 314 observations 266 observations 84 are drawn from the municipality and 48 observations from the bashantapur and bagha vdc s in addition to a large sample of the respondents belonging to the urban area the amount of bacterial contamination in drinking water is also high in the urban area out of 266 observations 95 households 35 drinking water tested positive for e coli contamination while only 31 tested positive in the rural areas as a robustness check we estimate the effect of e coli on only the urban sample to observe the consistency of our results we follow the same estimation methodology in the urban sample that was used for the entire study area since the marginal effects of the ordered probit estimates show the precise effect we present the marginal effects in each category for estimation consistency the number of hh member is still used as the exposure variable in all the negative binomial models presented in table 6 column 1 3 shows the marginal effect of self in three different categories such as poor 1 medium 2 and good 3 column 4 6 shows the marginal effect of the negative binomial models fixed effect is considered in all the models gfe 1 is the generalized residual calculated from the column 1 of table 2 which includes a fixed effect gno 2 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child but including the fixed effect all the generalized residuals are calculated from equation 5 of empirical section column 1 3 shows the marginal effect of self in three different categories such as poor 1 medium 2 and good 3 based on the samples collected from the siddharthanagar municipality column 4 6 shows the marginal effect of the negative binomial models gr 1 is the generalized residual calculated from column 2 of table 2 gnofe 2 is the generalized residual calculated without controlling for age agesq and male of the child and without the fixed effect the general findings in table 6 are similar to the results in table 5 and supports the consistency of our results even when the siddharthanagar sample is considered by itself the change in the predicted probability on each category for self reported health is consistent between table 5 and 6 however the difference in the expected incidence in the siddharthanagar sample is dissimilar when compared to the results of the entire sample for instance the impact on the number of children affected by diarrhea in siddharthanagar is lower than the entire sample while the impact on the number of adults shows a larger estimate the chi square statistic and the corresponding p value indicates the fit of the data by a negative binomial process as mentioned earlier several past studies have indicated a direct association between e coli contamination and health outcomes although these studies do not account for any intermediary process 11 15 as another robustness check for the validity of the results and also to confirm the findings of previous research we estimate the direct association between e coli contamination and health outcomes without controlling for the endogeneity of the e coli variable this is done by directly estimating equation 1 by employing the ordered probit and the negative binomial model and the output is shown in table 7 the general results are still consistent and support the main findings of the paper the likelihood of e coli contamination in drinking water reduces the self reported health status and increases the expected incidence of diarrhea among the household members similar to the previous findings only the boil variable is significant and only in the adult regression and income is significant with the expected sign column 1 presents the ordered probit estimates of self reported health status self is the dependent variable column 2 4 presents the estimates for child adult and both by negative binomial models constant 1 and constant 2 are the two constants of the ordered probit model where constant is the constant for the negative binomial model we have used both self reported health and the number of household members affected by diarrheal incidences as indicators of the health status the results show consistency between the two indicators of health status as indicated earlier self reported health status suffers from the limitation of bias while reporting it 62 63 however studies 64 65 have also shown concordance between generic self reported health and a specific measure the results from negative binomial regressions from this study also suggest that self reported health could be used as an indicator of health due to the consistency of results since the measurement between the two health indicators is different in this study we do not discuss whether the estimates of e coli from the ordered probit and negative binomial regressions can be used as substitutes the negative binomial estimates show a higher value of the difference between the expected incidences for adults than child tables 4 and 7 this suggests that e coli contamination has a higher impact on the health of an adult than a child research has shown that intestinal parasites such as giardia are dominant in causing diarrhea than bacterial contamination such as e coli among children sherchand et al 66 investigated the stool sample of 440 diarrheal child patients in nepal and found that intestinal parasites 36 5 and pathogenic bacteria 20 were the cause of most of the diarrheal infections among the pathogenic bacteria the predominant bacteria were shigella species 36 8 vibrio species 26 3 escherichia coli 22 8 and salmonella species 14 03 respectively their finding further supports our results of low impact on a child from e coli contamination since other parasites may play a dominant role in the prevalence of diarrhea compared to adults moreover as a measure of another robustness check we used the number of child and the number of adults as exposure variables and re estimated the regressions of child and adult in each of the specifications in tables 4 7 we find the consistency of the results in terms of the sign of coefficients and level of significance however we do not report the results here to limit the length of the paper finally the results from this study also indicate that boiling the water alone may not protect from e coli contamination whereas washing utensils could have a significant impact on reducing bacterial contamination in drinking water among other covariates the marginal effect of income income is significant with the expected sign on categories poor and good table 5 the predicted probability for self reported health status self decreases by five percentage points if the household is considered poor while it increases by four percentage points if the household income is considered good 6 conclusions this study investigated the linkages between water quality level and two measures of health outcomes self reported health status and the number of household members affected by diarrheal diseases the novel contribution of this paper is that we introduce an intermediary process to understand the relationship between water quality level and health status the study is carried out in three locations in the rupandehi district of nepal the results not only confirm prior findings on the significant linkage between health outcomes and drinking water contamination but also extend the understanding of factors pertaining to e coli formation in the drinking water more specifically our analyses from the primary survey data collected suggest that a better hygiene infrastructure and cleanliness behavior reduces the likelihood of e coli contamination b higher likelihood of e coli presence significantly decreases the self reported health status c higher likelihood of e coli presence also significantly increases the number of diarrheal incidences furthermore the outcome variables are estimated by accounting for the endogeneity of e coli the results remain consistent across the various specifications carried out to test the robustness of our findings while the general results from this paper suggest a link between health outcomes water quality and cleanliness and hygienic behaviors these findings should still be taken with caution for one although we accounted for the potential endogeneity of the e coli variable the results might still be sensitive to unobservables despite the several validities and robustness checks conducted incorporating other variables in the estimation of e coli was not possible since data was not collected on other possible sources of e coli contamination similarly information on the child s age and gender could also have explained more of the actual outcome but it was outside the scope of the study due to the limitation 22 22 while we do not think the central result of the study would differ incorporating the children s gender and age would probably make the findings more robust and comparison of the result between the two sub groups adults and children would be more comparable since both groups would have similar control variables to capture the variations of the data the findings from this study can nevertheless provide substantial guidance to the siddharthangar municipality for appropriate policy formulation to alleviate health hazards from water related issues one policy measure that could be implemented is to begin regular monitoring of the water quality level of the water sources which would make the municipal authorities more informed and better prepared to take protective actions to make the drinking water safe for households in addition to municipalities monitoring the water sources an alternative approach could be to train the households themselves to measure their water quality so they too can make informed decisions this could be done by implementing programs such as citizen science 23 23 in fact the nepal study center at the university of new mexico had recently implemented a citizen science program where the local volunteers in siddharthanagar were trained to measure the contaminants in the nearby danda river this type of program could be extended to the household level as well more information on this project can be found on kunwar et al 47 and also on https foxc01 wixsite com yogdan projects initiatives that allows the general people to become more aware and engaged to learn further about water cleansing behaviors and the risks of contaminants in their water the results from this study could be instrumental in furthering research on water quality and health status in the developing world for instance based on our findings a randomized control trial rct study could be carried out to analyze impacts on health status from changes in behavior and infrastructure among households with varying levels of information dissemination about their drinking water quality levels our study finds that cleanliness behavior and hygiene infrastructures are the mitigating factors for reducing the outbreak of e coli contamination in drinking water hence another policy could be targeted towards nudging cleanliness habits while handling water which could reduce health hazards from diarrheal incidences investment in raising awareness through social media campaigns and developing school level curriculums on cleanliness practices hygiene infrastructure and water quality could all also aid in developing health knowledge among the general population finally the construction of hygienic infrastructures such as deep tubewell and flush toilet incurs a significant amount of cost to the households subsidizing the costs of these infrastructures could induce a larger number of households to use them which would thereby safeguard the entire community from health hazards like diarrheal incidences credit authorship

8677,like many islands worldwide santa cruz the most populated of ecuador s galápagos islands has limited resources to provide safe drinking water to an increasing number of inhabitants and tourists currently households receive brackish water at their tap which is rationed to a few hours per day insufficient recovery of water supply costs is an impediment to improving water services against this backdrop we implemented a contingent valuation survey to investigate whether households are willing to pay for improved water services using split sample scenarios that allow for scope and part whole tests we elicited household preferences for three improvements 1 uninterrupted water supply 2 drinkable tap water and 3 combining both our estimation results indicate that households are willing to pay for safe drinking water conversely our willingness to pay estimates suggest that households are indifferent about improvements of service reliability unless water quality is improved as well the median willingness to pay for concurrent improvements of system reliability and water quality is estimated at approximately 36 month about 2 1 of average monthly household income this study has policy implications as it demonstrates that households deem system reliability and water quality as complementary improvements keywords safe drinking water continuous water supply willingness to pay contingent valuation galápagos islands ecuador 1 introduction the global population with access to piped water systems increased from 3 5 billion to 4 8 billion over 2000 2017 indicating a shift toward achieving sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation for all 1 however many water utilities throughout the world provide unreliable water services to their constituents due to natural constraints institutional barriers and insufficient cost recovery 2 5 even where there are formal delivery systems approximately 300 million people globally are connected to intermittent water supply systems where water is delivered non continuously 6 in settings where water services are frequently interrupted water rationing schemes are pervasive and water can be unsafe to drink 7 11 in some cases water service interruptions may exacerbate the prevalence of water related illnesses 6 12 15 system unreliability also imposes significant costs on households which cope with service interruptions by storing water at home 3 16 consuming bottled water 17 18 and purchasing water from private vendors 19 20 these costs can be significant often exceeding 10 of household income 21 22 despite these costs water utilities and government officials often assume that water users are not willing to pay additional fees for service improvements which becomes an impediment to investing in water infrastructure 23 24 even when there is political will to improve water services water utilities lack information about how much money households are willing to pay for service improvements consequently water planning and pricing structures may be inconsistent with household preferences which could lead to a vicious cycle of consumer dissatisfaction distrust of water utilities insufficient system revenues and low quality services designing water policies that reflect household preferences for improved services may help break that vicious cycle previous studies on preferences for improving different attributes of piped water services have relied on discrete choice experiments e g refs 25 27 sequential contingent valuation questions for each attribute e g ref 28 and a single contingent valuation question with split sample scenarios to test for scope effects e g refs 29 30 those approaches assume that the value assigned to any single service attribute is independent from other values and that the willingness to pay for concurrently improving all attributes can be estimated as the sum of those values however recent studies have shown that there may exist a degree of substitution or complementarity among attributes 20 74 in which case summing the value of improving each service attribute will not equal the value of concurrent improvements we conducted a survey based contingent valuation cv study on household preferences for improvements in two service attributes supply continuity and water quality in the island of santa cruz where population growth and sustained increase in tourism are putting considerable pressure on limited water resources santa cruz provides an example of a small island where water services are frequently interrupted and tap water is unsafe to drink due to high salinity levels 31 in contrast to prior studies on preferences for water service attributes we designed split sample scenarios where supply continuity and water quality are improved independently or simultaneously this approach allows us to investigate whether households see those attributes as complements substitutes or independent from each other we found a significant degree of complementarity between preferences for supply continuity and water quality our findings indicate that households are willing to pay a considerable increase in their monthly water bill at least 700 of the current flat fee for improvements in water quality in contrast they are not willing to pay for improvements in system reliability unless service continuity is complemented with water quality improvements 2 household preferences for improving piped water systems there is an extensive literature on household preferences for improved water services based on revealed and stated preference techniques one revealed preference approach the averting behavior method has been used to investigate preferences for improved piped water services particularly in developing countries averting expenditures on in home water storage and water from alternative sources are estimates of households willingness to pay wtp for uninterrupted services e g refs 3 16 75 similarly expenditures on in home water treatment and bottled water represent households wtp for water quality improvements e g 18 32 76 77 hedonic models of property values have also been used to estimate economic values for water service interruptions e g ref 33 and water quality issues e g refs 34 78 although a majority of those applications are from developed countries presumably because of the lack of reliable data on property values in developing areas 35 an issue with revealed preference methods is that they understate the total economic value of improvements as they do not always capture the totality of the components or attributes of the improvements 79 another possible shortcoming of revealed preference methods in developing countries is that since many districts or agencies lack experience with adequate water provision mechanisms it is difficult to observe consumer choices over meaningful options 36 moreover revealed preference methods lack flexibility to investigate complementarity or substitutability among improvements of different water services attributes stated preference methods such as cv and discrete choice experiments dces overcome this limitation dces are appropriate to elicit preferences for separable attributes of goods and services that are not traded in market settings by choosing among a number of alternatives that vary from each other in terms of attribute levels respondents state their preferences for different service specification for instance ref 26 used a dce to evaluate public preferences for alternative levels of water quality frequency of water supply interruptions and water availability for agriculture in greece he found that mean wtp for ensuring good water quality was about 40 of their current water bills almost 95 60 year and average wtp for addressing supply interruptions was about 5 of current bills about 12 year household 37 use a dce to investigate wtp for improvements in several contaminants e g arsenic chlorides coliforms most respondents 61 chose a mid range reduction of pollutants at an additional cost of 450 bangladesh taka month us 5 31 25 use a dce to ascertain wtp for improvements in water quality and the number of days in a week with access to water for the case of only supply improvements they found average wtp of between 25 50 over the current bill of 36 2 birr us 2 20 in the case of both attributes improving simultaneously they found wtp of between 60 and 80 depending on the extent of the increase in provision those dce studies are limited to estimate main effects of attribute levels on wtp i e they do not include interaction terms between service attributes therefore it is not possible to investigate whether the sum of marginal values of continuity and quality attributes is equal to the value of a concurrent improvement the contingent valuation method has also been extensively used to estimate local wtp for improvements of piped water services 1 1 the contingent valuation method has also been applied in areas with reliable water systems to estimate wtp to avoid water use restrictions during droughts e g refs 69 70 many of those studies studies have focused on a single improvement e g service continuity water quality a bundle of service attributes or a bundle of services 11 32 38 42 2 2 we provide a table evaluating a number of appropriate cv studies in appendix a however other cv studies have estimated the value of quantity and quality attributes using sequential questions or split samples for instance in pakistan 28 used two sequential questions to assess wtp for clean water that could be drunk directly from the tap and uninterrupted water supply respectively alternatively 29 implemented a split sample treatment approach to conduct a scope test in parral mexico while a subsample of respondents was presented with the improvement of water quality to make it safe to drink with unchanged service interruptions the other subsample assessed an improvement of both water quality and service reliability i e uninterrupted provision of drinkable water they found that households were willing to pay an increase of 122 in their water bill for water quality improvements and 191 for the concurrent improvement of water quality and service reliability 33 followed a similar split sample approach in león nicaragua although their basic improvement was in system reliability compared to the concurrent improvement of system reliability and water quality their findings indicate that households were willing to pay at least 120 of their water bill for service continuity but they would not pay more for improvements in water quality 30 conducted a split sample cv study in mexico city to examine a maintenance and an improvement scenario under the maintenance scenario users would not see predicted declines in water provision and under the improvement scenario users would see an increase in the amount of water they regularly received for maintenance they found a wtp of 241 pesos bimonthly a 164 increase over current bill 5 2 of income and for improvement the wtp was 290 pesos bimonthly a 197 increase over current bill 6 3 of income existing stated preference studies implicitly assume that wtp estimates for different water service attributes are separable however households could have stronger preferences for concurrent improvements than for separate ones in that case the value of a concurrent improvement cannot be calculated as the sum of separate improvements of its parts a split sample design with contingent scenarios for separate and combined improvements of water service attributes can be implemented to test the hypothesis that the value of a concurrent improvement is equal to the sum of the value of separate improvements alternatively one could design a discrete choice experiment with interaction effects between service attributes while highly effective in eliciting preferences for different attributes discrete choice experiments may impose a cognitive burden on respondents depending on the number of alternatives attributes and choice sets 43 80 compared to discrete choice experiments a contingent valuation question is easier for the respondent to understand although the split sample approach may require a larger sample 3 study site the galápagos islands are an archipelago off the coast of ecuador known for their high degree of endemism and historical connection with the development of the theory of natural selection with an area of 986 km2 santa cruz is the second largest island in the archipelago and the most populated the galápagos have attracted an increasing number of tourists in recent decades in 2018 the archipelago received almost 276 000 visitors of which 76 arrived in the baltra santa cruz airport 44 the number of new residents primarily from the ecuadorian mainland has also increased considerably in the last years as they look for job opportunities related to the tourism industry the latest census reported that the island of santa cruz had a population of approximately 15 701 inhabitants in 2015 most of whom live in the urban center of puerto ayora 45 tourism and population growth puts pressure on the environment particularly on water resources 46 48 water stress is of particular concern on santa cruz where water availability is limited to brackish water accumulated in crevices in volcanic rock the proximity of the urban settlement to the basal aquifer seawater intrusion and inefficient wastewater treatment have negatively affected the quality of groundwater sources in santa cruz 49 49 reported that salinity concentrations in some inland sites exceeded the who guidelines for drinking water by as much as 100 additionally in puerto ayora domestic effluent is collected in single family septic tanks without additional depuration 50 malfunction of up to 90 of septic tanks has caused infiltration of wastewater into the basal aquifer making it an unsuitable drinking water source due to the presence of fecal coliforms 49 50 the public water company referred to as empresa pública municipal de agua potable y alcantarillado de santa cruz epmapasc was created in december 2015 and started operation in january 2018 as of november 2020 epmapasc served 2410 water connections residential and commercial in puerto ayora with brackish water from lä camisetä crevice pers comm with the general manager of epmapasc galápagos november 17th 2020 however between the volume from that water source system inefficiencies and deficits in revenue the system is insufficient to satisfy a growing demand for drinking water a majority of which about 55 comes from tourists moreover water services are frequently interrupted with an average supply of approximately 3 h per day 3 3 based on our conversations with the local water utility and municipal officials all water users experience service interruptions however hotels have invested in water storage capacity and the large ones have their own desalination plants those investments may explain why few visitors less than 10 according to ref 35 observe service interruptions since municipal water is not potable residents rely on a private market of bottled water for drinking and cooking 31 from a technical perspective seawater desalination is deemed the main alternative to supply drinking water for tourists and locals in the long run 47 51 investigated different combinations of seawater desalination rainwater harvesting graywater recycling leakage reduction water meter installation and water demand reduction in order to provide drinking water to the local population and tourist visitors over a span of 30 years combining leakage reduction water metering and seawater desalination was the only strategy that would meet the water demand under each of four population and tourism growth scenarios they also estimated a total cost of us 2 17 per cubic meter of desalinated water for the fastest growth scenario which consisted of a population growth of 7 and tourism growth of 9 that estimate included investment operation and management costs in 2016 us 7 million was invested to build the desalination plant located 2 8 km from puerto ayora 52 this desalination plant was designed to treat brackish groundwater from la camiseta crevice and supply drinking water to the town of puerto ayora however as of november of 2020 the plant was still being tested and operated by the contractor and the public water company epmapasc was expected to be in charge of its operation by the second half of 2021 despite the financial investment the desalination plant was not functional at the time of this writing december 2020 and the salinity levels of piped water remains too high for drinking in its first year of operation epmapasc used a tariff structure managed by the municipality of santa cruz since february 2019 epmapasc has collected tariffs directly from water users the monthly water tariff in puerto ayora is flat and is currently divided into two categories based on consumption and construction area i commercial if the construction area is greater than 100 m2 11 24 and ii residential if the construction area is less than 100 m2 5 24 4 4 according to the national survey of employment unemployment and underemployment referred to as enemdu in ecuador the average monthly household income in the galápagos islands was 1862 as of december 2019 the residential rate of 5 24 is equivalent to 0 28 of the aforementioned household income which is below the affordability threshold of 3 71 approximately 40 of water users pay the domestic rate the rest are considered commercial users 53 in 2019 16 of the total water bill was past due epmapasc allows water users to have up to three outstanding monthly bills and if they do not arrange a payment schedule the service is suspended pers comm with the general manager of epmapasc galápagos november 17th 2020 the municipality in puerto ayora is currently considering a new water policy where the tariff will be paid based on consumption thus this study is timely and relevant for water planning and pricing schemes on the island 4 survey design and sampling procedure the contingent valuation method has proved to be a flexible approach to estimate use and non use values for goods and services that are not traded in market settings despite multiple criticisms due to its hypothetical nature moreover when carefully designed cv consistently produces wtp estimates that exhibit internal validity and that are similar to values estimated from revealed preference methods haab et al 2020 following best practices for designing cv surveys 34 54 55 we developed a questionnaire based on a comprehensive review of scholarly articles and official documents as well as iterative consultations with local authorities water users and researchers with ample knowledge on local water issues the final survey consisted of 23 questions some of which had multiple conditional follow up questions the survey gathered information about current conditions of water services household water practices consumer satisfaction with different service attributes preferences for improved water services and respondents sociodemographic characteristics 5 5 the survey is available from the authors upon request the survey was administered by four trained surveyors via in home interviews with household representatives in january 2020 we selected respondents using a geographically stratified sampling procedure first we divided the town of puerto ayora into five zones to identify the following a recent urban development residential and commercial zones and relative affluence of different neighborhoods see fig 1 due to the lack of official data we used local knowledge to create this geographical stratification then to select the sampled households we follow a non discretionary approach consisting of requesting interviews at every third house in order to avoid any selectivity bias in the interviewers selection of respondents if a respondent could not respond at the time the interviewers came by the interviewers made appointments with these households this sampling protocol yielded 453 completed questionnaires we designed a referendum cv question in which respondents could vote against or in favor of a project that would improve water services in exchange for an increase in their water bill this increase varied randomly across respondents from 5 to 25 in increments of 5 before responding whether or not they would pay the given amount respondents were reminded of their budget constraint to make the choice scenario more realistic given our interest in exploring complementarity between preferences for service reliability and water quality we implemented split sample scenarios with three variations in the proposed service improvement a continuous supply of safe drinking water at the tap b improving the system reliability to provide water without interruptions while maintaining the current water quality and c improving water quality to make it safe to drink while keeping current service hours this split sample variation allows for a scope test for a nested good 56 as well as for a test of part whole valuation effects 57 the cv question in the survey read as follows suppose that the residents of santa cruz will have the opportunity to vote in favor of or against a project that would improve the supply of tap water scenario a the new system would provide water 24 h per day every day of the year additionally the water would be treated so it can be drunk directly from the tap scenario b the new system would provide water 24 h per day every day of the year however the water would have the same quality it has now scenario c the water would be treated so it can be drunk directly from the tap however the water supply would continue being interrupted with the same frequency if the project is approved bid will be added to your monthly water bill to install operate and maintain the new water system keep in mind that the additional money paid in your water bill will not be available of other needs at your home such as food clothing etc would you vote in favor of or against the project in cv studies the hypothetical nature of the valuation question can lead to a bias in stated wtp to address hypothetical biases we elicited respondents certainty levels regarding their answer to the cv question using a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 meant completely uncertain and 10 completely certain researchers use the certainty question to reduce the hypothetical bias and obtain more accurate wtp estimates 29 58 60 61 found that the certainty question was more effective than other methods for estimating actual wtp values 5 analytical framework and econometric modeling the cv method is based on a utility theoretic framework we keep the discussion of that framework to a minimum as it has been extensively discussed in previous studies 34 81 and haab et al 2020 provide detailed descriptions of the theoretic foundations of the cv method and 29 present an application of that framework to improvements of piped water services in the context of this study the indirect utility of a household v is a function of household income y attributes of water services w and prices of other goods p i e v y w p the framework assumes that households derive utility from improvements in system reliability and water quality and that income decreases reduce utility levels hence the maximum amount that a household will pay for improved water services wtp is equivalent to the income loss that would take their utility back to the original level after improving the service denoting status quo conditions with a 0 subscript and improved conditions with a 1 subscript the compensating welfare measure of benefits derived from service improvements i e wtp is usually defined using the indirect utility function v 0 y w 0 p 0 v 1 y wtp w 1 p 0 by solving for wtp from that utility equivalence one observes that wtp is a function of the individual s income the service improvement and prices of other goods our split sample design allows for scope and part whole tests given that scenario a encompasses both scenarios b and c i e b a c a we can implement a scope test regarding the hypothesis that households wtp for simultaneous improvements of system reliability and water quality is greater than households wtp for improvements in one of those attributes alone i e wtpa wtpb wtpa wtpc additionally because scenario a is a combination of scenarios b and c i e a b c we can compare the wtp for improvements of system reliability and water quality estimated as a whole wtpa versus estimating it as the addition of the wtp for each part of the improvement wtpb wtpc the part whole test depends on how households perceive the relationship between system reliability and water quality 62 63 if system reliability and water quality are considered to be independent then wtpa wtpb wtpc in the case that they are seen as substitutes then wtpa wtpb wtpc conversely wtpa wtpb wtpc when system reliability and water quality are considered to complement each other 57 therefore our split sample design allows for investigating the nature of the relationship between system reliability and water quality from a consumer perspective from an empirical perspective the wtp function can be modeled using a linear or a log linear specification see ref 28 however the log linear model is preferred over the linear specification because it ensures having non negative wtp estimates conversely the linear model may yield negative wtp estimates which is inconsistent with the utility theoretic framework haab et al 2020 in our empirical approach we assume that households wtp for the proposed water service improvements follows a log linear specification 1 l n w t p x β ε where lnwtp represents the natural logarithm of the maximum amount that the household is willing to pay x is a vector of covariates including indicators on split sample scenarios β is a vector of coefficients to be estimated and ε is a stochastic error term that depicts unobservable covariates note that prices of other goods are excluded l n p r 1 p r α l n b i d x δ e from vector x because there is no variation in prices across respondents in the referendum format the maximum wtp is not directly observed hence an alternative estimation procedure is needed to analyze responses to the referendum cv question following cameron 1988 lnwtp can be indirectly identified using the equivalence between the probability of being willing to pay for the proposed improvement and the probability that lnwtp is greater than the natural logarithm of the bid presented in the contingent scenario i e pr yes pr lnwtp lnbid consequently the probability of a positive response to the cv question pr can be modeled using a logit specification 2 l n p r 1 p r α l n b i d x δ e where α and δ are coefficients to be determined using a maximum likelihood estimation approach under the assumption that the stochastic error term e follows a logistic distribution table 1 presents the variables included in vector x the variable lnbid is included to investigate the effect of the additional payment on the likelihood of voting in favor of the proposed water project according to our theoretical framework we expect this effect to be negative because such payment would reduce income available for other goods and services two indicators reliable and quality were included to depict differentials among our split sample scenarios reliable takes the value of one if the respondent was presented with an improvement in system reliability without improving water quality i e scenario b quality takes the value of one in the opposite case i e scenario c both indicators are equal to zero for respondents who were presented with simultaneous improvements in system reliability and water quality i e scenario a given that scenario a is the base for comparison we expect both reliable and quality to have a negative effect on the likelihood of voting for the proposed project our theoretical framework also indicates that wtp for improved services is a function of household income therefore we included the variable income to test the hypothesis that the likelihood of voting for the proposed project increases with household income additionally following 43 we included the binary indicator consequential to investigate whether respondents who believe that our survey could have policy implications would be more likely to vote for the proposed project finally as in previous studies on preferences for improved water services e g refs 11 28 29 32 33 38 we explored several variables as controls for heterogeneity among respondents including sex age number of years living in the study site home ownership number of rooms in the home household size number of hours in a week with water supply and two indices depicting consumer satisfaction with system reliability and water quality based on pseudo r 2 coefficients akaike aic and bayesian bic information criteria and the statistical significance of corresponding coefficients education was the only control variable in the model that best fits our data household wtp for improved services can be calculated using the α and δ coefficients estimated in equation 2 specifically median household wtp for improved water services can be calculated as follows 34 3 m e d i a n w t p e x δ ˆ α ˆ where x is a vector of the average of covariates δ ˆ represents the estimated coefficients of covariates other than the bid proposed in the contingent scenario and α ˆ is the coefficient of lnbid median wtp for specific improvements can be estimated by setting the corresponding indicator to the appropriate levels 34 given our modeling approach we estimate the median wtp for concurrent improvements of service reliability and water quality by setting the indicators reliable and quality equal to zero when reliable is equal to one and quality equal to zero equation 3 yields the median wtp for improving service continuity only similarly the median wtp for improvements of water quality is estimated when quality is equal to one while keeping reliable at zero in addition to using the original responses to the referendum question we used responses to the follow up certainty question to recode positive voting responses as negative ones if the respondent s certainty level was below seven model 2 or eight model 3 on a scale varying from one to 10 then the recoded responses are used to estimate equations 2 and 3 29 followed a similar approach to correct for voting response uncertainty and thus mitigate potential hypothetical biases as 58 shows this approach allows for estimating more conservative and arguably more accurate wtp estimates 6 survey and estimation results table 2 provides an average profile of our respondents a majority of respondents were female this is presumably because we conducted interviews during business hours when males are more likely to be at work nonetheless our sample was more gender balanced than recent studies on wtp for improved water services in developing countries e g refs 33 37 the average respondent was approximately 42 years old had 12 years of schooling had lived in the sampled home for almost 12 years and had been a resident of santa cruz for more than 25 years the average household had four members and a monthly income of 1720 almost 67 of the sampled households owned their home each of which has an average of six rooms our sample is similar in years of schooling to the most recent census of all the galápagos islands 45 but with higher household size 4 vs 3 members and home ownership 66 7 vs 48 4 these differentials can be partially explained by different population dynamics of santa cruz relative to the other galápagos islands in the archipelago santa cruz is the most populated island and the one with the most rapid annual population growth at 2 4 which is 0 6 points above the average population growth in all the galápagos islands 45 the age of the average respondent is also higher than the population average 41 7 vs 29 3 years of age which was expected given that we intentionally interviewed adults despite these few differences we are confident that our sample is representative of the population of santa cruz given our stratified random sampling strategy and that we sampled almost 19 of the housing units served by the water utility our survey results provide an overview of the current conditions of water services and practices that households adopt to cope with poor service conditions see table 3 the average household received tap water almost every day during the week but for less than 3 h per day a small percentage of households reported low water pressure 7 1 under these conditions it is not surprising that all households stored water at home fig 2 shows the type of water storage devices that households used to store water cisterns and roof tanks were the most popular devices used by a majority of households households that used those devices invested an average of 603 in roof tanks and 3627 in cisterns table 3 also shows some household practices related to water quality none of the sampled households consumed tap water without treating it at home and only few households treated tap water at home to drink 13 conversely a majority of households consumed bottled water more than 90 the average household consumed more than four 20l carboys large bottles of water in a week on which they spent more than 8 in total we also elicited levels of consumer satisfaction with different water service attributes fig 3 respondents were equally divided in terms of their satisfaction with attributes related to system reliability i e daily service hours and water pressure in contrast approximately 94 were unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with the quality of their tap water more than 91 of respondents also showed some dissatisfaction with the flavor of tap water and a majority was not satisfied with other aesthetic attributes such as color and smell of tap water consistent with consumer satisfaction levels fig 4 indicates that approximately 89 of respondents believed that improving water quality should be the water utility s priority overall these results indicate public concern with the quality of tap water in puerto ayora given that households are dissatisfied with current water services the incumbent question is whether they are willing to pay for improved services to address that question we estimated logit models of the probability of voting in favor of the proposed water service improvements equation 2 which we then used to compute wtp estimates using equation 3 given that the magnitude of logit coefficients are difficult to interpret in table 4 we show the marginal effects of corresponding covariates on the probability of voting for the project proposed in the cv scenario based on estimation results of three logit models the specification of model 1 is the one that best fit our data based on pseudo r2 coefficients aic and bic 6 6 we assessed different control variables including the respondent s sex age number of years living in our study site home ownership number of rooms in the home household size number of hours in a week with water supply and two indices depicting consumer satisfaction with system reliability and water quality we also control for fixed effects of geographical areas used to stratify our sample none of them was statistically significant moreover goodness of fit measures aic and bic suggest that models including those statistically insignificant factors were less suitable than the parsimonious model specification shown in table 4 we then estimated models 2 and 3 with favorable responses recoded as negative when certainty levels were below 7 model 2 and 8 model 3 out of a 1 10 scale estimated coefficients on lnbid were negative and statistically significant this indicates that respondents are sensitive to increases in the water bill indicators reliable and quality are also negative and significant suggesting that there are some wtp differentials among our split sample scenarios compared to the scenario where both system reliability and water quality were improved respondents were less likely to support only continuous supply without improving water quality scenario b similarly the scenario where only water quality was improved scenario c received less support than the scenario of continuous supply of safe drinking water results also indicate that the likelihood of voting for the proposed project would decrease with an additional year of schooling by about eight percentage points although this effect is statistically significant only at the 10 level consistent with our theoretical framework the effect of household income is positive and statistically significant at the 1 level based on the estimated coefficient of income in model 1 the probability of voting for the proposed water improvements increase by 4 8 points with an increase in income of 500 finally respondents who believed that our survey could have policy implications were 21 points more likely to vote for the proposed service improvement than those who believed otherwise we followed equation 3 to compute the median household wtp for each service improvement in scenarios a b and c at the average of income education and consequential the indicators reliable and quality are set to the appropriate value to reproduce each scenario fig 5 a shows confidence intervals for the median wtp for continuous supply of safe drinking water i e scenario a which we computed using the delta method based on model 1 median wtp was approximately 87 per month estimates corrected for response uncertainty i e based on model 2 and model 3 indicate that the median household would pay about 36 or 15 for continuous supply of safe drinking water depending on the level of certainty correction these estimates are more conservative and presumably more accurate 58 wtp estimates for scenario b i e continuous water supply without improving water quality are statistically insignificant fig 5b suggesting that households would not pay for system reliability if water quality is not improved as well conversely fig 5 c shows that households are willing to pay for safe drinking water even if water services continue being interrupted the median household would pay about 26 monthly for improving water quality wtp estimates corrected for voting response certainty are at 4 75 or 2 depending on the certainty correction 7 discussion and conclusions we implemented a contingent valuation survey to investigate household preferences for improved water services in santa cruz the most populated island in the galápagos archipelago ecuador currently the system supplies brackish water for less than 3 h per day our survey results indicate that households are dissatisfied with current water services and cope with unreliable services by storing water at home and consuming bottled water we followed a split sample approach to estimate households wtp for three types of service improvement 1 eliminating service interruptions 2 making tap water safe to drink and 3 improving both system reliability and water quality concurrently wtp estimates suggest that households are indifferent about improvements of service reliability unless water quality is improved as well this may be explained by the fact that all households have already invested in expensive infrastructure to store water at home e g roof tanks and cisterns given that households have significant water storage capacity increasing the number of daily hours with water services without improving water quality was not sufficient for them to pay an additional fee in contrast the median household would pay almost 26 for safe drinking water even if it were not continuously provided this wtp estimate is below current household expenditures on bottled water that amount to more than 35 in a month households wtp increases when both service reliability and water quality are improved the estimated wtp for continuous supply of safe drinking water is almost 87 month this wtp estimate is higher than current household expenditures on adaptive measures which suggests that the wtp estimate may be affected by hypothetical bias thus we rely on the wtp estimate corrected for 70 certainty regarding voting responses this estimate indicates that the median household would pay an increase in the water bill of approximately 36 month it is worth noting that the conservative wtp estimate for continuous supply of safe drinking water is greater than the wtp estimate for single improvements in water quality and system reliability that is our estimates show evidence of sensitivity to scope for nested goods 56 moreover the conservative wtp estimate for continuous supply of safe drinking water is greater than the sum of both wtp estimates for single improvements i e wtpa wtpb wtpc this indicates that service reliability and water quality are complements in the eyes of water consumers 57 based on these results we recommend that future valuation studies consider potential complementarity or substitutability among household preferences for different attributes from a policy perspective our estimates are a monetary measure of the benefits that households would derive from continuous access to drinking water which can be compared with the cost of improving water services in santa cruz according to ecuadorian legislation memorandum senagua sapys 2 2016 0214 m the average household of four should be provided with 24 cubic meters of water in a month 200 l per person per day in order to meet the growing water demand over the next 30 years according to ref 51 the water company epmapasc will need to invest in a seawater desalination plant new pipes water meters and leak control systems based on their cost estimate of 2 17 per cubic meter of water which includes financing operation and maintenance costs providing the average household with the minimum legally required amount of potable water would cost 52 per month hence the proposed increase of 36 in the water would be insufficient to cover supply costs there could also be some concerns about the affordability of a new water tariff of 41 36 increase from the current rate of 5 although the new tariff would remain below the affordability threshold of 3 at 2 4 of the average monthly household income reported by our sample 40 of the sampled households would surpass that threshold and 15 would be paying more than 5 of their monthly income to address this issue epmapasc could use our wtp estimates by income brackets shown in appendix b to design a differentiated pricing structure if water users can be classified in terms of their household income 7 7 in the context of our study it may be difficult to design an income based differential pricing mechanism because many people work in the informal sector in ecuador it is estimated that 60 of workers are in the informal sector 72 for instance projections based on model 2 suggest that households earning 500 or less would be willing to pay an increase of about 14 in their water bill and those in the following income bracket 501 1000 would pay an increase of approximately 19 50 those water fees would be lower than current monthly expenditures on bottled water which amount to 24 for households in the first income bracket 500 or less and 31 for households in the second bracket 501 1000 additionally it may be unreasonable to expect that every water user will pay the proposed increase in water bills currently outstanding payments account for approximately 16 of the total water bill consequently epmapasc operates with significant financial deficits which are covered with municipal transfers under these circumstances alternative sources of revenue may be required to finance improved water services much of the demand increase that drives the need for additional supply comes from tourism increasing the visitor entrance fee could be one of those revenue sources according to ref 35 tourists would be willing to make a one time payment of 45 to support improvements in local water services enough to pay for the production of 20 cubic meters of water future studies can estimate the water footprint of tourist and determine whether an increase in the visitor entrance fee would be an adequate tool to subsidize local water service improvements funding we acknowledge

estimates were computed using the delta method given that income is assumed to influence wtp in a linear form projections away from the average income are statistically insignificant we tested for interaction effects between lnbid and income and found them to be statistically insignificant which suggest that households responsiveness to increases in water bills does not vary across different income levels 
8677,like many islands worldwide santa cruz the most populated of ecuador s galápagos islands has limited resources to provide safe drinking water to an increasing number of inhabitants and tourists currently households receive brackish water at their tap which is rationed to a few hours per day insufficient recovery of water supply costs is an impediment to improving water services against this backdrop we implemented a contingent valuation survey to investigate whether households are willing to pay for improved water services using split sample scenarios that allow for scope and part whole tests we elicited household preferences for three improvements 1 uninterrupted water supply 2 drinkable tap water and 3 combining both our estimation results indicate that households are willing to pay for safe drinking water conversely our willingness to pay estimates suggest that households are indifferent about improvements of service reliability unless water quality is improved as well the median willingness to pay for concurrent improvements of system reliability and water quality is estimated at approximately 36 month about 2 1 of average monthly household income this study has policy implications as it demonstrates that households deem system reliability and water quality as complementary improvements keywords safe drinking water continuous water supply willingness to pay contingent valuation galápagos islands ecuador 1 introduction the global population with access to piped water systems increased from 3 5 billion to 4 8 billion over 2000 2017 indicating a shift toward achieving sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation for all 1 however many water utilities throughout the world provide unreliable water services to their constituents due to natural constraints institutional barriers and insufficient cost recovery 2 5 even where there are formal delivery systems approximately 300 million people globally are connected to intermittent water supply systems where water is delivered non continuously 6 in settings where water services are frequently interrupted water rationing schemes are pervasive and water can be unsafe to drink 7 11 in some cases water service interruptions may exacerbate the prevalence of water related illnesses 6 12 15 system unreliability also imposes significant costs on households which cope with service interruptions by storing water at home 3 16 consuming bottled water 17 18 and purchasing water from private vendors 19 20 these costs can be significant often exceeding 10 of household income 21 22 despite these costs water utilities and government officials often assume that water users are not willing to pay additional fees for service improvements which becomes an impediment to investing in water infrastructure 23 24 even when there is political will to improve water services water utilities lack information about how much money households are willing to pay for service improvements consequently water planning and pricing structures may be inconsistent with household preferences which could lead to a vicious cycle of consumer dissatisfaction distrust of water utilities insufficient system revenues and low quality services designing water policies that reflect household preferences for improved services may help break that vicious cycle previous studies on preferences for improving different attributes of piped water services have relied on discrete choice experiments e g refs 25 27 sequential contingent valuation questions for each attribute e g ref 28 and a single contingent valuation question with split sample scenarios to test for scope effects e g refs 29 30 those approaches assume that the value assigned to any single service attribute is independent from other values and that the willingness to pay for concurrently improving all attributes can be estimated as the sum of those values however recent studies have shown that there may exist a degree of substitution or complementarity among attributes 20 74 in which case summing the value of improving each service attribute will not equal the value of concurrent improvements we conducted a survey based contingent valuation cv study on household preferences for improvements in two service attributes supply continuity and water quality in the island of santa cruz where population growth and sustained increase in tourism are putting considerable pressure on limited water resources santa cruz provides an example of a small island where water services are frequently interrupted and tap water is unsafe to drink due to high salinity levels 31 in contrast to prior studies on preferences for water service attributes we designed split sample scenarios where supply continuity and water quality are improved independently or simultaneously this approach allows us to investigate whether households see those attributes as complements substitutes or independent from each other we found a significant degree of complementarity between preferences for supply continuity and water quality our findings indicate that households are willing to pay a considerable increase in their monthly water bill at least 700 of the current flat fee for improvements in water quality in contrast they are not willing to pay for improvements in system reliability unless service continuity is complemented with water quality improvements 2 household preferences for improving piped water systems there is an extensive literature on household preferences for improved water services based on revealed and stated preference techniques one revealed preference approach the averting behavior method has been used to investigate preferences for improved piped water services particularly in developing countries averting expenditures on in home water storage and water from alternative sources are estimates of households willingness to pay wtp for uninterrupted services e g refs 3 16 75 similarly expenditures on in home water treatment and bottled water represent households wtp for water quality improvements e g 18 32 76 77 hedonic models of property values have also been used to estimate economic values for water service interruptions e g ref 33 and water quality issues e g refs 34 78 although a majority of those applications are from developed countries presumably because of the lack of reliable data on property values in developing areas 35 an issue with revealed preference methods is that they understate the total economic value of improvements as they do not always capture the totality of the components or attributes of the improvements 79 another possible shortcoming of revealed preference methods in developing countries is that since many districts or agencies lack experience with adequate water provision mechanisms it is difficult to observe consumer choices over meaningful options 36 moreover revealed preference methods lack flexibility to investigate complementarity or substitutability among improvements of different water services attributes stated preference methods such as cv and discrete choice experiments dces overcome this limitation dces are appropriate to elicit preferences for separable attributes of goods and services that are not traded in market settings by choosing among a number of alternatives that vary from each other in terms of attribute levels respondents state their preferences for different service specification for instance ref 26 used a dce to evaluate public preferences for alternative levels of water quality frequency of water supply interruptions and water availability for agriculture in greece he found that mean wtp for ensuring good water quality was about 40 of their current water bills almost 95 60 year and average wtp for addressing supply interruptions was about 5 of current bills about 12 year household 37 use a dce to investigate wtp for improvements in several contaminants e g arsenic chlorides coliforms most respondents 61 chose a mid range reduction of pollutants at an additional cost of 450 bangladesh taka month us 5 31 25 use a dce to ascertain wtp for improvements in water quality and the number of days in a week with access to water for the case of only supply improvements they found average wtp of between 25 50 over the current bill of 36 2 birr us 2 20 in the case of both attributes improving simultaneously they found wtp of between 60 and 80 depending on the extent of the increase in provision those dce studies are limited to estimate main effects of attribute levels on wtp i e they do not include interaction terms between service attributes therefore it is not possible to investigate whether the sum of marginal values of continuity and quality attributes is equal to the value of a concurrent improvement the contingent valuation method has also been extensively used to estimate local wtp for improvements of piped water services 1 1 the contingent valuation method has also been applied in areas with reliable water systems to estimate wtp to avoid water use restrictions during droughts e g refs 69 70 many of those studies studies have focused on a single improvement e g service continuity water quality a bundle of service attributes or a bundle of services 11 32 38 42 2 2 we provide a table evaluating a number of appropriate cv studies in appendix a however other cv studies have estimated the value of quantity and quality attributes using sequential questions or split samples for instance in pakistan 28 used two sequential questions to assess wtp for clean water that could be drunk directly from the tap and uninterrupted water supply respectively alternatively 29 implemented a split sample treatment approach to conduct a scope test in parral mexico while a subsample of respondents was presented with the improvement of water quality to make it safe to drink with unchanged service interruptions the other subsample assessed an improvement of both water quality and service reliability i e uninterrupted provision of drinkable water they found that households were willing to pay an increase of 122 in their water bill for water quality improvements and 191 for the concurrent improvement of water quality and service reliability 33 followed a similar split sample approach in león nicaragua although their basic improvement was in system reliability compared to the concurrent improvement of system reliability and water quality their findings indicate that households were willing to pay at least 120 of their water bill for service continuity but they would not pay more for improvements in water quality 30 conducted a split sample cv study in mexico city to examine a maintenance and an improvement scenario under the maintenance scenario users would not see predicted declines in water provision and under the improvement scenario users would see an increase in the amount of water they regularly received for maintenance they found a wtp of 241 pesos bimonthly a 164 increase over current bill 5 2 of income and for improvement the wtp was 290 pesos bimonthly a 197 increase over current bill 6 3 of income existing stated preference studies implicitly assume that wtp estimates for different water service attributes are separable however households could have stronger preferences for concurrent improvements than for separate ones in that case the value of a concurrent improvement cannot be calculated as the sum of separate improvements of its parts a split sample design with contingent scenarios for separate and combined improvements of water service attributes can be implemented to test the hypothesis that the value of a concurrent improvement is equal to the sum of the value of separate improvements alternatively one could design a discrete choice experiment with interaction effects between service attributes while highly effective in eliciting preferences for different attributes discrete choice experiments may impose a cognitive burden on respondents depending on the number of alternatives attributes and choice sets 43 80 compared to discrete choice experiments a contingent valuation question is easier for the respondent to understand although the split sample approach may require a larger sample 3 study site the galápagos islands are an archipelago off the coast of ecuador known for their high degree of endemism and historical connection with the development of the theory of natural selection with an area of 986 km2 santa cruz is the second largest island in the archipelago and the most populated the galápagos have attracted an increasing number of tourists in recent decades in 2018 the archipelago received almost 276 000 visitors of which 76 arrived in the baltra santa cruz airport 44 the number of new residents primarily from the ecuadorian mainland has also increased considerably in the last years as they look for job opportunities related to the tourism industry the latest census reported that the island of santa cruz had a population of approximately 15 701 inhabitants in 2015 most of whom live in the urban center of puerto ayora 45 tourism and population growth puts pressure on the environment particularly on water resources 46 48 water stress is of particular concern on santa cruz where water availability is limited to brackish water accumulated in crevices in volcanic rock the proximity of the urban settlement to the basal aquifer seawater intrusion and inefficient wastewater treatment have negatively affected the quality of groundwater sources in santa cruz 49 49 reported that salinity concentrations in some inland sites exceeded the who guidelines for drinking water by as much as 100 additionally in puerto ayora domestic effluent is collected in single family septic tanks without additional depuration 50 malfunction of up to 90 of septic tanks has caused infiltration of wastewater into the basal aquifer making it an unsuitable drinking water source due to the presence of fecal coliforms 49 50 the public water company referred to as empresa pública municipal de agua potable y alcantarillado de santa cruz epmapasc was created in december 2015 and started operation in january 2018 as of november 2020 epmapasc served 2410 water connections residential and commercial in puerto ayora with brackish water from lä camisetä crevice pers comm with the general manager of epmapasc galápagos november 17th 2020 however between the volume from that water source system inefficiencies and deficits in revenue the system is insufficient to satisfy a growing demand for drinking water a majority of which about 55 comes from tourists moreover water services are frequently interrupted with an average supply of approximately 3 h per day 3 3 based on our conversations with the local water utility and municipal officials all water users experience service interruptions however hotels have invested in water storage capacity and the large ones have their own desalination plants those investments may explain why few visitors less than 10 according to ref 35 observe service interruptions since municipal water is not potable residents rely on a private market of bottled water for drinking and cooking 31 from a technical perspective seawater desalination is deemed the main alternative to supply drinking water for tourists and locals in the long run 47 51 investigated different combinations of seawater desalination rainwater harvesting graywater recycling leakage reduction water meter installation and water demand reduction in order to provide drinking water to the local population and tourist visitors over a span of 30 years combining leakage reduction water metering and seawater desalination was the only strategy that would meet the water demand under each of four population and tourism growth scenarios they also estimated a total cost of us 2 17 per cubic meter of desalinated water for the fastest growth scenario which consisted of a population growth of 7 and tourism growth of 9 that estimate included investment operation and management costs in 2016 us 7 million was invested to build the desalination plant located 2 8 km from puerto ayora 52 this desalination plant was designed to treat brackish groundwater from la camiseta crevice and supply drinking water to the town of puerto ayora however as of november of 2020 the plant was still being tested and operated by the contractor and the public water company epmapasc was expected to be in charge of its operation by the second half of 2021 despite the financial investment the desalination plant was not functional at the time of this writing december 2020 and the salinity levels of piped water remains too high for drinking in its first year of operation epmapasc used a tariff structure managed by the municipality of santa cruz since february 2019 epmapasc has collected tariffs directly from water users the monthly water tariff in puerto ayora is flat and is currently divided into two categories based on consumption and construction area i commercial if the construction area is greater than 100 m2 11 24 and ii residential if the construction area is less than 100 m2 5 24 4 4 according to the national survey of employment unemployment and underemployment referred to as enemdu in ecuador the average monthly household income in the galápagos islands was 1862 as of december 2019 the residential rate of 5 24 is equivalent to 0 28 of the aforementioned household income which is below the affordability threshold of 3 71 approximately 40 of water users pay the domestic rate the rest are considered commercial users 53 in 2019 16 of the total water bill was past due epmapasc allows water users to have up to three outstanding monthly bills and if they do not arrange a payment schedule the service is suspended pers comm with the general manager of epmapasc galápagos november 17th 2020 the municipality in puerto ayora is currently considering a new water policy where the tariff will be paid based on consumption thus this study is timely and relevant for water planning and pricing schemes on the island 4 survey design and sampling procedure the contingent valuation method has proved to be a flexible approach to estimate use and non use values for goods and services that are not traded in market settings despite multiple criticisms due to its hypothetical nature moreover when carefully designed cv consistently produces wtp estimates that exhibit internal validity and that are similar to values estimated from revealed preference methods haab et al 2020 following best practices for designing cv surveys 34 54 55 we developed a questionnaire based on a comprehensive review of scholarly articles and official documents as well as iterative consultations with local authorities water users and researchers with ample knowledge on local water issues the final survey consisted of 23 questions some of which had multiple conditional follow up questions the survey gathered information about current conditions of water services household water practices consumer satisfaction with different service attributes preferences for improved water services and respondents sociodemographic characteristics 5 5 the survey is available from the authors upon request the survey was administered by four trained surveyors via in home interviews with household representatives in january 2020 we selected respondents using a geographically stratified sampling procedure first we divided the town of puerto ayora into five zones to identify the following a recent urban development residential and commercial zones and relative affluence of different neighborhoods see fig 1 due to the lack of official data we used local knowledge to create this geographical stratification then to select the sampled households we follow a non discretionary approach consisting of requesting interviews at every third house in order to avoid any selectivity bias in the interviewers selection of respondents if a respondent could not respond at the time the interviewers came by the interviewers made appointments with these households this sampling protocol yielded 453 completed questionnaires we designed a referendum cv question in which respondents could vote against or in favor of a project that would improve water services in exchange for an increase in their water bill this increase varied randomly across respondents from 5 to 25 in increments of 5 before responding whether or not they would pay the given amount respondents were reminded of their budget constraint to make the choice scenario more realistic given our interest in exploring complementarity between preferences for service reliability and water quality we implemented split sample scenarios with three variations in the proposed service improvement a continuous supply of safe drinking water at the tap b improving the system reliability to provide water without interruptions while maintaining the current water quality and c improving water quality to make it safe to drink while keeping current service hours this split sample variation allows for a scope test for a nested good 56 as well as for a test of part whole valuation effects 57 the cv question in the survey read as follows suppose that the residents of santa cruz will have the opportunity to vote in favor of or against a project that would improve the supply of tap water scenario a the new system would provide water 24 h per day every day of the year additionally the water would be treated so it can be drunk directly from the tap scenario b the new system would provide water 24 h per day every day of the year however the water would have the same quality it has now scenario c the water would be treated so it can be drunk directly from the tap however the water supply would continue being interrupted with the same frequency if the project is approved bid will be added to your monthly water bill to install operate and maintain the new water system keep in mind that the additional money paid in your water bill will not be available of other needs at your home such as food clothing etc would you vote in favor of or against the project in cv studies the hypothetical nature of the valuation question can lead to a bias in stated wtp to address hypothetical biases we elicited respondents certainty levels regarding their answer to the cv question using a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 meant completely uncertain and 10 completely certain researchers use the certainty question to reduce the hypothetical bias and obtain more accurate wtp estimates 29 58 60 61 found that the certainty question was more effective than other methods for estimating actual wtp values 5 analytical framework and econometric modeling the cv method is based on a utility theoretic framework we keep the discussion of that framework to a minimum as it has been extensively discussed in previous studies 34 81 and haab et al 2020 provide detailed descriptions of the theoretic foundations of the cv method and 29 present an application of that framework to improvements of piped water services in the context of this study the indirect utility of a household v is a function of household income y attributes of water services w and prices of other goods p i e v y w p the framework assumes that households derive utility from improvements in system reliability and water quality and that income decreases reduce utility levels hence the maximum amount that a household will pay for improved water services wtp is equivalent to the income loss that would take their utility back to the original level after improving the service denoting status quo conditions with a 0 subscript and improved conditions with a 1 subscript the compensating welfare measure of benefits derived from service improvements i e wtp is usually defined using the indirect utility function v 0 y w 0 p 0 v 1 y wtp w 1 p 0 by solving for wtp from that utility equivalence one observes that wtp is a function of the individual s income the service improvement and prices of other goods our split sample design allows for scope and part whole tests given that scenario a encompasses both scenarios b and c i e b a c a we can implement a scope test regarding the hypothesis that households wtp for simultaneous improvements of system reliability and water quality is greater than households wtp for improvements in one of those attributes alone i e wtpa wtpb wtpa wtpc additionally because scenario a is a combination of scenarios b and c i e a b c we can compare the wtp for improvements of system reliability and water quality estimated as a whole wtpa versus estimating it as the addition of the wtp for each part of the improvement wtpb wtpc the part whole test depends on how households perceive the relationship between system reliability and water quality 62 63 if system reliability and water quality are considered to be independent then wtpa wtpb wtpc in the case that they are seen as substitutes then wtpa wtpb wtpc conversely wtpa wtpb wtpc when system reliability and water quality are considered to complement each other 57 therefore our split sample design allows for investigating the nature of the relationship between system reliability and water quality from a consumer perspective from an empirical perspective the wtp function can be modeled using a linear or a log linear specification see ref 28 however the log linear model is preferred over the linear specification because it ensures having non negative wtp estimates conversely the linear model may yield negative wtp estimates which is inconsistent with the utility theoretic framework haab et al 2020 in our empirical approach we assume that households wtp for the proposed water service improvements follows a log linear specification 1 l n w t p x β ε where lnwtp represents the natural logarithm of the maximum amount that the household is willing to pay x is a vector of covariates including indicators on split sample scenarios β is a vector of coefficients to be estimated and ε is a stochastic error term that depicts unobservable covariates note that prices of other goods are excluded l n p r 1 p r α l n b i d x δ e from vector x because there is no variation in prices across respondents in the referendum format the maximum wtp is not directly observed hence an alternative estimation procedure is needed to analyze responses to the referendum cv question following cameron 1988 lnwtp can be indirectly identified using the equivalence between the probability of being willing to pay for the proposed improvement and the probability that lnwtp is greater than the natural logarithm of the bid presented in the contingent scenario i e pr yes pr lnwtp lnbid consequently the probability of a positive response to the cv question pr can be modeled using a logit specification 2 l n p r 1 p r α l n b i d x δ e where α and δ are coefficients to be determined using a maximum likelihood estimation approach under the assumption that the stochastic error term e follows a logistic distribution table 1 presents the variables included in vector x the variable lnbid is included to investigate the effect of the additional payment on the likelihood of voting in favor of the proposed water project according to our theoretical framework we expect this effect to be negative because such payment would reduce income available for other goods and services two indicators reliable and quality were included to depict differentials among our split sample scenarios reliable takes the value of one if the respondent was presented with an improvement in system reliability without improving water quality i e scenario b quality takes the value of one in the opposite case i e scenario c both indicators are equal to zero for respondents who were presented with simultaneous improvements in system reliability and water quality i e scenario a given that scenario a is the base for comparison we expect both reliable and quality to have a negative effect on the likelihood of voting for the proposed project our theoretical framework also indicates that wtp for improved services is a function of household income therefore we included the variable income to test the hypothesis that the likelihood of voting for the proposed project increases with household income additionally following 43 we included the binary indicator consequential to investigate whether respondents who believe that our survey could have policy implications would be more likely to vote for the proposed project finally as in previous studies on preferences for improved water services e g refs 11 28 29 32 33 38 we explored several variables as controls for heterogeneity among respondents including sex age number of years living in the study site home ownership number of rooms in the home household size number of hours in a week with water supply and two indices depicting consumer satisfaction with system reliability and water quality based on pseudo r 2 coefficients akaike aic and bayesian bic information criteria and the statistical significance of corresponding coefficients education was the only control variable in the model that best fits our data household wtp for improved services can be calculated using the α and δ coefficients estimated in equation 2 specifically median household wtp for improved water services can be calculated as follows 34 3 m e d i a n w t p e x δ ˆ α ˆ where x is a vector of the average of covariates δ ˆ represents the estimated coefficients of covariates other than the bid proposed in the contingent scenario and α ˆ is the coefficient of lnbid median wtp for specific improvements can be estimated by setting the corresponding indicator to the appropriate levels 34 given our modeling approach we estimate the median wtp for concurrent improvements of service reliability and water quality by setting the indicators reliable and quality equal to zero when reliable is equal to one and quality equal to zero equation 3 yields the median wtp for improving service continuity only similarly the median wtp for improvements of water quality is estimated when quality is equal to one while keeping reliable at zero in addition to using the original responses to the referendum question we used responses to the follow up certainty question to recode positive voting responses as negative ones if the respondent s certainty level was below seven model 2 or eight model 3 on a scale varying from one to 10 then the recoded responses are used to estimate equations 2 and 3 29 followed a similar approach to correct for voting response uncertainty and thus mitigate potential hypothetical biases as 58 shows this approach allows for estimating more conservative and arguably more accurate wtp estimates 6 survey and estimation results table 2 provides an average profile of our respondents a majority of respondents were female this is presumably because we conducted interviews during business hours when males are more likely to be at work nonetheless our sample was more gender balanced than recent studies on wtp for improved water services in developing countries e g refs 33 37 the average respondent was approximately 42 years old had 12 years of schooling had lived in the sampled home for almost 12 years and had been a resident of santa cruz for more than 25 years the average household had four members and a monthly income of 1720 almost 67 of the sampled households owned their home each of which has an average of six rooms our sample is similar in years of schooling to the most recent census of all the galápagos islands 45 but with higher household size 4 vs 3 members and home ownership 66 7 vs 48 4 these differentials can be partially explained by different population dynamics of santa cruz relative to the other galápagos islands in the archipelago santa cruz is the most populated island and the one with the most rapid annual population growth at 2 4 which is 0 6 points above the average population growth in all the galápagos islands 45 the age of the average respondent is also higher than the population average 41 7 vs 29 3 years of age which was expected given that we intentionally interviewed adults despite these few differences we are confident that our sample is representative of the population of santa cruz given our stratified random sampling strategy and that we sampled almost 19 of the housing units served by the water utility our survey results provide an overview of the current conditions of water services and practices that households adopt to cope with poor service conditions see table 3 the average household received tap water almost every day during the week but for less than 3 h per day a small percentage of households reported low water pressure 7 1 under these conditions it is not surprising that all households stored water at home fig 2 shows the type of water storage devices that households used to store water cisterns and roof tanks were the most popular devices used by a majority of households households that used those devices invested an average of 603 in roof tanks and 3627 in cisterns table 3 also shows some household practices related to water quality none of the sampled households consumed tap water without treating it at home and only few households treated tap water at home to drink 13 conversely a majority of households consumed bottled water more than 90 the average household consumed more than four 20l carboys large bottles of water in a week on which they spent more than 8 in total we also elicited levels of consumer satisfaction with different water service attributes fig 3 respondents were equally divided in terms of their satisfaction with attributes related to system reliability i e daily service hours and water pressure in contrast approximately 94 were unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with the quality of their tap water more than 91 of respondents also showed some dissatisfaction with the flavor of tap water and a majority was not satisfied with other aesthetic attributes such as color and smell of tap water consistent with consumer satisfaction levels fig 4 indicates that approximately 89 of respondents believed that improving water quality should be the water utility s priority overall these results indicate public concern with the quality of tap water in puerto ayora given that households are dissatisfied with current water services the incumbent question is whether they are willing to pay for improved services to address that question we estimated logit models of the probability of voting in favor of the proposed water service improvements equation 2 which we then used to compute wtp estimates using equation 3 given that the magnitude of logit coefficients are difficult to interpret in table 4 we show the marginal effects of corresponding covariates on the probability of voting for the project proposed in the cv scenario based on estimation results of three logit models the specification of model 1 is the one that best fit our data based on pseudo r2 coefficients aic and bic 6 6 we assessed different control variables including the respondent s sex age number of years living in our study site home ownership number of rooms in the home household size number of hours in a week with water supply and two indices depicting consumer satisfaction with system reliability and water quality we also control for fixed effects of geographical areas used to stratify our sample none of them was statistically significant moreover goodness of fit measures aic and bic suggest that models including those statistically insignificant factors were less suitable than the parsimonious model specification shown in table 4 we then estimated models 2 and 3 with favorable responses recoded as negative when certainty levels were below 7 model 2 and 8 model 3 out of a 1 10 scale estimated coefficients on lnbid were negative and statistically significant this indicates that respondents are sensitive to increases in the water bill indicators reliable and quality are also negative and significant suggesting that there are some wtp differentials among our split sample scenarios compared to the scenario where both system reliability and water quality were improved respondents were less likely to support only continuous supply without improving water quality scenario b similarly the scenario where only water quality was improved scenario c received less support than the scenario of continuous supply of safe drinking water results also indicate that the likelihood of voting for the proposed project would decrease with an additional year of schooling by about eight percentage points although this effect is statistically significant only at the 10 level consistent with our theoretical framework the effect of household income is positive and statistically significant at the 1 level based on the estimated coefficient of income in model 1 the probability of voting for the proposed water improvements increase by 4 8 points with an increase in income of 500 finally respondents who believed that our survey could have policy implications were 21 points more likely to vote for the proposed service improvement than those who believed otherwise we followed equation 3 to compute the median household wtp for each service improvement in scenarios a b and c at the average of income education and consequential the indicators reliable and quality are set to the appropriate value to reproduce each scenario fig 5 a shows confidence intervals for the median wtp for continuous supply of safe drinking water i e scenario a which we computed using the delta method based on model 1 median wtp was approximately 87 per month estimates corrected for response uncertainty i e based on model 2 and model 3 indicate that the median household would pay about 36 or 15 for continuous supply of safe drinking water depending on the level of certainty correction these estimates are more conservative and presumably more accurate 58 wtp estimates for scenario b i e continuous water supply without improving water quality are statistically insignificant fig 5b suggesting that households would not pay for system reliability if water quality is not improved as well conversely fig 5 c shows that households are willing to pay for safe drinking water even if water services continue being interrupted the median household would pay about 26 monthly for improving water quality wtp estimates corrected for voting response certainty are at 4 75 or 2 depending on the certainty correction 7 discussion and conclusions we implemented a contingent valuation survey to investigate household preferences for improved water services in santa cruz the most populated island in the galápagos archipelago ecuador currently the system supplies brackish water for less than 3 h per day our survey results indicate that households are dissatisfied with current water services and cope with unreliable services by storing water at home and consuming bottled water we followed a split sample approach to estimate households wtp for three types of service improvement 1 eliminating service interruptions 2 making tap water safe to drink and 3 improving both system reliability and water quality concurrently wtp estimates suggest that households are indifferent about improvements of service reliability unless water quality is improved as well this may be explained by the fact that all households have already invested in expensive infrastructure to store water at home e g roof tanks and cisterns given that households have significant water storage capacity increasing the number of daily hours with water services without improving water quality was not sufficient for them to pay an additional fee in contrast the median household would pay almost 26 for safe drinking water even if it were not continuously provided this wtp estimate is below current household expenditures on bottled water that amount to more than 35 in a month households wtp increases when both service reliability and water quality are improved the estimated wtp for continuous supply of safe drinking water is almost 87 month this wtp estimate is higher than current household expenditures on adaptive measures which suggests that the wtp estimate may be affected by hypothetical bias thus we rely on the wtp estimate corrected for 70 certainty regarding voting responses this estimate indicates that the median household would pay an increase in the water bill of approximately 36 month it is worth noting that the conservative wtp estimate for continuous supply of safe drinking water is greater than the wtp estimate for single improvements in water quality and system reliability that is our estimates show evidence of sensitivity to scope for nested goods 56 moreover the conservative wtp estimate for continuous supply of safe drinking water is greater than the sum of both wtp estimates for single improvements i e wtpa wtpb wtpc this indicates that service reliability and water quality are complements in the eyes of water consumers 57 based on these results we recommend that future valuation studies consider potential complementarity or substitutability among household preferences for different attributes from a policy perspective our estimates are a monetary measure of the benefits that households would derive from continuous access to drinking water which can be compared with the cost of improving water services in santa cruz according to ecuadorian legislation memorandum senagua sapys 2 2016 0214 m the average household of four should be provided with 24 cubic meters of water in a month 200 l per person per day in order to meet the growing water demand over the next 30 years according to ref 51 the water company epmapasc will need to invest in a seawater desalination plant new pipes water meters and leak control systems based on their cost estimate of 2 17 per cubic meter of water which includes financing operation and maintenance costs providing the average household with the minimum legally required amount of potable water would cost 52 per month hence the proposed increase of 36 in the water would be insufficient to cover supply costs there could also be some concerns about the affordability of a new water tariff of 41 36 increase from the current rate of 5 although the new tariff would remain below the affordability threshold of 3 at 2 4 of the average monthly household income reported by our sample 40 of the sampled households would surpass that threshold and 15 would be paying more than 5 of their monthly income to address this issue epmapasc could use our wtp estimates by income brackets shown in appendix b to design a differentiated pricing structure if water users can be classified in terms of their household income 7 7 in the context of our study it may be difficult to design an income based differential pricing mechanism because many people work in the informal sector in ecuador it is estimated that 60 of workers are in the informal sector 72 for instance projections based on model 2 suggest that households earning 500 or less would be willing to pay an increase of about 14 in their water bill and those in the following income bracket 501 1000 would pay an increase of approximately 19 50 those water fees would be lower than current monthly expenditures on bottled water which amount to 24 for households in the first income bracket 500 or less and 31 for households in the second bracket 501 1000 additionally it may be unreasonable to expect that every water user will pay the proposed increase in water bills currently outstanding payments account for approximately 16 of the total water bill consequently epmapasc operates with significant financial deficits which are covered with municipal transfers under these circumstances alternative sources of revenue may be required to finance improved water services much of the demand increase that drives the need for additional supply comes from tourism increasing the visitor entrance fee could be one of those revenue sources according to ref 35 tourists would be willing to make a one time payment of 45 to support improvements in local water services enough to pay for the production of 20 cubic meters of water future studies can estimate the water footprint of tourist and determine whether an increase in the visitor entrance fee would be an adequate tool to subsidize local water service improvements funding we acknowledge

8678,reforms in irrigation management can make important contributions to reducing irrigation water scarcity this paper attempts to examine the role of participatory irrigation management pim in farmers mulched drip irrigation technology adoption decisions it is based on a comparative analysis between government promoted mulched drip irrigation technology gmdit and localized self governed mulched drip irrigation technology lmdit in rural xinjiang china data from a survey conducted in 2017 across 739 households covering 1763 plots in awati county in xinjiang were used to estimate a nested logit model the results indicate that pim induces farmers to switch from traditional flood irrigation technology to gmdit but does not promote the adoption of lmdit we conclude that promoting pim can make an important contribution to more sustainable water use in this drought prone area but that the self governance of localized irrigation systems requires more attention by local governments keywords technology adoption participatory irrigation management mulched drip irrigation rural xinjiang 1 introduction the agriculture sector is the largest consumer of water with a share of water consumption of over 70 globally 1 due to the impact of increasing climate change industrialization and water pollution the irrigation water shortage is expected to become more serious 2 3 china is no exception particularly in its arid and semi arid northwest regions figures show that the annual water availability in northwest china is only 750 m3 per capita which is far below the world s 1000 m3 water scarcity threshold 4 to address growing irrigation water scarcity substantial emphasis has been given to advanced and innovative irrigation techniques 5 6 mulched drip irrigation technology mdit 1 1 mdit refers to an irrigation method that conveys water to plants through pipes and emitters under a low operating pressure with a cover of plastic mulch on or below the soil surface 10 this technique combines the advantages of both drip technology and plastic film mulch 16 has the potential to increase crop yields to provide farmers with improved water application and to benefit the environment by reducing soil erosion 7 thus mdit is widely encouraged as a viable adaptation strategy to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change 1 however despite the widespread efforts that have been made to promote mdit in developing regions its actual adoption rate is low 8 10 numerous studies have documented the factors influencing the innovation diffusion of mdit generally the identified factors consist of three categories namely farm and farm household characteristics such as farm size age education socioeconomic factors such as extension service and information 11 social network 4 12 13 and institutional factors such as water price water right and water management 10 although most of the existing studies mainly focus on the first two categories 14 the analysis on the substantial role of the institutional management factor in mdit diffusion has been increasingly highlighted see e g ref 7 15 16 effective water management can not only promote the diffusion of innovative irrigation technologies but also limit or even eliminate its undesirable rebound effects the participatory irrigation management pim approach has been the focus of water management reforms pim refers to the responsibilities of local irrigation related issues e g water fee collection and water allocation and to the transfer of power over irrigation issue decision making from government authorities to water users and or groups of farmers 17 this approach stems from the rationale that the top down approach developed by government bureaucracies lacks the incentives to optimize management 18 comparatively pim provides farmers with significant incentives to enhance and sustain management efficiency and further improve the use of innovative water saving irrigation technology 16 19 despite the numerous analyses that have been conducted to investigate the influencing factors of mdit the role of pim in mdit diffusion has received insufficient attention the objective of this analysis is to investigate the role of pim in mdit diffusion among cotton farmers particularly focusing on its different impacts on two specific irrigation technologies i e localized self governed mdit lmdit and government promoted mdit gmdit the relevant findings and implications are expected to provide useful insights for framing policies aimed at improving irrigation management strategies that facilitate coping with water scarcity we attempt to contribute to the empirical literature in three respects first it adds to the scarce literature on the impact of pim on mdit adoption in arid and semi arid rural regions an exception is the recent study by ref 20 their study descriptively analyses the relationship between village based water users associations wua and mdit in northern china and uses regression analysis to examine the determinants of smallholders participation in wua and mdit unfortunately their study does not examine the impact of participation in wua a form of pim on farmers mdit adoption decisions therefore our analysis provides direct empirical evidence on the impact of pim on mdit second this study examines two types of mdit gmdit and lmdit the existing literature focuses on the analysis of gmdit however pim may provide adoption incentives that differ significantly between gmdit and lmdit 2 2 the different impacts of pim on gmdit and lmdit are discussed in subsection 2 3 third the available studies in the agricultural technology literature tend to treat the adoption variable as a categorical variable and apply multinomial probit logit models 21 22 in contrast to the previous work we estimate a nested logit model which accounts for the correlation among different types of irrigation decisions and represents patterns of substitution among correlated mdit choices relative to the standard multinomial logit approach the nested logit approach relaxes the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives and allows us to capture the dissimilarities among different technologies the remaining parts of the present study are structured as follows section 2 presents theoretical consideration of the impacts of pim on mdit based on a critical synthesis of the literature section 3 introduces the empirical model of mdit choices within the expected utility framework section 4 introduces the research area and the dataset the variables included in the empirical analysis are defined and the estimation strategy is discussed in section 5 the estimation results robustness check results and discussion are presented the conclusions are presented in the final section 2 theoretical consideration of pim and mdit 2 1 previous research there is a long tradition of empirical research that seeks to examine the factors that impact farmers adoption of drip irrigation in the areas of rural sociology and agricultural economics generally the past numerous studies have mainly been documented according to distinct lines of research such as sociology economics psychology agriculture extension and marketing 4 regarding factors affecting farmers adoption decisions no consensus has been reached as factors are usually context specific 23 24 for instance sociologists highlight the characteristics of potential adopters and leading farmers 10 their perception of water scarcity 25 26 and the social network and communication involved in the different stages of the irrigation technology diffusion process 27 28 in contrast economists concentrate specifically on economic variables such as the relevant costs and profits crop yield and water productivity in the context of irrigation technology adoption 29 others emphasize the crucial role of institutional factors such as cooperation among farmers water prices property rights irrigation management systems and subsidies 4 10 30 31 the same applies to the specific notion of mdit adoption decisions by farmers crucial determinants identified by empirical analysis include farmers demographics water and land resource endowments field size the availability of water geographical factors farm location economic factors water fee increased yield and revenue risk exposure and uncertainties such as drought and institution water price or water policy 32 34 notably more recently the importance of irrigation management particularly pim has been increasingly highlighted in drip irrigation technology studies 35 36 it has been documented that poor irrigation management does not encourage innovative irrigation technology application pim approaches can facilitate farmer s enthusiasm to switch from traditional irrigation approaches to adopt innovative techniques 32 for instance the results from ref 37 suggest that the application of advanced irrigation technologies requires improved irrigation management efficiency similarly 38 39 state that increasing the adoption rate of advanced irrigation techniques in rural china largely depends on the effectiveness of local water management systems following the previous research and in light of the essential role of pim in mdit diffusion the following discussion sheds additional light on the influencing channels of pim on mdit particularly focusing on the different impacts of pim on gmdit and lmdit 2 2 impacting mechanism of pim on mdit in this study we distinguish among three major channels through which pim might affect farmers mdit adoption decisions information advantage social support and social network first the participatory approach implies that local water users are involved in relevant water management issues such as water allocation irrigation timing and frequency facility maintenance water fee collection and extension support 7 the sharing of transparent management relevant information through pim makes water managers more accountable in irrigation facility maintenance and results in more reliable water provision 15 furthermore the close involvement of water users creates information advantages which ensures that users have more knowledge to help them recognize water signs of scarcity and to adopt innovative irrigation technologies 3 3 for instance the timing and frequency of water application are two important factors to be considered before implementing mdit because supplemental irrigation is needed particularly during critical growth periods in arid and semi arid regions 7 last the application of mdit is usually complex and requires professional training 11 40 thus mdit is considered to be a risky investment due to imperfect technology knowledge 4 41 from this perspective technology targeted training can further strengthen the information advantage of farmers involved in pim second participatory approaches can foster social support from governments for the implementation of mdit programmes specifically participatory approaches take into account the needs experiences and perceptions of local water users through intensive interactions between state agencies and local water users 7 close interactions allow a better translation of the demands for governmental services by local water users and can therefore enhance the social support for the application of mdit more importantly social support can facilitate the resolution of conflicts and problems in irrigation technology practices third interactions between local water users village collectives and governments facilitate the development of social network that can stimulate the adoption of mdit specifically participants can build new networks through technology training management meeting discussions and other forms of interaction in the joint management of irrigation water resources social networks play a crucial role in diffusing mdit because they have a significant social learning effect in mdit diffusion 28 in other words the adoption of mdit by a small number of farmers will spread among others through social networks if the social learning is effective 2 3 different impacts on gmdit and lmdit before further discussing the different impacts of pim on gmdit and lmdit it is necessary to distinguish these two technologies first a big difference is that gmdit is a top down government promoted technology programme implemented in a relatively large region within a village thus its diffusion is usually carried out by village collectives lmdit is a localized self governed project implemented among small groups of farmers with traditions of long term use second both surface water and groundwater can be used as water resource for gmdit and lmdit in our research area the choice of applying surface water or groundwater is largely exogenous 42 the availability of surface water and ground water mainly depends on the water supply from local water stations and access to wells respectively in practice gmdit uses both surface water and groundwater as water resources drawn from collective wells comparatively lmdit mainly uses groundwater drawn from private wells in this regard there are significant differences in the average irrigation costs and labour inputs between these two technologies on the one hand governments are responsible for installing the main and branch pipes and drilling wells for gmdit adopters through subsidies in comparison lmdit adopters must be able to afford these costs by themselves on the other hand the use of gmdit imposes labour input constraints by requiring fixed frequency and timing of irrigation schedules while the labour input in the lmdit application is more flexible 4 4 the average irrigation cost and labour input is 302 65 rmb and 11 49 days per year per mu respectively for gmdit users which is 421 87 rmb and 17 19 days per year per mu for lmdit users thus in the estimation models two alternative specific variables average cost and labour input were introduced to capture the possible impacts on specific irrigation technology decisions third our field observation shows that there is no significant gap in crop yield and revenue among farmers using different mdits despite the potential advantages for the two types of mdits in saving water the use of mdits poses a risk of leading to land salinization problems compared to traditional flood irrigation technologies we expect that the impacts of pim on gmdit are different from the impacts of pim on lmdit according to the three channels mentioned above first lmdit is relatively more compatible with local context than gmdit because it is a self governed project this implies that lmdit is a better matched practice with a higher level of physical consistency of innovative technique along with farmers temporal conditions particularly in terms of the knowledge and resource structure in this regard the triggering impact of technology switch by pim through an information advantage channel is less significant on lmdit than on gmdit second it has been found that the policy decisions made by state agencies alone are unlikely to be successful 43 44 instead the success of such governmental programmes usually requires bureaucrats and farmer groups to develop the capacity to collaborate in the joint management of irrigation resources 45 given that more water users and other stakeholders e g water managers village leaders local government officials are involved in gmdit implementation and that more potential conflicts may occur 11 social support is much more important for implementing gmdit compared to lmdit therefore the impact of pim through social support channels is expected to be greater for gmdit than for lmdit third social network connections have been identified as creditable for community based new technology extension 13 28 the extension supports for gmdit depend on a larger social network i e village community based social network while lmdit depends on a smaller social network among a small group of farmers therefore the impact of pim through social network channels is expected to be greater on gmdit than on lmdit 3 empirical model of mdit choices according to the expected utility framework originally proposed by ref 46 the adoption of a new technology results from the comparison of utilities derived from different alternatives in our case farmers choose the irrigation technology on their plots that maximizes the net benefit obtained from cotton production on the plots farmers have three alternative irrigation approaches gmdit lmdit and flooding irrigation a multinomial logit model is usually appropriate for the case with the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives iia however this is not the case because gmdit and lmdit are close substitutes for farmers adoption of irrigation technologies the nested logit model is a generalization of the multinomial or mcfadden s conditional logit model relative to a single stage technique such as the multinomial logit the nested logit framework relaxes the assumption of iia 5 5 iia property holds only within the nests but not necessarily across the nests and allows us to model dissimilarities among different decisions the practical significance is that in a nested logit the alternatives grouped into the same nest i e gmdit and lmdit are allowed to be closer substitutes we build on the models of 47 48 and modify their approach for the two level nesting structure the top level shows the irrigation type choice mdit and flood irrigation and the bottom level shows technology type choice gmdit and lmdit in practice a farmer generally chooses the technology type gmdit or lmdit and irrigation type mdit or flood irrigation simultaneously by partitioning the mdit choice we do not assume that the choice is made sequentially the two level decision tree of irrigation technology choice by a farmer is shown in fig 1 below let b nij represent the nth farmer s net benefit from choosing irrigation type i and technology type j the farmer will choose the ijth alternative if b n i j b n k i k a n d j l k is another irrigation type and l is another technology type we do not know the farmer s preferences but observe the farmers characteristics and the attributes of the technology type therefore we can decompose the farmer s benefit into an observed component v nij and an unobserved component ε nij that is 1 b n i j v n i j ε n i j we assume that the random errors ε nij are distributed extreme values and are uncorrelated across nests but not within nests suppose that the farmer chooses among i 1 t irrigation type and j 1 c technology type for each irrigation type there is a subset of technology types 6 6 in our case there are two types of technologies gmdit and lmdit for the mulched drip irrigation type however there is only one technology for flood irrigation type let us denote this set of technologies c i for each irrigation type i we can write the probability of observing the adoption of choice ij as the joint probability as follows 2 p i j e v i j i t j c i e v i j although irrigation type and technology type may be jointly determined ultimately we can isolate irrigation type from the joint probability of adopting a technology irrigation type pair by decomposing the joint probability into a conditional and marginal probability decomposing the joint probability in equation 2 leads to the nested logit model and significantly simplifies the estimation of the joint probability 49 we specify v ij as 3 v i j α i j z β x i j η i w γ y i where z is a vector of observed individual characteristics that affect the technology irrigation choice x ij is a vector of observed attributes of the irrigation technology ij w is a vector of individual characteristics affecting irrigation type and y i is a vector of attributes affecting irrigation type i thus our model estimates irrigation type and technology type by incorporating individual characteristics and technology attributes the coefficients of individual characteristics vary across technology choices however the coefficients for technology attributes do not the joint probability of choosing irrigation type i and adopting technology type j given in equation 2 can be written as 4 p i j p j i p i where 5 p j i e α j i z β x j i j c i e α j i z β x j i and c i is the set of technology type with irrigation type i j 1 c the marginal probability of taking irrigation type i is 6 p i e η i w γ y j c i e α j i z β x j i i t e η i w γ y j c i e α j i z β x j i defining an inclusive value for each irrigation type i as 7 i i ln j c i e α j i z β x j i we can express equation 6 more concisely as 8 p i e η i w γ y i τ i i i t e η i w γ y i τ i i where t is the choice of the two irrigation types mdit or flood irrigation the inclusive value i i explicitly links the irrigation choice in the first level to the technology choice in the bottom level the coefficient τ is a measure of independence among the choices in the nest given by the ith irrigation choice and the statistic 1 τ is a measure of correlation in order to achieve the objectives of the paper we introduce pim and other observed individual characteristics in vector z and technology specific variables in the vector x ij in equation 3 in our case it is very difficult to find observed individual characteristics and irrigation type relevant attributes that affect irrigation type mdit or flood irrigation but do not affect technology type gmdit or lmdit we therefore exclude w and y i from equation 3 in the empirical analysis 4 data and estimation strategy 4 1 research site our research site see fig 2 below is situated in awati county aksu prefecture in the southwest of xinjiang neighbouring the northern edge of the taklimakan desert the second largest desert in the world this region is characteristic of a warm temperature continental desert climate the mean annual temperature throughout xinjiang has been increasing since the mid 1980s and it is predicted to continue with intensified global warming in the future 50 the annual mean precipitation is less than 150 mm in xinjiang i e 23 of the average of 630 mm in china as a whole and it rarely exceeds 50 mm in the south 51 52 the mean annual pan evaporation between 1000 and 4500 mm in xinjiang is much stronger than in other locations at the same latitude in china between 500 and 3500 mm 51 in the south part the annual evaporation usually exceeds 2200 mm the agricultural production depends heavily on irrigation and has been confronting an increasingly water shortage in recent years 53 several programmes have been promoted in recent years to handle the irrigation scarcity one of the most important programmes is the gmdit programme for cotton production which has been in operation since 2006 in akesu this project aims at establishing 267 ha of core demonstration site for cotton production with the application of gmdit within awati county financial assistance of 12 06 million rmb from the automatic governance region government was transferred to the county government as a subsidy to support the programme in 2014 it is estimated that the area equipped for gmdit is 3 73 million hectares accounting for approximately 41 of the total irrigated cotton area in awati county 4 2 data collection the dataset used for the empirical analysis was obtained from a rural household survey conducted in awati county held in february 2017 the main purpose was to investigate the relationship between irrigation water management reform and water use efficiency in the context of intensified climate change a multiple stratified sampling strategy was used for selecting the households by excluding one township located in the suburb area with very limited farmers we first selected the rest of seven townships in the county seventeen villages were randomly selected based on a roster of all villages in each township notably the number of villages chosen in each township was based on the total number of villages and village heterogeneity in terms of land and population size economic development geographic location household respondents within each village were randomly selected from a list with household names in each village and on average 12 of households in each village were interviewed similar to the village sampling strategy the household sample rate is also different among villages depending on household level economic development land endowment and geographical location of homeset in total 774 households were interviewed out of these households 35 indicated that they are not involved in farmland cultivation and were therefore excluded from the analysis in addition to household level information we collected plot level information including the irrigation situation soil salinization perception soil type land type contracted land or wasteland 7 7 in xinjiang there are two types of cultivated land contracted land is assigned following the implementation of the household responsibility system in the 1970s wasteland is reclaimed from desert land or grassland that can be developed by farm households or local government 24 and plot area because households usually cultivate many plots it is a very time consuming task to collect information for all plots we therefore collected information for a maximum of four plots per household two of the largest contracted plots and two of the largest wasteland plots this resulted in a household survey data set with information for 739 households and 1763 plots with mdit applied on 837 plots detailed information on field irrigation management used in cotton production the fixed costs of using gmdit and lmdit participation in village level irrigation management land endowments and demographic characteristics in 2016 were collected using a standardized structured questionnaire complemented by village level data obtained from the respective village committees 4 3 variable definition and summary statistics tables 1 and 2 report the definitions and descriptive statistics of the dependent variables and six groups of explanatory variables respectively irrigation technology choice the main dependent variables are dummy variables reflecting the plot level adoption of mdit the adoption rate of mdit is 0 48 with gmdit adoption equalling 0 30 and lmdit adoption equalling 0 18 for the plots in our sample participatory irrigation management farmers involvement in pim in china mainly includes the process of the foundation of the system the selection of the manager the attendance of regular management meetings 54 rule setting and enforcement 54 55 our field observations show that individual farmers are rarely involved in the specific procedures of the foundation of pim systems in our research area we therefore use two dummy variables as proxies of pim i e farmers participation in the selection of the head manager pim1 and participation in meetings concerning the discussion of relevant irrigation management rule making pim2 furthermore we introduce five groups of control variables in our empirical specification the characteristics of land parcel household village regional dummy variables and alternative specific variables land parcel characteristics are used to capture the effects of environmental conditions and farm attributes 3 they include timely irrigation soil salinization perception soil type distance to a channel land type and plot area it is expected that farmers experiencing problems with timely receipt of irrigation water have a greater probability of adopting mdit to lower the loss of water shortage induced crop production saline and sandy soils are poor soil types for which farmers are less likely to adopt innovative technology 56 average plot distance from the field to the irrigation channel and land type are used as indicators of the availability of surface water the former is also included to capture the impact of irrigation infrastructure 57 plots located further away from an irrigation canal generally receive less water wasteland is usually located in remote areas and therefore receives less surface water than contracted land 24 a larger plot area means a greater risk of loss due to water shortages and a higher demand to adopt water saving irrigation technology 58 regarding household characteristics the age and the education of the household head are proxies for experience and management ability 59 older household heads tend to have more agricultural management experience and are not reliable with regard to innovative technology thus they are less likely to adopt mdit 4 educated farmers are more likely to be able to handle the technical issues related to mdit and are therefore more likely to adopt it 10 uyghur ethnicity is used to reflect potential differences in mdit adoption between the uyghur and the han ethnic groups household wealth is used to control for heterogeneity in economic and social power among households 33 wealthy households have fewer financial capital constraints and are more likely to invest in advanced irrigation techniques households with more labourers can spend more time on field irrigation management farmers with a relatively high risk preference are more likely to adopt innovative technologies 57 and they are therefore are more likely to adopt lmdit with greater risk village characteristics consist of the distance between the village and the nearest town centre and the number of wells in the village the distance to the town centre is used as an indicator of market access the number of wells is a proxy for groundwater availability as well as village level irrigation infrastructure 8 a large number of wells in a village means relatively high groundwater use and may contribute to groundwater resource depletion farmers are expected to respond by adopting mdit for a larger number of wells particularly adopting lmdit because it relies more on underground water six regional dummy variables township dummy variables were introduced to control for the unobserved effects of agro ecological conditions that differ systematically among the seven townships the alternative specific variables used for adopting the three irrigation technologies gmdit lmdit and flooding irrigation in the estimation models consist of the average cost and labour input they are measured by the per unit land area of average costs and labour input in technology use respectively the average cost and labour input can be classified as alternative specific variables because their values change according to farmers selections of different irrigation technologies unfortunately we could collect data only for the alternatives that actually occurred following 60 we assume that the calculated average cost and labour input for each technology can be considered as the opportunity costs of giving up other technology choices 8 8 the information on the costs and labour input for three technologies was collected by asking village cadres this investigation is at the village level because the opportunity costs for using one technology are very similar within the same village but tend to vary among villages 4 4 estimation strategy one possible concern is that there may be an endogeneity problem stemming from reverse causality and or missing unobserved factors in estimating the impact of pim on mdit adoption decisions on contributions to pim may partly depend on the type of irrigation technology that is used moreover mdit adoption decisions may be correlated with some unobserved factors such as informal institutions that also influence the pim practice we use control function to address this problem by introducing three instrumental variables ivs specifically the number of temporary cadres assigned to live in the village 9 9 to increase village governance efficiency and stabilize rural social security some public servants from higher level governments are temporarily assigned to work as village cadres in rural xinjiang their main responsibility is to investigate the living standards of households to disseminate agricultural policy information and to provide agricultural training through close interactions with local farmers a dummy variable measuring whether the village has received irrigation management documents such as documents on irrigation rules and canal usage and maintenance from higher level authorities and the number of mosques in the village the definitions of three instrumental variables are also reported in table 1 we assume that these three instruments are correlated with farmers participation in pim but do not directly affect mdit adoption decisions first the duty of temporary cadres is to improve village governance efficiency and maintain rural social security and is thus expected to have a strong correlation with farmers participation in pim these duties are unlikely to have a direct effect on individual field irrigation decisions second irrigation management documents from higher authorities are expected to strongly affect farmers participation in pim however there is no reason to expect that they affect individual field irrigation decisions in a similar vein 61 used upper level government documents as an instrumental variable for village choices of wuas third informal institutions may affect the active participation of farmers in village level irrigation management 50 we use the number of mosques in a village as an indicator of a major relevant informal institution in the region which is expected to affect pim but is unlikely to directly affect farmers adoption decisions of mdit it may be argued that religion also plays a role in technology adoption the islam doctrine particularly section 71 in chapter vii and section 60 in chapter 56 in the koran prescribes that individuals should conserve water resource and protect the environment however during our field investigation in 2017 we observed that religion plays a major role in household affairs such as marriage and death but not in agricultural production activities in our research area to handle the endogeneity of farmers participation status in pim a combination of the two stage conditional maximum likelihood 2scml method 10 10 in a traditional two stage instrumental variable regression the predicted value of the endogenous variable obtained from the first stage is introduced into the second stage however the results may be biased and inconsistent when both the dependent variable and the endogenous variable are discrete 63 2scml has been identified as an appropriate method to address such an endogeneity problem by refs 24 62 proposed by ref 62 63 with a nested logit model is used in our empirical analysis in the first stage we conduct a linear regression with all the exogenous variables m n and instruments i n to explain the participation status p n model 9 and to obtain its predicted residual values p ˆ n in the second stage both the obtained residuals p ˆ n and the original variable p n are simultaneously introduced into the nested logit regression to explain choices of gmdit and lmdit model 10 9 p n β 0 β 1 i n β 2 m n ε 1 10 a n r 0 r 1 p n r 2 p ˆ n r 3 z n r 4 x i j ε 2 where p n denotes the status of pim for the nth household a n measures the nth household s choice of mdit gmdit or lmdit z n is the nth household s other observed individual characteristics except pim and x ij denotes the ijth technology specific variables β 0 β 2 γ 0 γ 4 are the coefficients to be estimated ε 1 and ε 2 are the error terms 5 results and discussion 5 1 results the estimation results for the top and bottom level equations using the nested logit technique are reported in table 3 the iia likelihood ratio tests of the two models provide strong evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis that tau value equals to 1 this result indicates that the choice of whether to adopt gmdit or lmdit is not independent therefore the model cannot collapse to the multinomial logit model meaning that the nested logit is a more appropriate choice the estimated coefficients for the residuals of the two pim variables are significantly different from zero providing evidence of endogeneity this implies that the estimated coefficients of the two pim variables would be biased if we did not control for endogeneity regarding the impact of pim we found that the two pim variables have significant and positive impacts on gmdit but with different impacts on lmdit specifically the coefficients of participation in the selection of the head irrigation manager and participation in irrigation management meetings are significantly positive in the gmdit model in comparison the coefficient of participation in the selection of the head irrigation manager is not significant and participation in irrigation management meetings is negatively significant in the lmdit model we discuss this in section 5 3 with respect to the impacts of land characteristics both soil type and plot area are found to have positive impacts on the adoption of lmdit but not gmdit demonstrating that farm attributes play a crucial role in the diffusion of innovative irrigation technology 40 the impact of plot area is found to be positive but only for lmdit parcels with sandy soils are more likely to be managed with lmdit with regard to the impacts of household characteristics we found that neither age of the household head nor education of the household head has a significant impact on lmdit or gmdit ethnicity has a significantly negative impact on both technology types indicating that han chinese farmers have more incentives to adopt new irrigation technology than uyghur farmers household wealth is found to positively affect the adoption of lmdit but not gmdit this finding is in line with the finding of 26 who state that household wealth facilitates the relaxation of financial constraints in diffusing advanced agricultural techniques the number of agricultural labourers in a family has a significantly positive impact on both gmdit and lmdit adoption this finding confirms that the availability of labour for field irrigation management plays an important role in irrigation technology application as it is a labour intensive activity 13 the household head s degree of risk preference negatively influences the adoption of gmdit but positively affects the adoption of lmdit this finding is consistent with that of 57 who identified that risk preference plays a crucial role in farmers irrigation technology adoption decisions in dry land systems a plausible reason for the different impacts between gmdit and lmdit is that a large portion of installation costs for gmdit application are paid by the government and a large group of farmers involved in the gmdit programme thus this technique may be considered to be less risky regarding village characteristics we found that both the distance from the village to the town centre and the number of wells in a village have significantly positive impacts on lmdit but not on gmdit the positive impact of distance suggests that farmers who live farther away from town have fewer off farm opportunities and are thus more likely to invest in agricultural technology innovation than those living closer to town the number of wells in a village has a positive effect on the adoption of lmdit because lmdit mainly uses groundwater in our research area the estimated coefficients of the two alternative specific variables are significant the sign of the average cost is negative confirming that farmers are more likely to adopt irrigation technology with lower costs this finding is consistent with that reported by ref 4 who demonstrate that high adoption costs are a main obstacle to innovative agricultural technology adoption among paddy farmers in malaysia strikingly the estimated coefficient for labour input has a positive sign reflecting that farmers are more likely to adopt irrigation technology that requires more labour input we also discuss this in section 5 3 5 2 robustness check first the nested logit model relaxes the assumption of independently distributed errors and the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia inherent in conditional and multinomial logit models by clustering similar alternatives the gmdit and lmdit in our research into nests however one may argue that the three types of irrigation technologies gmdit lmdit and flood irrigation are independent and irrelevant and the potential substitution between the two types of mdit is not different from substitution between gmdit lmdit and flood irrigation this may explain why there is no obvious nested structure presented in fig 1 to relax the constraint of a nested structure in the nested logit model we estimated an alternative specific conditional logit model for robustness checks the alternative specific conditional logit model also allows for two types of independent variables alternative specific variables which vary across both cases and alternatives and case specific variables which vary only across cases the results obtained from the alternative specific conditional logit model are shown in table a1 in the appendix we found that the pim1 variable remained consistent with those presented in table 3 while the coefficient of pim2 was still significant but shrunk to one half for gmdit use plots and it became insignificant for lmdit use plots this finding is consistent with our expectation because the potential substitution between the two types of mdit was not considered we also found that the significance of the estimation coefficients of a few controlled variables is different from table 3 due to the lack of consideration of a nested structure between gmdit and lmdit second in our model two dependent variables whether to adopt gmdit or lmdit are dichotomous and the participatory status of farmers pim is also dichotomous therefore the recursive bivariate probit rbp model may also be an appropriate specification for this case 11 11 the disadvantages of using the rpb model are that it does not take into account the potential substitution between the two types of mdit and alternative specific variables are not allowed in rpb models another advantage of using the rbp model is that the instrumental variables used in control functions can be used as excluded restrictions variables in the rpb model which reduces the risk of inappropriate identification of instrumental variables we estimated four groups of rbp models for pim1 gmdit pim1 lmdit pim2 gmdit pim2 lmdit which are reported in table a2 and table a3 in the appendix we found that the direction of the coefficients of two pim variables remains unaffected in all models however they become more significant particularly the impact of pim1 on lmdit these findings confirm that the main empirical results obtained from the use of the nested logit model are reliable 5 3 discussion in many arid and semi arid regions improving the application and use efficiency of irrigation water through developing innovative irrigation technology is crucial for a sustainable agriculture system and for a sustainable livelihood strategy 1 due to inefficiency and a lack of incentives to induce local water users technology enthusiasm for the adoption of top down irrigation management systems the pim approach is commonly promoted to induce new irrigation technology adoption such as mdit 17 18 however our empirical evidence shows different impacts of pim on two types of mdits we found that pim induces farmers to switch from traditional flood irrigation technology to gmdit but does not promote the adoption of lmdit these findings are consistent with our theoretical expectation obtained in section 2 gmdit is a top down government promoted technology programme implemented at the village level while lmdit is a localized self governed project implemented in the context of a long term use tradition among small groups of farmers the incentives presented by pim to adopt gmdit are therefore greater than those to adopt lmdit through the three channels of information advantage social support and social network as discussed in section 2 3 these findings are also in line with the argument by ref 55 who state that local water users participation in irrigation management rule setting facilitates the adoption of government promoted irrigation technology another interesting finding is that pim even has a negative effect on farmers adopting lmdit the opposite influencing direction may possibly be related to a substitution relationship between gmdit and lmdit i e participation in irrigation management induces more farmers to opt for gmdit the substitution between gmdit and lmdit thus reduces the use of lmdit the findings regarding the different impacts of pim on mdits have twofold implications on the one hand effective participatory irrigation management institutions are urgently required to support the development of gmdit although participatory irrigation management has been encouraged in many developing countries it does not receive enough attention transferring irrigation management directly to user farmers is being increasingly advocated and practised in many regions around the world 64 however there is usually inadequate representation participation and involvement of local water users in many irrigation management institutions for instance in nepal and eastern india the rural elites are still the main members elected to carry out relevant management decisions however the role of farmers participatory management receives less attention 65 on the other hand the potential substitution relationship between these two technologies i e gmdit and lmdit in our case can relate to cooperation in irrigation technology based public services by government and community the typical debate proposed by ref 45 highlights that interactions between state and community can involve both conflict and cooperation given that lmdit is a traditional technique with relatively higher compatibility with local contexts the generation of cooperation between the state and community should be considered in future irrigation water management reforms 15 in addition the average cost is found to have a negative impact on both gmdit and lmdit whereas family wealth has a positive impact this implies that liquid constraint can impede the diffusion of mdit thus subsidy and off farm immigration policies can play a significant role in scaling up the application of modern irrigation technology 8 however a common situation in many developing countries such as northern ghana india and china is that a governmental subsidy is available only in the beginning stage and covers only a small portion of the installation costs in addition off farm immigration opportunities are very limited particularly in underdeveloped drought prone ethnic rural regions therefore maximizing the effectiveness of subsidy programmes and creating off farm opportunities can be a win win formula to develop mdit and to reduce local poverty 31 finally contrary to our expectation farmers are more likely to adopt the irrigation technology that requires more labour input this striking finding is inconsistent with those of 13 66 who state that irrigation is a labour intensive job and thus that labour shortage is usually the constraint confronted by mdit adopters a plausible explanation is the presence of surplus agricultural labour in our study area due to limited off farm employment opportunities 67 hence the opportunity costs of labour are low and farmers are willing to invest labour in adopting water saving irrigation technologies this argument is consistent with the positive impact of agricultural labour force on both gmdit and lmdit which means that farmers with more agricultural labour are more likely to adopt both gmdit and lmdit 6 conclusion this study attempts to empirically identify the determining factors of cotton farmers adoption decision regarding mdit focusing particularly on the different impacts of pim on two specific forms of mdit specifically gmdit and lmdit in rural xinjiang a nested logit model was used based on a dataset collected in february 2017 in awati county in aksu prefecture covering 739 households and 1763 plots we conclude that farmers participation in irrigation management can facilitate their conversion from traditional flood irrigation technology to gmdit through information advantage social networking and social support second from a practical perspective there is a possible substitution relationship between gmdit and lmdit in addition we also conclude that context incompatibility and liquid constraint can impede the diffusion of mdit our findings have several important policy implications for improving irrigation water management efficiency and the dissemination of drip irrigation technology in arid and semi arid drought prone areas in northwestern china and other developing countries first relevant irrigation management issues should be taken into account in future irrigation water management reforms to develop effective participatory irrigation management institutions through the close involvement of local water users the water user association wua is a promising participatory irrigation management institution however it was not functioning well in our research area more governmental financial support technical guidance and legal policy support may be necessary to increase farmers incentive to truly participate in the wua second the government may also offer intensive training programmes on drip irrigation technology or agricultural production to generate social networks and to attach traditional social cohesiveness and social support among small households third it is of crucial importance to consider the physical consistency of innovative irrigation technology with local conditions before scaling up implementation to improve the context compatibility of irrigation technology finally feasible subsidies covering most of the initial installation costs should be provided to relax the

8678,reforms in irrigation management can make important contributions to reducing irrigation water scarcity this paper attempts to examine the role of participatory irrigation management pim in farmers mulched drip irrigation technology adoption decisions it is based on a comparative analysis between government promoted mulched drip irrigation technology gmdit and localized self governed mulched drip irrigation technology lmdit in rural xinjiang china data from a survey conducted in 2017 across 739 households covering 1763 plots in awati county in xinjiang were used to estimate a nested logit model the results indicate that pim induces farmers to switch from traditional flood irrigation technology to gmdit but does not promote the adoption of lmdit we conclude that promoting pim can make an important contribution to more sustainable water use in this drought prone area but that the self governance of localized irrigation systems requires more attention by local governments keywords technology adoption participatory irrigation management mulched drip irrigation rural xinjiang 1 introduction the agriculture sector is the largest consumer of water with a share of water consumption of over 70 globally 1 due to the impact of increasing climate change industrialization and water pollution the irrigation water shortage is expected to become more serious 2 3 china is no exception particularly in its arid and semi arid northwest regions figures show that the annual water availability in northwest china is only 750 m3 per capita which is far below the world s 1000 m3 water scarcity threshold 4 to address growing irrigation water scarcity substantial emphasis has been given to advanced and innovative irrigation techniques 5 6 mulched drip irrigation technology mdit 1 1 mdit refers to an irrigation method that conveys water to plants through pipes and emitters under a low operating pressure with a cover of plastic mulch on or below the soil surface 10 this technique combines the advantages of both drip technology and plastic film mulch 16 has the potential to increase crop yields to provide farmers with improved water application and to benefit the environment by reducing soil erosion 7 thus mdit is widely encouraged as a viable adaptation strategy to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change 1 however despite the widespread efforts that have been made to promote mdit in developing regions its actual adoption rate is low 8 10 numerous studies have documented the factors influencing the innovation diffusion of mdit generally the identified factors consist of three categories namely farm and farm household characteristics such as farm size age education socioeconomic factors such as extension service and information 11 social network 4 12 13 and institutional factors such as water price water right and water management 10 although most of the existing studies mainly focus on the first two categories 14 the analysis on the substantial role of the institutional management factor in mdit diffusion has been increasingly highlighted see e g ref 7 15 16 effective water management can not only promote the diffusion of innovative irrigation technologies but also limit or even eliminate its undesirable rebound effects the participatory irrigation management pim approach has been the focus of water management reforms pim refers to the responsibilities of local irrigation related issues e g water fee collection and water allocation and to the transfer of power over irrigation issue decision making from government authorities to water users and or groups of farmers 17 this approach stems from the rationale that the top down approach developed by government bureaucracies lacks the incentives to optimize management 18 comparatively pim provides farmers with significant incentives to enhance and sustain management efficiency and further improve the use of innovative water saving irrigation technology 16 19 despite the numerous analyses that have been conducted to investigate the influencing factors of mdit the role of pim in mdit diffusion has received insufficient attention the objective of this analysis is to investigate the role of pim in mdit diffusion among cotton farmers particularly focusing on its different impacts on two specific irrigation technologies i e localized self governed mdit lmdit and government promoted mdit gmdit the relevant findings and implications are expected to provide useful insights for framing policies aimed at improving irrigation management strategies that facilitate coping with water scarcity we attempt to contribute to the empirical literature in three respects first it adds to the scarce literature on the impact of pim on mdit adoption in arid and semi arid rural regions an exception is the recent study by ref 20 their study descriptively analyses the relationship between village based water users associations wua and mdit in northern china and uses regression analysis to examine the determinants of smallholders participation in wua and mdit unfortunately their study does not examine the impact of participation in wua a form of pim on farmers mdit adoption decisions therefore our analysis provides direct empirical evidence on the impact of pim on mdit second this study examines two types of mdit gmdit and lmdit the existing literature focuses on the analysis of gmdit however pim may provide adoption incentives that differ significantly between gmdit and lmdit 2 2 the different impacts of pim on gmdit and lmdit are discussed in subsection 2 3 third the available studies in the agricultural technology literature tend to treat the adoption variable as a categorical variable and apply multinomial probit logit models 21 22 in contrast to the previous work we estimate a nested logit model which accounts for the correlation among different types of irrigation decisions and represents patterns of substitution among correlated mdit choices relative to the standard multinomial logit approach the nested logit approach relaxes the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives and allows us to capture the dissimilarities among different technologies the remaining parts of the present study are structured as follows section 2 presents theoretical consideration of the impacts of pim on mdit based on a critical synthesis of the literature section 3 introduces the empirical model of mdit choices within the expected utility framework section 4 introduces the research area and the dataset the variables included in the empirical analysis are defined and the estimation strategy is discussed in section 5 the estimation results robustness check results and discussion are presented the conclusions are presented in the final section 2 theoretical consideration of pim and mdit 2 1 previous research there is a long tradition of empirical research that seeks to examine the factors that impact farmers adoption of drip irrigation in the areas of rural sociology and agricultural economics generally the past numerous studies have mainly been documented according to distinct lines of research such as sociology economics psychology agriculture extension and marketing 4 regarding factors affecting farmers adoption decisions no consensus has been reached as factors are usually context specific 23 24 for instance sociologists highlight the characteristics of potential adopters and leading farmers 10 their perception of water scarcity 25 26 and the social network and communication involved in the different stages of the irrigation technology diffusion process 27 28 in contrast economists concentrate specifically on economic variables such as the relevant costs and profits crop yield and water productivity in the context of irrigation technology adoption 29 others emphasize the crucial role of institutional factors such as cooperation among farmers water prices property rights irrigation management systems and subsidies 4 10 30 31 the same applies to the specific notion of mdit adoption decisions by farmers crucial determinants identified by empirical analysis include farmers demographics water and land resource endowments field size the availability of water geographical factors farm location economic factors water fee increased yield and revenue risk exposure and uncertainties such as drought and institution water price or water policy 32 34 notably more recently the importance of irrigation management particularly pim has been increasingly highlighted in drip irrigation technology studies 35 36 it has been documented that poor irrigation management does not encourage innovative irrigation technology application pim approaches can facilitate farmer s enthusiasm to switch from traditional irrigation approaches to adopt innovative techniques 32 for instance the results from ref 37 suggest that the application of advanced irrigation technologies requires improved irrigation management efficiency similarly 38 39 state that increasing the adoption rate of advanced irrigation techniques in rural china largely depends on the effectiveness of local water management systems following the previous research and in light of the essential role of pim in mdit diffusion the following discussion sheds additional light on the influencing channels of pim on mdit particularly focusing on the different impacts of pim on gmdit and lmdit 2 2 impacting mechanism of pim on mdit in this study we distinguish among three major channels through which pim might affect farmers mdit adoption decisions information advantage social support and social network first the participatory approach implies that local water users are involved in relevant water management issues such as water allocation irrigation timing and frequency facility maintenance water fee collection and extension support 7 the sharing of transparent management relevant information through pim makes water managers more accountable in irrigation facility maintenance and results in more reliable water provision 15 furthermore the close involvement of water users creates information advantages which ensures that users have more knowledge to help them recognize water signs of scarcity and to adopt innovative irrigation technologies 3 3 for instance the timing and frequency of water application are two important factors to be considered before implementing mdit because supplemental irrigation is needed particularly during critical growth periods in arid and semi arid regions 7 last the application of mdit is usually complex and requires professional training 11 40 thus mdit is considered to be a risky investment due to imperfect technology knowledge 4 41 from this perspective technology targeted training can further strengthen the information advantage of farmers involved in pim second participatory approaches can foster social support from governments for the implementation of mdit programmes specifically participatory approaches take into account the needs experiences and perceptions of local water users through intensive interactions between state agencies and local water users 7 close interactions allow a better translation of the demands for governmental services by local water users and can therefore enhance the social support for the application of mdit more importantly social support can facilitate the resolution of conflicts and problems in irrigation technology practices third interactions between local water users village collectives and governments facilitate the development of social network that can stimulate the adoption of mdit specifically participants can build new networks through technology training management meeting discussions and other forms of interaction in the joint management of irrigation water resources social networks play a crucial role in diffusing mdit because they have a significant social learning effect in mdit diffusion 28 in other words the adoption of mdit by a small number of farmers will spread among others through social networks if the social learning is effective 2 3 different impacts on gmdit and lmdit before further discussing the different impacts of pim on gmdit and lmdit it is necessary to distinguish these two technologies first a big difference is that gmdit is a top down government promoted technology programme implemented in a relatively large region within a village thus its diffusion is usually carried out by village collectives lmdit is a localized self governed project implemented among small groups of farmers with traditions of long term use second both surface water and groundwater can be used as water resource for gmdit and lmdit in our research area the choice of applying surface water or groundwater is largely exogenous 42 the availability of surface water and ground water mainly depends on the water supply from local water stations and access to wells respectively in practice gmdit uses both surface water and groundwater as water resources drawn from collective wells comparatively lmdit mainly uses groundwater drawn from private wells in this regard there are significant differences in the average irrigation costs and labour inputs between these two technologies on the one hand governments are responsible for installing the main and branch pipes and drilling wells for gmdit adopters through subsidies in comparison lmdit adopters must be able to afford these costs by themselves on the other hand the use of gmdit imposes labour input constraints by requiring fixed frequency and timing of irrigation schedules while the labour input in the lmdit application is more flexible 4 4 the average irrigation cost and labour input is 302 65 rmb and 11 49 days per year per mu respectively for gmdit users which is 421 87 rmb and 17 19 days per year per mu for lmdit users thus in the estimation models two alternative specific variables average cost and labour input were introduced to capture the possible impacts on specific irrigation technology decisions third our field observation shows that there is no significant gap in crop yield and revenue among farmers using different mdits despite the potential advantages for the two types of mdits in saving water the use of mdits poses a risk of leading to land salinization problems compared to traditional flood irrigation technologies we expect that the impacts of pim on gmdit are different from the impacts of pim on lmdit according to the three channels mentioned above first lmdit is relatively more compatible with local context than gmdit because it is a self governed project this implies that lmdit is a better matched practice with a higher level of physical consistency of innovative technique along with farmers temporal conditions particularly in terms of the knowledge and resource structure in this regard the triggering impact of technology switch by pim through an information advantage channel is less significant on lmdit than on gmdit second it has been found that the policy decisions made by state agencies alone are unlikely to be successful 43 44 instead the success of such governmental programmes usually requires bureaucrats and farmer groups to develop the capacity to collaborate in the joint management of irrigation resources 45 given that more water users and other stakeholders e g water managers village leaders local government officials are involved in gmdit implementation and that more potential conflicts may occur 11 social support is much more important for implementing gmdit compared to lmdit therefore the impact of pim through social support channels is expected to be greater for gmdit than for lmdit third social network connections have been identified as creditable for community based new technology extension 13 28 the extension supports for gmdit depend on a larger social network i e village community based social network while lmdit depends on a smaller social network among a small group of farmers therefore the impact of pim through social network channels is expected to be greater on gmdit than on lmdit 3 empirical model of mdit choices according to the expected utility framework originally proposed by ref 46 the adoption of a new technology results from the comparison of utilities derived from different alternatives in our case farmers choose the irrigation technology on their plots that maximizes the net benefit obtained from cotton production on the plots farmers have three alternative irrigation approaches gmdit lmdit and flooding irrigation a multinomial logit model is usually appropriate for the case with the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives iia however this is not the case because gmdit and lmdit are close substitutes for farmers adoption of irrigation technologies the nested logit model is a generalization of the multinomial or mcfadden s conditional logit model relative to a single stage technique such as the multinomial logit the nested logit framework relaxes the assumption of iia 5 5 iia property holds only within the nests but not necessarily across the nests and allows us to model dissimilarities among different decisions the practical significance is that in a nested logit the alternatives grouped into the same nest i e gmdit and lmdit are allowed to be closer substitutes we build on the models of 47 48 and modify their approach for the two level nesting structure the top level shows the irrigation type choice mdit and flood irrigation and the bottom level shows technology type choice gmdit and lmdit in practice a farmer generally chooses the technology type gmdit or lmdit and irrigation type mdit or flood irrigation simultaneously by partitioning the mdit choice we do not assume that the choice is made sequentially the two level decision tree of irrigation technology choice by a farmer is shown in fig 1 below let b nij represent the nth farmer s net benefit from choosing irrigation type i and technology type j the farmer will choose the ijth alternative if b n i j b n k i k a n d j l k is another irrigation type and l is another technology type we do not know the farmer s preferences but observe the farmers characteristics and the attributes of the technology type therefore we can decompose the farmer s benefit into an observed component v nij and an unobserved component ε nij that is 1 b n i j v n i j ε n i j we assume that the random errors ε nij are distributed extreme values and are uncorrelated across nests but not within nests suppose that the farmer chooses among i 1 t irrigation type and j 1 c technology type for each irrigation type there is a subset of technology types 6 6 in our case there are two types of technologies gmdit and lmdit for the mulched drip irrigation type however there is only one technology for flood irrigation type let us denote this set of technologies c i for each irrigation type i we can write the probability of observing the adoption of choice ij as the joint probability as follows 2 p i j e v i j i t j c i e v i j although irrigation type and technology type may be jointly determined ultimately we can isolate irrigation type from the joint probability of adopting a technology irrigation type pair by decomposing the joint probability into a conditional and marginal probability decomposing the joint probability in equation 2 leads to the nested logit model and significantly simplifies the estimation of the joint probability 49 we specify v ij as 3 v i j α i j z β x i j η i w γ y i where z is a vector of observed individual characteristics that affect the technology irrigation choice x ij is a vector of observed attributes of the irrigation technology ij w is a vector of individual characteristics affecting irrigation type and y i is a vector of attributes affecting irrigation type i thus our model estimates irrigation type and technology type by incorporating individual characteristics and technology attributes the coefficients of individual characteristics vary across technology choices however the coefficients for technology attributes do not the joint probability of choosing irrigation type i and adopting technology type j given in equation 2 can be written as 4 p i j p j i p i where 5 p j i e α j i z β x j i j c i e α j i z β x j i and c i is the set of technology type with irrigation type i j 1 c the marginal probability of taking irrigation type i is 6 p i e η i w γ y j c i e α j i z β x j i i t e η i w γ y j c i e α j i z β x j i defining an inclusive value for each irrigation type i as 7 i i ln j c i e α j i z β x j i we can express equation 6 more concisely as 8 p i e η i w γ y i τ i i i t e η i w γ y i τ i i where t is the choice of the two irrigation types mdit or flood irrigation the inclusive value i i explicitly links the irrigation choice in the first level to the technology choice in the bottom level the coefficient τ is a measure of independence among the choices in the nest given by the ith irrigation choice and the statistic 1 τ is a measure of correlation in order to achieve the objectives of the paper we introduce pim and other observed individual characteristics in vector z and technology specific variables in the vector x ij in equation 3 in our case it is very difficult to find observed individual characteristics and irrigation type relevant attributes that affect irrigation type mdit or flood irrigation but do not affect technology type gmdit or lmdit we therefore exclude w and y i from equation 3 in the empirical analysis 4 data and estimation strategy 4 1 research site our research site see fig 2 below is situated in awati county aksu prefecture in the southwest of xinjiang neighbouring the northern edge of the taklimakan desert the second largest desert in the world this region is characteristic of a warm temperature continental desert climate the mean annual temperature throughout xinjiang has been increasing since the mid 1980s and it is predicted to continue with intensified global warming in the future 50 the annual mean precipitation is less than 150 mm in xinjiang i e 23 of the average of 630 mm in china as a whole and it rarely exceeds 50 mm in the south 51 52 the mean annual pan evaporation between 1000 and 4500 mm in xinjiang is much stronger than in other locations at the same latitude in china between 500 and 3500 mm 51 in the south part the annual evaporation usually exceeds 2200 mm the agricultural production depends heavily on irrigation and has been confronting an increasingly water shortage in recent years 53 several programmes have been promoted in recent years to handle the irrigation scarcity one of the most important programmes is the gmdit programme for cotton production which has been in operation since 2006 in akesu this project aims at establishing 267 ha of core demonstration site for cotton production with the application of gmdit within awati county financial assistance of 12 06 million rmb from the automatic governance region government was transferred to the county government as a subsidy to support the programme in 2014 it is estimated that the area equipped for gmdit is 3 73 million hectares accounting for approximately 41 of the total irrigated cotton area in awati county 4 2 data collection the dataset used for the empirical analysis was obtained from a rural household survey conducted in awati county held in february 2017 the main purpose was to investigate the relationship between irrigation water management reform and water use efficiency in the context of intensified climate change a multiple stratified sampling strategy was used for selecting the households by excluding one township located in the suburb area with very limited farmers we first selected the rest of seven townships in the county seventeen villages were randomly selected based on a roster of all villages in each township notably the number of villages chosen in each township was based on the total number of villages and village heterogeneity in terms of land and population size economic development geographic location household respondents within each village were randomly selected from a list with household names in each village and on average 12 of households in each village were interviewed similar to the village sampling strategy the household sample rate is also different among villages depending on household level economic development land endowment and geographical location of homeset in total 774 households were interviewed out of these households 35 indicated that they are not involved in farmland cultivation and were therefore excluded from the analysis in addition to household level information we collected plot level information including the irrigation situation soil salinization perception soil type land type contracted land or wasteland 7 7 in xinjiang there are two types of cultivated land contracted land is assigned following the implementation of the household responsibility system in the 1970s wasteland is reclaimed from desert land or grassland that can be developed by farm households or local government 24 and plot area because households usually cultivate many plots it is a very time consuming task to collect information for all plots we therefore collected information for a maximum of four plots per household two of the largest contracted plots and two of the largest wasteland plots this resulted in a household survey data set with information for 739 households and 1763 plots with mdit applied on 837 plots detailed information on field irrigation management used in cotton production the fixed costs of using gmdit and lmdit participation in village level irrigation management land endowments and demographic characteristics in 2016 were collected using a standardized structured questionnaire complemented by village level data obtained from the respective village committees 4 3 variable definition and summary statistics tables 1 and 2 report the definitions and descriptive statistics of the dependent variables and six groups of explanatory variables respectively irrigation technology choice the main dependent variables are dummy variables reflecting the plot level adoption of mdit the adoption rate of mdit is 0 48 with gmdit adoption equalling 0 30 and lmdit adoption equalling 0 18 for the plots in our sample participatory irrigation management farmers involvement in pim in china mainly includes the process of the foundation of the system the selection of the manager the attendance of regular management meetings 54 rule setting and enforcement 54 55 our field observations show that individual farmers are rarely involved in the specific procedures of the foundation of pim systems in our research area we therefore use two dummy variables as proxies of pim i e farmers participation in the selection of the head manager pim1 and participation in meetings concerning the discussion of relevant irrigation management rule making pim2 furthermore we introduce five groups of control variables in our empirical specification the characteristics of land parcel household village regional dummy variables and alternative specific variables land parcel characteristics are used to capture the effects of environmental conditions and farm attributes 3 they include timely irrigation soil salinization perception soil type distance to a channel land type and plot area it is expected that farmers experiencing problems with timely receipt of irrigation water have a greater probability of adopting mdit to lower the loss of water shortage induced crop production saline and sandy soils are poor soil types for which farmers are less likely to adopt innovative technology 56 average plot distance from the field to the irrigation channel and land type are used as indicators of the availability of surface water the former is also included to capture the impact of irrigation infrastructure 57 plots located further away from an irrigation canal generally receive less water wasteland is usually located in remote areas and therefore receives less surface water than contracted land 24 a larger plot area means a greater risk of loss due to water shortages and a higher demand to adopt water saving irrigation technology 58 regarding household characteristics the age and the education of the household head are proxies for experience and management ability 59 older household heads tend to have more agricultural management experience and are not reliable with regard to innovative technology thus they are less likely to adopt mdit 4 educated farmers are more likely to be able to handle the technical issues related to mdit and are therefore more likely to adopt it 10 uyghur ethnicity is used to reflect potential differences in mdit adoption between the uyghur and the han ethnic groups household wealth is used to control for heterogeneity in economic and social power among households 33 wealthy households have fewer financial capital constraints and are more likely to invest in advanced irrigation techniques households with more labourers can spend more time on field irrigation management farmers with a relatively high risk preference are more likely to adopt innovative technologies 57 and they are therefore are more likely to adopt lmdit with greater risk village characteristics consist of the distance between the village and the nearest town centre and the number of wells in the village the distance to the town centre is used as an indicator of market access the number of wells is a proxy for groundwater availability as well as village level irrigation infrastructure 8 a large number of wells in a village means relatively high groundwater use and may contribute to groundwater resource depletion farmers are expected to respond by adopting mdit for a larger number of wells particularly adopting lmdit because it relies more on underground water six regional dummy variables township dummy variables were introduced to control for the unobserved effects of agro ecological conditions that differ systematically among the seven townships the alternative specific variables used for adopting the three irrigation technologies gmdit lmdit and flooding irrigation in the estimation models consist of the average cost and labour input they are measured by the per unit land area of average costs and labour input in technology use respectively the average cost and labour input can be classified as alternative specific variables because their values change according to farmers selections of different irrigation technologies unfortunately we could collect data only for the alternatives that actually occurred following 60 we assume that the calculated average cost and labour input for each technology can be considered as the opportunity costs of giving up other technology choices 8 8 the information on the costs and labour input for three technologies was collected by asking village cadres this investigation is at the village level because the opportunity costs for using one technology are very similar within the same village but tend to vary among villages 4 4 estimation strategy one possible concern is that there may be an endogeneity problem stemming from reverse causality and or missing unobserved factors in estimating the impact of pim on mdit adoption decisions on contributions to pim may partly depend on the type of irrigation technology that is used moreover mdit adoption decisions may be correlated with some unobserved factors such as informal institutions that also influence the pim practice we use control function to address this problem by introducing three instrumental variables ivs specifically the number of temporary cadres assigned to live in the village 9 9 to increase village governance efficiency and stabilize rural social security some public servants from higher level governments are temporarily assigned to work as village cadres in rural xinjiang their main responsibility is to investigate the living standards of households to disseminate agricultural policy information and to provide agricultural training through close interactions with local farmers a dummy variable measuring whether the village has received irrigation management documents such as documents on irrigation rules and canal usage and maintenance from higher level authorities and the number of mosques in the village the definitions of three instrumental variables are also reported in table 1 we assume that these three instruments are correlated with farmers participation in pim but do not directly affect mdit adoption decisions first the duty of temporary cadres is to improve village governance efficiency and maintain rural social security and is thus expected to have a strong correlation with farmers participation in pim these duties are unlikely to have a direct effect on individual field irrigation decisions second irrigation management documents from higher authorities are expected to strongly affect farmers participation in pim however there is no reason to expect that they affect individual field irrigation decisions in a similar vein 61 used upper level government documents as an instrumental variable for village choices of wuas third informal institutions may affect the active participation of farmers in village level irrigation management 50 we use the number of mosques in a village as an indicator of a major relevant informal institution in the region which is expected to affect pim but is unlikely to directly affect farmers adoption decisions of mdit it may be argued that religion also plays a role in technology adoption the islam doctrine particularly section 71 in chapter vii and section 60 in chapter 56 in the koran prescribes that individuals should conserve water resource and protect the environment however during our field investigation in 2017 we observed that religion plays a major role in household affairs such as marriage and death but not in agricultural production activities in our research area to handle the endogeneity of farmers participation status in pim a combination of the two stage conditional maximum likelihood 2scml method 10 10 in a traditional two stage instrumental variable regression the predicted value of the endogenous variable obtained from the first stage is introduced into the second stage however the results may be biased and inconsistent when both the dependent variable and the endogenous variable are discrete 63 2scml has been identified as an appropriate method to address such an endogeneity problem by refs 24 62 proposed by ref 62 63 with a nested logit model is used in our empirical analysis in the first stage we conduct a linear regression with all the exogenous variables m n and instruments i n to explain the participation status p n model 9 and to obtain its predicted residual values p ˆ n in the second stage both the obtained residuals p ˆ n and the original variable p n are simultaneously introduced into the nested logit regression to explain choices of gmdit and lmdit model 10 9 p n β 0 β 1 i n β 2 m n ε 1 10 a n r 0 r 1 p n r 2 p ˆ n r 3 z n r 4 x i j ε 2 where p n denotes the status of pim for the nth household a n measures the nth household s choice of mdit gmdit or lmdit z n is the nth household s other observed individual characteristics except pim and x ij denotes the ijth technology specific variables β 0 β 2 γ 0 γ 4 are the coefficients to be estimated ε 1 and ε 2 are the error terms 5 results and discussion 5 1 results the estimation results for the top and bottom level equations using the nested logit technique are reported in table 3 the iia likelihood ratio tests of the two models provide strong evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis that tau value equals to 1 this result indicates that the choice of whether to adopt gmdit or lmdit is not independent therefore the model cannot collapse to the multinomial logit model meaning that the nested logit is a more appropriate choice the estimated coefficients for the residuals of the two pim variables are significantly different from zero providing evidence of endogeneity this implies that the estimated coefficients of the two pim variables would be biased if we did not control for endogeneity regarding the impact of pim we found that the two pim variables have significant and positive impacts on gmdit but with different impacts on lmdit specifically the coefficients of participation in the selection of the head irrigation manager and participation in irrigation management meetings are significantly positive in the gmdit model in comparison the coefficient of participation in the selection of the head irrigation manager is not significant and participation in irrigation management meetings is negatively significant in the lmdit model we discuss this in section 5 3 with respect to the impacts of land characteristics both soil type and plot area are found to have positive impacts on the adoption of lmdit but not gmdit demonstrating that farm attributes play a crucial role in the diffusion of innovative irrigation technology 40 the impact of plot area is found to be positive but only for lmdit parcels with sandy soils are more likely to be managed with lmdit with regard to the impacts of household characteristics we found that neither age of the household head nor education of the household head has a significant impact on lmdit or gmdit ethnicity has a significantly negative impact on both technology types indicating that han chinese farmers have more incentives to adopt new irrigation technology than uyghur farmers household wealth is found to positively affect the adoption of lmdit but not gmdit this finding is in line with the finding of 26 who state that household wealth facilitates the relaxation of financial constraints in diffusing advanced agricultural techniques the number of agricultural labourers in a family has a significantly positive impact on both gmdit and lmdit adoption this finding confirms that the availability of labour for field irrigation management plays an important role in irrigation technology application as it is a labour intensive activity 13 the household head s degree of risk preference negatively influences the adoption of gmdit but positively affects the adoption of lmdit this finding is consistent with that of 57 who identified that risk preference plays a crucial role in farmers irrigation technology adoption decisions in dry land systems a plausible reason for the different impacts between gmdit and lmdit is that a large portion of installation costs for gmdit application are paid by the government and a large group of farmers involved in the gmdit programme thus this technique may be considered to be less risky regarding village characteristics we found that both the distance from the village to the town centre and the number of wells in a village have significantly positive impacts on lmdit but not on gmdit the positive impact of distance suggests that farmers who live farther away from town have fewer off farm opportunities and are thus more likely to invest in agricultural technology innovation than those living closer to town the number of wells in a village has a positive effect on the adoption of lmdit because lmdit mainly uses groundwater in our research area the estimated coefficients of the two alternative specific variables are significant the sign of the average cost is negative confirming that farmers are more likely to adopt irrigation technology with lower costs this finding is consistent with that reported by ref 4 who demonstrate that high adoption costs are a main obstacle to innovative agricultural technology adoption among paddy farmers in malaysia strikingly the estimated coefficient for labour input has a positive sign reflecting that farmers are more likely to adopt irrigation technology that requires more labour input we also discuss this in section 5 3 5 2 robustness check first the nested logit model relaxes the assumption of independently distributed errors and the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia inherent in conditional and multinomial logit models by clustering similar alternatives the gmdit and lmdit in our research into nests however one may argue that the three types of irrigation technologies gmdit lmdit and flood irrigation are independent and irrelevant and the potential substitution between the two types of mdit is not different from substitution between gmdit lmdit and flood irrigation this may explain why there is no obvious nested structure presented in fig 1 to relax the constraint of a nested structure in the nested logit model we estimated an alternative specific conditional logit model for robustness checks the alternative specific conditional logit model also allows for two types of independent variables alternative specific variables which vary across both cases and alternatives and case specific variables which vary only across cases the results obtained from the alternative specific conditional logit model are shown in table a1 in the appendix we found that the pim1 variable remained consistent with those presented in table 3 while the coefficient of pim2 was still significant but shrunk to one half for gmdit use plots and it became insignificant for lmdit use plots this finding is consistent with our expectation because the potential substitution between the two types of mdit was not considered we also found that the significance of the estimation coefficients of a few controlled variables is different from table 3 due to the lack of consideration of a nested structure between gmdit and lmdit second in our model two dependent variables whether to adopt gmdit or lmdit are dichotomous and the participatory status of farmers pim is also dichotomous therefore the recursive bivariate probit rbp model may also be an appropriate specification for this case 11 11 the disadvantages of using the rpb model are that it does not take into account the potential substitution between the two types of mdit and alternative specific variables are not allowed in rpb models another advantage of using the rbp model is that the instrumental variables used in control functions can be used as excluded restrictions variables in the rpb model which reduces the risk of inappropriate identification of instrumental variables we estimated four groups of rbp models for pim1 gmdit pim1 lmdit pim2 gmdit pim2 lmdit which are reported in table a2 and table a3 in the appendix we found that the direction of the coefficients of two pim variables remains unaffected in all models however they become more significant particularly the impact of pim1 on lmdit these findings confirm that the main empirical results obtained from the use of the nested logit model are reliable 5 3 discussion in many arid and semi arid regions improving the application and use efficiency of irrigation water through developing innovative irrigation technology is crucial for a sustainable agriculture system and for a sustainable livelihood strategy 1 due to inefficiency and a lack of incentives to induce local water users technology enthusiasm for the adoption of top down irrigation management systems the pim approach is commonly promoted to induce new irrigation technology adoption such as mdit 17 18 however our empirical evidence shows different impacts of pim on two types of mdits we found that pim induces farmers to switch from traditional flood irrigation technology to gmdit but does not promote the adoption of lmdit these findings are consistent with our theoretical expectation obtained in section 2 gmdit is a top down government promoted technology programme implemented at the village level while lmdit is a localized self governed project implemented in the context of a long term use tradition among small groups of farmers the incentives presented by pim to adopt gmdit are therefore greater than those to adopt lmdit through the three channels of information advantage social support and social network as discussed in section 2 3 these findings are also in line with the argument by ref 55 who state that local water users participation in irrigation management rule setting facilitates the adoption of government promoted irrigation technology another interesting finding is that pim even has a negative effect on farmers adopting lmdit the opposite influencing direction may possibly be related to a substitution relationship between gmdit and lmdit i e participation in irrigation management induces more farmers to opt for gmdit the substitution between gmdit and lmdit thus reduces the use of lmdit the findings regarding the different impacts of pim on mdits have twofold implications on the one hand effective participatory irrigation management institutions are urgently required to support the development of gmdit although participatory irrigation management has been encouraged in many developing countries it does not receive enough attention transferring irrigation management directly to user farmers is being increasingly advocated and practised in many regions around the world 64 however there is usually inadequate representation participation and involvement of local water users in many irrigation management institutions for instance in nepal and eastern india the rural elites are still the main members elected to carry out relevant management decisions however the role of farmers participatory management receives less attention 65 on the other hand the potential substitution relationship between these two technologies i e gmdit and lmdit in our case can relate to cooperation in irrigation technology based public services by government and community the typical debate proposed by ref 45 highlights that interactions between state and community can involve both conflict and cooperation given that lmdit is a traditional technique with relatively higher compatibility with local contexts the generation of cooperation between the state and community should be considered in future irrigation water management reforms 15 in addition the average cost is found to have a negative impact on both gmdit and lmdit whereas family wealth has a positive impact this implies that liquid constraint can impede the diffusion of mdit thus subsidy and off farm immigration policies can play a significant role in scaling up the application of modern irrigation technology 8 however a common situation in many developing countries such as northern ghana india and china is that a governmental subsidy is available only in the beginning stage and covers only a small portion of the installation costs in addition off farm immigration opportunities are very limited particularly in underdeveloped drought prone ethnic rural regions therefore maximizing the effectiveness of subsidy programmes and creating off farm opportunities can be a win win formula to develop mdit and to reduce local poverty 31 finally contrary to our expectation farmers are more likely to adopt the irrigation technology that requires more labour input this striking finding is inconsistent with those of 13 66 who state that irrigation is a labour intensive job and thus that labour shortage is usually the constraint confronted by mdit adopters a plausible explanation is the presence of surplus agricultural labour in our study area due to limited off farm employment opportunities 67 hence the opportunity costs of labour are low and farmers are willing to invest labour in adopting water saving irrigation technologies this argument is consistent with the positive impact of agricultural labour force on both gmdit and lmdit which means that farmers with more agricultural labour are more likely to adopt both gmdit and lmdit 6 conclusion this study attempts to empirically identify the determining factors of cotton farmers adoption decision regarding mdit focusing particularly on the different impacts of pim on two specific forms of mdit specifically gmdit and lmdit in rural xinjiang a nested logit model was used based on a dataset collected in february 2017 in awati county in aksu prefecture covering 739 households and 1763 plots we conclude that farmers participation in irrigation management can facilitate their conversion from traditional flood irrigation technology to gmdit through information advantage social networking and social support second from a practical perspective there is a possible substitution relationship between gmdit and lmdit in addition we also conclude that context incompatibility and liquid constraint can impede the diffusion of mdit our findings have several important policy implications for improving irrigation water management efficiency and the dissemination of drip irrigation technology in arid and semi arid drought prone areas in northwestern china and other developing countries first relevant irrigation management issues should be taken into account in future irrigation water management reforms to develop effective participatory irrigation management institutions through the close involvement of local water users the water user association wua is a promising participatory irrigation management institution however it was not functioning well in our research area more governmental financial support technical guidance and legal policy support may be necessary to increase farmers incentive to truly participate in the wua second the government may also offer intensive training programmes on drip irrigation technology or agricultural production to generate social networks and to attach traditional social cohesiveness and social support among small households third it is of crucial importance to consider the physical consistency of innovative irrigation technology with local conditions before scaling up implementation to improve the context compatibility of irrigation technology finally feasible subsidies covering most of the initial installation costs should be provided to relax the

8679,in this study we investigated whether irrigated agriculture results in improved child nutrition outcomes among farm households in southern ghana using panel data collected between 2014 and 2015 this study seeks to add to the growing body of literature on the determinants of irrigated agriculture adoption its effects on child nutrition and the potential pathways through which irrigation can affect child nutrition outcomes the results from the inverse probability weighted regression adjustment ipwra estimator suggest that children living in irrigating households have on average 0 23 standard deviations of weight for age and 0 27 standard deviations of weight for height higher than their counterparts with males and under five children gaining substantial improvements disaggregating irrigation by types the results indicate that households planting on riverbeds or riverbanks had improved child nutrition in contrast children living with households lifting water from water sources had higher height for age and weight for age further analysis of the underlying pathways suggests that an increase in health care financing and improvement in environmental quality rather than decreases in illness incidence may be the crucial channels altogether the findings show the importance of investments in agricultural development particularly in small scale irrigated agriculture technologies to reduce childhood undernutrition keywords irrigated agriculture child nutrition intrahousehold allocation treatment effect estimators panel regressions 1 introduction in many low and middle income countries lmics reducing undernutrition remains a primary public health goal and this is more evident in the sustainable development goals sdgs where 12 of the 17 about 70 goals are related to nutrition 42 globally undernutrition accounts for about 45 of deaths of under five children 13 despite several nutrition sensitive interventions undernutrition remains disproportionately higher in lmics the health effects of child undernutrition are often irreversible with long term consequences many empirical studies show that undernutrition can impair cognitive and physical development school performance and labor productivity in the later years of their life e g refs 5 24 in ghana about 19 of under five children are stunted low height for age z scores and 11 of children are underweight low weight for age z scores 23 the prevalence of child undernutrition is even much higher in rural areas than in urban areas investments in agriculture are essential to enhance food and nutrition security agriculture employs about 38 of the labor force despite ghana s population increasingly urbanized and the gross domestic product gdp shares of the agriculture sector sharply declined over the last decade 61 public investments can improve agricultural yield and productivity through knowledge transfer and infrastructure expansion 16 in africa expanding irrigation technology is one of the agrarian policy goals and this is emphasized in the recent 2018 malabo montpellier panel report however public investments in agriculture remain low in many african countries in ghana for instance public agricultural expenditure gdp averaged about 3 3 from 2001 to 2015 significantly less than the 10 target of the comprehensive africa agricultural development programme caadp commitment 9 previous studies have shown that irrigation technology increases production and household income for example by expanding irrigation technologies households can extend the growing season produce more than once annually and reduce the dependence of rain fed agriculture by making crop production possible in marginal lands where rainfall is inadequate 29 irrigation also increases land productivity using an appropriate input mix thereby generating higher farm incomes along with that small scale irrigation ssi using tubewell in nigeria increased per hectare returns from 65 to 500 14 while treadle pump irrigation increased income per hectare by over 500 in malawi 32 in balana et al 8 although access to ssi can significantly increase net returns in northern ghana the use of diesel powered irrigation schemes generates more net income than other types of irrigation the cost benefit analysis however shows that the use of watering can generates higher returns per capital investment indicating potential differential impacts of irrigation technologies altogether recent evidence suggests that ssi schemes generate the highest economic pay offs and are more sustainable 57 58 the main objective of this study is to examine the impact of irrigation on child health and nutrition outcomes in southern ghana using four rounds of panel data collected between 2014 and 2015 a few studies have investigated the relationship between irrigation and consumption nutrition outcomes alaofe et al 4 reported that households with irrigation increase yield and consumption of fruits and vegetables spend more on food and health care services than households without irrigation other studies that explore the relationship between irrigation and dietary diversity found that irrigation is positively and significantly associated with household dietary diversity and production diversity 10 11 41 although investment in irrigation is supported to ensure food and livelihood security e g ref 18 there is an ongoing debate over which types of irrigation technologies could be more nutrition sensitive irrigation technology is a key strategy to improve yield and productivity and thereby to ensure food and nutrition security among smallholders to that end various types of ssi technologies have been promoted in many lmics the impacts of irrigation on household nutrition and health outcomes greatly depend on the scale and types of irrigation schemes for instance homestead irrigation typically owned by women is used to grow vegetables for their own consumption and or for local markets on the other hand in large scale irrigation schemes farmers produce mainly cash crops in which the women often do not have much control over the income studies assessing the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition using anthropometric measurements are few e g refs 10 48 to the best of our knowledge evidence on the impacts of irrigated agriculture by its type on child nutrition is also scarce and no previous study looked into the gender differentiated impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes there is a need to build a strong evidence base for policymakers and development practitioners to guide how to design successful programs and facilitate the adoption of irrigation technologies this study attempts to fill these gaps with the growing interest in expanding ssi in ghana this is an important and policy relevant topic in addition the implementation challenges encountered with the so called one village one dam program the results from this study could shed additional light by providing evidence on the nutritional benefits of ssi furthermore the implementation challenges of the government s current irrigation program make it a critical issue in terms of agricultural policy therefore studying the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutritional outcomes is a topical issue in ghana due to the slow pace of implementation of the flagship program of one village one dam and the reported complaints of the quality of completed dams 21 for policy decisions it is also essential to identify the types of irrigation technologies that are nutrition sensitive and hasten the implementation of the program this study contributes to the literature in many ways first the study focuses on the effect of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition using anthropometric indicators previous studies e g refs 34 41 mostly rely on food consumption diversity second the current study uses panel data allowing to control for time dimension in the analysis other studies e g refs 10 20 27 48 have relied on cross sectional data affected by endogeneity issues third and most importantly the study disaggregates the impacts based on irrigation types and gender of children and discusses the potential pathways through which irrigated agriculture could impact child nutrition outcomes using four rounds of panel data collected between 2014 and 2015 in southern ghana and employing the inverse probability weighted regression adjustment ipwra estimator the findings are that children living with irrigating households have on average higher weight for age and weight for height than children residing with non irrigating households the results are robust to various model specifications and alternative estimation approaches 2 background 2 1 irrigated agriculture in ghana in ghana expanding irrigated agriculture has been one of the underlying pillars of modernizing agriculture in the country s agricultural policies nevertheless empirical studies on the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutritional outcomes are scarce in ghana agriculture is important because it is a source of food and income for the vast majority of rural households although it is mainly subsistent and rain fed this implies that seasons of low rainfall lead to low yields which can affect poor rural households livelihoods as part of food security and poverty reduction strategies the government of ghana has designed policies and programs to expand ssi in many rural communities small scale irrigation can promote all year round food production and increase yields through reliance on water resources for agricultural purposes with irrigated agriculture the types of crops farmers grow will also change which has indirect implications on the types of food supply and consumption in the communities in ghana agricultural policies primarily focused on modernizing the sector through intensification improved agronomic practices irrigation and mechanization available statistics from the ministry of food and agriculture mofa 36 indicate that in 2016 the share of agricultural land to the total land area of ghana is 57 of which 46 6 of agricultural land was under cultivation with only 3 6 of the total cultivated area is under irrigation due to the lack of public investment 36 since the potentials of scaling up irrigated agriculture to increase yield and productivity the government has a great interest in investing in irrigation infrastructure as an example in 2017 the government initiated the one village one dam program in northern ghana to construct small scale dams 2 2 the impact of irrigated agriculture on nutrition and health outcomes irrigation can affect health and nutrition outcomes through various pathways see fig 1 poorly designed irrigation for instance can bring adverse impacts on the environment and human health through increased water related diseases and drinking water contaminations irrigation systems increase the availability of water for domestic purposes where multiple use water systems are common however it can be a source of domestic water contamination 20 47 50 moreover it can exacerbate the incidence of waterborne diseases by creating favorable conditions for disease vectors such as mosquitoes 6 7 on the one hand irrigated agriculture could increase productivity production diversity and food availability which in turn improve household income and consumption e g refs 3 25 38 41 54 relatedly the increased income associated with irrigation enables households to access improved health care services which can enhance the health and nutrition outcomes of household members irrigation water serves as source of drinking water in many rural communities where access to improved drinking water sources is inadequate 49 53 increasing water availability for domestic purposes helps households to meet basic hygiene practices that improve health associated with water quantity 53 in a related manner increasing water availability reduces the burden of water collection time which is often disproportionately borne by women and girls the time saving from water collection can be used for other income generating activities such as agricultural production social events and childcaring 43 with direct and indirect health consequences a recent review has synthesized the available evidence on the impacts of irrigation on health and nutrition in sub saharan africa see ref 17 for a detailed review 3 methods 3 1 data this study relies on four rounds of geographic specific surveys collected from april 2014 to june 2015 the sample households were selected using a stratified cluster sample design see ref 39 for detailed information informed consent was obtained for participant households of the study the survey instruments for the baseline survey data april may 2014 collected height and weight measurements for children under eight years of age detailed information on agricultural activities irrigated agriculture productive assets income health care expenses household consumption expenditures and other socioeconomic characteristics this survey instrument was repeated for the end line survey in may june 2015 the other two survey waves i e first follow up november december 2014 and second follow up january february 2015 used an abridged version of the baseline survey instrument with anthropometric measures information on income health care expenses irrigated agriculture and other agricultural activities but without the detailed consumption expenses and productive assets information having child level anthropometric measures together with irrigated agriculture activities and detailed household socioeconomic characteristics presents the opportunity to examine the potential mechanisms according to kirk et al 26 the short time duration between the survey waves allows controlling for time constant child characteristics which could not be addressed using cross sectional data the household survey was conducted in ga south municipal urban and shai osudoku rural districts in the greater accra region from the urban district only rural and peri urban communities which are similar to those in the rural district were targeted in the sample selection the main focus of this study is on children living in agricultural households but children from non agricultural households are maintained due to the relatively smaller sample size we restrict the analysis on children with anthropometric measures in the baseline survey or born after the baseline survey see ref 28 the final analysis consists of 1317 child observations across the four survey waves 318 331 392 and 276 child observations in the surveys of april may 2014 november december 2014 january february 2015 and may june 2015 respectively of these 41 6 in all the four surveys 32 6 in three survey waves 16 9 in any two survey waves and 9 in only one survey waves were observed fig 2 depicts a map of the study areas finally the sample is representative neither at the national nor at the district level the study sites were selected purposely based on ex ante information therefore the results may not be generalized to the whole population while we acknowledge that the sample size may be small there are no alternative panel datasets for ghana based on our knowledge containing anthropometrics with representative sample for children in both irrigated and non irrigated agricultural households in ghana access to irrigation is extremely low for example the africa rising baseline evaluation survey arbes report a nationally representative survey in ghana showed that merely 3 of the sampled households declared to irrigate their land 46 similarly in ghana various types of irrigation technologies exist but less than 2 of arable lands are under irrigation 35 these include human powered rope and treadle pumps to liquid fuel engine driven systems and solar powered pumps as well as gravity and river diversion methods 2 this paper uses unbalanced panel data with some of the children not measured in all the survey rounds accordingly the study may suffer from attrition bias although we control for survey round fixed effects in our analyses the attrition rate if systematic and affects one group more than the other could lead to potential upward estimation bias we undertake an analysis of the attrition rate and we find that it is similar for both irrigators and non irrigators appendix g for instance we analyzed the level of attrition rate based on children with only one observation and older than 12 months of age in the baseline data following kirk et al 26 we find that the attrition rate is unaffected by the adoption of irrigated agriculture furthermore the results do not change by defining attrition either to mean children with one or two observations and older than 12 months of age in the baseline data or to mean children with only one or two observations in the data 3 2 estimation strategy anthropometrics measures such as height for age z scores haz weight for age z scores waz and weight for height z scores whz are used as indicators of child nutrition the use of anthropometrics which is recommended by who for child nutrition measures is few in the literature on the impacts of irrigated agriculture anthropometrics measurements are objective indicators and less subject to measurement errors than alternative nutritional indicators such as dietary diversity calorie intakes which are mainly based on recall by the respondent and prone to recall bias the study is based on a random utility framework where a household adopted irrigation technologies to maximize its utility i e child nutrition by comparing it to the utility from non irrigating households further closely following grossman 22 and mangyo 33 this study conceptualizes the nutrition of children as a stock implying that the current level of child nutrition is affected by both current and previous inputs including investments in irrigated agriculture the econometric model for the nutrition production function is specified in its basic form as 1 n i j t i a j t ρ h j t μ c i j t ω v i j t w t d c ε i j t where i represents child t indicates survey waves t 0 1 2 3 j indicates household i a a dummy variable indicating whether household participation in irrigated agriculture n represents child nutritional outcomes h represents the household c represents the child and v represents community level characteristics w t and d c capture survey wave and district fixed effects respectively while ε represents the error term ρ μ and ω are the estimated coefficients assessing the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutritional outcomes haz waz and whz is challenging due to several reasons including inadequate data and methodological issues one of the main challenges of evaluating the impact of irrigated agriculture based on observational data is the estimation bias due to the non random participation in irrigated agriculture and the self selection of households into adopting irrigation technology hence irrigation technology is not assigned randomly and households may decide whether to adopt irrigation depending on observed and unobservable factors for instance if resource endowed farmers are more likely to participate in irrigated agriculture impact assessments that fail to account for such household s characteristics adequately will lead to biased estimates see ref 16 for discussion on impact evaluation of infrastructures furthermore undernutrition is caused by several factors including the environment prior studies have shown that the benefits of high quality foods on nutrition could be eroded by poor environmental quality such as unsafe drinking water inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices e g refs 55 60 all of these factors could affect the validity of the estimated impact notably if these factors are correlated with irrigated agriculture this study focuses on estimating the impact of irrigated agriculture and its types on child nutritional outcomes as discussed previously participation in irrigated agriculture is non random we therefore employed the ipwra estimator where both outcome and treatment models are specified to address the non random participation in irrigated agriculture the treatment effect is obtained using weighted regression coefficients where the weights are generated from the inverse probabilities of the treatment 56 the ipwra estimator accounts for the misspecification in either the outcome or treatment models thereby generating a robust estimate of the impact of irrigated agriculture based on the observable characteristics 15 31 however one of the main limitations of the ipwra is that it does not consider selections based on unobservable characteristics based on the estimated inverse probability weights weighted regression models for the outcome are fitted using a logit model to generate the expected outcomes of the probabilities of participation and non participation in irrigated agriculture the independent variables are selected based on previous studies on the factors influencing the adoption of irrigation technologies and the availability of information see tables 1 and 3 for variables included in the models the difference between the computed mean outcomes of participants and non participants provides estimates of the treatment effects of irrigated agriculture see refs 31 44 the study relies on teffects ipwra in stata version 14 2 statacorp 2015 for the data analysis in the preferred estimator of ipwra complemented with propensity score matching psm the study analyzes both

correlated random effects cre estimators 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics table 1 presents the summary statistics on irrigated agriculture practices the results provide some perspective on the econometric results later presented in this section we find that agriculture is the main livelihood activity in the study area and less than one fourth of the households engaged in irrigated agriculture the most commonly practiced 22 3 irrigation technology is access to water from various water sources followed by cultivating on low lying swamp or marshland 19 2 other types of irrigation including drip irrigation surface irrigation among others 13 6 around 6 3 of the households apply overhead irrigation using a watering can or bucket sprinkler irrigation 3 3 is less widespread in the study area on average families spend about three and a half days each week on irrigated fields the average irrigable farm size is 1 3 ha and the average income from irrigated agriculture is about ghs 1398 equivalent to usd 466 over half of the sampled households entirely depend on family labor for irrigated agriculture irrigating household members experienced health problems such as body pains 86 1 injury 48 1 malaria 38 and respiratory diseases 25 3 in the preceding four weeks before the survey reported in table 2 are child nutritional outcomes by irrigation status and the results show that irrigating households have better child nutrition than non irrigating households column 3 except for haz there are statistically significant mean differences in children s waz and whz between irrigating and non irrigating households the main caution with this result is that it is merely a correlation and not suggestive of the impact of irrigated agriculture summary statistics of the outcome variables by the survey waves are reported in appendix f based on previous empirical studies e g ref 1 we have included a wide range of child parental household and community level characteristics in the empirical models several of these variables are important determinants of child health and nutrition outcomes as shown in table 3 about 80 of the household is male headed with low educational qualification 65 3 with no formal education access to the internet is deficient 11 6 but access to environmental quality indicators are moderately high according to the who s joint monitoring program jmp classifications about 68 of the households have access to improved water supply while 44 have access to improved sanitation around one fifth of the households treat water to make it safer for consumption further most households are living in communities having water bodies half of the children are males and biological children of household heads 75 the self reported prevalence of diarrhea among children is low while fever is relatively high 15 4 additionally table 3 provides summary statistics by irrigation status the results suggest that irrigated households are relatively male headed and educated have significantly better access to the internet and improved drinking water high monthly income more extension visits high presence of cooperative or farmer group organizations and owned more agricultural land on the other hand non irrigated households owned more large livestock than irrigated households on children s characteristics both groups are comparable in terms of age gender and relationship to household head except for health care financing and malaria prevalence lastly imbalances in summary statistics for observational studies are common in the empirical literature in zeweld et al 59 for example seven out of the 11 variables were statistically different at the conventional significance level similarly in pasarelli et al 41 13 out of 21 for ethiopia data and 17 out of 21 variables for tanzania data were statistically different from each other 4 2 econometric results 4 2 1 factors influencing adoption of irrigation technologies in this section we first present the empirical results from logit regressions table 4 which are used to predict the treatment status that is the factors influencing a household s decision on whether to adopt irrigated agriculture column 1 presents a pooled logit model without considering the panel structure of the data columns 2 and 3 report the re logit models considering the panel structure of the data but without including unobserved heterogeneity the last two columns 4 5 summarize the estimates of cre models which consider both the panel nature of the data and unobserved heterogeneity 30 37 45 the results from column 4 our preferred model with clustered standard errors suggest that household access to the internet agricultural extension visits to the community and the presence of cooperative in the community are more likely to increase household adoption of irrigated agriculture column 4 of table 4 these results partly confirm previous studies e g ref 1 on the socio economic correlates of irrigation all these variables could improve household access to information related to agricultural technologies which can increase the likelihood of households to adopt irrigation technology ownership of farmland presence of water resources and religion of household head being christian are also positively associated with irrigation adoption on the other hand ownership of livestock is negatively and significantly associated with irrigation adoption regression results in the other columns show the importance of different institutional and socioeconomic characteristics in influencing the decision of households to undertake irrigated agriculture 4 2 2 effects on nutrition outcomes the effect of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes is summarized in table 5 the estimated coefficients are from the doubly robust ipwra estimator and the treatment models are specified using the covariates reported in table 4 we performed several diagnostic tests for the ipwra and psm estimators we find the model specifications can balance the covariates and samples in the data as the estimated density of the predicted probabilities displays in appendix h1 the two estimated densities have more of their respective masses in the regions where they overlay each other although both plots are relatively skewed to the right for instance we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the ipwra model balanced the covariates included in the regression with a p value of 0 39 suggesting that the overlap assumption may not be violated relatedly the covariance balance summary suggests that matching on the estimated propensity score balanced the covariates that is the variance ratio for all the variables are close to one while the standardized difference is close to zero appendix h2 therefore the results show that once we control for covariates propensity score the probability of treatment is random among irrigators and non irrigators households although the treatment effect estimator has its limitation casual inferences of ipwra or other matching methods are common in the empirical literature see for example 31 44 59 particularly so when further diagnostics statistics support that the models satisfactorily address selection bias in all our regressions we reported both the ate and the att for comparisons our preferred estimation is however the att which is relevant in the context of an impact evaluation where selection into the treatment may be important the results suggest the effect of irrigated agriculture on haz is positive and statistically significant at the 5 level for male children similarly the estimated impact of waz is statistically significant for instance the weight of children living in irrigating households are on average 0 23 units of sd higher compared to children living with non irrigating households and this effect is even larger for male children column 4 panel b of table 5 when disaggregating the sample by age groups the estimated effect of irrigated agriculture is still large and positive and statistically significant at the conventional significance levels the results further reveal that the whz of children of irrigating households is on average 0 27 units of sd more than children of non irrigating households the differential impact of irrigated agriculture on whz is larger and stronger for children aged between 0 and 4 years column 2 panel b of table 5 4 3 differential effects of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes we also examine whether different types of irrigations have different impacts on child nutritional outcomes to test that we estimated the same outcome variables based on irrigation types and the results are summarized in table 6 the estimation strategy compares the various types of irrigation to those not using that specific type of irrigation the analyses assume that the different irrigation types are mutually exclusive although in reality farmers adopt multiple irrigation options particularly on those involving low technology options we do this mainly for practical and methodological reasons the technologies involved are many and the data is too small to allow us to undertake complex analysis of the combination of the irrigation options see ref 12 for analyses of combining agricultural technologies unfortunately we do not have additional irrigation type specific information that could be used to address the above shortcomings moreover some of the irrigation types rely on similar technologies and including dummies of these other types will not be an appropriate exercise from an estimation point of view as they are highly correlated controlling for the covariates should be however adequate to generate relevant evidence a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of different irrigation technologies is an avenue for future research however the estimation approach we employed is relevant as it presents evidence of the differential impacts of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes our findings suggest that having irrigated fields in the community is positively and significantly associated with all child nutritional indicators except for haz for instance the att estimates suggest that the waz of children with irrigated fields in the community are 0 34 units of sd higher than their counterparts this partly confirms previous studies on the local economy or distributional effects of irrigation 19 52 similarly households cultivating on low lying swamp marshland show positive impacts on child nutritional outcomes panel b of table 6 as can be seen the differential effects of different irrigation types on child nutritional outcomes are generally robust although the estimated att for irrigation type of lifting water from dams canals rivers lakes are positive across for the different nutritional indicators the coefficients are statistically nonsignificant panel d of table 6 note that the ate estimate is enormous and estimated imprecisely which might be due to the small number of samples in this group for instance about 8 of the samples fall in this group and a higher height for age compared to their counterparts could drive this result although we are interested in the att estimates the ate result in panel d should be treated with caution we also observed that the estimated coefficients of the att of the presence of irrigated fields in the community and cultivation on low lying swamp marshland do not have a significant impact on haz long term nutritional indicators in contrast the riverbeds riverbanks irrigation type does not have a considerable effect on whz table 6 an essential policy question is why should different types of irrigated agriculture lead to differential impacts on nutrition the plausible explanation is that in this study context similar to previous studies e g refs 8 41 59 different types of irrigated agriculture are involved with different technologies with associated differences in crops planted productivity returns and cost implications for example planting on riverbeds riverbanks does not involve a large cost for irrigation but this traditional approach is important as it allows for access to water to crops during climatic stress variability the key result is that the adoption of low cost ssi generates differential impacts on child nutrition outcomes in this study context additional descriptive analyses show that there are differences in crops planted and income from the different types of irrigation and these may be influencing the differences in child nutrition outcomes for instance households cultivating on low lying swamp marshland mainly planted okro 55 93 pepper 42 37 rice 33 90 and maize 28 81 besides average income from irrigated agriculture for this group was ghs 1457 12 although the income from irrigated agriculture was on average about ghs 678 44 on the other hand for households relying on overhead irrigation the following were the major crops pepper 60 okro 50 rice 15 and maize 5 major crops planted by those using riverbeds riverbanks were okro 70 maize 50 pepper 43 33 and rice 20 furthermore income from irrigated agriculture for this group was ghs 1348 these results suggest that households using different types of irrigation cultivates either cereals and or vegetables as their major crops and this leads to differences in income 5 pathways other outcomes and robustness checks 5 1 effects on income health care financing and environmental quality in this section we further investigate the possible mechanisms through which irrigated agriculture can affect child nutrition one of the primary pathways that irrigation can impact child nutrition is through the availability of diverse foods which is closely related to nutritional outcomes the data at hand however do not allow us to investigate this channel in detail table 7 reports other possible mechanisms proxies of income environmental quality that irrigation could affect nutrition outcomes most of the estimated coefficients of the att indicates a positive association but none of them is statistically significant except for improved drinking water source the negative effect on bed net per capita raises a vital policy question on why irrigating households do not invest in preventive health care this requires further analyses on the productive expenditure of irrigated agriculture households 5 2 other outcomes we estimate the impacts of irrigated agriculture on child illness diarrhea and fever as shown in table 8 children living in irrigating households are more likely to experienced general illness or fever in the last four weeks preceding the surveys columns 1 3 table 8 although irrigated agriculture can improve child nutrition through household income and food availability irrigation water may exacerbate the prevalence of water related diseases in the community furthermore the results on self reported fever are inconsistent with the paddy paradox and this shows that the estimated results on nutrition are lower bound irrigation systems for instance can serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes that lead to a higher incidence of malaria 6 7 5 3 sensitivity analyses the estimated parameters from the ipwra estimator may suffer from omitted variable bias if unobserved time variant characteristics are correlated with the adoption of irrigation farming and or child nutrition outcomes therefore we conducted several robustness checks using psm re fe and cre estimators and the results are provided in the online supplementary materials propensity score matching was estimated using the nearest neighbor of four nn 4 the results are comparable across different estimation strategies the psm results are summarized in appendices a b c and d rosenbaum bounds on treatment effects estimates for the psm results mainly confirm that there is no hidden bias due to unobserved characteristics appendix i however results obtained from re and cre models show that irrigated agriculture improves haz appendix e1 e2 which was not statistically significant for the ipwra or psm estimators similarly results from fe estimates partly confirms those from the re and cre except that the effects on whz were not statistically significant appendix e3 e4 we also explore the option of addressing selection bias issues using the heckman selection model we assume that child health and nutrition outcome is a function of child and household characteristics and environmental quality in contrast the likelihood of adopting irrigated agriculture is a function of household characteristics and additional baseline information and indirectly the child health and nutrition outcomes via the inclusion of household level characteristics which we think determine the child health and nutrition outcomes the estimated inverse mills ratios are not statistically significant p value of 0 483 suggesting that sample selection bias is less likely 6 conclusion and policy implications agricultural development primarily irrigated agriculture has the potential of reducing undernutrition in lmics despite its large potential benefits investments in agriculture are low in many sub saharan african countries in this study we examined whether households engaged in irrigated agriculture have improved child nutrition outcomes using a panel household survey data and a doubly robust estimator we find that irrigated agriculture led to large improvements in child nutrition outcomes with considerable gains for males and under five children for instance a child living with an irrigating household gains 0 23 units of sd in waz and 0 27 units of sd in whz in the study period the findings on male children indicate the biases in intrahousehold resource allocation toward this group which is in concurrence with earlier findings e g ref 40 the estimated results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation techniques disaggregating irrigation by types the results show that the presence of irrigated fields in the community planting on riverbeds and lifting water from water sources have larger impacts on child nutrition compared to overhead and other irrigation types while there is a broad consensus on the importance of investments in irrigation as a policy towards the reduction of undernutrition there is still debate on the types of irrigation that could deliver these nutritional benefits our findings also suggest that some of the irrigation types such as planting on riverbeds and lifting water from water sources generate higher nutrition benefits than overhead irrigation type moreover the presence of irrigated fields in the community generates improved nutrition outcomes this implies that irrigated agriculture generates community level benefits aside from the benefits accrued to an individual or household the results suggest that investment in low cost ssi generates nutrition benefits in the study context the potential pathways that irrigation impacts child nutrition could be increased in demand for environmental quality and health care financing rather than decreases in illness incidences the latter is not surprising as the results show that irrigated agriculture does not lead to investments in preventive health care e g bednets leading to a high incidence of self reported fever cases although the results are not statistically significant diarrhea incidences are consistently lower finally the study identifies several areas for future research on the impacts of irrigation on child nutrition outcomes the sample for the study is relatively small and due to the complexity of the linkages between irrigated agriculture and nutrition future studies based on nationally representative data could shed additional light on these linkages additionally although we attempt to reduce selection problems to the extent possible using various econometric techniques causal interpretation of the results may be biased this is so because treatment effects models and panel regressions may not be able to address all issues related to endogeneity and therefore the causal interpretation of empirical findings maybe be viewed with some caution for instance unobserved child or household characteristics can still bias the true coefficient of the impacts of irrigation on child nutrition outcome despite these limitations the results obtained from this study are robust to various model specifications and are relevant for policymakers as well as researchers on the nutrition impacts of irrigation in lmics including ghana author contribution charles y okyere conceptualization formal analysis funding

8679,in this study we investigated whether irrigated agriculture results in improved child nutrition outcomes among farm households in southern ghana using panel data collected between 2014 and 2015 this study seeks to add to the growing body of literature on the determinants of irrigated agriculture adoption its effects on child nutrition and the potential pathways through which irrigation can affect child nutrition outcomes the results from the inverse probability weighted regression adjustment ipwra estimator suggest that children living in irrigating households have on average 0 23 standard deviations of weight for age and 0 27 standard deviations of weight for height higher than their counterparts with males and under five children gaining substantial improvements disaggregating irrigation by types the results indicate that households planting on riverbeds or riverbanks had improved child nutrition in contrast children living with households lifting water from water sources had higher height for age and weight for age further analysis of the underlying pathways suggests that an increase in health care financing and improvement in environmental quality rather than decreases in illness incidence may be the crucial channels altogether the findings show the importance of investments in agricultural development particularly in small scale irrigated agriculture technologies to reduce childhood undernutrition keywords irrigated agriculture child nutrition intrahousehold allocation treatment effect estimators panel regressions 1 introduction in many low and middle income countries lmics reducing undernutrition remains a primary public health goal and this is more evident in the sustainable development goals sdgs where 12 of the 17 about 70 goals are related to nutrition 42 globally undernutrition accounts for about 45 of deaths of under five children 13 despite several nutrition sensitive interventions undernutrition remains disproportionately higher in lmics the health effects of child undernutrition are often irreversible with long term consequences many empirical studies show that undernutrition can impair cognitive and physical development school performance and labor productivity in the later years of their life e g refs 5 24 in ghana about 19 of under five children are stunted low height for age z scores and 11 of children are underweight low weight for age z scores 23 the prevalence of child undernutrition is even much higher in rural areas than in urban areas investments in agriculture are essential to enhance food and nutrition security agriculture employs about 38 of the labor force despite ghana s population increasingly urbanized and the gross domestic product gdp shares of the agriculture sector sharply declined over the last decade 61 public investments can improve agricultural yield and productivity through knowledge transfer and infrastructure expansion 16 in africa expanding irrigation technology is one of the agrarian policy goals and this is emphasized in the recent 2018 malabo montpellier panel report however public investments in agriculture remain low in many african countries in ghana for instance public agricultural expenditure gdp averaged about 3 3 from 2001 to 2015 significantly less than the 10 target of the comprehensive africa agricultural development programme caadp commitment 9 previous studies have shown that irrigation technology increases production and household income for example by expanding irrigation technologies households can extend the growing season produce more than once annually and reduce the dependence of rain fed agriculture by making crop production possible in marginal lands where rainfall is inadequate 29 irrigation also increases land productivity using an appropriate input mix thereby generating higher farm incomes along with that small scale irrigation ssi using tubewell in nigeria increased per hectare returns from 65 to 500 14 while treadle pump irrigation increased income per hectare by over 500 in malawi 32 in balana et al 8 although access to ssi can significantly increase net returns in northern ghana the use of diesel powered irrigation schemes generates more net income than other types of irrigation the cost benefit analysis however shows that the use of watering can generates higher returns per capital investment indicating potential differential impacts of irrigation technologies altogether recent evidence suggests that ssi schemes generate the highest economic pay offs and are more sustainable 57 58 the main objective of this study is to examine the impact of irrigation on child health and nutrition outcomes in southern ghana using four rounds of panel data collected between 2014 and 2015 a few studies have investigated the relationship between irrigation and consumption nutrition outcomes alaofe et al 4 reported that households with irrigation increase yield and consumption of fruits and vegetables spend more on food and health care services than households without irrigation other studies that explore the relationship between irrigation and dietary diversity found that irrigation is positively and significantly associated with household dietary diversity and production diversity 10 11 41 although investment in irrigation is supported to ensure food and livelihood security e g ref 18 there is an ongoing debate over which types of irrigation technologies could be more nutrition sensitive irrigation technology is a key strategy to improve yield and productivity and thereby to ensure food and nutrition security among smallholders to that end various types of ssi technologies have been promoted in many lmics the impacts of irrigation on household nutrition and health outcomes greatly depend on the scale and types of irrigation schemes for instance homestead irrigation typically owned by women is used to grow vegetables for their own consumption and or for local markets on the other hand in large scale irrigation schemes farmers produce mainly cash crops in which the women often do not have much control over the income studies assessing the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition using anthropometric measurements are few e g refs 10 48 to the best of our knowledge evidence on the impacts of irrigated agriculture by its type on child nutrition is also scarce and no previous study looked into the gender differentiated impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes there is a need to build a strong evidence base for policymakers and development practitioners to guide how to design successful programs and facilitate the adoption of irrigation technologies this study attempts to fill these gaps with the growing interest in expanding ssi in ghana this is an important and policy relevant topic in addition the implementation challenges encountered with the so called one village one dam program the results from this study could shed additional light by providing evidence on the nutritional benefits of ssi furthermore the implementation challenges of the government s current irrigation program make it a critical issue in terms of agricultural policy therefore studying the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutritional outcomes is a topical issue in ghana due to the slow pace of implementation of the flagship program of one village one dam and the reported complaints of the quality of completed dams 21 for policy decisions it is also essential to identify the types of irrigation technologies that are nutrition sensitive and hasten the implementation of the program this study contributes to the literature in many ways first the study focuses on the effect of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition using anthropometric indicators previous studies e g refs 34 41 mostly rely on food consumption diversity second the current study uses panel data allowing to control for time dimension in the analysis other studies e g refs 10 20 27 48 have relied on cross sectional data affected by endogeneity issues third and most importantly the study disaggregates the impacts based on irrigation types and gender of children and discusses the potential pathways through which irrigated agriculture could impact child nutrition outcomes using four rounds of panel data collected between 2014 and 2015 in southern ghana and employing the inverse probability weighted regression adjustment ipwra estimator the findings are that children living with irrigating households have on average higher weight for age and weight for height than children residing with non irrigating households the results are robust to various model specifications and alternative estimation approaches 2 background 2 1 irrigated agriculture in ghana in ghana expanding irrigated agriculture has been one of the underlying pillars of modernizing agriculture in the country s agricultural policies nevertheless empirical studies on the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutritional outcomes are scarce in ghana agriculture is important because it is a source of food and income for the vast majority of rural households although it is mainly subsistent and rain fed this implies that seasons of low rainfall lead to low yields which can affect poor rural households livelihoods as part of food security and poverty reduction strategies the government of ghana has designed policies and programs to expand ssi in many rural communities small scale irrigation can promote all year round food production and increase yields through reliance on water resources for agricultural purposes with irrigated agriculture the types of crops farmers grow will also change which has indirect implications on the types of food supply and consumption in the communities in ghana agricultural policies primarily focused on modernizing the sector through intensification improved agronomic practices irrigation and mechanization available statistics from the ministry of food and agriculture mofa 36 indicate that in 2016 the share of agricultural land to the total land area of ghana is 57 of which 46 6 of agricultural land was under cultivation with only 3 6 of the total cultivated area is under irrigation due to the lack of public investment 36 since the potentials of scaling up irrigated agriculture to increase yield and productivity the government has a great interest in investing in irrigation infrastructure as an example in 2017 the government initiated the one village one dam program in northern ghana to construct small scale dams 2 2 the impact of irrigated agriculture on nutrition and health outcomes irrigation can affect health and nutrition outcomes through various pathways see fig 1 poorly designed irrigation for instance can bring adverse impacts on the environment and human health through increased water related diseases and drinking water contaminations irrigation systems increase the availability of water for domestic purposes where multiple use water systems are common however it can be a source of domestic water contamination 20 47 50 moreover it can exacerbate the incidence of waterborne diseases by creating favorable conditions for disease vectors such as mosquitoes 6 7 on the one hand irrigated agriculture could increase productivity production diversity and food availability which in turn improve household income and consumption e g refs 3 25 38 41 54 relatedly the increased income associated with irrigation enables households to access improved health care services which can enhance the health and nutrition outcomes of household members irrigation water serves as source of drinking water in many rural communities where access to improved drinking water sources is inadequate 49 53 increasing water availability for domestic purposes helps households to meet basic hygiene practices that improve health associated with water quantity 53 in a related manner increasing water availability reduces the burden of water collection time which is often disproportionately borne by women and girls the time saving from water collection can be used for other income generating activities such as agricultural production social events and childcaring 43 with direct and indirect health consequences a recent review has synthesized the available evidence on the impacts of irrigation on health and nutrition in sub saharan africa see ref 17 for a detailed review 3 methods 3 1 data this study relies on four rounds of geographic specific surveys collected from april 2014 to june 2015 the sample households were selected using a stratified cluster sample design see ref 39 for detailed information informed consent was obtained for participant households of the study the survey instruments for the baseline survey data april may 2014 collected height and weight measurements for children under eight years of age detailed information on agricultural activities irrigated agriculture productive assets income health care expenses household consumption expenditures and other socioeconomic characteristics this survey instrument was repeated for the end line survey in may june 2015 the other two survey waves i e first follow up november december 2014 and second follow up january february 2015 used an abridged version of the baseline survey instrument with anthropometric measures information on income health care expenses irrigated agriculture and other agricultural activities but without the detailed consumption expenses and productive assets information having child level anthropometric measures together with irrigated agriculture activities and detailed household socioeconomic characteristics presents the opportunity to examine the potential mechanisms according to kirk et al 26 the short time duration between the survey waves allows controlling for time constant child characteristics which could not be addressed using cross sectional data the household survey was conducted in ga south municipal urban and shai osudoku rural districts in the greater accra region from the urban district only rural and peri urban communities which are similar to those in the rural district were targeted in the sample selection the main focus of this study is on children living in agricultural households but children from non agricultural households are maintained due to the relatively smaller sample size we restrict the analysis on children with anthropometric measures in the baseline survey or born after the baseline survey see ref 28 the final analysis consists of 1317 child observations across the four survey waves 318 331 392 and 276 child observations in the surveys of april may 2014 november december 2014 january february 2015 and may june 2015 respectively of these 41 6 in all the four surveys 32 6 in three survey waves 16 9 in any two survey waves and 9 in only one survey waves were observed fig 2 depicts a map of the study areas finally the sample is representative neither at the national nor at the district level the study sites were selected purposely based on ex ante information therefore the results may not be generalized to the whole population while we acknowledge that the sample size may be small there are no alternative panel datasets for ghana based on our knowledge containing anthropometrics with representative sample for children in both irrigated and non irrigated agricultural households in ghana access to irrigation is extremely low for example the africa rising baseline evaluation survey arbes report a nationally representative survey in ghana showed that merely 3 of the sampled households declared to irrigate their land 46 similarly in ghana various types of irrigation technologies exist but less than 2 of arable lands are under irrigation 35 these include human powered rope and treadle pumps to liquid fuel engine driven systems and solar powered pumps as well as gravity and river diversion methods 2 this paper uses unbalanced panel data with some of the children not measured in all the survey rounds accordingly the study may suffer from attrition bias although we control for survey round fixed effects in our analyses the attrition rate if systematic and affects one group more than the other could lead to potential upward estimation bias we undertake an analysis of the attrition rate and we find that it is similar for both irrigators and non irrigators appendix g for instance we analyzed the level of attrition rate based on children with only one observation and older than 12 months of age in the baseline data following kirk et al 26 we find that the attrition rate is unaffected by the adoption of irrigated agriculture furthermore the results do not change by defining attrition either to mean children with one or two observations and older than 12 months of age in the baseline data or to mean children with only one or two observations in the data 3 2 estimation strategy anthropometrics measures such as height for age z scores haz weight for age z scores waz and weight for height z scores whz are used as indicators of child nutrition the use of anthropometrics which is recommended by who for child nutrition measures is few in the literature on the impacts of irrigated agriculture anthropometrics measurements are objective indicators and less subject to measurement errors than alternative nutritional indicators such as dietary diversity calorie intakes which are mainly based on recall by the respondent and prone to recall bias the study is based on a random utility framework where a household adopted irrigation technologies to maximize its utility i e child nutrition by comparing it to the utility from non irrigating households further closely following grossman 22 and mangyo 33 this study conceptualizes the nutrition of children as a stock implying that the current level of child nutrition is affected by both current and previous inputs including investments in irrigated agriculture the econometric model for the nutrition production function is specified in its basic form as 1 n i j t i a j t ρ h j t μ c i j t ω v i j t w t d c ε i j t where i represents child t indicates survey waves t 0 1 2 3 j indicates household i a a dummy variable indicating whether household participation in irrigated agriculture n represents child nutritional outcomes h represents the household c represents the child and v represents community level characteristics w t and d c capture survey wave and district fixed effects respectively while ε represents the error term ρ μ and ω are the estimated coefficients assessing the impact of irrigated agriculture on child nutritional outcomes haz waz and whz is challenging due to several reasons including inadequate data and methodological issues one of the main challenges of evaluating the impact of irrigated agriculture based on observational data is the estimation bias due to the non random participation in irrigated agriculture and the self selection of households into adopting irrigation technology hence irrigation technology is not assigned randomly and households may decide whether to adopt irrigation depending on observed and unobservable factors for instance if resource endowed farmers are more likely to participate in irrigated agriculture impact assessments that fail to account for such household s characteristics adequately will lead to biased estimates see ref 16 for discussion on impact evaluation of infrastructures furthermore undernutrition is caused by several factors including the environment prior studies have shown that the benefits of high quality foods on nutrition could be eroded by poor environmental quality such as unsafe drinking water inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices e g refs 55 60 all of these factors could affect the validity of the estimated impact notably if these factors are correlated with irrigated agriculture this study focuses on estimating the impact of irrigated agriculture and its types on child nutritional outcomes as discussed previously participation in irrigated agriculture is non random we therefore employed the ipwra estimator where both outcome and treatment models are specified to address the non random participation in irrigated agriculture the treatment effect is obtained using weighted regression coefficients where the weights are generated from the inverse probabilities of the treatment 56 the ipwra estimator accounts for the misspecification in either the outcome or treatment models thereby generating a robust estimate of the impact of irrigated agriculture based on the observable characteristics 15 31 however one of the main limitations of the ipwra is that it does not consider selections based on unobservable characteristics based on the estimated inverse probability weights weighted regression models for the outcome are fitted using a logit model to generate the expected outcomes of the probabilities of participation and non participation in irrigated agriculture the independent variables are selected based on previous studies on the factors influencing the adoption of irrigation technologies and the availability of information see tables 1 and 3 for variables included in the models the difference between the computed mean outcomes of participants and non participants provides estimates of the treatment effects of irrigated agriculture see refs 31 44 the study relies on teffects ipwra in stata version 14 2 statacorp 2015 for the data analysis in the preferred estimator of ipwra complemented with propensity score matching psm the study analyzes both the average treatment effect ate and average treatment effects on the treated att the att can be obtained with the following mathematical representation 2 a t t i a p i a 0 e n i a p n i a o t i a p e

perspective on the econometric results later presented in this section we find that agriculture is the main livelihood activity in the study area and less than one fourth of the households engaged in irrigated agriculture the most commonly practiced 22 3 irrigation technology is access to water from various water sources followed by cultivating on low lying swamp or marshland 19 2 other types of irrigation including drip irrigation surface irrigation among others 13 6 around 6 3 of the households apply overhead irrigation using a watering can or bucket sprinkler irrigation 3 3 is less widespread in the study area on average families spend about three and a half days each week on irrigated fields the average irrigable farm size is 1 3 ha and the average income from irrigated agriculture is about ghs 1398 equivalent to usd 466 over half of the sampled households entirely depend on family labor for irrigated agriculture irrigating household members experienced health problems such as body pains 86 1 injury 48 1 malaria 38 and respiratory diseases 25 3 in the preceding four weeks before the survey reported in table 2 are child nutritional outcomes by irrigation status and the results show that irrigating households have better child nutrition than non irrigating households column 3 except for haz there are statistically significant mean differences in children s waz and whz between irrigating and non irrigating households the main caution with this result is that it is merely a correlation and not suggestive of the impact of irrigated agriculture summary statistics of the outcome variables by the survey waves are reported in appendix f based on previous empirical studies e g ref 1 we have included a wide range of child parental household and community level characteristics in the empirical models several of these variables are important determinants of child health and nutrition outcomes as shown in table 3 about 80 of the household is male headed with low educational qualification 65 3 with no formal education access to the internet is deficient 11 6 but access to environmental quality indicators are moderately high according to the who s joint monitoring program jmp classifications about 68 of the households have access to improved water supply while 44 have access to improved sanitation around one fifth of the households treat water to make it safer for consumption further most households are living in communities having water bodies half of the children are males and biological children of household heads 75 the self reported prevalence of diarrhea among children is low while fever is relatively high 15 4 additionally table 3 provides summary statistics by irrigation status the results suggest that irrigated households are relatively male headed and educated have significantly better access to the internet and improved drinking water high monthly income more extension visits high presence of cooperative or farmer group organizations and owned more agricultural land on the other hand non irrigated households owned more large livestock than irrigated households on children s characteristics both groups are comparable in terms of age gender and relationship to household head except for health care financing and malaria prevalence lastly imbalances in summary statistics for observational studies are common in the empirical literature in zeweld et al 59 for example seven out of the 11 variables were statistically different at the conventional significance level similarly in pasarelli et al 41 13 out of 21 for ethiopia data and 17 out of 21 variables for tanzania data were statistically different from each other 4 2 econometric results 4 2 1 factors influencing adoption of irrigation technologies in this section we first present the empirical results from logit regressions table 4 which are used to predict the treatment status that is the factors influencing a household s decision on whether to adopt irrigated agriculture column 1 presents a pooled logit model without considering the panel structure of the data columns 2 and 3 report the re logit models considering the panel structure of the data but without including unobserved heterogeneity the last two columns 4 5 summarize the estimates of cre models which consider both the panel nature of the data and unobserved heterogeneity 30 37 45 the results from column 4 our preferred model with clustered standard errors suggest that household access to the internet agricultural extension visits to the community and the presence of cooperative in the community are more likely to increase household adoption of irrigated agriculture column 4 of table 4 these results partly confirm previous studies e g ref 1 on the socio economic correlates of irrigation all these variables could improve household access to information related to agricultural technologies which can increase the likelihood of households to adopt irrigation technology ownership of farmland presence of water resources and religion of household head being christian are also positively associated with irrigation adoption on the other hand ownership of livestock is negatively and significantly associated with irrigation adoption regression results in the other columns show the importance of different institutional and socioeconomic characteristics in influencing the decision of households to undertake irrigated agriculture 4 2 2 effects on nutrition outcomes the effect of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes is summarized in table 5 the estimated coefficients are from the doubly robust ipwra estimator and the treatment models are specified using the covariates reported in table 4 we performed several diagnostic tests for the ipwra and psm estimators we find the model specifications can balance the covariates and samples in the data as the estimated density of the predicted probabilities displays in appendix h1 the two estimated densities have more of their respective masses in the regions where they overlay each other although both plots are relatively skewed to the right for instance we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the ipwra model balanced the covariates included in the regression with a p value of 0 39 suggesting that the overlap assumption may not be violated relatedly the covariance balance summary suggests that matching on the estimated propensity score balanced the covariates that is the variance ratio for all the variables are close to one while the standardized difference is close to zero appendix h2 therefore the results show that once we control for covariates propensity score the probability of treatment is random among irrigators and non irrigators households although the treatment effect estimator has its limitation casual inferences of ipwra or other matching methods are common in the empirical literature see for example 31 44 59 particularly so when further diagnostics statistics support that the models satisfactorily address selection bias in all our regressions we reported both the ate and the att for comparisons our preferred estimation is however the att which is relevant in the context of an impact evaluation where selection into the treatment may be important the results suggest the effect of irrigated agriculture on haz is positive and statistically significant at the 5 level for male children similarly the estimated impact of waz is statistically significant for instance the weight of children living in irrigating households are on average 0 23 units of sd higher compared to children living with non irrigating households and this effect is even larger for male children column 4 panel b of table 5 when disaggregating the sample by age groups the estimated effect of irrigated agriculture is still large and positive and statistically significant at the conventional significance levels the results further reveal that the whz of children of irrigating households is on average 0 27 units of sd more than children of non irrigating households the differential impact of irrigated agriculture on whz is larger and stronger for children aged between 0 and 4 years column 2 panel b of table 5 4 3 differential effects of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes we also examine whether different types of irrigations have different impacts on child nutritional outcomes to test that we estimated the same outcome variables based on irrigation types and the results are summarized in table 6 the estimation strategy compares the various types of irrigation to those not using that specific type of irrigation the analyses assume that the different irrigation types are mutually exclusive although in reality farmers adopt multiple irrigation options particularly on those involving low technology options we do this mainly for practical and methodological reasons the technologies involved are many and the data is too small to allow us to undertake complex analysis of the combination of the irrigation options see ref 12 for analyses of combining agricultural technologies unfortunately we do not have additional irrigation type specific information that could be used to address the above shortcomings moreover some of the irrigation types rely on similar technologies and including dummies of these other types will not be an appropriate exercise from an estimation point of view as they are highly correlated controlling for the covariates should be however adequate to generate relevant evidence a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of different irrigation technologies is an avenue for future research however the estimation approach we employed is relevant as it presents evidence of the differential impacts of irrigated agriculture on child nutrition outcomes our findings suggest that having irrigated fields in the community is positively and significantly associated with all child nutritional indicators except for haz for instance the att estimates suggest that the waz of children with irrigated fields in the community are 0 34 units of sd higher than their counterparts this partly confirms previous studies on the local economy or distributional effects of irrigation 19 52 similarly households cultivating on low lying swamp marshland show positive impacts on child nutritional outcomes panel b of table 6 as can be seen the differential effects of different irrigation types on child nutritional outcomes are generally robust although the estimated att for irrigation type of lifting water from dams canals rivers lakes are positive across for the different nutritional indicators the coefficients are statistically nonsignificant panel d of table 6 note that the ate estimate is enormous and estimated imprecisely which might be due to the small number of samples in this group for instance about 8 of the samples fall in this group and a higher height for age compared to their counterparts could drive this result although we are interested in the att estimates the ate result in panel d should be treated with caution we also observed that the estimated coefficients of the att of the presence of irrigated fields in the community and cultivation on low lying swamp marshland do not have a significant impact on haz long term nutritional indicators in contrast the riverbeds riverbanks irrigation type does not have a considerable effect on whz table 6 an essential policy question is why should different types of irrigated agriculture lead to differential impacts on nutrition the plausible explanation is that in this study context similar to previous studies e g refs 8 41 59 different types of irrigated agriculture are involved with different technologies with associated differences in crops planted productivity returns and cost implications for example planting on riverbeds riverbanks does not involve a large cost for irrigation but this traditional approach is important as it allows for access to water to crops during climatic stress variability the key result is that the adoption of low cost ssi generates differential impacts on child nutrition outcomes in this study context additional descriptive analyses show that there are differences in crops planted and income from the different types of irrigation and these may be influencing the differences in child nutrition outcomes for instance households cultivating on low lying swamp marshland mainly planted okro 55 93 pepper 42 37 rice 33 90 and maize 28 81 besides average income from irrigated agriculture for this group was ghs 1457 12 although the income from irrigated agriculture was on average about ghs 678 44 on the other hand for households relying on overhead irrigation the following were the major crops pepper 60 okro 50 rice 15 and maize 5 major crops planted by those using riverbeds riverbanks were okro 70 maize 50 pepper 43 33 and rice 20 furthermore income from irrigated agriculture for this group was ghs 1348 these results suggest that households using different types of irrigation cultivates either cereals and or vegetables as their major crops and this leads to differences in income 5 pathways other outcomes and robustness checks 5 1 effects on income health care financing and environmental quality in this section we further investigate the possible mechanisms through which irrigated agriculture can affect child nutrition one of the primary pathways that irrigation can impact child nutrition is through the availability of diverse foods which is closely related to nutritional outcomes the data at hand however do not allow us to investigate this channel in detail table 7 reports other possible mechanisms proxies of income environmental quality that irrigation could affect nutrition outcomes most of the estimated coefficients of the att indicates a positive association but none of them is statistically significant except for improved drinking water source the negative effect on bed net per capita raises a vital policy question on why irrigating households do not invest in preventive health care this requires further analyses on the productive expenditure of irrigated agriculture households 5 2 other outcomes we estimate the impacts of irrigated agriculture on child illness diarrhea and fever as shown in table 8 children living in irrigating households are more likely to experienced general illness or fever in the last four weeks preceding the surveys columns 1 3 table 8 although irrigated agriculture can improve child nutrition through household income and food availability irrigation water may exacerbate the prevalence of water related diseases in the community furthermore the results on self reported fever are inconsistent with the paddy paradox and this shows that the estimated results on nutrition are lower bound irrigation systems for instance can serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes that lead to a higher incidence of malaria 6 7 5 3 sensitivity analyses the estimated parameters from the ipwra estimator may suffer from omitted variable bias if unobserved time variant characteristics are correlated with the adoption of irrigation farming and or child nutrition outcomes therefore we conducted several robustness checks using psm re fe and cre estimators and the results are provided in the online supplementary materials propensity score matching was estimated using the nearest neighbor of four nn 4 the results are comparable across different estimation strategies the psm results are summarized in appendices a b c and d rosenbaum bounds on treatment effects estimates for the psm results mainly confirm that there is no hidden bias due to unobserved characteristics appendix i however results obtained from re and cre models show that irrigated agriculture improves haz appendix e1 e2 which was not statistically significant for the ipwra or psm estimators similarly results from fe estimates partly confirms those from the re and cre except that the effects on whz were not statistically significant appendix e3 e4 we also explore the option of addressing selection bias issues using the heckman selection model we assume that child health and nutrition outcome is a function of child and household characteristics and environmental quality in contrast the likelihood of adopting irrigated agriculture is a function of household characteristics and additional baseline information and indirectly the child health and nutrition outcomes via the inclusion of household level characteristics which we think determine the child health and nutrition outcomes the estimated inverse mills ratios are not statistically significant p value of 0 483 suggesting that sample selection bias is less likely 6 conclusion and policy implications agricultural development primarily irrigated agriculture has the potential of reducing undernutrition in lmics despite its large potential benefits investments in agriculture are low in many sub saharan african countries in this study we examined whether households engaged in irrigated agriculture have improved child nutrition outcomes using a panel household survey data and a doubly robust estimator we find that irrigated agriculture led to large improvements in child nutrition outcomes with considerable gains for males and under five children for instance a child living with an irrigating household gains 0 23 units of sd in waz and 0 27 units of sd in whz in the study period the findings on male children indicate the biases in intrahousehold resource allocation toward this group which is in concurrence with earlier findings e g ref 40 the estimated results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation techniques disaggregating irrigation by types the results show that the presence of irrigated fields in the community planting on riverbeds and lifting water from water sources have larger impacts on child nutrition compared to overhead and other irrigation types while there is a broad consensus on the importance of investments in irrigation as a policy towards the reduction of undernutrition there is still debate on the types of irrigation that could deliver these nutritional benefits our findings also suggest that some of the irrigation types such as planting on riverbeds and lifting water from water sources generate higher nutrition benefits than overhead irrigation type moreover the presence of irrigated fields in the community generates improved nutrition outcomes this implies that irrigated agriculture generates community level benefits aside from the benefits accrued to an individual or household the results suggest that investment in low cost ssi generates nutrition benefits in the study context the potential pathways that irrigation impacts child nutrition could be increased in demand for environmental quality and health care financing rather than decreases in illness incidences the latter is not surprising as the results show that irrigated agriculture does not lead to investments in preventive health care e g bednets leading to a high incidence of self reported fever cases although the results are not statistically significant diarrhea incidences are consistently lower finally the study identifies several areas for future research on the impacts of irrigation on child nutrition outcomes the sample for the study is relatively small and due to the complexity of the linkages between irrigated agriculture and nutrition future studies based on nationally representative data could shed additional light on these linkages additionally although we attempt to reduce selection problems to the extent possible using various econometric techniques causal interpretation of the results may be biased this is so because treatment effects models and panel regressions may not be able to address all issues related to endogeneity and therefore the causal interpretation of empirical findings maybe be viewed with some caution for instance unobserved child or household characteristics can still bias the true coefficient of the impacts of irrigation on child nutrition outcome despite these limitations the results obtained from this study are robust to various model specifications and are relevant for policymakers as well as researchers on the nutrition impacts of irrigation in lmics including ghana author contribution charles y okyere conceptualization formal analysis funding
