23275,creep failure of hmpe ropes is a major concern for the application of hmpe ropes in deepwater moorings hence the creep and creep rupture behaviors of hmpe samples were systematically investigated by utilizing a special experimental set up the procedure and techniques for performing creep rupture tests of hmpe samples were proposed in detail which can be a reference for other sizes of synthetic fiber ropes the test results illustrated that the completed creep rupture curves include the primary secondary and tertiary creep stages to simulate the test results of hmpe samples a viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model was developed based on thermodynamics and a method for identifying the model parameters was proposed in detail moreover the comparison of the model predictions with test data at different loading levels was performed and it showed satisfactory agreement which means the present model can well simulate creep rupture behaviors of hmpe samples the present study helps to improve the understanding of creep rupture behaviors of hmpe ropes for deepwater moorings keywords hmpe rope viscoelasticity viscoplasticity viscodamage model mooring creep rupture 1 introduction with offshore oil exploration moving into deeper waters the taut wire mooring system tms with synthetic fiber ropes used as the main part of mooring lines becomes widely applied petruska et al 2010 compared with catenary mooring systems cms with chains or wire ropes the tms shows lots of advantages such as less self weight of mooring lines smaller anchorage radius and smaller platform offsets due to higher restoring stiffness of fiber ropes abs 2011 api 2015 note that most of the restoring forces in the cms are generated by the weight of mooring chains or steel ropes while in the tms the restoring forces are directly generated by the elongation of fiber ropes beltran 2006 mohanraj et al 2011 zhang 2011 as shown in fig 1 in the tms forces are exerted on each fiber mooring rope which are connectors between the floating structure and anchors normally the fiber mooring ropes act as the loading transfers and play a vital role in the security operation of taut wire mooring systems hence it is necessary to investigate the long term mechanical behavior of fiber mooring ropes polyester and high modulus polyethylene hmpe ropes are the most common types of fiber ropes in tms polyester rope does not show significant creep at loads and temperatures normally experienced in mooring applications abs 2011 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 but its lower stiffness may not satisfy the requirement of ultra deepwater mooring at depth over 2000m due to that hmpe ropes show higher stiffness compared to those of polyester hmpe ropes have potential to be utilized as alternatives of polyester ropes in ultra deepwater moorings davies et al 2002 however hmpe shows easier creep which is a concern for permanent moorings but can be dealt with in temporary moorings leite and boesten 2011 hmpe fiber is produced in various types dsm dyneema disclosed the development of an hmpe fiber with creep properties that can meet offshore permanent mooring lines for which typically polyester is used vlasblom et al 2012 however the creep performance of hmpe ropes can be strongly affected by the loading time and loading levels therefore investigating the creep and creep rupture behavior of hmpe ropes is desirable for engineering typically by performing creep rupture tests of hmpe components such as fiber yarn strand and sub ropes the corresponding creep rupture curves including the primary secondary and tertiary stages can be obtained as shown in fig 2 smeets et al 2001 vlasblom and bosman 2006 abs 2011 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 however performing creep rupture tests of fiber ropes is time consuming and needs a special experimental set up that can provide long term constant loads hence short term creep and creep rupture tests on fiber or yarn samples are usually performed and the corresponding models are developed jacobs 1999 first systematically performed short term creep tests of hmpe yarns and proposed a creep rate model to describe the corresponding creep behavior vlasblom and bosman 2006 updated jacobs s model to accurately predict the creep rate but still neglected modeling the tertiary creep of hmpe yarns note that synthetic fiber ropes made of materials such as polyester aramid and hmpe show viscoelastic and viscoplastic behavior davies et al 2003 chailleux and davies 2005 vlasblom and van dingenen 2009 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 huang et al 2013 hence davies et al 2003 and chailleux and davies 2005 originally applied schapery s viscoelastic and perzyna s viscoplastic model to predict the strain of test yarns in addition derombise et al 2011 employed the same model to describe the creep recovery strains and the aging effect of aramid fibers to more accurately simulate the creep recovery test results from the references davies et al 2003 chailleux and davies 2005 huang et al 2013 proposed schapery s theory combined with owen s viscoplastic model however the above researches merely focused on the phenomena of short term behavior of fiber ropes and hence their models can not simulate the tertiary creep due to the absence of damage variable the damage variable was first proposed by kachanov 1986 1999 which made great contribution to the development of continuum damage mechanics in the research field of fiber ropes karayaka et al 1999 initially proposed applying the continuum damage theory to the fiber ropes but they did not develop a quantitative model based on the damage theory beltran et al 2003 2017 and beltran and williamson 2004 2005 2009 2010 proposed a numerical damage model to describe the degradation of rope under the static tensile load but their model has not yet been applied to predict the creep rupture behavior of fiber ropes hence da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 systematically conducted the creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe yarns and first proposed a model to simulate the creep rupture strains of hmpe yarns based on thermodynamics but this model cannot describe the primary creep due to the lack of describing the viscoelastic effect to further understand the creep damage of hmpe stands lian et al 2015 systematically performed the creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe strands and developed a model based on schapery s model and kachanov s damage evolution law their numerical results showed that the model can effectively describe the viscoelastic damage behavior of hmpe strands however the viscoplastic behavior of fiber ropes is neglected in the model which means that the model still needs to be improved note that many thermodynamic models have been developed to describe the nonlinear damage evolution behavior of metals polymers and asphalt mixtures darabi et al 2011a 2011b 2013 konartakhteh 2011 abu al rub and darabi 2012 zhu and sun 2013 however little research to date has focused on the viscoelastic viscoplastic viscodamage model for fiber ropes da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 konartakhteh 2011 hence to accurately capture the creep rupture behavior of hmpe ropes a viscoelastic viscoplastic viscodamage model should be proposed the present study aims to investigate the creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples first the creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe samples are performed by utilizing a special experimental set up and the results show that the completed creep rupture curves possess three stages including the primary secondary and tertiary stage second to capture the creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples a coupled viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model is developed within the framework of thermodynamics the parameter identification methods are also introduced in detail which apply to any component of fiber ropes in the end the feasibility of the present model is examined by the experimental data of hmpe strands within the authors knowledge it is the first time to utilize a viscoelastic viscoplastic viscodamage model to capture the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands the present work not only helps to investigate the creep failure of hmpe ropes but also helps to ensure the safety operations of the hmpe mooring systems 2 experimental study on creep behavior of hmpe samples to investigate creep behavior of hmpe samples an experimental set up is designed and adopted to perform tests on fiber ropes the experimental set up mainly consists of a loading element a measurement system a water cyclic system and equipment foundation as shown in fig 3 the set up can provide the static tensile load cyclic load and constant load for fiber ropes a detailed description about the experimental set up can be found in elsewhere lian et al 2017 the test samples are hmpe strands with a diameter of about 2 mm which have been carefully extracted from the 12 strand braid hmpe rope with a diameter of 6 mm for the hmpe rope construction the pitch length p helix angle α and helix radius a of the rope components strands are equal to 40 mm 20 and 2 637 mm respectively as presented in fig 4 the average breaking strength abs of the test strands is 3 02 kn and its standard deviation is 0 16 kn these values are obtained by five breaking tests and their static capacity curves are presented in fig 5 utilizing these hmpe strands 10 experimental cases are designed as listed in table 1 in which l c denotes the constant loading level and f c denotes the loading value the test temperature is 18 c the total length of hmpe strands is 2 4 m and the splice length is 0 3 m the gauge length in the middle of the sample is 0 3 m to obtain valid test results hmpe strands are installed in the experimental set up for each case in table 1 by utilizing the eye splice method which is proved by mckenna et al 2004 after that the bedding in process recommended by bureau veritas 2007 is used for each sample when the bedding in process is completed the sample is loaded at a rate of 10 n s until the tension equals the setting value f 0 a schematic of the creep test presented in fig 6 shows that creep begins when the load equals the setting value the displacement of the gauge length and the load value of samples are measured by the wire displacement transducer and the load transducer respectively the acquisition of measured data is 9 points per second to verify the reliability of measured data each case is carried out at least twice based on the measured data the creep strains are calculated the measured creep curves and the corresponding creep rate curves of hmpe samples at different loading levels 10 20 30 40 50 abs are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively similarly the creep rupture curves and the corresponding creep rate curves of hmpe samples at different loading levels 60 65 70 75 80 abs are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively as can be observed from figs 7 10 the creep strains show different creep stages specifically figs 9 and 10 illustrate that the creep rupture curves of hmpe samples present three creep stages including the primary secondary and tertiary stages in the primary stage the creep rate decreases with time from an initial rapid rate this is followed by a secondary creep stage in which the creep rate is small and increases very slightly with time however in the tertiary stage the creep rate of hmpe samples increases sharply with strain until the samples fracture as can been seen from the results of hmpe strands the secondary creep rate increases with the increase of the loading level while the failure time decreases with the increase of loading levels these nonlinear stress dependent behavior cause difficulty in capturing the completed creep rupture stages of hmpe samples however in the present study the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands are systematically investigated which will improve the understanding of the creep mechanism of hmpe samples 3 thermodynamic derivation of the constitutive model 3 1 effective configuration to provide a better understanding of the creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples a continuum damage model is proposed based on thermodynamics as we all known the concept of a damage variable was originally proposed by kachanov 1958 and subsequently developed by others rabotnov 1968 lemaitre and chaboche 1990 in the present study the hypothesis of isotropic damage and strain equivalence are adopted hence the damage density or damage variable ϕ is a scalar quantity and the stress in the effective configuration σ i j is written as 1 σ i j σ i j 1 ϕ where σ i j is the stress in the damaged configuration i e the nominal stress 3 2 basic thermodynamic theory to grasp the mechanical properties of fiber ropes the main challenges are to develop appropriate constitutive equations and to determine the evolution law of the internal state variables the most effective method is widely based on the basic laws of thermodynamics lemaitre and chaboche 1990 konartakhteh 2011 the first law of thermodynamics is utilized to describe the conservation of energy while the second law of thermodynamics is applied to account for a dissipative system the second law of thermodynamics is written as lemaitre and chaboche 1990 2 σ i j ε i j ρ φ η t 1 t q i i t 0 where ρ ρ φ ρ η q and t are the mass density the helmholtz free energy density the specific entropy density the heat flux vector and temperature respectively it is generally assumed that once the material is damaged further loading only affects the undamaged part of the material therefore the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage models are considered as functions of effective stress hence the inequality 2 in the effective configuration is written as 3 σ i j ε i j ρ φ η t 1 t q i i t 0 based on the assumption of small deformation the total effective strain is divided into viscoelastic and viscoplastic strains hence the total effective strain rate is obtained 4 ε i j ε i j v e ε i j v p in the framework of effective stress the constitutive model is defined as a function of variables which include the viscoelastic strain tensor in the effective configuration ε i j v e phenomenological internal state variables associated with the viscoelastic processes ξ m m 1 m int v e m int v e 1 the accumulative viscoplastic strain in the effective configuration p the isotropic damage density and the temperature hence the helmholtz free energy is written as a function of the state variables in the effective configuration as follows konartakhteh 2011 5 φ φ ε i j v e ξ m p ϕ t taking the time derivative of the helmholtz free energy implies 6 φ φ ε i j v e ε i j v e φ ξ m ξ m ρ φ p p φ ϕ ϕ φ t t substituting eq 6 and eq 4 into the inequality 3 yields the following constraint 7 σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e ε i j v e ρ φ ξ m ξ m σ i j ε i j v p ρ φ p p ρ φ ϕ ϕ ρ φ t η t 1 t q i i t 0 assuming the isothermal conditions the inequality inequation 7 can be written as 8 σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e ε i j v e ρ φ ξ m ξ m σ i j ε i j v p ρ φ p p ρ φ ϕ ϕ 0 based on the inequality above the thermodynamic conjugate forces and state laws are defined as follows 9a l i j σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e 9b q m ρ φ ξ m 9c κ ρ φ p 9d y ρ φ ϕ where q m κ and y are the thermodynamic conjugate forces associated with ξ m p and ϕ respectively considering that the clausius duhem inequality namely inequation 8 is valid for all load histories konartakhteh 2011 abu al rub and darabi 2012 assumed a completely reversible loading history which indicates that the rate of the state variables vanishes i e p 0 ϕ 0 and ξ m 0 m 1 m int v e hence eq 9a is rewritten as 10 σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e in addition by substituting eqs 9a and 9d into inequation 8 the rate of the total energy dissipation is rewritten as 11 π l i j ε i j v e q m ξ m σ i j ε i j v p κ p y ϕ 0 the rate of the total energy dissipation π in eq 11 is decomposed into the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage parts as follows 12 π π v e π v p π v d 0 13 π v e l i j ε i j v e q m ξ m 14 π v p σ i j ε i j v p κ p 15 π v d y ϕ the above thermodynamic framework has been used to derive constitutive equations for different materials especially metals and polymers lévesque et al 2008 konartakhteh 2011 darabi et al 2011b abu al rub and darabi 2012 however few studies can be found on utilizing the thermodynamic theory to derive the coupled viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model for fiber ropes da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 konartakhteh 2011 3 3 the helmholtz free energy the definition of helmholtz free energy is important to establish a concise constitutive model lemaitre and chaboche 1990 darabi et al 2011b zhu and sun 2013 in the present study to describe the changes in stored energy of fiber ropes the helmholtz free energy is decomposed into viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage parts the viscoelastic part is defined to establish the viscoelastic constitutive relation the viscoplastic part describes the evolution mechanism of plastic hardening the viscodamage part reflects the amount of free energy which is released during the process of damage evolution the present study assumes that fiber ropes are decoupled material hence the helmholtz free energy is written as konartakhteh 2011 darabi et al 2011b abu al rub and darabi 2012 zhu and sun 2013 16 φ ε i j v e ξ m p ϕ φ v e ε i j v e ξ m φ v p p φ v d ϕ where φ v e ε i j v e ξ m is the viscoelastic stored energy while φ v p p and φ v d ϕ are the energies due to material viscoplastic hardening and damage evolution respectively darabi et al 2011b zhu and sun 2013 in the classical viscoelastic theory it is assumed that the viscoelastic part of the helmholtz free energy can be described by utilizing a taylor expansion of the state variables around the reference state where σ ε i j v e ξ m 0 schapery 1969 lévesque et al 2008 darabi et al 2011b konartakhteh 2011 especially schapery 1969 introduced nonlinear dependency parameters to define the viscoelastic part of the helmholtz free energy hence this can be written as abu al rub and darabi 2012 17 ρ φ v e 1 2 a 0 ε v e p i j k l ε i j v e ε k l v e a 1 ε v e p i j m 1 ε i j v e ζ m 1 2 p m m 2 ζ m ζ n where a 0 ε v e and a 1 ε v e are included to make the viscoelastic model nonlinear the matrices p i j k l p i j m 1 and p m m 2 are positive definite following the hardening equation proposed by lemaitre and chaboche 1990 which is an exponential function of the effective viscoplastic strain the viscoplastic part of the helmholtz free energy is proposed 18 ρ φ v p p a exp b ε e f f d p where a and b are material parameters ε e f f ε i j ε i j is the total effective strain which is proposed to couple the viscoelastic and viscoplastic models with the viscodamage model in addition rabotnov 1968 proposed a damage evolution equation in which the rate of damage density is an exponential function of both the effective viscoplastic strain and 1 ϕ nedjar and roy 2012 proposed the driving source of damage to develop a strain based damage model following their works the viscodamage part of helmholtz free energy is expressed in the following form 19 ρ φ v d s p exp a 0 1 ϕ m 0 d ϕ where a 0 and m 0 are viscodamage parameters s p is the driving source of damage which depends only on the value of the effective viscoplastic strain p mai et al 2012 nedjar and roy 2012 3 4 viscoelastic model based on the laws of thermodynamics and laplace transform schapery 1969 lévesque et al 2008 darabi et al 2011b konartakhteh 2011 schapery s nonlinear viscoelastic model in the effective stress space can be written as follows 20 ε i j v e g 0 d i j k l 0 t σ k l g 1 0 ψ δ d i j k l ψ t ψ τ d g 2 σ k l d τ d τ considering the uniaxial deformation of fiber ropes the one dimensional schapery s model is written as 21 ε t g 0 d 0 σ t g 1 0 t δ d ψ t ψ τ d g 2 σ t d τ d τ where ε t is the strain to reflect the effects of damaged fibers d 0 and δ d are the compliance components ψ t is the reduced time given by 22 ψ t 0 t d s a σ σ s where the parameters g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are functions of the effective stress σ t the transient compliance δ d is expressed as the prony series that are more accurate and convenient than other functions especially under complex loadings park and schapery 1999 marklund et al 2006 huang et al 2013 as follows 23 δ d ψ n 1 n d n 1 exp λ n ψ where d n is the nth coefficient of the prony series n is the number of the terms λ n is the nth reciprocal of retardation time in addition the first term of the viscoelastic part instantaneous strain in eq 21 rules the capacity curves of test samples in fig 5 hence to effectively predict the capacity curve of fiber samples a tangent modulus has been advised beltran et al 2017 this section is about the viscoelastic model which has been proposed and utilized in the references schapery 1969 davies et al 2003 lévesque et al 2008 darabi et al 2011b konartakhteh 2011 derombise et al 2011 huang et al 2013 2015 lian et al 2015 in addition to describe the special behavior of fiber ropes the viscoelastic model is then coupled to different viscoplastic and viscodamage model 3 5 viscoplastic model to obtain the viscoplastic evolution law the maximum dissipation principle is widely adopted this principle declares that the actual states of the thermodynamic forces are those that maximize the inelastic dissipation function over all possible states to use the principle of maximum energy dissipation the objective function ω 1 is proposed as shown in eq 24 this describes three factors including the energy dissipation of thermo viscoplastic part π v p in eq 14 the corresponding lagrange multiplier λ v p and the constraint condition f 0 24 ω 1 π v p λ v p f σ i j ε i j v p κ p λ v p f where f is the yield criterion p is the effective viscoplastic strain rate defined as p 2 3 ε i j v p ε i j v p in the one dimensional case the effective viscoplastic strain p is simplified to the viscoplastic strain ε v p namely p ε v p based on perzyna s viscoplastic theory perzyna 1971 the yield criterion for nonlinear mechanical behavior of fiber ropes is assumed as follows 25 f σ i j σ y n 1 κ where κ is the isotropic hardening function depended on the total strain κ can now be determined by using eqs 9c and 18 26 κ a exp b ε i j the isotropic hardening function is shown that the yield function is strengthened with the increase of the total strain it is compatible with the form proposed by lemaitre and chaboche 1990 by utilizing the principle of maximum energy dissipation for the objective function namely ω 1 the constrained equation can be expressed as 27 ω 1 σ i j 0 ω 1 κ 0 by substituting eq 25 into 24 and utilizing eq 27 the corresponding viscoplastic strain evolution and the effective plastic strain evolution laws can be obtained as follows 28 ε i j v p λ v p f σ i j 29 p λ v p f κ considering the special mechanical behavior of fiber ropes it is assumed that fiber rope complies with the non associated flow rule i e the yield criterion and plastic potential are not the same hence the plastic potential is assumed as follows 30 f σ i j p σ i j σ y n 1 a exp b ε i j f 1 a exp b ε i j hence the non associated flow rule can be written as 31 ε i j v p λ v p f σ i j in addition the lagrange multiplier can be obtained through the consistency condition which shows that the stress is always maintained at subsequent yield surface which is the foundation of perzyna theory perzyna 1971 based on perzyna viscoplastic theory the plastic multiplier λ v p is taken as the form of λ v p m γ f n where γ f is the function of yield criterion the special situation is that γ f equals f x is the macaulay bracket x x when x 0 and x 0 when x 0 m and n are material constants hence the viscoplastic constitutive equation is obtained such that 32 ε i j v p m γ f n f σ i j eq 32 shows that the direction of the increment of viscoplastic strain are parallel to the direction of the external normal of the potential function based on the derivation above for the one dimensional loading condition of fiber ropes the viscoplastic yield surface is reduced as follows 33 f σ σ y a exp b ε the plastic potential function can be written as 34 f σ ε v p σ σ y n 1 a exp b ε then according to perzyna theory perzyna 1971 the viscoplastic strain rate is given by 35 ε i j v p σ σ y f v p α v p exp β v p ε where a v p m a n β v p b n and f v p n are viscoplastical parameters of model for fiber ropes 3 6 viscodamage model to obtain the damage evolution law the maximum dissipation principle is widely adopted this principle claims that the actual states of the thermodynamic forces are those that maximize the inelastic dissipation function over all possible states konartakhteh 2011 to maximize the rate of energy dissipation the following objective function ω 2 in eq 36 is proposed this reflects the rate of energy dissipation of the viscodamage part π v d in eq 15 the corresponding lagrange multiplier λ v d and the constraint condition g 0 36 ω 2 π v d λ v d g where π v d is the rate of viscodamage energy dissipation and g is a damage criterion based on the maximum dissipation principle the evolution law can be obtained by satisfying the necessary condition for the objective function namely ω 2 as follows 37 ω 2 y 0 by substituting eq 36 into eq 37 and making use of eq 15 the thermodynamic law corresponding to the evolution of the damage variable yields 38 ϕ λ v d g y where lagrange multiplier λ v d can be determined by satisfying the consistency conditions for viscodamage loading surfaces i e g 0 a damage criterion is formulated as follows 39 g ϕ p y y 0 exp a 0 1 ϕ m 0 s p y 0 0 where y is the released rate of strain energy density y 0 is the initial damage threshold a 0 is a stress dependent parameter which is defined as a 0 a d σ max h s p is the driving source of damage which depends solely on the effective viscoplastic strain which describes that damage level is associated with the plastic hardening degree mai et al 2012 nedjar and roy 2012 the driving source of damage can be assumed as 40 s p α 1 exp β 1 p besides substituting eq 19 into 9d yields 41 y exp a 0 1 ϕ m 0 s p an associative viscodamage flow rule is used for fiber ropes hence the damage criterion equals the viscodamage potential function according to the consistency conditions lagrange multipliers λ v d can be obtained i e g ϕ p 0 42 λ v d ϕ s p a 0 m 0 1 ϕ m 0 1 s p by substituting eq 40 into eq 42 the evolution of the damage variable is obtained 43 ϕ β 1 p a 0 m 0 1 ϕ m 0 1 for the unidimensional case the effective viscoplastic strain equals viscoplastic strain i e p ε v p considering that fiber ropes endure axial tensions the damage evolution law in eq 43 can be written as follows 44 ϕ β 1 ε v p a 0 m 0 1 ϕ m 0 1 by substituting the viscoplastic strain rate in eq 35 into eq 44 the damage evolution law is written as 45 ϕ a e σ max h σ σ y f v p α v p exp β v p ε 1 ϕ m e where parameters a e β 1 a d m 0 and m e 1 m 0 are defined to simplify the equation eq 45 which derived from the thermodynamic shows that both the term of exponential function of strain and the power function of the damage variable are similar to the damage evolution law in the references abu al rub and darabi 2012 zhu and sun 2013 however other terms in eq 45 are different from those obtained in the references eq 45 aims to describe the damage evolution behavior of fiber ropes 3 7 summary set of constitutive equations in summary to describe the coupling viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage behavior of fiber ropes a constitutive model developed with the thermodynamic theory can be described by the following set of constitutive equations 46 ε ε v e ε v p σ σ 1 ϕ ε v e t g 0 d 0 σ t g 1 0 t δ d ψ t ψ τ d g 2 σ t d τ d τ ε v p σ σ y f v p α v p exp β v p ε ϕ a e σ max h σ σ y f v p α v p exp β v p ε 1 ϕ m e 4 numerical implementation in the present study the numerical algorithm is straightforward when the stress history is prescribed and the corresponding strain output is to be determined hence an approximate solution based on a recursive method is presented first the effective stress namely σ is obtained according to eq 1 second after the effective stress is updated the viscoelastic and viscoplastic strains can be calculated third the damage value is calculated based on the damage value of the previous step and the damage evolution law namely eq 45 the incremental form for small strain problems is shown as follows 47 ε t ε v e t ε v p t ε t δ t δ ε t ε v e t δ t ε v p t δ t δ ε v e t δ ε v p t 48 ε v e t ε v e t δ t δ ε v e t 49 ε v p t ε v p t δ t δ ε v p t 50 σ t σ t δ t δ σ t note that t indicates the current time t δ t denotes the previous time the magnitude of time step is set as 0 1 s in the present study values of the stress and internal variables from the previous step i e at time t δ t are given hence the key step is to update the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage values the viscoelastic strain increments can be expressed as follows 51 δ ε v e t ε v e t ε v e t δ t g 0 t d 0 g 1 t g 2 t n 1 n d n 1 1 ⅇ λ n δ ψ t λ n δ ψ t σ t g 1 t n 1 n d n q n t δ

t δ t σ t δ t δ t 1 ⅇ λ n δ ψ t δ t λ n δ ψ t δ t where the variable q n t δ t is a component of the hereditary integral for every prony series term n at the previous time step t δ t the hereditary integral at the end of the time increment i e at time t namely q n t can be expressed as follows haj ali and muliana 2004 huang et al 2015 52 q n t 0 t e λ n ψ t ψ τ d g 2 τ σ τ d τ d τ e λ n δ ψ q n t δ t 1 e λ n δ ψ t λ n δ ψ t g 2 t σ t g 2 t δ t σ t δ t specifically under the condition of constant stress σ c the viscoelastic strain can be calculated as ε v e t g 0 t d 0 σ c t g 1 t g 2 t n 1 n d n 1 1 ⅇ λ n δ ψ t λ n δ ψ t σ c t in addition based on eq 35 when σ t δ t σ y the increment of the viscoplastic strain can be written as 53 δ ε v p t σ t δ t σ y f v p α v p exp β v p ε t δ t δ t once the incremental viscoelastic and viscoplastic strains are determined the total strain at current time is calculated after that the rate of damage density can be obtained according to eq 45 the updated damage density can be given as 54 ϕ t ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t finally according to the undated damage density the damage state of fiber ropes can be determined if the value of damage density is smaller than the maximum damage value which equals one the procedure will update the total effective stress and strains a flow chart of the numerical implementation is shown in appendix a 5 parameters identification and model validation to validate the present creep rupture model the parameter identifications for the constitutive model are proposed and the prediction results are compared with the experimental data at different loading levels 5 1 parameter identifications for the constitutive model parameter identifications play an important role in model application hence it is necessary to propose a convenient method for characterizing the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage parameters in the present model based on the fact that hmpe ropes show creep rupture behavior which include the primary secondary and tertiary stages the total strain can be divided into the recoverable and irrecoverable components as illustrated in fig 11 the recoverable component denotes the viscoelastic strains as shown in fig 11 b the irrecoverable component is made up of viscoplastic and viscodamage strains as shown in fig 11 c hence the parameters of viscoplastic and viscodamage models can be determined by analyzing the secondary and tertiary creep stages respectively after the parameters of the irrecoverable component are calibrated the viscoelastic parameters can be identified the detailed procedure for parameter identifications is shown as follows as shown in figs 9 and 10 the tertiary creep rate is different from the creep rate of the secondary stage therefore to clearly obtain the parameters of the irrecoverable component we assumed that the secondary creep rate is mainly caused by the viscoplastic part and the tertiary creep rate is mainly caused by the damage part in addition the strain range can affect the damage evolution beltran and williamson 2005 however for the present experimental results of hmpe samples we found that damage of rope samples in the secondary stage is much less than that in the tertiary stage hence we assumed that the damage in the secondary stage due to strain range is negligible to calibrate the viscoplastic parameters in eq 35 including α v p β v p and f v p the creep strain stress and creep rate in the secondary stage are analyzed utilizing the least square method this method is reasonable considering that the increment of the viscoplastic strain is dependent on both the effective stress and the total strain in addition the effective stress is approximately equal to the nominal stress in the secondary creep stage because the damage of test samples in the secondary stage is smaller than that in the tertiary stage in the present study the yield stress of 10 abs is adopted because under 10 abs which is considered to be low enough stress the test samples only exhibit viscoelasticity huang et al 2013 besides experimental data of cases 9 and 10 in which loading levels equal 75 and 80 abs are applied by utilizing the above calibrated method the viscoplastic parameters including α v p β v p and f v p are obtained as listed in table 2 to calibrate the viscodamage parameters in eq 45 the experimental data in the tertiary stage are utilized by adopting the same least square method considering that the damage changes significantly in the tertiary stage the start point of the tertiary creep stage can be defined as the initial value of the damage which equals zero the rupture strain corresponds to the maximum damage value which equals one hence the strain in the tertiary stage corresponds to the closed interval of damage 0 1 analyzing the total strain damage and damage rate the viscodamage parameters including a e h and m e in eq 45 are obtained as listed in table 3 therefore after the viscoplastic and viscodamage effects of the creep data are subtracted the viscoelastic component of strain can be obtained and utilized to characterize the viscoelastic parameters at this step six terms of the prony series are adopted according to the previous researches park and schapery 1999 huang et al 2013 in addition four parameters including d 0 g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ need to be identified the procedure for identifying the viscoelastic parameters is presented as follows under the condition of the constant stress σ c the viscoelastic strain is written as 55 ε ve t 1 g 0 d 0 σ c g 1 g 2 δ d t 1 a σ σ c if the constant stress level σ c is low the material is in the linear region and the parameters including g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are equal to one by fitting eq 55 to the creep strain at the low stress level the coefficients of the prony series and d 0 can be obtained similarly by utilizing the same calibrated method for viscoelastic strain at higher stress levels g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are obtained then according to the identified values of g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ at different stress levels the polynomial interpolations are performed to obtain the corresponding parameters for an arbitrary stress according to the calibrated method for viscoelastic parameters utilizing the viscoelastic strain at 10 abs level coefficients of the prony series listed in table 4 and the instantaneous compliance d 0 2 146 10 2 are obtained subsequently the parameters g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are obtained for each stress level as listed in table 5 based on these values the corresponding polynomial interpolations are performed as shown in figs 12 14 then the polynomial interpolation functions are listed in table 6 the corresponding correlation coefficients of functions g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are 0 993 0 976 and 0 993 respectively hence based on the equations in table 6 the viscoelastic parameters at other loading levels can be calculated through the above procedure the viscoplastic viscodamage and viscoelastic parameters can be effectively identified 5 2 model validation after the model parameters are obtained the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands at other loading levels 60 65 and 70 abs are calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental results to validate the present model the comparisons between prediction data and test results are shown in fig 15 the average errors between the prediction data and test data are 1 55 2 09 and 1 64 for the corresponding loading levels 60 65 and 70 abs respectively these comparisons prove that the prediction values at different loading levels match well with the corresponding test data note that the time duration of the validation case is about 13 h for 60 abs while the longest time for parameter calibration is only about 3 h this illustrates that the present model can efficiently predict the competed creep rupture responses of hmpe strands although the present model and the parameter identification method are only verified on hmpe strands they can apply to any component of fiber ropes within the range of tested strand creep conditions 10 80 abs for different structures or types of fiber rope the model parameters are different but they can be identified by following the parameter identification methods established in the present study 6 concluding remarks hmpe ropes have potential to be used as alternatives to polyester ropes but their creep failure has been a great concern for their application in mooring engineering hence it is necessary to investigate the creep behavior of hmpe ropes in the present study creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe strands at different loading levels were performed utilizing a specially designed experimental system the procedure and techniques for performing creep tests of hmpe strands were proposed in detail which can be a reference for other sizes of fiber ropes the experimental results illustrated that the creep rupture curves of hmpe samples present primary secondary and tertiary stages which change with the loading level and loading time to describe the creep behavior of hmpe samples a coupled viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model was developed within the framework of thermodynamics and a method for calibrating the model parameters was proposed utilizing the present model the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands at other loading levels 60 65 and 70 abs are predicted and compared with the corresponding experimental results overall the prediction results match well with the corresponding test data at the same loading level note that in the present study only the short term creep data were utilized to calibrate model parameters while the completed creep rupture data at different loading levels were compared with the prediction results this shows the parameters can be conveniently calibrated utilizing the short term test data and the completed creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples at different loading levels can be effectively captured specifically the proposed model can predict the creep rupture tests of hmpe samples at low loading levels whereas performing the creep rupture tests would be very time consuming hence the present studies can be useful for gaining a better understanding of the creep rupture behavior of hmpe ropes acknowledgements financial support from the national natural science

23275,creep failure of hmpe ropes is a major concern for the application of hmpe ropes in deepwater moorings hence the creep and creep rupture behaviors of hmpe samples were systematically investigated by utilizing a special experimental set up the procedure and techniques for performing creep rupture tests of hmpe samples were proposed in detail which can be a reference for other sizes of synthetic fiber ropes the test results illustrated that the completed creep rupture curves include the primary secondary and tertiary creep stages to simulate the test results of hmpe samples a viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model was developed based on thermodynamics and a method for identifying the model parameters was proposed in detail moreover the comparison of the model predictions with test data at different loading levels was performed and it showed satisfactory agreement which means the present model can well simulate creep rupture behaviors of hmpe samples the present study helps to improve the understanding of creep rupture behaviors of hmpe ropes for deepwater moorings keywords hmpe rope viscoelasticity viscoplasticity viscodamage model mooring creep rupture 1 introduction with offshore oil exploration moving into deeper waters the taut wire mooring system tms with synthetic fiber ropes used as the main part of mooring lines becomes widely applied petruska et al 2010 compared with catenary mooring systems cms with chains or wire ropes the tms shows lots of advantages such as less self weight of mooring lines smaller anchorage radius and smaller platform offsets due to higher restoring stiffness of fiber ropes abs 2011 api 2015 note that most of the restoring forces in the cms are generated by the weight of mooring chains or steel ropes while in the tms the restoring forces are directly generated by the elongation of fiber ropes beltran 2006 mohanraj et al 2011 zhang 2011 as shown in fig 1 in the tms forces are exerted on each fiber mooring rope which are connectors between the floating structure and anchors normally the fiber mooring ropes act as the loading transfers and play a vital role in the security operation of taut wire mooring systems hence it is necessary to investigate the long term mechanical behavior of fiber mooring ropes polyester and high modulus polyethylene hmpe ropes are the most common types of fiber ropes in tms polyester rope does not show significant creep at loads and temperatures normally experienced in mooring applications abs 2011 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 but its lower stiffness may not satisfy the requirement of ultra deepwater mooring at depth over 2000m due to that hmpe ropes show higher stiffness compared to those of polyester hmpe ropes have potential to be utilized as alternatives of polyester ropes in ultra deepwater moorings davies et al 2002 however hmpe shows easier creep which is a concern for permanent moorings but can be dealt with in temporary moorings leite and boesten 2011 hmpe fiber is produced in various types dsm dyneema disclosed the development of an hmpe fiber with creep properties that can meet offshore permanent mooring lines for which typically polyester is used vlasblom et al 2012 however the creep performance of hmpe ropes can be strongly affected by the loading time and loading levels therefore investigating the creep and creep rupture behavior of hmpe ropes is desirable for engineering typically by performing creep rupture tests of hmpe components such as fiber yarn strand and sub ropes the corresponding creep rupture curves including the primary secondary and tertiary stages can be obtained as shown in fig 2 smeets et al 2001 vlasblom and bosman 2006 abs 2011 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 however performing creep rupture tests of fiber ropes is time consuming and needs a special experimental set up that can provide long term constant loads hence short term creep and creep rupture tests on fiber or yarn samples are usually performed and the corresponding models are developed jacobs 1999 first systematically performed short term creep tests of hmpe yarns and proposed a creep rate model to describe the corresponding creep behavior vlasblom and bosman 2006 updated jacobs s model to accurately predict the creep rate but still neglected modeling the tertiary creep of hmpe yarns note that synthetic fiber ropes made of materials such as polyester aramid and hmpe show viscoelastic and viscoplastic behavior davies et al 2003 chailleux and davies 2005 vlasblom and van dingenen 2009 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 huang et al 2013 hence davies et al 2003 and chailleux and davies 2005 originally applied schapery s viscoelastic and perzyna s viscoplastic model to predict the strain of test yarns in addition derombise et al 2011 employed the same model to describe the creep recovery strains and the aging effect of aramid fibers to more accurately simulate the creep recovery test results from the references davies et al 2003 chailleux and davies 2005 huang et al 2013 proposed schapery s theory combined with owen s viscoplastic model however the above researches merely focused on the phenomena of short term behavior of fiber ropes and hence their models can not simulate the tertiary creep due to the absence of damage variable the damage variable was first proposed by kachanov 1986 1999 which made great contribution to the development of continuum damage mechanics in the research field of fiber ropes karayaka et al 1999 initially proposed applying the continuum damage theory to the fiber ropes but they did not develop a quantitative model based on the damage theory beltran et al 2003 2017 and beltran and williamson 2004 2005 2009 2010 proposed a numerical damage model to describe the degradation of rope under the static tensile load but their model has not yet been applied to predict the creep rupture behavior of fiber ropes hence da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 systematically conducted the creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe yarns and first proposed a model to simulate the creep rupture strains of hmpe yarns based on thermodynamics but this model cannot describe the primary creep due to the lack of describing the viscoelastic effect to further understand the creep damage of hmpe stands lian et al 2015 systematically performed the creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe strands and developed a model based on schapery s model and kachanov s damage evolution law their numerical results showed that the model can effectively describe the viscoelastic damage behavior of hmpe strands however the viscoplastic behavior of fiber ropes is neglected in the model which means that the model still needs to be improved note that many thermodynamic models have been developed to describe the nonlinear damage evolution behavior of metals polymers and asphalt mixtures darabi et al 2011a 2011b 2013 konartakhteh 2011 abu al rub and darabi 2012 zhu and sun 2013 however little research to date has focused on the viscoelastic viscoplastic viscodamage model for fiber ropes da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 konartakhteh 2011 hence to accurately capture the creep rupture behavior of hmpe ropes a viscoelastic viscoplastic viscodamage model should be proposed the present study aims to investigate the creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples first the creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe samples are performed by utilizing a special experimental set up and the results show that the completed creep rupture curves possess three stages including the primary secondary and tertiary stage second to capture the creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples a coupled viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model is developed within the framework of thermodynamics the parameter identification methods are also introduced in detail which apply to any component of fiber ropes in the end the feasibility of the present model is examined by the experimental data of hmpe strands within the authors knowledge it is the first time to utilize a viscoelastic viscoplastic viscodamage model to capture the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands the present work not only helps to investigate the creep failure of hmpe ropes but also helps to ensure the safety operations of the hmpe mooring systems 2 experimental study on creep behavior of hmpe samples to investigate creep behavior of hmpe samples an experimental set up is designed and adopted to perform tests on fiber ropes the experimental set up mainly consists of a loading element a measurement system a water cyclic system and equipment foundation as shown in fig 3 the set up can provide the static tensile load cyclic load and constant load for fiber ropes a detailed description about the experimental set up can be found in elsewhere lian et al 2017 the test samples are hmpe strands with a diameter of about 2 mm which have been carefully extracted from the 12 strand braid hmpe rope with a diameter of 6 mm for the hmpe rope construction the pitch length p helix angle α and helix radius a of the rope components strands are equal to 40 mm 20 and 2 637 mm respectively as presented in fig 4 the average breaking strength abs of the test strands is 3 02 kn and its standard deviation is 0 16 kn these values are obtained by five breaking tests and their static capacity curves are presented in fig 5 utilizing these hmpe strands 10 experimental cases are designed as listed in table 1 in which l c denotes the constant loading level and f c denotes the loading value the test temperature is 18 c the total length of hmpe strands is 2 4 m and the splice length is 0 3 m the gauge length in the middle of the sample is 0 3 m to obtain valid test results hmpe strands are installed in the experimental set up for each case in table 1 by utilizing the eye splice method which is proved by mckenna et al 2004 after that the bedding in process recommended by bureau veritas 2007 is used for each sample when the bedding in process is completed the sample is loaded at a rate of 10 n s until the tension equals the setting value f 0 a schematic of the creep test presented in fig 6 shows that creep begins when the load equals the setting value the displacement of the gauge length and the load value of samples are measured by the wire displacement transducer and the load transducer respectively the acquisition of measured data is 9 points per second to verify the reliability of measured data each case is carried out at least twice based on the measured data the creep strains are calculated the measured creep curves and the corresponding creep rate curves of hmpe samples at different loading levels 10 20 30 40 50 abs are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively similarly the creep rupture curves and the corresponding creep rate curves of hmpe samples at different loading levels 60 65 70 75 80 abs are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively as can be observed from figs 7 10 the creep strains show different creep stages specifically figs 9 and 10 illustrate that the creep rupture curves of hmpe samples present three creep stages including the primary secondary and tertiary stages in the primary stage the creep rate decreases with time from an initial rapid rate this is followed by a secondary creep stage in which the creep rate is small and increases very slightly with time however in the tertiary stage the creep rate of hmpe samples increases sharply with strain until the samples fracture as can been seen from the results of hmpe strands the secondary creep rate increases with the increase of the loading level while the failure time decreases with the increase of loading levels these nonlinear stress dependent behavior cause difficulty in capturing the completed creep rupture stages of hmpe samples however in the present study the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands are systematically investigated which will improve the understanding of the creep mechanism of hmpe samples 3 thermodynamic derivation of the constitutive model 3 1 effective configuration to provide a better understanding of the creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples a continuum damage model is proposed based on thermodynamics as we all known the concept of a damage variable was originally proposed by kachanov 1958 and subsequently developed by others rabotnov 1968 lemaitre and chaboche 1990 in the present study the hypothesis of isotropic damage and strain equivalence are adopted hence the damage density or damage variable ϕ is a scalar quantity and the stress in the effective configuration σ i j is written as 1 σ i j σ i j 1 ϕ where σ i j is the stress in the damaged configuration i e the nominal stress 3 2 basic thermodynamic theory to grasp the mechanical properties of fiber ropes the main challenges are to develop appropriate constitutive equations and to determine the evolution law of the internal state variables the most effective method is widely based on the basic laws of thermodynamics lemaitre and chaboche 1990 konartakhteh 2011 the first law of thermodynamics is utilized to describe the conservation of energy while the second law of thermodynamics is applied to account for a dissipative system the second law of thermodynamics is written as lemaitre and chaboche 1990 2 σ i j ε i j ρ φ η t 1 t q i i t 0 where ρ ρ φ ρ η q and t are the mass density the helmholtz free energy density the specific entropy density the heat flux vector and temperature respectively it is generally assumed that once the material is damaged further loading only affects the undamaged part of the material therefore the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage models are considered as functions of effective stress hence the inequality 2 in the effective configuration is written as 3 σ i j ε i j ρ φ η t 1 t q i i t 0 based on the assumption of small deformation the total effective strain is divided into viscoelastic and viscoplastic strains hence the total effective strain rate is obtained 4 ε i j ε i j v e ε i j v p in the framework of effective stress the constitutive model is defined as a function of variables which include the viscoelastic strain tensor in the effective configuration ε i j v e phenomenological internal state variables associated with the viscoelastic processes ξ m m 1 m int v e m int v e 1 the accumulative viscoplastic strain in the effective configuration p the isotropic damage density and the temperature hence the helmholtz free energy is written as a function of the state variables in the effective configuration as follows konartakhteh 2011 5 φ φ ε i j v e ξ m p ϕ t taking the time derivative of the helmholtz free energy implies 6 φ φ ε i j v e ε i j v e φ ξ m ξ m ρ φ p p φ ϕ ϕ φ t t substituting eq 6 and eq 4 into the inequality 3 yields the following constraint 7 σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e ε i j v e ρ φ ξ m ξ m σ i j ε i j v p ρ φ p p ρ φ ϕ ϕ ρ φ t η t 1 t q i i t 0 assuming the isothermal conditions the inequality inequation 7 can be written as 8 σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e ε i j v e ρ φ ξ m ξ m σ i j ε i j v p ρ φ p p ρ φ ϕ ϕ 0 based on the inequality above the thermodynamic conjugate forces and state laws are defined as follows 9a l i j σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e 9b q m ρ φ ξ m 9c κ ρ φ p 9d y ρ φ ϕ where q m κ and y are the thermodynamic conjugate forces associated with ξ m p and ϕ respectively considering that the clausius duhem inequality namely inequation 8 is valid for all load histories konartakhteh 2011 abu al rub and darabi 2012 assumed a completely reversible loading history which indicates that the rate of the state variables vanishes i e p 0 ϕ 0 and ξ m 0 m 1 m int v e hence eq 9a is rewritten as 10 σ i j ρ φ ε i j v e in addition by substituting eqs 9a and 9d into inequation 8 the rate of the total energy dissipation is rewritten as 11 π l i j ε i j v e q m ξ m σ i j ε i j v p κ p y ϕ 0 the rate of the total energy dissipation π in eq 11 is decomposed into the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage parts as follows 12 π π v e π v p π v d 0 13 π v e l i j ε i j v e q m ξ m 14 π v p σ i j ε i j v p κ p 15 π v d y ϕ the above thermodynamic framework has been used to derive constitutive equations for different materials especially metals and polymers lévesque et al 2008 konartakhteh 2011 darabi et al 2011b abu al rub and darabi 2012 however few studies can be found on utilizing the thermodynamic theory to derive the coupled viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model for fiber ropes da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 konartakhteh 2011 3 3 the helmholtz free energy the definition of helmholtz free energy is important to establish a concise constitutive model lemaitre and chaboche 1990 darabi et al 2011b zhu and sun 2013 in the present study to describe the changes in stored energy of fiber ropes the helmholtz free energy is decomposed into viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage parts the viscoelastic part is defined to establish the viscoelastic constitutive relation the viscoplastic part describes the evolution mechanism of plastic hardening the viscodamage part reflects the amount of free energy which is released during the process of damage evolution the present study assumes that fiber ropes are decoupled material hence the helmholtz free energy is written as konartakhteh 2011 darabi et al 2011b abu al rub and darabi 2012 zhu and sun 2013 16 φ ε i j v e ξ m p ϕ φ v e ε i j v e ξ m φ v p p φ v d ϕ where φ v e ε i j v e ξ m is the viscoelastic stored energy while φ v p p and φ v d ϕ are the energies due to material viscoplastic hardening and damage evolution respectively darabi et al 2011b zhu and sun 2013 in the classical viscoelastic theory it is assumed that the viscoelastic part of the helmholtz free energy can be described by utilizing a taylor expansion of the state variables around the reference state where σ ε i j v e ξ m 0 schapery 1969 lévesque et al 2008 darabi et al 2011b konartakhteh 2011 especially schapery 1969 introduced nonlinear dependency parameters to define the viscoelastic part of the helmholtz free energy hence this can be written as abu al rub and darabi 2012 17 ρ φ v e 1 2 a 0 ε v e p i j k l ε i j v e ε k l v e a 1 ε v e p i j m 1 ε i j v e ζ m 1 2 p m m 2 ζ m ζ n where a 0 ε v e and a 1 ε v e are included to make the viscoelastic model nonlinear the matrices p i j k l p i j m 1 and p m m 2 are positive definite following the hardening equation proposed by lemaitre and chaboche 1990 which is an exponential function of the effective viscoplastic strain the viscoplastic part of the helmholtz free energy is proposed 18 ρ φ v p p a exp b ε e f f d p where a and b are material parameters ε e f f ε i j ε i j is the total effective strain which is proposed to couple the viscoelastic and viscoplastic models with the viscodamage model in addition rabotnov 1968 proposed a damage evolution equation in which the rate of damage density is an exponential function of both the effective viscoplastic strain and 1 ϕ nedjar and roy 2012 proposed the driving source of damage to develop a strain based damage model following their works the viscodamage part of helmholtz free energy is expressed in the following form 19 ρ φ v d s p exp a 0 1 ϕ m 0 d ϕ where a 0 and m 0 are viscodamage parameters s p is the driving source of damage which depends only on the value of the effective viscoplastic strain p mai et al 2012 nedjar and roy 2012 3 4 viscoelastic model based on the laws of thermodynamics and laplace transform schapery 1969 lévesque et al 2008 darabi et al 2011b konartakhteh 2011 schapery s nonlinear viscoelastic model in the effective stress space can be written as follows 20 ε i j v e g 0 d i j k l 0 t σ k l g 1 0 ψ δ d i j k l ψ t ψ τ d g 2 σ k l d τ d τ considering the uniaxial deformation of fiber ropes the one dimensional schapery s model is written as 21 ε t g 0 d 0 σ t g 1 0 t δ d ψ t ψ τ d g 2 σ t d τ d τ where ε t is the strain to reflect the effects of damaged fibers d 0 and δ d are the compliance components ψ t is the reduced time given by 22 ψ t 0 t d s a σ σ s where the parameters g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are functions of the effective stress σ t the transient compliance δ d is expressed as the prony series that are more accurate and convenient than other functions especially under complex loadings park and schapery 1999 marklund et al 2006 huang et al 2013 as follows 23 δ d ψ n 1 n d n 1 exp λ n ψ where d n is the nth coefficient of the prony series n is the number of the terms λ n is the nth reciprocal of retardation time in addition the first term of the viscoelastic part instantaneous strain in eq 21 rules the capacity curves of test samples in fig 5 hence to effectively predict the capacity curve of fiber samples a tangent modulus has been advised beltran et al 2017 this section is about the viscoelastic model which has been proposed and utilized in the references schapery 1969 davies et al 2003 lévesque et al 2008 darabi et al 2011b konartakhteh 2011 derombise et al 2011 huang et al 2013 2015 lian et al 2015 in addition to describe the special behavior of fiber ropes the viscoelastic model is then coupled to different viscoplastic and viscodamage model 3 5 viscoplastic model to obtain the viscoplastic evolution law the maximum dissipation principle is widely adopted this principle declares that the actual states of the thermodynamic forces are those that maximize the inelastic dissipation function over all possible states to use the principle of maximum energy dissipation the objective function ω 1 is proposed as shown in eq 24 this describes three factors including the energy dissipation of thermo viscoplastic part π v p in eq 14 the corresponding lagrange multiplier λ v p and the constraint condition f 0 24 ω 1 π v p λ v p f σ i j ε i j v p κ p λ v p f where f is the yield criterion p is the effective viscoplastic strain rate defined as p 2 3 ε i j v p ε i j v p in the one dimensional case the effective viscoplastic strain p is simplified to the viscoplastic strain ε v p namely p ε v p based on perzyna s viscoplastic theory perzyna 1971 the yield criterion for nonlinear mechanical behavior of fiber ropes is assumed as follows 25 f σ i j σ y n 1 κ where κ is the isotropic hardening function depended on the total strain κ can now be determined by using eqs 9c and 18 26 κ a exp b ε i j the isotropic hardening function is shown that the yield function is strengthened with the increase of the total strain it is compatible with the form proposed by lemaitre and chaboche 1990 by utilizing the principle of maximum energy dissipation for the objective function namely ω 1 the constrained equation can be expressed as 27 ω 1 σ i j 0 ω 1 κ 0 by substituting eq 25 into 24 and utilizing eq 27 the corresponding viscoplastic strain evolution and the effective plastic strain evolution laws can be obtained as follows 28 ε i j v p λ v p f σ i j 29 p λ v p f κ considering the special mechanical behavior of fiber ropes it is assumed that fiber rope complies with the non associated flow rule i e the yield criterion and plastic potential are not the same hence the plastic potential is assumed as follows 30 f σ i j p σ i j σ y n 1 a exp b ε i j f 1 a exp b ε i j hence the non associated flow rule can be written as 31 ε i j v p λ v p f σ i j in addition the lagrange multiplier can be obtained through the consistency condition which shows that the stress is always maintained at subsequent yield surface which is the foundation of perzyna theory perzyna 1971 based on perzyna viscoplastic theory the plastic multiplier λ v p is taken as the form of λ v p m γ f n where γ f is the function of yield criterion the special situation is that γ f equals f x is the macaulay bracket x x when x 0 and x 0 when x 0 m and n are material constants hence the viscoplastic constitutive equation is obtained such that 32 ε i j v p m γ f n f σ i j eq 32 shows that the direction of the increment of viscoplastic strain are parallel to the direction of the external normal of the potential function based on the derivation above for the one dimensional loading condition of fiber ropes the viscoplastic yield surface is reduced as follows 33 f σ σ y a exp b ε the plastic potential function can be written as 34 f σ ε v p σ σ y n 1 a exp b ε then according to perzyna theory perzyna 1971 the viscoplastic strain rate is given by 35 ε i j v p σ σ y f v p α v p exp β v p ε where a v p m a n β v p b n and f v p n are viscoplastical parameters of model for fiber ropes 3 6 viscodamage model to obtain the damage evolution law the maximum dissipation principle is widely adopted this principle claims that the actual states of the thermodynamic forces are those that maximize the inelastic dissipation function over all possible states konartakhteh 2011 to maximize the rate of energy dissipation the following objective function ω 2 in eq 36 is proposed this reflects the rate of energy dissipation of the viscodamage part π v d in eq 15 the corresponding lagrange multiplier λ v d and the constraint condition g 0 36 ω 2 π v d λ v d g where π v d is the rate of viscodamage energy dissipation and g is a damage criterion based on the maximum dissipation principle the evolution law can be obtained by satisfying the necessary condition for the objective function namely ω 2 as follows 37 ω 2 y 0 by substituting eq 36 into eq 37 and making use of eq 15 the thermodynamic law corresponding to the evolution of the damage variable yields 38 ϕ λ v d g y where lagrange multiplier λ v d can be determined by satisfying the consistency conditions for viscodamage loading surfaces i e g 0 a damage criterion is formulated as follows 39 g ϕ p y y 0 exp a 0 1 ϕ m 0 s p y 0 0 where y is the released rate of strain energy density y 0 is the initial damage threshold a 0 is a stress dependent parameter which is defined as a 0 a d σ max h s p is the driving source of damage which depends solely on the effective viscoplastic strain which describes that damage level is associated with the plastic hardening degree mai et al 2012 nedjar and roy 2012 the driving source of damage can be assumed as 40 s p α 1 exp β 1 p besides substituting eq 19 into 9d yields 41 y exp a 0 1 ϕ m 0 s p an associative viscodamage flow rule is used for fiber ropes hence the damage criterion equals the viscodamage potential function according to the consistency conditions lagrange multipliers λ v d can be obtained i e g ϕ p 0 42 λ v d ϕ s p a 0 m 0 1 ϕ m 0 1 s p by substituting eq 40 into eq 42 the evolution of the damage variable is obtained 43 ϕ β 1 p a 0 m 0 1 ϕ m 0 1 for the unidimensional case the effective viscoplastic strain equals viscoplastic strain i e p ε v p considering that fiber ropes endure axial tensions the damage evolution law in eq 43 can be written as follows 44 ϕ β 1 ε

e β 1 a d m 0 and m e 1 m 0 are defined to simplify the equation eq 45 which derived from the thermodynamic shows that both the term of exponential function of strain and the power function of the damage variable are similar to the damage evolution law in the references abu al rub and darabi 2012 zhu and sun 2013 however other terms in eq 45 are different from those obtained in the references eq 45 aims to describe the damage evolution behavior of fiber ropes 3 7 summary set of constitutive equations in summary to describe the coupling viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage behavior of fiber ropes a constitutive model developed with the thermodynamic theory can be described by the following set of constitutive equations 46 ε ε v e ε v p σ σ 1 ϕ ε v e t g 0 d 0 σ t g 1 0 t δ d ψ t ψ

when the stress history is prescribed and the corresponding strain output is to be determined hence an approximate solution based on a recursive method is presented first the effective stress namely σ is obtained according to eq 1 second after the effective stress is updated the viscoelastic and viscoplastic strains can be calculated third the damage value is calculated based on the damage value of the previous step and the damage evolution law namely eq 45 the incremental form for small strain problems is shown as follows 47 ε t ε v e t ε v p t ε t δ t δ ε t ε v e t δ t ε v p t δ t δ ε v e t δ

as 0 1 s in the present study values of the stress and internal variables from the previous step i e at time t δ t are given hence the key step is to update the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage values the viscoelastic strain increments can be expressed as follows 51 δ ε v e t ε v e t ε v e t δ t g 0 t d 0 g 1 t g 2 t n 1 n d n 1 1 ⅇ λ n δ ψ t λ n δ ψ t σ t g 1 t n 1 n d n q n t δ

integral at the end of the time increment i e at time t namely q n t can be expressed as follows haj ali and muliana 2004 huang et al 2015 52 q n t 0 t e λ n ψ t ψ τ d g 2 τ σ τ d τ d τ e λ n δ ψ q n

d n 1 1 ⅇ λ n δ ψ t λ n δ ψ t σ c t in addition based on eq 35 when σ t δ t σ y the increment of the viscoplastic strain can be written as 53 δ ε v p t σ t δ t σ y f v p α v p exp β v p ε t δ t δ t once the incremental viscoelastic and viscoplastic strains are determined the total strain at current time is calculated after that the rate of damage density can be obtained according to eq 45 the updated damage density can be given as 54 ϕ t ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t finally according to the undated damage density the damage state of fiber ropes can be determined if the value of damage density is smaller than the maximum damage value which equals one the procedure will update the total effective stress and strains a flow chart of the numerical implementation is shown in appendix a 5 parameters identification and model validation to validate the present creep rupture model the parameter identifications for the constitutive model are proposed and the prediction results are compared with the experimental data at different loading levels 5 1 parameter identifications for the constitutive model parameter identifications play an important role in model application hence it is necessary to propose a convenient method for characterizing the viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage parameters in the present model based on the fact that hmpe ropes show creep rupture behavior which include the primary secondary and tertiary stages the total strain can be divided into the recoverable and irrecoverable components as illustrated in fig 11 the recoverable component denotes the viscoelastic strains as shown in fig 11 b the irrecoverable component is made up of viscoplastic and viscodamage strains as shown in fig 11 c hence the parameters of viscoplastic and viscodamage models can be determined by analyzing the secondary and tertiary creep stages respectively after the parameters of the irrecoverable component are calibrated the viscoelastic parameters can be identified the detailed procedure for parameter identifications is shown as follows as shown in figs 9 and 10 the tertiary creep rate is different from the creep rate of the secondary stage therefore to clearly obtain the parameters of the irrecoverable component we assumed that the secondary creep rate is mainly caused by the viscoplastic part and the tertiary creep rate is mainly caused by the damage part in addition the strain range can affect the damage evolution beltran and williamson 2005 however for the present experimental results of hmpe samples we found that damage of rope samples in the secondary stage is much less than that in the tertiary stage hence we assumed that the damage in the secondary stage due to strain range is negligible to calibrate the viscoplastic parameters in eq 35 including α v p β v p and f v p the creep strain stress and creep rate in the secondary stage are analyzed utilizing the least square method this method is reasonable considering that the increment of the viscoplastic strain is dependent on both the effective stress and the total strain in addition the effective stress is approximately equal to the nominal stress in the secondary creep stage because the damage of test samples in the secondary stage is smaller than that in the tertiary stage in the present study the yield stress of 10 abs is adopted because under 10 abs which is considered to be low enough stress the test samples only exhibit viscoelasticity huang et al 2013 besides experimental data of cases 9 and 10 in which loading levels equal 75 and 80 abs are applied by utilizing the above calibrated method the viscoplastic parameters including α v p β v p and f v p are obtained as listed in table 2 to calibrate the viscodamage parameters in eq 45 the experimental data in the tertiary stage are utilized by adopting the same least square method considering that the damage changes significantly in the tertiary stage the start point of the tertiary creep stage can be defined as the initial value of the damage which equals zero the rupture strain corresponds to the maximum damage value which equals one hence the strain in the tertiary stage corresponds to the closed interval of damage 0 1 analyzing the total strain damage and damage rate the viscodamage parameters including a e h and m e in eq 45 are obtained as listed in table 3 therefore after the viscoplastic and viscodamage effects of the creep data are subtracted the viscoelastic component of strain can be obtained and utilized to characterize the viscoelastic parameters at this step six terms of the prony series are adopted according to the previous researches park and schapery 1999 huang et al 2013 in addition four parameters including d 0 g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ need to be identified the procedure for identifying the viscoelastic parameters is presented as follows under the condition of the constant stress σ c the viscoelastic strain is written as 55 ε ve t 1 g 0 d 0 σ c g 1 g 2 δ d t 1 a σ σ c if the constant stress level σ c is low the material is in the linear region and the parameters including g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are equal to one by fitting eq 55 to the creep strain at the low stress level the coefficients of the prony series and d 0 can be obtained similarly by utilizing the same calibrated method for viscoelastic strain at higher stress levels g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are obtained then according to the identified values of g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ at different stress levels the polynomial interpolations are performed to obtain the corresponding parameters for an arbitrary stress according to the calibrated method for viscoelastic parameters utilizing the viscoelastic strain at 10 abs level coefficients of the prony series listed in table 4 and the instantaneous compliance d 0 2 146 10 2 are obtained subsequently the parameters g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are obtained for each stress level as listed in table 5 based on these values the corresponding polynomial interpolations are performed as shown in figs 12 14 then the polynomial interpolation functions are listed in table 6 the corresponding correlation coefficients of functions g 0 g 1 g 2 and a σ are 0 993 0 976 and 0 993 respectively hence based on the equations in table 6 the viscoelastic parameters at other loading levels can be calculated through the above procedure the viscoplastic viscodamage and viscoelastic parameters can be effectively identified 5 2 model validation after the model parameters are obtained the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands at other loading levels 60 65 and 70 abs are calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental results to validate the present model the comparisons between prediction data and test results are shown in fig 15 the average errors between the prediction data and test data are 1 55 2 09 and 1 64 for the corresponding loading levels 60 65 and 70 abs respectively these comparisons prove that the prediction values at different loading levels match well with the corresponding test data note that the time duration of the validation case is about 13 h for 60 abs while the longest time for parameter calibration is only about 3 h this illustrates that the present model can efficiently predict the competed creep rupture responses of hmpe strands although the present model and the parameter identification method are only verified on hmpe strands they can apply to any component of fiber ropes within the range of tested strand creep conditions 10 80 abs for different structures or types of fiber rope the model parameters are different but they can be identified by following the parameter identification methods established in the present study 6 concluding remarks hmpe ropes have potential to be used as alternatives to polyester ropes but their creep failure has been a great concern for their application in mooring engineering hence it is necessary to investigate the creep behavior of hmpe ropes in the present study creep and creep rupture tests of hmpe strands at different loading levels were performed utilizing a specially designed experimental system the procedure and techniques for performing creep tests of hmpe strands were proposed in detail which can be a reference for other sizes of fiber ropes the experimental results illustrated that the creep rupture curves of hmpe samples present primary secondary and tertiary stages which change with the loading level and loading time to describe the creep behavior of hmpe samples a coupled viscoelastic viscoplastic and viscodamage model was developed within the framework of thermodynamics and a method for calibrating the model parameters was proposed utilizing the present model the creep rupture behavior of hmpe strands at other loading levels 60 65 and 70 abs are predicted and compared with the corresponding experimental results overall the prediction results match well with the corresponding test data at the same loading level note that in the present study only the short term creep data were utilized to calibrate model parameters while the completed creep rupture data at different loading levels were compared with the prediction results this shows the parameters can be conveniently calibrated utilizing the short term test data and the completed creep rupture behavior of hmpe samples at different loading levels can be effectively captured specifically the proposed model can predict the creep rupture tests of hmpe samples at low loading levels whereas performing the creep rupture tests would be very time consuming hence the present studies can be useful for gaining a better understanding of the creep rupture behavior of hmpe ropes acknowledgements financial support from the national natural science

23276,the drag reduction by small bubbles is investigated with mixture multiphase flow model combined with population balance model for the horizontal channel turbulence the influence of liquid phase reynolds number and global void fraction on the drag reduction is fully analyzed the present results show that the addition of small bubbles cause the drag reduction and the liquid phase reynolds number and the global void fraction have the great influence on the drag reduction rate for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the sharper the bubble breakup phenomenon is which leads to that the bubble diameter is smaller and the drag reduction rate is higher the influence of the global void fraction on the drag reduction rate is related to the liquid phase reynolds number for the low liquid phase reynolds number the case with the lower global void fraction has the higher drag reducing rate however for the high liquid phase reynolds number the higher void fraction corresponds to the larger drag reduction rate it is very important for investigating the drag reduction by bubbles to consider the bubble coalescence and breakup phenomena and the present results show that the drag reduction rate strongly depends on the bubble size keywords small bubble turbulence drag reduction turbulence modulation mixture model population balance model 1 introduction drag reduction in the turbulent flow has been a very important issue in engineering and academic circles as is well known many ways have been proposed to reduce turbulence frictional drag in liquid such oil and water transport process in the past of all drag reducing methods in view of the environmental friendly characteristic and the high drag reducing rate the drag reduction by bubbles with different sizes has recently been paid more and more attention by researchers and engineers to expect that it can be applied to reduce the frictional drag for ships in water and liquid transport in pipelines in the near future presently a large number of investigations on the drag reduction by bubbles have been performed so as to understand the drag reducing mechanism and to promote its engineering application some early investigations have shown that the drag reduction effect by bubbles is tightly related to the bubble size and it is found that the drag reduction by bubbles is very effective only when the bubble size is very small for this reason the early investigations on the drag reduction by bubbles mainly focus on microbubbles whose diameter is less than 1 mm some researchers such as mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 bogdevich et al 1977 merkle and deutsch 1989 madavan et al 1984 and 1985a guin et al 1996 kim and cleaver 1995 kato et al 1999 kodama et al 2000 gabillet et al 2002 moriguchi and kato 2002 nagaya et al 2002 latorre et al 2003 deutsch et al 2004 hassan et al 2005 van den berg et al 2005 akoi et al 2006 murai et al 2006 2007 sanders et al 2006 shen et al 2006 elbing et al 2008 jacob et al 2010 kumagai et al 2015 paik et al 2016 qin et al 2017 etc carried out studies on the drag reduction by microbubbles by means of experimental methods and other researchers such as legner 1984 madavan et al 1985b marie 1987 meng and uhlman 1989 kanai and miyata 2001 kawamura and kodama 2002 xu et al 2002 kunz et al 2003 ferrante and elghobashi 2004 2005 lu et al 2005 skudarnov and lin 2006 xu et al 2007 kunz et al 2007 mohanarangam et al 2009 pang et al 2014 asiagbe et al 2017 qin et al 2017 etc performed theoretical and numerical studies on the drag reduction by microbubbles with the deep investigation on the drag reduction by bubbles in the turbulent flow it is found that the bubbles with a diameter greater than 1 mm can also cause the drag reduction van gils et al 2013 maryami et al 2015 verschoof et al 2016 thus the importance of the bubble size for the drag reduction becomes a controversial focus it was even pointed out by shen et al 2006 and ceccio 2010 that the drag reduction is independent of the bubble size therefore the mechanism on the drag reduction by bubbles becomes more and more bewildered the present mechanism on the drag reduction by bubbles can be summarized as follows the first explanation is the density and viscosity effect legner 1984 marie 1987 chanson 1994 lvov et al 2005 shen et al 2006 skudarnov and lin 2006 etc namely the injection of bubbles changes local viscosity and density of the mixture phase to cause the drag reduction the second explanation is based on interactions between bubbles and liquid phase turbulence kanai and miyata 2001 xu et al 2002 ferrante and elghobashi 2004 mohanarangam et al 2009 jacob et al 2010 pang et al 2014 etc namely the addition of bubbles influences the liquid phase turbulence structure and reduces reynolds shear stress of the liquid phase to cause the drag reduction the third explanation is based on the bubble fluctuations namely the bubbles in the turbulence flow happens to shape change and volume compression to lead to the drag reduction lu et al 2005 van den berg et al 2005 lo et al 2006 van gils et al 2013 verschoof et al 2016 etc as a matter of fact the bubble deformation depends on the weber number if the thermos physical parameters of bubble and liquid phases and the liquid phase velocity field are fixed the bubble deformation is only related the bubble size according to the definition of the weber number for the definite liquid phase velocity field laden with bubbles the bubble size strongly depends on the coalescence and breakup processes even if the initial diameter of bubbles corresponding to the small weber number is very small it can also become relatively big due to the coalescence effect corresponding to the big weber number with the increase of the bubble size the bubble deformation happens and the drag reduction will also change vershoof et al 2016 accordingly it is very important for the drag reduction by bubbles to consider the bubble coalescence and breakup processes to further explore the physical phenomena and to understand the mechanism of the drag reduction by bubbles in this paper the influence of the bubble coalescence and breakup on the drag reduction is numerically investigated with mixture multiphase flow model combined with population balance model pbm in the horizontal channel the reynolds stress model rsm is applied to solve the turbulence velocity field the diameter range of the bubble coalescence and breakup is 0 001 8 mm the global void fraction is 1 5 and the liquid phase reynolds number is 104 105 the paper structure is arranged as follows section 1 is introduction section 2 introduces physical model and computational method section 3 presents result analyses and discussion and section 4 summarizes conclusions 2 physical model and computational method 2 1 geometric model and boundary conditions here the two dimensional channel is chosen as the computational region to investigate the drag reduction by bubbles as shown in fig 1 the coordinate system can be seen in fig 1 the coordinate origin is set at the center of cross section in the channel inlet the x direction denotes the flow direction the y direction is the spanwise one and the z direction is the wall normal one the gravity acceleration acts on the negative direction of the z axis dean 1978 pointed out that the secondary flow occurring in the spanwise wall can be ignored when the aspect ratio of the channel is greater than 7 for the present computation the channel width and height are 150 mm and 10 mm respectively and thus the aspect ratio of the channel is 15 greater than 7 which can ignore the influence of the secondary flow the channel length should be long enough to make the turbulence develop fully for the newtonian fluid the channel length which the full development of turbulence needs can be computed by the equation of l 8 14re 1 6 h for the present computation the largest liquid phase reynolds number is 105 and thus the channel length l should be larger than 550 mm to eliminate the influence of the back flow in the channel outlet the final length of the channel is set as 2000 mm thus the channel sizes l w h correspond to 2000 150 10 mm in the x y and z directions in the computational process the inlet section of the channel is the velocity inlet condition and the outlet is the free flow condition the top and bottom walls of the channel are set as no slip boundary conditions and the periodic boundary condition is applied to the spanwise direction in order to reduce the computational cost 2 2 calculation conditions in this paper the influence of the liquid phase reynolds number on the drag reduction is investigated under the same void fraction the global void fraction of bubbles is 1 and 5 each global void fraction corresponds to 10 liquid phase reynolds numbers and thus there are 20 computational cases in all thermo physical parameters of bubble and liquid phases are ones of air and water at the temperature of 20 c the initial diameter of bubbles is given to a constant value d b first 4 mm and the breakup and coalescence range of the bubble diameter is 0 001 8 mm as a matter of fact murai 2014 presented a detailed reviewer on the drag reduction by bubbles and it is found that the bubble diameter is in the range of 0 001 8 mm for the published cases with the liquid phase velocity in the range of 1 10 m s and the bubble void fraction in the range of 0 20 it can be seen from the above fact show that the range of the bubble diameter is reasonable according to the calculation need of pbm the bubble diameter is classified into 40 groups and the volume ratio between two adjacent bubbles v i 1 v i is equal to 2 the related computational parameters are listed in table 1 in addition according to the current calculation parameter the number of bubbles is 108 and thus the calculation cost is very large if the discrete phase model is used as the multiphase flow model 2 3 governing equations 2 3 1 continuity equation the mixture model is one kind of the models based on the eulerian coordinate system for which both gas and liquid phases are regarded as the continuous media only one set of the gas liquid two phase mixture equations are solved here the continuity equation is presented as follows 1 t ρ m ρ m u m 0 where ρ

equation 5 f 1 2 a b ρ c d u u b u b u where a b is the bubble sectional area a b πd 2 4 and c d is the drag coefficient because the bubble with millimeter scale in diameter may happen to deformation in the turbulence flow the non spherical bubble model proposed by ishii and zuber 1979 is used to calculate the bubble drag coefficient the model considers three kinds of bubble shapes spherical distorted and cap ones and the optimum drag coefficient is calculated according to the bubble shape it can be expressed as follows 6 c d spherical 24 re 1 0 1 re b 0 75 7 c d d i s t o r t e d 2 3 e o

15 u lb τ lb a where a is the bubble acceleration and τ lb is the relaxation time of bubbles they can be calculated by the following two equations respectively 16 a g u m u m u m t 17 τ lb ρ b d b 2 18 μ 2 3 4 population balance model here the population balance model is used to describe the coalescence and breakup phenomena of the bubble groups the population balance model groups bubbles as the discrete phase in scale and solves the number density function for each group of bubbles the range of bubble size is 0 001 8 mm and it is divided into 40 groups the bubbles with the smallest size do not consider the breakup phenomenon the bubbles with the largest size do not consider the coalescence phenomenon and the bubbles with other sizes simultaneously consider the coalescence and breakup phenomena yeoh et al 2010 presented a generalized computational model on the population balance equation namely 18 n v x t t u b v x t n v x t s v x t where n v x t is the number density of bubbles v is the bubble volume x is the spatial position vector of the bubble and t is the physical time u b v x t is the bubble velocity and s v x t is the bubble coalescence and breakup source term and it can be defined by the following function 19 s v x t 1 2 0 v n v v x t n v x t c v v v d ξ birth due to coalescence n v x t 0 n v x t c v v d v death due to coalescence v γ v n v x t b v v β v v d v birth due to breakage n v x t b v v death due to breakage where c v v is the coalescence rate of bubbles with volumes v and v respectively b v v is the breakup rate at which bubbles of volume v break into ones of volume v γ v is the number of daughter bubbles of volume v from the breakup here the binary breakup is used γ v 2 β v v is the probability density function of bubbles of volume v breaking into ones of volume v in this paper two kinds of the most important bubble coalescence and breakup model are used as shown in fig 2 namely the turbulent vortex colliding with bubbles causes the bubble breakup and the liquid phase turbulence induces bubbles to coalesce the details on the bubble coalescence and breakup models can be referred to luo and svendsen 1996 2 3 4 1 bubble breakup rate function luo and svendsen 1996 presented the general expression on the bubble breakup rate namely 20 b v v λ min d b p b v v f b v λ ω b λ v d λ where ω b λ v is the collision frequency between the bubble of volume v and one vortex and p b v vf bv λ is the collapsing probability of the bubble colliding with one vortex the bubble breakup rate function is based on the derivation of the energy principle if the turbulence kinetic energy for one vortex is greater than the bubble surface energy the bubble will break up luo and svendsen 1996 presented the mean turbulent energy expression for the vortex with the size of λ 21 e λ π 6 ρ λ 3 u λ 2 2 π β 12 ρ ε d b 2 3 d b 3 ξ 11 3 here β 2 047 and ξ λ d b u λ is the average velocity of the vortex with the size of λ and it can be expressed as follows 22 u λ β 1 2 ε λ 1 3 for the bubble with a diameter of d b its breakup consuming the surface energy can be calculated by the following equation 23 e d b c f π d b 2 σ where c f is the bubble surface area coefficient and it can be seen 24 c f f b v 2 3 1 f b v 2 3 1 here f bv is the broken volume fraction and it can be calculated by eqn 25 25 f b v v j v d b j 3 d b 3 d b j 3 d b i 3 d b j 3 in eqn 25 d b i and d b j are the diameter of the sub bubbles after the bubble with the diameter of d b breaks up and their corresponding volumes are v i and v j respectively as shown in fig 2 a the collision time is extremely short between the bubble and one vortex if the turbulent kinetic energy for one vortex is greater than the surface energy of the bubble the bubble may break up during this time namely e λ e d b and the bubble breakup probability expression is 26 p b v v f b v λ p e e λ e d b p e χ χ c 1 p e χ χ c where χ is the dimensionless energy χ e λ e λ and χ c is the critical dimensionless energy χ c e d b e λ 12 c f σ β ρ ε 2 3 d b 5 3 ξ 11 3 the breakup probability expression can be rewritten as follows 27 p b v v f b v λ 1 0 χ c e χ d χ e χ c based on the isotropy turbulence luo and svendsen 1996 presented the expression about the collision frequency between the bubble with the diameter of d b and the vortex with the size of λ 28 ω b λ d b c 4 1 α b n ε d b 1 3

rewritten as follows 29 b v v c ξ min 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 e a ξ 11 3 d ξ here a 12c f σρ 1 ε 2 3 d b 5 3 β 1 c 1 392ε 1 3 d b 2 3 and ξ min λ min d b λ min is the minimum vortex scale 2 3 4 2 sub bubble distribution function the probability density function of sub bubbles can be calculated by the following equation luo and svendsen 1996 30 β v v 2 ξ min 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 e χ c d ξ v 0 1 ξ min 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 e χ c d ξ d f b v 2 3 4 3 bubble coalescence rate function the coalescence between bubbles is mainly caused by the turbulence vortex of the liquid phase see fig 2 b the coalescence rate function proposed by luo 1993 is presented as follows 31 c v i v j ω v i v j p v i v j where v i and v j are the volume of the ith and jth bubble ω v i v j is the collision frequency between ith and jth bubbles and p v i v j is the bubble coalescence probability the collision frequency is 32 ω v i v j π 4 d b i d b j 2 u i j where u i j is the characteristic velocity of collision of two bubbles with the diameters of d i and d j and it can be calculated by the following expression 33 u i j u i 2 u j 2 1 2 34 u i 1 43 ε d b i 1 3 the random collision between bubbles is induced by the liquid phase turbulence and when the bubbles collide with each other two kinds of phenomena may happen 1 the bubble may rebound after the collision 2 the bubble coalescence may happen after the collision the coalescence rate function of bubbles can be defined as follows 35 p b v i v j e t d t c where t d is the coalescence time of bubbles and t c is the touch time of bubbles when the collision occurs between bubbles the bubbles will coalesce if t c t d the coalescence time t d is calculated by the following expression 36 t d 0 5 ρ u i j b b i 2 1 d b i d b j 2 σ where σ is the gas liquid interface tension the touch time during the bubble collision process mainly depends on the bubble diameter and the surface tension and it can be calculated by the following equation 37 t c 1 d b i d b j ρ b ρ c v m 3 1 d b i d b j 2 1 d b i d b j 3 ρ d b i 3 σ where c vm is the virtual mass coefficient c vm 0 5 0 8 and here c vm is 0 5 through substituting eqns 36 and 37 into eqn 35 one can obtain the coalescence probability function 38 p c v i v j exp c 0 75 1 x i j 2 1 x i j 3 1 2 ρ b ρ 0 5 1 2 1 x i j 3 w e i j 1 2 where the constant c is 0 4 x ij d b i d b j and we is weber number which is calculated by the following equation 39 w e i j ρ d b i u i j 2 σ 2 4 computation methods the standard hexahedral element is used to generate the grid system the uniform grid is respectively used in the x and y directions whereas the non uniform grid is used in the z direction in the z direction the closer the distance from the wall is the denser the mesh is in order to accurately compute the turbulence near the wall according to the reference bhole et al 2008 the first layer grid should be satisfied with z 1 in the boundary layer accordingly when the grid system is generated the first layer z near the wall is firstly estimated by the following equation 40 z 0 172 δ z re 0 9 l where l is the characteristic length l h z is the dimensionless wall distance re is the liquid phase reynolds number and δz is the grid spacing between the wall and the first layer grid in the z direction in order to ensure the calculation accuracy and to reduce the computational cost three kinds of the grid systems are designed 150 10 60 mesh1 200 15 80 mesh2 and 250 20 100 mesh3 in the direction of x y and z the result comparison for three kinds of the grid systems is presented in fig 4 and it can be seen that the result from the mesh2 seems more accurate for the mesh2 the grid number is 100 000 and the first z for the real grid system is 0 55 which can meet the calculation requirement the void fraction and the population equilibrium equation are discretized by the first order upwind scheme for the momentum equation the pressure term is discretized by the standard format and other terms such as turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate and reynolds stress are discretized by the second order upwind scheme the coupling between the velocity and pressure fields is realized by the simple algorithm for the population balance model the bubble diameter is divided into 40 groups the population balance equation is solved by the discrete method the discrete method is that the interval of the bubble volume is divided into multiple sub intervals and the node volume rather than the interval volume is used 41 g i v i v i 1 2 i 1 n 1 n 40 where g i is the node volume in the range from v i to v i 1 and n is the group number of the bubble diameter which is divided into n 1 sub intervals as shown in fig 3 for the multiphase flow model the bubble diameter is the sauter average diameter d s provided by the population balance model therefore the sauter average diameter of bubbles is used to consider the influence of the bubble on the liquid phase turbulence the sauter average diameter can be calculated by the following equation 42 d s i 1 n n i d b i 3 i 1 n n i d b i 2 where d b i is the bubble diameter of the ith group and n i is the bubble number with a diameter of d b i for the present calculation the time step is 0 001s firstly the single liquid turbulence is calculated when the single phase calculation reaches the statistically stable state the bubbles are injected into liquid and then the gas liquid two phase flow starts to iterate 3 result analyses and discussion 3 1 calculation result verification in order to check the accuracy of the computational result the result of the single phase flow is analyzed firstly to eliminate the influence of the channel inlet and outlet on the computational result the section for the result analyses is selected at x 1500 mm along the downstream direction the velocity distribution of the single phase flow with re 100 000 is compared with the classical velocity distribution as shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that for mesh2 and mesh3 the velocity profile agrees well with the linear law u z in the viscous layer z 5 and it is in good agreement with the logarithmic law u 2 5lnz 5 5 in the outer layer of turbulence z 30 here z is the dimensionless wall normal distance z zu τ ν l where z is the distance from the wall ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid phase and u τ is the friction velocity of the liquid phase the velocity distribution for mesh1 deviates from the classical one the grid number of mesh2 is less than that of mesh3 and therefore the mesh2 is chosen as the grid system for the subsequent computation 3 2 result analyses on bubbly flows 3 2 1 analyses on drag reduction by bubbles the drag reduction rate by bubbles is defined as follows 43 d r 1 c f c f 0 100 where c f0 is the friction coefficient of the pure liquid and c f is the friction coefficient of the liquid phase laden with bubbles the friction coefficient is calculated by the following equation 44 c f 0 2 τ w ρ u 2 c f 2 τ w ρ m u 2 where u is the mean bulk velocity of the liquid phase and τ w is the wall shear stress which is defined as follows 45 τ w δ p h w 2 l h w here δp is the pressure drop h is the channel height w is the channel width and l is the distance between two pressure sampling positions fig 5 shows the distribution of the drag reduction rate by bubbles it can be seen from fig 5 that for the present investigation the rag reduction rate by bubbles is related to the liquid phase reynolds number and the global void fraction the influence of the global void fraction on the drag reduction rate depends on the magnitude of the liquid phase reynolds number as shown in fig 5 the drag reduction rate increases with increasing the liquid phase reynolds number for the present global void fractions the change trend of the drag reduction rate with changing the liquid phase reynolds number is similar for the same global void fraction the increase amplitude of the drag reduction rate is different it is very sharp in the range of re 10 000 50 000 and it is relatively gentle in the range of re 60 000 100 000 the drag reduction rate is higher for the global void fraction α 1 than that for α 5 when the liquid phase reynolds number is less than 50 000 whereas it is higher for the global void fraction α 5 than that for α 1 when the liquid phase reynolds number is larger than 50 000 ouyang et al 2013 discovered that the drag reduction rate increases with the increase of air injection however the drag reduction rate decreases again when the amount of air injection exceeds one certain value it is thus clear that the influence of the bubble void fraction on the drag reduction rate is related to the liquid phase reynold number as pointed out by many researchers such as ceccio 2010 pang et al 2014 oishi and murai 2014 and bandeira et al 2017 the drag reduction by bubbles depends on many factors such as the bubble size the bubble shape the global void fraction the liquid phase reynolds number etc here it is easily discovered that there is the great influence of the global void fraction of bubbles and the liquid phase reynolds number on the drag reduction rate subsequently the bubble physical parameters and the influence of bubbles on the liquid phase turbulence statistics are detailedly analyzed as follows so as to understand deeply the drag reduction mechanism by bubbles 3 2 2 the pdf distribution of bubble diameter the probability density function pdf distribution of the bubble diameter can reflect the change trend of the bubble size guo et al 2016 believed that the pdf distribution of the bubble diameter is directly related to the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate as a matter of fact the bubble group with the different size has the different influence on the liquid phase turbulence as pointed out by fujiwara et al 2004 and the bubble size strongly depends on the global void fraction of bubbles accordingly the bubble diameter distribution is firstly analyzed fig 6 shows the pdf distribution of the bubble diameter in fig 6 the pdf of the bubble diameter can be defined as follows 46 p d f i n i v i v b where n i is the number of the bubble with the volume of v i and v b is the total volume of the bubble it can be seen from fig 6 that the bubble diameter decreases with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number the higher the liquid phase reynolds number is the smaller the proportion of the large bubbles is for the same void fraction the higher the liquid phase reynolds number is the smaller the bubble diameter with the great proportion is that shows that the bubble breakup phenomenon is sharper when the liquid phase turbulence is stronger for the same reynolds number of the liquid phase the higher the global void fraction of bubbles is the larger the bubble number with the large diameter is that indicates that the bubble coalescence phenomenon is sharper when the bubble global void fraction is higher those facts show that the global void fraction of bubbles and the liquid phase reynolds number have the great influence on the bubble size as pointed out by paik et al 2016 thus it can be concluded that the different drag reduction rate may result from the different bubble diameter hara et al 2011 discovered that the turbulence frictional drag increases when the small bubbles coalesce into the large bubbles 3 2 3 bubble void fraction distribution ortiz villafuerte and hassan 2006 and jacob et al 2010 pointed out that the drag reduction by bubbles is closely related to the bubble distribution in the channel or the pipeline especially the bubble distribution in the buffer layer has the great influence on the drag reduction rate paik et al 2016 also found the above phenomenon when the liquid phase reynolds number is high in order to understand the drag reduction mechanism by bubbles the void fraction distribution of bubbles is presented in fig 7 fig 7 shows the influence of the liquid phase reynolds number on the void fraction distribution of bubbles it can be seen from fig 7 that the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate near the top wall of the channel under the influence of buoyancy and the higher liquid phase reynolds number corresponds to the lower peak of the void fraction near the top wall of the channel the present result is consistent with one published by pang et al 2014 namely the bubbles overcome the obstruction from the turbulence bursting events and accumulate in the region near the top wall under the drive of buoyancy here the different distribution of bubble void fraction may be caused by the fact that the bubble diameter is different when the liquid phase reynolds number is different the smaller the bubble diameter is the smaller the buoyancy acting on them is therefore it is difficult for the small diameter bubbles to approach the top wall of the channel as mentioned above the higher liquid phase reynolds number leads to the smaller diameter of bubbles because of the bubble breakup phenomena finally that leads to the smaller peak of the bubble void fraction near the top wall of the channel in addition the void fraction distribution of bubbles is significantly influenced by the turbulence bursting events near the channel wall besides the influence of the bubble buoyancy as pointed out by ferrante and elghobashi 2004 2005 the ejection motion of the turbulence bursting events will pull bubbles away from the top wall however the sweep motion will carry bubbles close to it those influence combined with the bubble buoyancy leads to the present distribution of the bubble void fraction 3 2 4 bubble deformation analyses as mentioned before many investigations lu et al 2005 kitagawa et al 2005 van den berg et al 2005 lo et al 2006 van gils et al 2013 verschoof et al 2016 etc show that the drag reduction by bubbles is directly related to the bubble deformation for the present investigation the bubble deformation is approximately analyzed as follows firstly the equivalent diameter of bubbles is calculated by eqn 47 and then the bubble weber number is solved based on the equivalent diameter of the bubble thus it can be judged whether the bubble deformation happen according to the magnitude of the bubble weber number 47 d e q u i 1 40 p d f i d b i here d b i is the bubble diameter of the ith group bubble and pdf i is the percentage of ith group bubble fig 8 shows the distribution of the bubble equivalent diameter as shown in fig 8 with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number the bubble equivalent diameter quickly decreases firstly and then it slowly reduces until tends to be stable at the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number the higher global void fraction corresponds to the larger bubble diameter however at the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number the bubble diameter has the very little difference between the global void fractions of 1 and 5 those phenomena show that the bubble coalescence is relatively important for the high global void fraction when the liquid phase reynolds number is low however the bubble breakup is relatively important due to the strong shear action when the liquid phase reynolds number is high fig 9 displays the bubble weber distribution based on the bubble equivalent diameter and the relative velocity between the bubble and liquid phases it can be seen from fig 9 that for the same global void fraction the bubble weber number decreases with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number especially the bubble weber number tends to a very small value when re 50 000 those facts show that the bubble deformation is very sharp for the cases of the low liquid phase reynolds number and the bubble deformation mitigates with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number additionally it is easy to see from figs 8 and 9 that the bubble deformation is directly related to the bubble size here the present results seem to show that there is not a certain relation between the bubble deformation and the drag reduction rate whereas the bubble size has the great influence on the drag reduction rate 3 2 5 analyses on the liquid phase turbulence statistics it is very beneficial for understanding the drag reduction mechanism by bubbles to analyze the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase turbulence accordingly analyses on the bubbles influencing the liquid phase turbulence statistics are presented as follows fig 10 presents the mean streamwise velocity of liquid one can see from fig 10 that the liquid phase velocity increases due to the bubble injection comparing with the single phase liquid and especially the liquid phase velocity increases greatly when the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively high it seems that the increase degree of the liquid phase mean velocity is greater for α 1 than that α 5 in the liquid phase reynolds range of 10 000 50 000 whereas that is greater for α 5 than that α 1 in the liquid phase reynolds range of 60 000 100 000 fig 11 shows the maximum value of the mean velocity of the liquid phase against the liquid phase reynolds number and it clearly displays the influence of the global void fraction of bubbles and the liquid phase reynold number on the liquid phase mean velocity the distribution trend of the maximum value of the mean velocity of the liquid phase is similar to that of the drag reduction rate against the liquid phase reynolds number the increase of the liquid phase mean velocity shows the occurrence of the drag reduction due to the bubble injection namely the reduction of the turbulence frictional drag just corresponds to the increase of the mean velocity when the driving force is same in order to understand the reason for the increase of the liquid phase mean velocity other turbulence statistics are analyzed as follows fig 12 shows the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity and it clearly shows that the velocity fluctuation intensity distribution of the liquid phase is not symmetric any more along the channel middle plane due to the bubble injection as shown in fig 12 the velocity fluctuation intensity components of the liquid phase decrease sharply in the upper half part of the channel compared with the single phase flow for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the sharper the decrease degree of the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity is it can also be seen from fig 12 that the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity is relatively complex in the lower half part of the channel the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity components almost keep unchanged in the lower half part of the channel when the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively low the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity is complex when the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively high namely it decreases in the region near the bottom wall and increases in the region close to the channel center the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity seems to be related to the void fraction distribution of bubbles as shown in fig 7 the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate near the top wall of the channel under the influence of buoyancy and there are almost not bubbles in the lower half part of the channel that leads to that the above phenomena happen to the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity the decrease of the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity in the upper half part of the channel may be related to the suppression of bubbles on the turbulence vortexes near the top wall as pointed out by pang et al 2014 and park et al 2015 the suppression of the turbulence vortexes are bound to cause the decrease of the velocity fluctuation intensity in order to comprehensively understand the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity fig 13 displays the liquid phase turbulence intensity besides the phenomena similar to the velocity fluctuation intensity it can be seen from fig 13 that the bubble injection makes the peak of the liquid phase turbulence intensity closer to the channel wall that denotes that the turbulence boundary layer becomes thinner due to the bubble injection namely the active region of turbulence vortexes becomes narrow additionally it can also be seen from fig 13 that the decrease magnitude of the liquid phase turbulence intensity is sharper for the global void fraction α 1 than that for α 5 in the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number 10 000 50 000 whereas the decrease magnitude of it is sharper for the global void fraction α 5 than that for α 1 in the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number 60 000 100 000 as pointed out by fukagata et al 2002 the skin friction coefficient for the channel turbulence is tightly related to the liquid phase reynolds stress to see eqn 48 in eqn 48 z z h accordingly the understanding of the liquid phase reynolds stress modulated by bubbles is very helpful to understand the influence of the bubble injection on the skin friction drag fig 14 shows the liquid phase reynolds stress profile it can be seen from fig 14 that the bubble injection changes the balance place of the liquid phase reynolds stress in the channel it greatly reduces the liquid phase reynolds stress in the upper half part of the channel and slightly reduces the liquid phase reynolds stress in the region near the bottom wall of the channel the decrease degree of the liquid phase reynolds stress changes sharply with changing the liquid phase reynolds number in the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number whereas it changes slightly with changing the liquid phase reynolds number in the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number similar to the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase turbulence intensity the global void fraction of bubbles has also the definite influence on the liquid phase reynolds stress as well known the magnitude of the reynolds stress depends on the frequency and intensity of the turbulence bursting events for the present investigations the decrease of the liquid phase reynolds stress may be related to the intensity decrease of the turbulence bursting events 48 c f 12 re 12 0 1 2 1 z u v d z for the turbulence flow the part of energy can be dissipated by the turbulence vortex due to the fluid viscosity in order to judge whether the bubble injection influences the liquid phase turbulence dissipation fig 15 shows the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate it can be seen from fig 15 that compared with the single phase liquid the bubble injection reduces the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate is very sharp in the upper half part of the channel where the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate however it is relatively slight in the lower half part of the channel where there are hardly any bubbles the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate means the decrease of energy dissipated by the turbulence vortex the part of the saved energy may be used to increase the mean velocity of the liquid phase to cause the drag reduction as shown in figs 5 and 10 3 2 6 discussion on the drag reduction reason by bubbles the above analyses fully show that the bubble injection causes the drag reduction and the suppression of the liquid phase turbulence the drag reduction rate strongly depends on the liquid phase reynolds number and the bubble global void fraction for the same global void fraction the different liquid phase reynolds number leads to the different drag reduction rate and for the same liquid phase reynolds number the different global void fraction of bubbles leads to the different drag reduction rate too through analyzing the bubble deformation and the bubble size it is discovered that for the present investigation the drag reduction by bubbles mainly depends on the bubble size rather than the bubble deformation and the bubble size nonlinearly depends on both the bubble global void fraction and the liquid phase reynolds number the smaller the bubble diameter is the sharper the suppression of the bubble on the liquid turbulence is and the higher the drag reduction rate is for the low liquid phase reynolds number when the global void fraction of bubbles is high the coalescence between bubbles is significant that leads to that the bubble diameter is great the large bubbles can suppress the liquid phase turbulence but their wakes are chaotic and the bubble wakes influence each other those phenomena can enhance the liquid phase turbulence therefore for the low liquid phase reynolds number when the void fraction of bubbles is high the bubble diameter is large due to the notable coalescence the suppression of bubbles on the liquid turbulence is weak and thus the drag reduction becomes slight it seems to be concluded that for each global void fraction of bubbles the bubble has a minimum critical diameter when the bubble diameter reaches to the minimum one it changes very slightly with changing the liquid phase reynolds number and therefore the drag reduction rate changes slightly too as shown above the liquid phase turbulence suppression and the drag reduction by bubbles are tightly related to the bubble diameter when the bubble diameter is less than the optimum one the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence is slight and the drag reduction rate is low too when the bubble diameter is close to the optimum one the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence is very sharp and therefore the drag reduction rate is highest too when the bubble diameter is larger than the optimum one the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence does not violently change any more with the increases of the liquid phase reynolds number and the same is true for the drag reduction rate although the present numerical method cannot obtain the fine turbulence structures and cannot present the direct interactions between bubbles and liquid phase turbulence vortexes some mechanism explanations about the drag reduction by bubbles can also be concluded from the present results for the present investigation the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate in the region near the top wall of the channel under the drive of buoyancy that means that a bubble layer may form near the top wall which prevents the turbulence structure near the wall from spreading towards the channel center that corresponds to the fact that the bubble injection makes the turbulence boundary layer thin for the present investigation if the turbulence structure i e the vortex structure near the wall cannot effectively spread towards the central region of the channel the formation and development of the streamwise vortexes will be suppressed as the matter of fact the streamwise vortexes are the main reason that the turbulence friction drag forms therefore the drag reduction will happen as long as the streamwise vortexes are suppressed in addition most of bubbles accumulate in the region near the wall i e in the buffer layer where the coherent motions of turbulence are the most active and thus the interactions between the single bubble or the bubble group and the coherent structure of turbulence happen because the bubbles always have the motion trend towards to the wall the interactions between them may reduce the ejection strength of the low moment liquid that causes the decrease of the liquid phase reynolds stress as shown in eqn 48 the reynolds stress has the great contribution to the frictional drag coefficient accordingly the decrease of the liquid phase reynolds stress can cause the drag reduction too 4 conclusions the drag reduction by small bubbles are numerically investigated with the mixture model combined with the population balance model in this paper and the influence of the bubble global void fraction and the liquid phase reynolds number on the drag reduction and the liquid phase turbulence statistics are analyzed in detail some conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 for the present investigation the bubble injection causes the drag reduction the drag reduction rate is tightly related to the bubble global void fraction and the liquid phase reynolds number and in the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number the low global void fraction seems to be more beneficial to the drag reduction however the high global void fraction seems to be better for the drag reduction in the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number 2 the drag reduction by bubbles is tightly related to the bubble size but not the bubble deformation and the bubble with a small diameter seems to be more beneficial to the drag reduction and for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the sharper the bubble breakup phenomenon is the smaller the bubble diameter is and the higher the drag reduction rate is 3 the present studies show that the drag reduction by bubbles is related to the suppression of bubbles on the turbulence intensity and the reynolds stress of the liquid phase for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the smaller the bubble diameter is the sharper the decrease of the turbulence intensity and the reynolds stress of the liquid phase is and the higher the drag reduction rate is 4 the bubble injection seems to reduce the thickness of the turbulence boundary layer and that phenomenon may also be one of reasons for the drag reduction by bubbles 5 it can also be concluded that the interactions between bubbles may greatly limit the drag reduction when the bubble global void fraction is relatively high and the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively low

23276,the drag reduction by small bubbles is investigated with mixture multiphase flow model combined with population balance model for the horizontal channel turbulence the influence of liquid phase reynolds number and global void fraction on the drag reduction is fully analyzed the present results show that the addition of small bubbles cause the drag reduction and the liquid phase reynolds number and the global void fraction have the great influence on the drag reduction rate for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the sharper the bubble breakup phenomenon is which leads to that the bubble diameter is smaller and the drag reduction rate is higher the influence of the global void fraction on the drag reduction rate is related to the liquid phase reynolds number for the low liquid phase reynolds number the case with the lower global void fraction has the higher drag reducing rate however for the high liquid phase reynolds number the higher void fraction corresponds to the larger drag reduction rate it is very important for investigating the drag reduction by bubbles to consider the bubble coalescence and breakup phenomena and the present results show that the drag reduction rate strongly depends on the bubble size keywords small bubble turbulence drag reduction turbulence modulation mixture model population balance model 1 introduction drag reduction in the turbulent flow has been a very important issue in engineering and academic circles as is well known many ways have been proposed to reduce turbulence frictional drag in liquid such oil and water transport process in the past of all drag reducing methods in view of the environmental friendly characteristic and the high drag reducing rate the drag reduction by bubbles with different sizes has recently been paid more and more attention by researchers and engineers to expect that it can be applied to reduce the frictional drag for ships in water and liquid transport in pipelines in the near future presently a large number of investigations on the drag reduction by bubbles have been performed so as to understand the drag reducing mechanism and to promote its engineering application some early investigations have shown that the drag reduction effect by bubbles is tightly related to the bubble size and it is found that the drag reduction by bubbles is very effective only when the bubble size is very small for this reason the early investigations on the drag reduction by bubbles mainly focus on microbubbles whose diameter is less than 1 mm some researchers such as mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 bogdevich et al 1977 merkle and deutsch 1989 madavan et al 1984 and 1985a guin et al 1996 kim and cleaver 1995 kato et al 1999 kodama et al 2000 gabillet et al 2002 moriguchi and kato 2002 nagaya et al 2002 latorre et al 2003 deutsch et al 2004 hassan et al 2005 van den berg et al 2005 akoi et al 2006 murai et al 2006 2007 sanders et al 2006 shen et al 2006 elbing et al 2008 jacob et al 2010 kumagai et al 2015 paik et al 2016 qin et al 2017 etc carried out studies on the drag reduction by microbubbles by means of experimental methods and other researchers such as legner 1984 madavan et al 1985b marie 1987 meng and uhlman 1989 kanai and miyata 2001 kawamura and kodama 2002 xu et al 2002 kunz et al 2003 ferrante and elghobashi 2004 2005 lu et al 2005 skudarnov and lin 2006 xu et al 2007 kunz et al 2007 mohanarangam et al 2009 pang et al 2014 asiagbe et al 2017 qin et al 2017 etc performed theoretical and numerical studies on the drag reduction by microbubbles with the deep investigation on the drag reduction by bubbles in the turbulent flow it is found that the bubbles with a diameter greater than 1 mm can also cause the drag reduction van gils et al 2013 maryami et al 2015 verschoof et al 2016 thus the importance of the bubble size for the drag reduction becomes a controversial focus it was even pointed out by shen et al 2006 and ceccio 2010 that the drag reduction is independent of the bubble size therefore the mechanism on the drag reduction by bubbles becomes more and more bewildered the present mechanism on the drag reduction by bubbles can be summarized as follows the first explanation is the density and viscosity effect legner 1984 marie 1987 chanson 1994 lvov et al 2005 shen et al 2006 skudarnov and lin 2006 etc namely the injection of bubbles changes local viscosity and density of the mixture phase to cause the drag reduction the second explanation is based on interactions between bubbles and liquid phase turbulence kanai and miyata 2001 xu et al 2002 ferrante and elghobashi 2004 mohanarangam et al 2009 jacob et al 2010 pang et al 2014 etc namely the addition of bubbles influences the liquid phase turbulence structure and reduces reynolds shear stress of the liquid phase to cause the drag reduction the third explanation is based on the bubble fluctuations namely the bubbles in the turbulence flow happens to shape change and volume compression to lead to the drag reduction lu et al 2005 van den berg et al 2005 lo et al 2006 van gils et al 2013 verschoof et al 2016 etc as a matter of fact the bubble deformation depends on the weber number if the thermos physical parameters of bubble and liquid phases and the liquid phase velocity field are fixed the bubble deformation is only related the bubble size according to the definition of the weber number for the definite liquid phase velocity field laden with bubbles the bubble size strongly depends on the coalescence and breakup processes even if the initial diameter of bubbles corresponding to the small weber number is very small it can also become relatively big due to the coalescence effect corresponding to the big weber number with the increase of the bubble size the bubble deformation happens and the drag reduction will also change vershoof et al 2016 accordingly it is very important for the drag reduction by bubbles to consider the bubble coalescence and breakup processes to further explore the physical phenomena and to understand the mechanism of the drag reduction by bubbles in this paper the influence of the bubble coalescence and breakup on the drag reduction is numerically investigated with mixture multiphase flow model combined with population balance model pbm in the horizontal channel the reynolds stress model rsm is applied to solve the turbulence velocity field the diameter range of the bubble coalescence and breakup is 0 001 8 mm the global void fraction is 1 5 and the liquid phase reynolds number is 104 105 the paper structure is arranged as follows section 1 is introduction section 2 introduces physical model and computational method section 3 presents result analyses and discussion and section 4 summarizes conclusions 2 physical model and computational method 2 1 geometric model and boundary conditions here the two dimensional channel is chosen as the computational region to investigate the drag reduction by bubbles as shown in fig 1 the coordinate system can be seen in fig 1 the coordinate origin is set at the center of cross section in the channel inlet the x direction denotes the flow direction the y direction is the spanwise one and the z direction is the wall normal one the gravity acceleration acts on the negative direction of the z axis dean 1978 pointed out that the secondary flow occurring in the spanwise wall can be ignored when the aspect ratio of the channel is greater than 7 for the present computation the channel width and height are 150 mm and 10 mm respectively and thus the aspect ratio of the channel is 15 greater than 7 which can ignore the influence of the secondary flow the channel length should be long enough to make the turbulence develop fully for the newtonian fluid the channel length which the full development of turbulence needs can be computed by the equation of l 8 14re 1 6 h for the present computation the largest liquid phase reynolds number is 105 and thus the channel length l should be larger than 550 mm to eliminate the influence of the back flow in the channel outlet the final length of the channel is set as 2000 mm thus the channel sizes l w h correspond to 2000 150 10 mm in the x y and z directions in the computational process the inlet section of the channel is the velocity inlet condition and the outlet is the free flow condition the top and bottom walls of the channel are set as no slip boundary conditions and the periodic boundary condition is applied to the spanwise direction in order to reduce the computational cost 2 2 calculation conditions in this paper the influence of the liquid phase reynolds number on the drag reduction is investigated under the same void fraction the global void fraction of bubbles is 1 and 5 each global void fraction corresponds to 10 liquid phase reynolds numbers and thus there are 20 computational cases in all thermo physical parameters of bubble and liquid phases are ones of air and water at the temperature of 20 c the initial diameter of bubbles is given to a constant value d b first 4 mm and the breakup and coalescence range of the bubble diameter is 0 001 8 mm as a matter of fact murai 2014 presented a detailed reviewer on the drag reduction by bubbles and it is found that the bubble diameter is in the range of 0 001 8 mm for the published cases with the liquid phase velocity in the range of 1 10 m s and the bubble void fraction in the range of 0 20 it can be seen from the above fact show that the range of the bubble diameter is reasonable according to the calculation need of pbm the bubble diameter is classified into 40 groups and the volume ratio between two adjacent bubbles v i 1 v i is equal to 2 the related computational parameters are listed in table 1 in addition according to the current calculation parameter the number of bubbles is 108 and thus the calculation cost is very large if the discrete phase model is used as the multiphase flow model 2 3 governing equations 2 3 1 continuity equation the mixture model is one kind of the models based on the eulerian coordinate system for which both gas and liquid phases are regarded as the continuous media only one set of the gas liquid two phase mixture equations are solved here the continuity equation is presented as follows 1 t ρ m ρ m u m 0 where ρ

phase viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration and f is the body force here the body force denotes the drag force between the bubble and liquid phases and it is calculated by the following equation 5 f 1 2 a b ρ c d u u b u b u where a b is the bubble sectional area a b πd 2 4 and c d is the drag coefficient because the bubble with millimeter scale in diameter may happen to deformation in the turbulence flow the non spherical bubble model proposed by ishii and zuber 1979 is used to calculate the bubble drag coefficient the model considers three kinds of bubble shapes spherical distorted and cap ones and the optimum drag coefficient is calculated according to the bubble shape it can be expressed as follows 6 c d spherical 24 re 1 0 1 re b 0 75 7 c d d i s t o r t e d 2 3 e o

18 μ 2 3 4 population balance model here the population balance model is used to describe the coalescence and breakup phenomena of the bubble groups the population balance model groups bubbles as the discrete phase in scale and solves the number density function for each group of bubbles the range of bubble size is 0 001 8 mm and it is divided into 40 groups the bubbles with the smallest size do not consider the breakup phenomenon the bubbles with the largest size do not consider the coalescence phenomenon and the bubbles with other sizes simultaneously consider the coalescence and breakup phenomena yeoh et al 2010 presented a generalized computational model on the population balance equation namely 18 n v x t t u b v x t n v x t s v x t where n v x t is the number density of bubbles v is the bubble volume x is the spatial position vector of the bubble and t is the physical time u b v x t is the bubble velocity and s v x t is the bubble coalescence and breakup source term and it can be defined by the following function 19 s v x t 1 2 0 v n v v x t n v x t c v v v d ξ birth due to coalescence n v x t 0 n v x t c v v d v death due to coalescence v γ v n v x t b v v β v v d v birth due to breakage n v x t b v v death due to breakage where c v v is the coalescence rate of bubbles with volumes v and v respectively b v v is the breakup rate at which bubbles of volume v break into ones of volume v γ v is the number of daughter bubbles of volume v from the breakup here the binary breakup is used γ v 2 β v v is the probability density function of bubbles of volume v breaking into ones of volume v in this paper two kinds of the most important bubble coalescence and breakup model are used as shown in fig 2 namely the turbulent vortex colliding with bubbles causes the bubble breakup and the liquid phase turbulence induces bubbles to coalesce the details on the bubble coalescence and breakup models can be referred to luo and svendsen 1996 2 3 4 1 bubble breakup rate function luo and svendsen 1996 presented the general expression on the bubble breakup rate namely 20 b v v λ min d b p b v v f b v λ ω b λ v d λ where ω b λ v is the collision frequency between the bubble of volume v and one vortex and p b v vf bv λ is the collapsing probability of the bubble colliding with one vortex the bubble breakup rate function is based on the derivation of the energy principle if the turbulence kinetic energy for one vortex is greater than the bubble surface energy the bubble will break up luo and svendsen 1996 presented the mean turbulent energy expression for the vortex with the size of λ 21 e λ π 6 ρ λ 3 u λ 2 2 π β 12 ρ ε d b 2 3 d b 3 ξ 11 3 here β 2 047 and ξ λ d b u λ is the average velocity of the vortex with the size of λ and it can be expressed as follows 22 u λ β 1 2 ε λ 1 3 for the bubble with a diameter of d b its breakup consuming the surface energy can be calculated by the following equation 23 e d b c f π d b 2 σ where c f is the bubble surface area coefficient and it can be seen 24 c f f b v 2 3 1 f b v 2 3 1 here f bv is the broken volume fraction and it can be calculated by eqn 25 25 f b v v j v d b j 3 d b 3 d b j 3 d b i 3 d b j 3 in eqn 25 d b i and d b j are the diameter of the sub bubbles after the bubble with the diameter of d b breaks up and their corresponding volumes are v i and v j respectively as shown in fig 2 a the collision time is extremely short between the bubble and one vortex if the turbulent kinetic energy for one vortex is greater than the surface energy of the bubble the bubble may break up during this time namely e λ e d b and the bubble breakup probability expression is 26 p b v v f b v λ p e e λ e d b p e χ χ c 1 p e χ χ c where χ is the dimensionless energy χ e λ e λ and χ c is the critical dimensionless energy χ c e d b e λ 12 c f σ β ρ ε 2 3 d b 5 3 ξ 11 3 the breakup probability expression can be rewritten as follows 27 p b v v f b v λ 1 0 χ c e χ d χ e χ c based on the isotropy

rewritten as follows 29 b v v c ξ min 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 e a ξ 11 3 d ξ here a 12c f σρ 1 ε 2 3 d b 5 3 β 1 c 1 392ε 1 3 d b 2 3 and ξ min λ min d b λ min is the minimum vortex scale 2 3 4 2 sub bubble distribution function the probability density function of sub bubbles can be calculated by the following equation luo and svendsen 1996 30 β v v 2 ξ min 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 e χ c d ξ v 0 1 ξ min 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 e χ c d ξ d f b v 2 3 4 3 bubble coalescence rate function the coalescence between bubbles is mainly caused by the turbulence vortex of the liquid phase see fig 2 b the coalescence rate function proposed by luo 1993 is presented as follows 31 c v i v j ω v i v j p v i v j where v i and v j are the volume of the ith and jth bubble ω v i v j is the collision frequency between ith and jth bubbles and p v i v j is the bubble coalescence probability the collision frequency is 32 ω v i v j π 4 d b i d b j 2 u i j where u i j is the characteristic velocity of collision of two bubbles with the diameters of d i and d j and it can be calculated by the following expression 33 u i j u i 2 u j 2 1 2 34 u i 1 43 ε d b i 1 3 the random collision between bubbles is induced by the liquid phase turbulence and when the bubbles collide with each other two kinds of phenomena may happen 1 the bubble may rebound after the collision 2 the bubble coalescence may happen after the collision the coalescence rate function of bubbles can be defined as follows 35 p b v i v j e t d t c where t d is the coalescence time of bubbles and t c is the touch time of bubbles when the collision occurs between bubbles the bubbles will coalesce if t c t d the coalescence time t d is calculated by the following expression 36 t d 0 5 ρ u i j b b i 2 1 d b i d b j 2 σ where σ is the gas liquid interface tension the touch time during the bubble collision process mainly depends on the bubble diameter and the surface tension and it can be calculated by the following equation 37 t c 1 d b i d b j ρ b ρ c v m 3 1 d b i d b j 2 1 d b i d b j 3 ρ d b i 3 σ where c vm is the virtual mass coefficient c vm 0 5 0 8 and here c vm is 0 5 through substituting eqns 36 and 37 into eqn 35 one can obtain the coalescence probability function 38 p c v i v j exp c 0 75 1 x i j 2 1 x i j 3 1 2 ρ b ρ 0 5 1 2 1 x i j 3 w e i j 1 2 where the constant c is 0 4 x ij d b i d b j and we is weber number which is calculated by the following equation 39 w e i j ρ d b i u i j 2 σ 2 4 computation methods the standard hexahedral element is used to generate the grid system the uniform grid is respectively used in the x and y directions whereas the non uniform grid is used in the z direction in the z direction the closer the distance from the wall is the denser the mesh is in order to accurately compute the turbulence near the wall according to the reference bhole et al 2008 the first layer grid should be satisfied with z 1 in the boundary layer accordingly when the grid system is generated the first layer z near the wall is firstly estimated by the following equation 40 z 0 172 δ z re 0 9 l where l is the characteristic length l h z is the dimensionless wall distance re is the liquid phase reynolds number and δz is the grid spacing between the wall and the first layer grid in the z direction in order to ensure the calculation accuracy and to reduce the computational cost three kinds of the grid systems are designed 150 10 60 mesh1 200 15 80 mesh2 and 250 20 100 mesh3 in the direction of x y and z the result comparison for three kinds of the grid systems is presented in fig 4 and it can be seen that the result from the mesh2 seems more accurate for the mesh2 the grid number is 100 000 and the first z for the real grid system is 0 55 which can meet the calculation requirement the void fraction and the population equilibrium equation are discretized by the first order upwind scheme for the momentum equation the pressure term is discretized by the standard format and other terms such as turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate and reynolds stress are discretized by the second order upwind scheme the coupling between the velocity and pressure fields is realized by the simple algorithm for the population balance model the bubble diameter is divided into 40 groups the population balance equation is solved by the discrete method the discrete method is that the interval of the bubble volume is divided into multiple sub intervals and the node volume rather than the interval volume is used 41 g i v i v i 1 2 i 1 n 1 n 40 where g i is the node volume in the range from v i to v i 1 and n is the group number of the bubble diameter which is divided into n 1 sub intervals as shown in fig 3 for the multiphase flow model the bubble diameter is the sauter average diameter d s provided by the population balance model therefore the sauter average diameter of bubbles is used to consider the influence of the bubble on the liquid phase turbulence the sauter average diameter can be calculated by the following equation 42 d s i 1 n n i d b i 3 i 1 n n i d b i 2 where d b i is the bubble diameter of the ith group and n i is the bubble number with a diameter of d b i for the present calculation the time step is 0 001s firstly the single liquid turbulence is calculated when the single phase calculation reaches the statistically stable state the bubbles are injected into liquid and then the gas liquid two phase flow starts to iterate 3 result analyses and discussion 3 1 calculation result verification in order to check the accuracy of the computational result the result of the single phase flow is analyzed firstly to eliminate the influence of the channel inlet and outlet on the computational result the section for the result analyses is selected at x 1500 mm along the downstream direction the velocity distribution of the single phase flow with re 100 000 is compared with the classical velocity distribution as shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that for mesh2 and mesh3 the velocity profile agrees well with the linear law u z in the viscous layer z 5 and it is in good agreement with the logarithmic law u 2 5lnz 5 5 in the outer layer of turbulence z 30 here z is the dimensionless wall normal distance z zu τ ν l where z is the distance from the wall ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid phase and u τ is the friction velocity of the liquid phase the velocity distribution for mesh1 deviates from the classical one the grid number of mesh2 is less than that of mesh3 and therefore the mesh2 is chosen as the grid system for the subsequent computation 3 2 result analyses on bubbly flows 3 2 1 analyses on drag reduction by bubbles the drag reduction rate by bubbles is defined as follows 43 d r 1 c f c f 0 100 where c f0 is the friction coefficient of the pure liquid and c f is the friction coefficient of the liquid phase laden with bubbles the friction coefficient is calculated by the following equation 44 c f 0 2 τ w ρ u 2 c f 2 τ w ρ m u 2 where u is the mean bulk velocity of the liquid phase and τ w is the wall shear stress which is defined as follows 45 τ w δ p h w 2 l h w here δp is the pressure drop h is the channel height w is the channel width and l is the distance between two pressure sampling positions fig 5 shows the distribution of the drag reduction rate by bubbles it can be seen from fig 5 that for the present investigation the rag reduction rate by bubbles is related to the liquid phase reynolds number and the global void fraction the influence of the global void fraction on the drag reduction rate depends on the magnitude of the liquid phase reynolds number as shown in fig 5 the drag reduction rate increases with increasing the liquid phase reynolds number for the present global void fractions the change trend of the drag reduction rate with changing the liquid phase reynolds number is similar for the same global void fraction the increase amplitude of the drag reduction rate is different it is very sharp in the range of re 10 000 50 000 and it is relatively gentle in the range of re 60 000 100 000 the drag reduction rate is higher for the global void fraction α 1 than that for α 5 when the liquid phase reynolds number is less than 50 000 whereas it is higher for the global void fraction α 5 than that for α 1 when the liquid phase reynolds number is larger than 50 000 ouyang et al 2013 discovered that the drag reduction rate increases with the increase of air injection however the drag reduction rate decreases again when the amount of air injection exceeds one certain value it is thus clear that the influence of the bubble void fraction on the drag reduction rate is related to the liquid phase reynold number as pointed out by many researchers such as ceccio 2010 pang et al 2014 oishi and murai 2014 and bandeira et al 2017 the drag reduction by bubbles depends on many factors such as the bubble size the bubble shape the global void fraction the liquid phase reynolds number etc here it is easily discovered that there is the great influence of the global void fraction of bubbles and the liquid phase reynolds number on the drag reduction rate subsequently the bubble physical parameters and the influence of bubbles on the liquid phase turbulence statistics are detailedly analyzed as follows so as to understand deeply the drag reduction mechanism by bubbles 3 2 2 the pdf distribution of bubble diameter the probability density function pdf distribution of the bubble diameter can reflect the change trend of the bubble size guo et al 2016 believed that the pdf distribution of the bubble diameter is directly related to the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate as a matter of fact the bubble group with the different size has the different influence on the liquid phase turbulence as pointed out by fujiwara et al 2004 and the bubble size strongly depends on the global void fraction of bubbles accordingly the bubble diameter distribution is firstly analyzed fig 6 shows the pdf distribution of the bubble diameter in fig 6 the pdf of the bubble diameter can be defined as follows 46 p d f i n i v i v b where n i is the number of the bubble with the volume of v i and v b is the total volume of the bubble it can be seen from fig 6 that the bubble diameter decreases with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number the higher the liquid phase reynolds number is the smaller the proportion of the large bubbles is for the same void fraction the higher the liquid phase reynolds number is the smaller the bubble diameter with the great proportion is that shows that the bubble breakup phenomenon is sharper when the liquid phase turbulence is stronger for the same reynolds number of the liquid phase the higher the global void fraction of bubbles is the larger the bubble number with the large diameter is that indicates that the bubble coalescence phenomenon is sharper when the bubble global void fraction is higher those facts show that the global void fraction of bubbles and the liquid phase reynolds number have the great influence on the bubble size as pointed out by paik et al 2016 thus it can be concluded that the different drag reduction rate may result from the different bubble diameter hara et al 2011 discovered that the turbulence frictional drag increases when the small bubbles coalesce into the large bubbles 3 2 3 bubble void fraction distribution ortiz villafuerte and hassan 2006 and jacob et al 2010 pointed out that the drag reduction by bubbles is closely related to the bubble distribution in the channel or the pipeline especially the bubble distribution in the buffer layer has the great influence on the drag reduction rate paik et al 2016 also found the above phenomenon when the liquid phase reynolds number is high in order to understand the drag reduction mechanism by bubbles the void fraction distribution of bubbles is presented in fig 7 fig 7 shows the influence of the liquid phase reynolds number on the void fraction distribution of bubbles it can be seen from fig 7 that the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate near the top wall of the channel under the influence of buoyancy and the higher liquid phase reynolds number corresponds to the lower peak of the void fraction near the top wall of the channel the present result is consistent with one published by pang et al 2014 namely the bubbles overcome the obstruction from the turbulence bursting events and accumulate in the region near the top wall under the drive of buoyancy here the different distribution of bubble void fraction may be caused by the fact that the bubble diameter is different when the liquid phase reynolds number is different the smaller the bubble diameter is the smaller the buoyancy acting on them is therefore it is difficult for the small diameter bubbles to approach the top wall of the channel as mentioned above the higher liquid phase reynolds number leads to the smaller diameter of bubbles because of the bubble breakup phenomena finally that leads to the smaller peak of the bubble void fraction near the top wall of the channel in addition the void fraction distribution of bubbles is significantly influenced by the turbulence bursting events near the channel wall besides the influence of the bubble buoyancy as pointed out by ferrante and elghobashi 2004 2005 the ejection motion of the turbulence bursting events will pull bubbles away from the top wall however the sweep motion will carry bubbles close to it those influence combined with the bubble buoyancy leads to the present distribution of the bubble void fraction 3 2 4 bubble deformation analyses as mentioned before many investigations lu et al 2005 kitagawa et al 2005 van den berg et al 2005 lo et al 2006 van gils et al 2013 verschoof et al 2016 etc show that the drag reduction by bubbles is directly related to the bubble deformation for the present investigation the bubble deformation is approximately analyzed as follows firstly the equivalent diameter of bubbles is calculated by eqn 47 and then the bubble weber number is solved based on the equivalent diameter of the bubble thus it can be judged whether the bubble deformation happen according to the magnitude of the bubble weber number 47 d e q u i 1 40 p d f i d b i here d b i is the bubble diameter of the ith group bubble and pdf i is the percentage of ith group bubble fig 8 shows the distribution of the bubble equivalent diameter as shown in fig 8 with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number the bubble equivalent diameter quickly decreases firstly and then it slowly reduces until tends to be stable at the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number the higher global void fraction corresponds to the larger bubble diameter however at the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number the bubble diameter has the very little difference between the global void fractions of 1 and 5 those phenomena show that the bubble coalescence is relatively important for the high global void fraction when the liquid phase reynolds number is low however the bubble breakup is relatively important due to the strong shear action when the liquid phase reynolds number is high fig 9 displays the bubble weber distribution based on the bubble equivalent diameter and the relative velocity between the bubble and liquid phases it can be seen from fig 9 that for the same global void fraction the bubble weber number decreases with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number especially the bubble weber number tends to a very small value when re 50 000 those facts show that the bubble deformation is very sharp for the cases of the low liquid phase reynolds number and the bubble deformation mitigates with the increase of the liquid phase reynolds number additionally it is easy to see from figs 8 and 9 that the bubble deformation is directly related to the bubble size here the present results seem to show that there is not a certain relation between the bubble deformation and the drag reduction rate whereas the bubble size has the great influence on the drag reduction rate 3 2 5 analyses on the liquid phase turbulence statistics it is very beneficial for understanding the drag reduction mechanism by bubbles to analyze the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase turbulence accordingly analyses on the bubbles influencing the liquid phase turbulence statistics are presented as follows fig 10 presents the mean streamwise velocity of liquid one can see from fig 10 that the liquid phase velocity increases due to the bubble injection comparing with the single phase liquid and especially the liquid phase velocity increases greatly when the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively high it seems that the increase degree of the liquid phase mean velocity is greater for α 1 than that α 5 in the liquid phase reynolds range of 10 000 50 000 whereas that is greater for α 5 than that α 1 in the liquid phase reynolds range of 60 000 100 000 fig 11 shows the maximum value of the mean velocity of the liquid phase against the liquid phase reynolds number and it clearly displays the influence of the global void fraction of bubbles and the liquid phase reynold number on the liquid phase mean velocity the distribution trend of the maximum value of the mean velocity of the liquid phase is similar to that of the drag reduction rate against the liquid phase reynolds number the increase of the liquid phase mean velocity shows the occurrence of the drag reduction due to the bubble injection namely the reduction of the turbulence frictional drag just corresponds to the increase of the mean velocity when the driving force is same in order to understand the reason for the increase of the liquid phase mean velocity other turbulence statistics are analyzed as follows fig 12 shows the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity and it clearly shows that the velocity fluctuation intensity distribution of the liquid phase is not symmetric any more along the channel middle plane due to the bubble injection as shown in fig 12 the velocity fluctuation intensity components of the liquid phase decrease sharply in the upper half part of the channel compared with the single phase flow for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the sharper the decrease degree of the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity is it can also be seen from fig 12 that the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity is relatively complex in the lower half part of the channel the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity components almost keep unchanged in the lower half part of the channel when the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively low the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity is complex when the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively high namely it decreases in the region near the bottom wall and increases in the region close to the channel center the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity seems to be related to the void fraction distribution of bubbles as shown in fig 7 the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate near the top wall of the channel under the influence of buoyancy and there are almost not bubbles in the lower half part of the channel that leads to that the above phenomena happen to the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity the decrease of the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity in the upper half part of the channel may be related to the suppression of bubbles on the turbulence vortexes near the top wall as pointed out by pang et al 2014 and park et al 2015 the suppression of the turbulence vortexes are bound to cause the decrease of the velocity fluctuation intensity in order to comprehensively understand the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase velocity fluctuation intensity fig 13 displays the liquid phase turbulence intensity besides the phenomena similar to the velocity fluctuation intensity it can be seen from fig 13 that the bubble injection makes the peak of the liquid phase turbulence intensity closer to the channel wall that denotes that the turbulence boundary layer becomes thinner due to the bubble injection namely the active region of turbulence vortexes becomes narrow additionally it can also be seen from fig 13 that the decrease magnitude of the liquid phase turbulence intensity is sharper for the global void fraction α 1 than that for α 5 in the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number 10 000 50 000 whereas the decrease magnitude of it is sharper for the global void fraction α 5 than that for α 1 in the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number 60 000 100 000 as pointed out by fukagata et al 2002 the skin friction coefficient for the channel turbulence is tightly related to the liquid phase reynolds stress to see eqn 48 in eqn 48 z z h accordingly the understanding of the liquid phase reynolds stress modulated by bubbles is very helpful to understand the influence of the bubble injection on the skin friction drag fig 14 shows the liquid phase reynolds stress profile it can be seen from fig 14 that the bubble injection changes the balance place of the liquid phase reynolds stress in the channel it greatly reduces the liquid phase reynolds stress in the upper half part of the channel and slightly reduces the liquid phase reynolds stress in the region near the bottom wall of the channel the decrease degree of the liquid phase reynolds stress changes sharply with changing the liquid phase reynolds number in the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number whereas it changes slightly with changing the liquid phase reynolds number in the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number similar to the influence of the bubble injection on the liquid phase turbulence intensity the global void fraction of bubbles has also the definite influence on the liquid phase reynolds stress as well known the magnitude of the reynolds stress depends on the frequency and intensity of the turbulence bursting events for the present investigations the decrease of the liquid phase reynolds stress may be related to the intensity decrease of the turbulence bursting events 48 c f 12 re 12 0 1 2 1 z u v d z for the turbulence flow the part of energy can be dissipated by the turbulence vortex due to the fluid viscosity in order to judge whether the bubble injection influences the liquid phase turbulence dissipation fig 15 shows the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate it can be seen from fig 15 that compared with the single phase liquid the bubble injection reduces the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate is very sharp in the upper half part of the channel where the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate however it is relatively slight in the lower half part of the channel where there are hardly any bubbles the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence dissipation rate means the decrease of energy dissipated by the turbulence vortex the part of the saved energy may be used to increase the mean velocity of the liquid phase to cause the drag reduction as shown in figs 5 and 10 3 2 6 discussion on the drag reduction reason by bubbles the above analyses fully show that the bubble injection causes the drag reduction and the suppression of the liquid phase turbulence the drag reduction rate strongly depends on the liquid phase reynolds number and the bubble global void fraction for the same global void fraction the different liquid phase reynolds number leads to the different drag reduction rate and for the same liquid phase reynolds number the different global void fraction of bubbles leads to the different drag reduction rate too through analyzing the bubble deformation and the bubble size it is discovered that for the present investigation the drag reduction by bubbles mainly depends on the bubble size rather than the bubble deformation and the bubble size nonlinearly depends on both the bubble global void fraction and the liquid phase reynolds number the smaller the bubble diameter is the sharper the suppression of the bubble on the liquid turbulence is and the higher the drag reduction rate is for the low liquid phase reynolds number when the global void fraction of bubbles is high the coalescence between bubbles is significant that leads to that the bubble diameter is great the large bubbles can suppress the liquid phase turbulence but their wakes are chaotic and the bubble wakes influence each other those phenomena can enhance the liquid phase turbulence therefore for the low liquid phase reynolds number when the void fraction of bubbles is high the bubble diameter is large due to the notable coalescence the suppression of bubbles on the liquid turbulence is weak and thus the drag reduction becomes slight it seems to be concluded that for each global void fraction of bubbles the bubble has a minimum critical diameter when the bubble diameter reaches to the minimum one it changes very slightly with changing the liquid phase reynolds number and therefore the drag reduction rate changes slightly too as shown above the liquid phase turbulence suppression and the drag reduction by bubbles are tightly related to the bubble diameter when the bubble diameter is less than the optimum one the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence is slight and the drag reduction rate is low too when the bubble diameter is close to the optimum one the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence is very sharp and therefore the drag reduction rate is highest too when the bubble diameter is larger than the optimum one the decrease of the liquid phase turbulence does not violently change any more with the increases of the liquid phase reynolds number and the same is true for the drag reduction rate although the present numerical method cannot obtain the fine turbulence structures and cannot present the direct interactions between bubbles and liquid phase turbulence vortexes some mechanism explanations about the drag reduction by bubbles can also be concluded from the present results for the present investigation the overwhelming majority of bubbles accumulate in the region near the top wall of the channel under the drive of buoyancy that means that a bubble layer may form near the top wall which prevents the turbulence structure near the wall from spreading towards the channel center that corresponds to the fact that the bubble injection makes the turbulence boundary layer thin for the present investigation if the turbulence structure i e the vortex structure near the wall cannot effectively spread towards the central region of the channel the formation and development of the streamwise vortexes will be suppressed as the matter of fact the streamwise vortexes are the main reason that the turbulence friction drag forms therefore the drag reduction will happen as long as the streamwise vortexes are suppressed in addition most of bubbles accumulate in the region near the wall i e in the buffer layer where the coherent motions of turbulence are the most active and thus the interactions between the single bubble or the bubble group and the coherent structure of turbulence happen because the bubbles always have the motion trend towards to the wall the interactions between them may reduce the ejection strength of the low moment liquid that causes the decrease of the liquid phase reynolds stress as shown in eqn 48 the reynolds stress has the great contribution to the frictional drag coefficient accordingly the decrease of the liquid phase reynolds stress can cause the drag reduction too 4 conclusions the drag reduction by small bubbles are numerically investigated with the mixture model combined with the population balance model in this paper and the influence of the bubble global void fraction and the liquid phase reynolds number on the drag reduction and the liquid phase turbulence statistics are analyzed in detail some conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 for the present investigation the bubble injection causes the drag reduction the drag reduction rate is tightly related to the bubble global void fraction and the liquid phase reynolds number and in the range of the low liquid phase reynolds number the low global void fraction seems to be more beneficial to the drag reduction however the high global void fraction seems to be better for the drag reduction in the range of the high liquid phase reynolds number 2 the drag reduction by bubbles is tightly related to the bubble size but not the bubble deformation and the bubble with a small diameter seems to be more beneficial to the drag reduction and for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the sharper the bubble breakup phenomenon is the smaller the bubble diameter is and the higher the drag reduction rate is 3 the present studies show that the drag reduction by bubbles is related to the suppression of bubbles on the turbulence intensity and the reynolds stress of the liquid phase for the same global void fraction the larger the liquid phase reynolds number is the smaller the bubble diameter is the sharper the decrease of the turbulence intensity and the reynolds stress of the liquid phase is and the higher the drag reduction rate is 4 the bubble injection seems to reduce the thickness of the turbulence boundary layer and that phenomenon may also be one of reasons for the drag reduction by bubbles 5 it can also be concluded that the interactions between bubbles may greatly limit the drag reduction when the bubble global void fraction is relatively high and the liquid phase reynolds number is relatively low

is a difficult and important subject in the field of coastal and ocean engineering due to the complicated and stochastic behavior of wave agrawal and deo 2002 in aspects of disaster warning and emergency prevention it is very important to predict the ocean wave heights quickly and accurately in the building and maintenance of coastal and offshore structures maritime transportation

height of the wave these physical processes and their relationships are coded into a numerical model that encapsulates wave propagation in a differential equation it usually requires a high performance computing infrastructure to solve the equation this method is to establish a physical model of the height of ocean wave which requires knowledge of basic physical processes as a prerequisite in addition it also need high cost and long time period yoon et al 2011 when emergency situations occur in ocean in order to predict the wave heights quickly faster and more accurate forecasting methods need to be raised for example deo et al 2001 proposed a three layer feedforward network model to predict the ocean wave heights in different seas and analyze the parameters which

method the strategy of mea bp is similar to ga bp both of them optimize bpnn with evolutionary algorithm but mea bp has better predictions and takes less time this paper propose mea bp method in mea bp the population is generated randomly the individual in population contains the weights and thresholds of bpnn and the score the score function of the bpnn is calculated by the mean square error mse of the training data set firstly we generate individuals and then use the individuals we need as centers to generate subgroups secondly the similartaxis and dissimilation operation are used to search the superior individual in the population finally the weights and thresholds we searched are assigned to the initial bpnn it can not only improve the prediction performance of bpnn but also improve its generalization ability 2 data analysis and processing 2 1 data collection the data sets of this paper is from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf official website the website url of the european center for medium range weather forecasts is http apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily in this paper we select two areas of bohai sea and yellow sea to measure ocean wave heights as shown in fig 1 in observation area of bohai sea we select 6 observation points from latitude 38 n to latitude 40 n longitude 120 e to longitude 121 e in observation area of yellow sea we select 6 observation points from latitude 34 5 n to latitude 36 5 n longitude 122 e to longitude 123 e the latitude and longitude between each observation point differs by 1 in each observation area the data set contain 8784 sets of data which is collected from january 1 to december 31 2016 in every day four time points 0 00 6 00 12 00 18 00 so we observed 17568 sets of data in two observation areas and each observation point observed 1464 sets of data 2 2 data feature selection the data features of this paper are showed in table 1 mean sea level pressure msl 10 metres u wind component u10 10 metres v wind component v10 ocean waves height owh mean wave direction mwd mean wave period mwp where owh is the output representing the significant height of the ocean wave another five parameters are input feature sets when choosing the input features the relevance of each feature with owh need to be determined so the concept of correlation coefficient is raised in formula 1 1 r x y cov x y σ x σ y 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 where r x y represents the correlation coefficient between data set x and y i is a positive integer when r 0 8 indicating that there is a high correlation between the two features when 0 5 r 0 8 indicating that there is a medium correlation between the two features when 0 3 r 0 5 indicating that there is a low correlation between the two features when r 0 3 indicating that there is a weak correlation between the two features the highest correlation feature is mwp as shown in table 1 but the mwp is measured after measuring the owh which is the output feature so mwp should not be used as an input feature similarly mwd should not be used as a feature to predict the owh from table 1 three features msl u10 and v10 msl is low correlation v10 is moderate negative correlation u10 is weak correlation these three features have a low correlation with the owh so they should not be used as the input parameters kazeminezhad et al 2005 liu et al 2002 feature u10 represents the direction along the weft and v10 represents the direction along the warp both of them cannot represent the wind speed value u10 and v10 have a low correlation with the owh so a new feature uv is proposed as the wind speed value the correlation coefficient between uv and owh is 0 7880 so the uv and msl are chosen as input features and the equation 2 is used to calculate the value of uv 2 u v u 10 2 v 10 2 3 the mea bp neural network prediction model 3 1 generation of individuals and subgroups the strategy of mea bp is generating individuals for a certain number sorting the scores searching for individual which have the highest score as superior individual we searching for other individuals which have the highest score as temporary individuals making each superior individual and temporary individual as the center to generate the superior subgroups and temporary subgroups sun et al 1998 2000 in individual x x 1 x 2 x n 1 x n x 1 x n 1 represents the weights and thresholds of bpnn x n represents the individual s score before generating an individual it is necessary to determine the number of weights and thresholds of each individual the number of input nodes s i and output nodes s o are determined by the input and output features for predicting ocean wave heights the input features are uv and msl the output feature is swh so s i 2 s o 1 according to the s i s o and formula 3 the number of hidden nodes s l 5 α is a constant between 0 and 10 3 s l s i s o α individual is a matrix which is composed of the weights thresholds of the bpnn and the score of each individual ga is the number of elements in the matrix and it is determined by the number of nodes in each layer by formula 4 ga 22 the last item is the score for each individual 4 g a s i s l s l s o s l s o 1 after determining the elements contained in the individual x randomly assign the random number between 1 0 and 1 0 to x 1 x 21 the generation of individuals is basically completed choosing an individual x 1 x 1 x 2 x 21 as the center to generate the subgroups z n generating a random number matrix y n y 1 y 2 y 21 where y i 0 5 0 5 i 1 21 n 1 19 adding matrix x 1 to y n in order to generate a new matrix z n then scaled down the value of the elements in z n making z n 1 0 1 0 in a subgroup using the central individual and random number matrix to generate other individuals zn 5 z n z 1 z 2 z 21 x 1 y 1 l max x 2 y 2 l max x 21 y 21 l max where l max max x i y i i 1 21 n 1 19 the generated subgroup is in the form of matrix s x 1 z 1 z 2 z 19 t 3 2 billboard and the score function the function of the billboard is to provide a platform for comparing scores among subgroups and individuals in fig 2 the billboard is divided into global billboard and local billboard the global billboard records the information of each subgroup and the information exchange among the subgroups in the global billboard the score of each subgroup can be compared the local billboard records individual information and evolution information of the subgroups the score of each individual can be compared in the local billboard and perform similartaxis operation until subgroups are mature except the weights and thresholds of the bpnn the individual contains the score the score function f x is the reciprocal of the mse of the training data set the highest score individual need to be found so the reciprocal of the mse is used when the mse is smaller the score is higher and the individual is better the elements in x x 1 x 2 x 21 are placed in matrix w 1 w 2 b 1 b 2 as 6 w 1 x 1 x 5 x 6 x 10 t w 2 x 11 x 15 b 1 x 16 x 20 t b 2 x 21 where w 1 represents the weight of the input layer to the hidden layer w 2 represents the weight of the hidden layer to the output layer b 1 represents the hidden layer threshold b 2 represents the output layer threshold the form of input dataset matrix p as 7 p u v 1 u v 2 u v n m s l 1 m s l 2 m s l n t the transfer function chosen for the hidden layer neurons is tansig and transfer function chosen for the output layer neurons is burelin calculating the output a 1 of neurons in the hidden layer by 8 a 1 tan s i g w 1 p b 1 where tansig is the transfer function to calculate the output of the hidden layer the two input features in the function are w 1 p and b 1 calculating the output a 2 of neurons in the output layer by 9 a 2 b u r e l i n w 2 a 1 b 2 where burelin is the transfer function to calculate the result of the output layer the two input features in the function are w 2 a 1 and b 2 calculating the reciprocal of the mse as the score function f x by 10 f x n i 1 n x i o i 2 where x i is the actual output of the training data o i is the predicted output value of the training data and a 2 is consist of o i 3 3 similartaxis and dissimilation operation in the subgroup the process of the individuals competing with each other and generating the superior individual is called similartaxis comparing the score of each individual in the subgroup and select the optimal individual which has highest score the similartaxis operation ends until the new optimal individual is no longer generated the purpose of similartaxis operation is to make the subgroups mature and the score of subgroups equals the score of their own optimal individuals in subgroup s x 1 z 1 z 2 z 19 t if the score of individual x 1 is highest it means subgroup s is mature if there is an individual z i which score is higher than x 1 then use individual z i to generate a new subgroup 11 s z i z 1 z 2 z 19 t where z 1 z 19 are new individuals in new subgroup s looking for the individual which have highest score and make it as the center to generate new subgroup constantly when the new optimal individual is no longer generated the similartaxis operation is over comparing the score of the superior subgroups and the temporary subgroups if there is a temporary subgroup which score is higher than that of a superior subgroup the superior subgroup is released and the superior subgroup is replaced by this temporary subgroup finally randomly generate a subgroup into the temporary subgroups this process is called dissimilation the process of similartaxis and dissimilation operation is showed in fig 3 fig 3 a and b show the similartaxis process of initial superior subgroups and temporary subgroups fig 3 c and d show the similartaxis process of initial superior subgroups and temporary subgroups after dissimilation operation after several similartaxis operations the score of each subgroup is no longer increased it means that each subgroup is mature in fig 3 a the score of subgroup1 has no change subgroup1 doesn t perform the similartaxis operation because no optimal individual is found around the center of the subgroup1 when the subgroups are mature comparing the scores of the temporary subgroups and the superior subgroups if the score of a temporary subgroup is higher than the score of a superior subgroup do the dissimilation operation otherwise don t perform dissimilation operation fig 3 a in comparison with the fig 3 b the subgroup1 subgroup2 and subgroup3 in temporary subgroups have higher scores than the subgroup1 subgroup3 and subgroup4 in superior subgroups so we need to do dissimilation operation for three times and add three new subgroups to the temporary subgroups in fig 3 c the score of each subgroup remains the same because they never do the similartaxis operation and they have already mature fig 3 c in comparison with the fig 3 d each subgroup in temporary subgroups has a lower score than each subgroup in superior subgroups so the subgroups needn t to do the dissimilation operation the superior subgroups have been already found in global billboard 3 4 the procedure of mea bp the route of mea bp model is illustrated in algorithm 1 and fig 4 step 1 setting the parameters of mea randomly generating individuals of a certain number searching for superior individuals and temporary individuals according to the score step 2 making these superior individuals and temporary individuals as centers create new individuals around each center individual and obtain superior subgroups and temporary subgroups step 3 the similartaxis operation is performed in each subgroup until the subgroup is mature the score of the optimal individual is used as the score of the subgroup step 4 when the subgroups are mature the scores of each subgroup are posted on the global billboard the subgroups perform the dissimilation operation between the superior subgroups and the temporary subgroups step 5 output the superior individual when we do enough iterations operations or the global optimal individual is found if the above conditions are not satisfied return to step 3 step 6 assign the weights and thresholds of the global superior individual to the initial bpnn then training the mea bp and using the mea bp to predict the ocean wave heights algorithm 1 procedure of mea bp image 1 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 correlation analysis of prediction results and comparison of generalization ability the parameters of mea bp ga bp st bp are shown in table 2 three algorithm model adopt 2 5 1 three layer bp neural network structure as shown in table 2 η is learning rate g is convergence error s is population size i is maximal iterative number p m is mutation probability p c is crossover probability n t is the number of temporary subgroups n s is the number of superior subgroups in each observation area using the first 8000 sets of data as the training data set and the latter 784 sets of data as the test data set to predict ocean wave heights so there are 16000 sets of data as input and 1568 sets of data as output in all in the modeling process of bpnn the default samples are randomly divided into three categories training samples validation samples and test samples in fig 5 three graphs show the correlation coefficients between the prediction output data and the actual output data at three stages of training verification and testing in training stage of st bp model is effective the effect of the validation stage becomes worse and the effect of the test stage is poor it s indicating that the generalization ability of st bp needs to be improved the prediction result for the unknown data is worst in three models the performance and effect of prediction is relative equilibrium of the ga bp in three stages of training verification testing in test stage the effect is better than the st bp it means the ga bp improves the generalization ability of the st bp the crossover and mutation operations in ga can not only improve global searching ability but also improve the generalization ability of ga bp in mea bp performance of prediction is the best in test stage comparing with other models and better than its own training stage it s indicating that the generalization ability of mea bp is the best in order to see the prediction effect of mea bp more intuitively in two observation areas bohai sea and yellow sea choosing the last 40 sets of data measured from last 10 days respectively as the test set and the rest sets of data as the training set to compare prediction effect of mea bp ga bp and st bp in fig 6 the prediction results of mea bp is closer to the actual value the prediction results of st bp have a serious deviation with measured results in general the prediction error of ga bp is larger than that of mea bp different from the crossover and mutation operations in ga mea can remember more than one generation of evolutionary information which can guide similartaxis and dissimilation operations towards a correct direction meanwhile similartaxis and dissimilation operations can make sure find a better individual than before from the chart it can be seen more intuitively that mea bp has better prediction and generalization ability than others 4 2 performance criteria observing the data for a whole year in two observation area there are four seasons in one year weather may influence the prediction results putting the each month of the year as a test data set the remaining eleven months as a training data set to see the influence of weather this paper use me mae mape rmse rmspe ns six different performance criteria chang et al 2017 rodger 2014 and mathematical expressions of the performance criteria are given by the mean error me can be calculated as 12 m e 1 n i 1 n x i p i the mean absolute error mae can be calculated as 13 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i p i the mean absolute percentage error mape can be calculated as 14 m a p e 1 n i 1 n x i p i x i 100 the root mean square error rmse can be calculated as 15 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i p i 2 the root mean squared percentage error rmspe can be calculated as 16 r m s p e 1 n i 1 n x i p i x i 2 100 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns can be calculated as 17 n s 1 i 1 n x i p i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where x i is the actual output of the test data p i is the predicted output of the test data x is the average of the actual output of the test data the value of ns is from to 1 ns is close to 1 indicating that the model is highly reliable ns close to 0 indicating that the simulation results close to average value of the observed value ns is much smaller than 0 the model is not credible the average of the six performance criteria is proposed to eliminate the impact of weather and other uncertainties through the average of these six performance criteria the prediction effect of ga bp and mea bp is better than that of the st bp in other words the ga bp and the mea bp improve the prediction effect of st bp the crossover and mutation operations in ga can produce good genes or destroy the original genes but similartaxis and dissimilation operations in mea can avoid this problem comparing with ga bp and mea bp the mea bp has an accurate prediction effect in me mae mape rmse ns the ga bp has an accurate prediction effect in rmspe from the performance criteria the performance of mea bp is the most accurate but in several months the performance of ga bp is better than mea bp even in several months the st bp is the most accurate for example the prediction effect of st bp is better than ga bp in june 2016 the reason is that the training of bpnn and the impact of the weather in different seasons different months are uncertainty all of the above can be the factors to affect the prediction results although the weather factor has the possibility to affect the prediction results we can find the possibility is small and mea bp has the best performance in six performance criteria 5 summary in this paper the mea bp is compared with the ga bp and st bp fig 5 shows the correlation coefficients between the prediction output data and the actual output data the data is chosen such that the study covers a wide range of geographical locations and different weather fig 6 shows mea bp ga bp and st bp prediction results in two observation areas of bohai sea and yellow sea table 3 table 4 and table 5 show six performance criteria of mea bp ga bp and st bp in each month of 2016 through the six performance criteria and the correlation coefficient of prediction output and the actual output we can find in performance criteria and generalization performance the mea bp has the best performance compared with other two models the mea bp has obvious advantages 1 divide the subgroups into superior subgroups and temporary subgroups the similartaxis and dissimilation operations are coordinated and maintain independence it s beneficial to improve the overall search efficiency of the algorithm 2 mea can remember more than one generation of evolutionary information which can guide similartaxis and dissimilation operations towards a correct direction meanwhile similartaxis and dissimilation operations can make sure find a better individual than before 3 comparing with ga the crossover and mutation operations in ga can produce good genes or destroy the original genes but similartaxis and dissimilation operations in mea can avoid this problem 4 mea bp has a faster running speed the optimal individual can be found after several similartaxis and dissimilation operations but ga bp requires a large number of iterations to find the optimal individual and crossover and mutation operations cost more time it s resulting mea bp run faster than ga bp due to the complicated and stochastic behavior of ocean waves predicting the ocean wave heights is full of challenge

the superior individual in the population finally the weights and thresholds we searched are assigned to the initial bpnn it can not only improve the prediction performance of bpnn but also improve its generalization ability 2 data analysis and processing 2 1 data collection the data sets of this paper is from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf official website the website url of the european center for medium range weather forecasts is http apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily in this paper we select two areas of bohai sea and yellow sea to measure ocean wave heights as shown in fig 1 in observation area of bohai sea we select 6 observation points from latitude 38 n to latitude 40 n longitude 120 e to longitude 121 e in observation area of yellow sea we select 6 observation points from latitude 34 5 n to latitude 36 5 n longitude 122 e to longitude 123 e the latitude and longitude between each observation point differs by 1 in each observation area the data set contain 8784 sets of data which is collected from january 1 to december 31 2016 in every day four time points 0 00 6 00 12 00 18 00 so we observed 17568 sets of data in two observation areas and each observation point observed 1464 sets of data 2 2 data feature selection the data features of this paper are showed in table 1 mean sea level pressure msl 10 metres u wind component u10 10 metres v wind component v10 ocean waves height owh mean wave direction mwd mean wave period mwp where owh is the output representing the significant height of the ocean wave another five parameters are input feature sets when choosing the input features the relevance of each feature with owh need to be determined so the concept of correlation coefficient is raised in formula 1 1 r x y cov x y σ x σ y 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 where r x y represents the correlation coefficient between data set x and y i is a positive integer when r 0 8 indicating that there is a high correlation between the two features when 0 5 r 0 8 indicating that there is a medium correlation between the two features when 0 3 r 0 5 indicating that there is a low correlation between the two features when r 0 3 indicating that there is a weak correlation between the two features the highest correlation feature is mwp as shown in table 1 but the mwp is measured after measuring the owh which is the output feature so mwp should not be used as an input feature similarly mwd should not be used as a feature to predict the owh from table 1 three features msl u10 and v10 msl is low correlation v10 is moderate negative correlation u10 is weak correlation these three features have a low correlation with the owh so they should not be used as the input parameters kazeminezhad et al 2005 liu et al 2002 feature u10 represents the direction along the weft and v10 represents the direction along the warp both of them cannot represent the wind speed value u10 and v10 have a low correlation with the owh so a new feature uv is proposed as the wind speed value the correlation coefficient between uv and owh is 0 7880 so the uv and msl are chosen as input features and the equation 2 is used to calculate the value of uv 2 u v u 10 2 v 10 2 3 the mea bp neural network prediction model 3 1 generation of individuals and subgroups the strategy of mea bp is generating individuals for a certain number sorting the scores searching for individual which have the highest score as superior individual we searching for other individuals which have the highest score as temporary individuals making each superior individual and temporary individual as the center to generate the superior subgroups and temporary subgroups sun et al 1998 2000 in individual x x 1 x 2 x n 1 x n x 1 x n 1 represents the weights and thresholds of bpnn x n represents the individual s score before generating an individual it is necessary to determine the number of weights and thresholds of each individual the number of input nodes s i and output nodes s o are determined by the input and output features for predicting ocean wave heights the input features are uv and msl the output feature is swh so s i 2 s o 1 according to the s i s o and formula 3 the number of hidden nodes s l 5 α is a constant between 0 and 10 3 s l s i s o α individual is a matrix which is composed of the weights thresholds of the bpnn and the score of each individual ga is the number of elements in the matrix and it is determined by the number of nodes in each layer by formula 4 ga 22 the last item is the score for each individual 4 g a s i s l s l s o s l s o 1 after determining the elements contained in the individual x randomly assign the random number between 1 0 and 1 0 to x 1 x 21 the generation of individuals is basically completed choosing an individual x 1 x 1 x 2 x 21 as the center to generate the subgroups z n generating a random number matrix y n y 1 y 2 y 21 where y i 0 5 0 5 i 1 21 n 1 19 adding matrix x 1 to y n in order to generate a new matrix z n then scaled down the value of the elements in z n making z n 1 0 1 0 in a subgroup using the central individual and random number matrix to generate other individuals zn 5 z n z 1 z 2 z 21 x 1 y 1 l max x 2 y 2 l max x 21 y 21 l max where l max max x i y i i 1 21 n 1 19 the generated subgroup is in the form of matrix s x 1 z 1 z 2 z 19 t 3 2 billboard and the score function the function of the billboard is to provide a platform for comparing scores among subgroups and individuals in fig 2 the billboard is divided into global billboard and local billboard the global billboard records the information of each subgroup and the information exchange among the subgroups in the global billboard the score of each subgroup can be compared the local billboard records individual information and evolution information of the subgroups the score of each individual can be compared in the local billboard and perform similartaxis operation until subgroups are mature except the weights and thresholds of the bpnn the individual contains the score the score function f x is the reciprocal of the mse of the training data set the highest score individual need to be found so the reciprocal of the mse is used when the mse is smaller the score is higher and the individual is better the elements in x x 1 x 2 x 21 are placed in matrix w 1 w 2 b 1 b 2 as 6 w 1 x 1 x 5 x 6 x 10 t w 2 x 11 x 15 b 1 x 16 x 20 t b 2 x 21 where w 1 represents the weight of the input layer to the hidden layer w 2 represents the weight of the hidden layer to the output layer b 1 represents the hidden layer threshold b 2 represents the output layer threshold the form of input dataset matrix p as 7 p u v 1 u v 2 u v n m s l 1 m s l 2 m s l n t the transfer function chosen for the hidden layer neurons is tansig and transfer function chosen for the output layer neurons is burelin calculating the output a 1 of neurons in the hidden layer by 8 a 1 tan s i g w 1 p b 1 where tansig is the transfer function to calculate the output of the hidden layer the two input features in the function are w 1 p and b 1 calculating the output a 2 of neurons in the output layer by 9 a 2 b u r e l i n w 2 a 1 b 2 where burelin is the transfer function to calculate the result of the output layer the two input features in the function are w 2 a 1 and b 2 calculating the reciprocal of the mse as the score function f x by 10 f x n i 1 n x i o i 2 where x i is the actual output of the training data o i is the predicted output value of the training data and a 2 is consist of o i 3 3 similartaxis and dissimilation operation in the subgroup the process of the individuals competing with each other and generating the superior individual is called similartaxis comparing the score of each individual in the subgroup and select the optimal individual which has highest score the similartaxis operation ends until the new optimal individual is no longer generated the purpose of similartaxis operation is to make the subgroups mature and the score of subgroups equals the score of their own optimal individuals in subgroup s x 1 z 1 z 2 z 19 t if the score of individual x 1 is highest it means subgroup s is mature if there is an individual z i which score is higher than x 1 then use individual z i to generate a new subgroup 11 s z i z 1 z 2 z 19 t where z 1 z 19 are new individuals in new subgroup s looking for the individual which have highest score and make it as the center to generate new subgroup constantly when the new optimal individual is no longer generated the similartaxis operation is over comparing the score of the superior subgroups and the temporary subgroups if there is a temporary subgroup which score is higher than that of a superior subgroup the superior subgroup is released and the superior subgroup is replaced by this temporary subgroup finally randomly generate a subgroup into the temporary subgroups this process is called dissimilation the process of similartaxis and dissimilation operation is showed in fig 3 fig 3 a and b show the similartaxis process of initial superior subgroups and temporary subgroups fig 3 c and d show the similartaxis process of initial superior subgroups and temporary subgroups after dissimilation operation after several similartaxis operations the score of each subgroup is no longer increased it means that each subgroup is mature in fig 3 a the score of subgroup1 has no change subgroup1 doesn t perform the similartaxis operation because no optimal individual is found around the center of the subgroup1 when the subgroups are mature comparing the scores of the temporary subgroups and the superior subgroups if the score of a temporary subgroup is higher than the score of a superior subgroup do the dissimilation operation otherwise don t perform dissimilation operation fig 3 a in comparison with the fig 3 b the subgroup1 subgroup2 and subgroup3 in temporary subgroups have higher scores than the subgroup1 subgroup3 and subgroup4 in superior subgroups so we need to do dissimilation operation for three times and add three new subgroups to the temporary subgroups in fig 3 c the score of each subgroup remains the same because they never do the similartaxis operation and they have already mature fig 3 c in comparison with the fig 3 d each subgroup in temporary subgroups has a lower score than each subgroup in superior subgroups so the subgroups needn t to do the dissimilation operation the superior subgroups have been already found in global billboard 3 4 the procedure of mea bp the route of mea bp model is illustrated in algorithm 1 and fig 4 step 1 setting the parameters of mea randomly generating individuals of a certain number searching for superior individuals and temporary individuals according to the score step 2 making these superior individuals and temporary individuals as centers create new individuals around each center individual and obtain superior subgroups and temporary subgroups step 3 the similartaxis operation is performed in each subgroup until the subgroup is mature the score of the optimal individual is used as the score of the subgroup step 4 when the subgroups are mature the scores of each subgroup are posted on the global billboard the subgroups perform the dissimilation operation between the superior subgroups and the temporary subgroups step 5 output the superior individual when we do enough iterations operations or the global optimal individual is found if the above conditions are not satisfied return to step 3 step 6 assign the weights and thresholds of the global superior individual to the initial bpnn then training the mea bp and using the mea bp to predict the ocean wave heights algorithm 1 procedure of mea bp image 1 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 correlation analysis of prediction results and comparison of generalization ability the parameters of mea bp ga bp st bp are shown in table 2 three algorithm model adopt 2 5 1 three layer bp neural network structure as shown in table 2 η is learning rate g is convergence error s is population size i is maximal iterative number p m is mutation probability p c is crossover probability n t is the number of temporary subgroups n s is the number of superior subgroups in each observation area using the first 8000 sets of data as the training data set and the latter 784 sets of data as the test data set to predict ocean wave heights so there are 16000 sets of data as input and 1568 sets of data as output in all in the modeling process of bpnn the default samples are randomly divided into three categories training samples validation samples and test samples in fig 5 three graphs show the correlation coefficients between the prediction output data and the actual output data at three stages of training verification and testing in training stage of st bp model is effective the effect of the validation stage becomes worse and the effect of the test stage is poor it s indicating that the generalization ability of st bp needs to be improved the prediction result for the unknown data is worst in three models the performance and effect of prediction is relative equilibrium of the ga bp in three stages of training verification testing in test stage the effect is better than the st bp it means the ga bp improves the generalization ability of the st bp the crossover and mutation operations in ga can not only improve global searching ability but also improve the generalization ability of ga bp in mea bp performance of prediction is the best in test stage comparing with other models and better than its own training stage it s indicating that the generalization ability of mea bp is the best in order to see the prediction effect of mea bp more intuitively in two observation areas bohai sea and yellow sea choosing the last 40 sets of data measured from last 10 days respectively as the test set and the rest sets of data as the training set to compare prediction effect of mea bp ga bp and st bp in fig 6 the prediction results of mea bp is closer to the actual value the prediction results of st bp have a serious deviation with measured results in general the prediction error of ga bp is larger than that of mea bp different from the crossover and mutation operations in ga mea can remember more than one generation of evolutionary information which can guide similartaxis and dissimilation operations towards a correct direction meanwhile similartaxis and dissimilation operations can make sure find a better individual than before from the chart it can be seen more intuitively that mea bp has better prediction and generalization ability than others 4 2 performance criteria observing the data for a whole year in two observation area there are four seasons in one year weather may influence the prediction results putting the each month of the year as a test data set the remaining eleven months as a training data set to see the influence of weather this paper use me mae mape rmse rmspe ns six different performance criteria chang et al 2017 rodger 2014 and mathematical expressions of the performance criteria are given by the mean error me can be calculated as 12 m e 1 n i 1 n x i p i the mean absolute error mae can be calculated as 13 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i p i the mean absolute percentage error mape can be calculated as 14 m a p e 1 n i 1 n x i p i x i 100 the root mean square error rmse can be calculated as 15 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i p i 2 the root mean squared percentage error rmspe can be calculated as 16 r m s p e 1 n i 1 n x i p i x i 2 100 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns can be calculated as 17 n s 1 i 1 n x i p i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where x i is the actual output of the test data p i is the predicted output of the test data x is the average of the actual output of the test data the value of ns is from to 1 ns is close to 1 indicating that the model is highly reliable ns close to 0 indicating that the simulation results close to average value of the observed value ns is much smaller than 0 the model is not credible the average of the six performance criteria is proposed to eliminate the impact of weather and other uncertainties through the average of these six performance criteria the prediction effect of ga bp and mea bp is better than that of the st bp in other words the ga bp and the mea bp improve the prediction effect of st bp the crossover and mutation operations in ga can produce good genes or destroy the original genes but similartaxis and dissimilation operations in mea can avoid this problem comparing with ga bp and mea bp the mea bp has an accurate prediction effect in me mae mape rmse ns the ga bp has an accurate prediction effect in rmspe from the performance criteria the performance of mea bp is the most accurate but in several months the performance of ga bp is better than mea bp even in several months the st bp is the most accurate for example the prediction effect of st bp is better than ga bp in june 2016 the reason is that the training of bpnn and the impact of the weather in different seasons different months are uncertainty all of the above can be the factors to affect the prediction results although the weather factor has the possibility to affect the prediction results we can find the possibility is small and mea bp has the best performance in six performance criteria 5 summary in this paper the mea bp is compared with the ga bp and st bp fig 5 shows the correlation coefficients between the prediction output data and the actual output data the data is chosen such that the study covers a wide range of geographical locations and different weather fig 6 shows mea bp ga bp and st bp prediction results in two observation areas of bohai sea and yellow sea table 3 table 4 and table 5 show six performance criteria of mea bp ga bp and st bp in each month of 2016 through the six performance criteria and the correlation coefficient of prediction output and the actual output we can find in performance criteria and generalization performance the mea bp has the best performance compared with other two models the mea bp has obvious advantages 1 divide the subgroups into superior subgroups and temporary subgroups the similartaxis and dissimilation operations are coordinated and maintain independence it s beneficial to improve the overall search efficiency of the algorithm 2 mea can remember more than one generation of evolutionary information which can guide similartaxis and dissimilation operations towards a correct direction meanwhile similartaxis and dissimilation operations can make sure find a better individual than before 3 comparing with ga the crossover and mutation operations in ga can produce good genes or destroy the original genes but similartaxis and dissimilation operations in mea can avoid this problem 4 mea bp has a faster running speed the optimal individual can be found after several similartaxis and dissimilation operations but ga bp requires a large number of iterations to find the optimal individual and crossover and mutation operations cost more time it s resulting mea bp run faster than ga bp due to the complicated and stochastic behavior of ocean waves predicting the ocean wave heights is full of challenge through comparison the mea bp model can predict the ocean wave heights quickly and accurately acknowledgements this work is supported by the national key research and development program of china

23278,an otter board is an important device that provides a desired horizontal opening of a trawl net a high lift to drag ratio is required for an otter board to maintain fishing efficiency this study optimized the parameters of a double deflector rectangular cambered otter board based on the maximum lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio and studied the hydrodynamic performance of the optimal otter board computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis was used verified by a flume tank experiment in the optimization process simulation results showed that the aspect ratios and deflectors had a significant influence on the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board the optimal otter board had a better performance when the aspect ratio was 1 4 and the cambered ratios of the deflectors were 10 its maximum lift to drag ratio was 4 835 which was 1 10 times that of the initial otter board the streamlines around the otter board showed that the structure of the deflectors can delay flow separation the range of the wing tip vortex increased with the angle of attack until stall occurred at which time the vortex began to break down keywords otter board numerical simulation optimization design hydrodynamic performance 1 introduction an otter board is a hydrodynamic wing traditionally comprising a flat plate rigged at an angle of attack aoa to produce lift or shear and the desired horizontal force to a trawl system the board creates hydrodynamic forces that horizontally open penaeid trawls to spread ratios typically 0 6 0 8 of their total headline length mchugh et al 2015 the drag force was hypothesized to account for up to 30 of the entire trawl otter board system sterling 2000 drag directly relates to the energy consumption lift characterizes the otter board effectiveness and the lift to drag ratio characterizes the efficiency balash and sterling 2014 therefore improving the lift and reducing the drag are important issues in improving fishing efficiency and saving energy to improve the hydrodynamic efficiency of otter boards extensive research has been carried out during the past decades wang et al 2004 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a vertical v type otter board and optimized the main structure parameters i e the curvature dihedral angle and aspect ratio of the otter board results showed that the otter board had a better hydrodynamic performance when the curvature was 14 the dihedral angle was 12 the aspect ratio was 1 6 and the sweepback angle was 10 yamasaki et al 2007 designed a high lift v type otter board used in a semi pelagic trawl net in ise wan bay model tests and sea trial results showed a higher lift to drag ratio which was 1 41 times that of a conventional rectangular otter board a fundamentally different design of otter board named batwing was proposed by sterling 2008 2010 this design used a flexible sail operated at a low aoa and a seabed contact shoe aligned with the tow direction flume tank experiment results showed that the flexible sails had at least three times greater efficiency at a 20 aoa compared with that of flat rectangular otter boards balash and sterling 2014 balash et al 2015 a b the concurrent sea trials showed about a 20 drag reduction for the entire trawl system when using the batwing otter board mchugh et al 2015 an airfoil shaped otter board named hyper lift trawl door was designed by hu et al 2011 that utilized two wing end plates and the back of the leading edge was modified into an airfoil to improve lift and reduce drag forces flume tank experiments showed a lift improvement of 15 2 compared with a simple cambered plate with the same camber ratio shen et al 2015 many researchers have designed new otter boards or optimized the conventional otter boards to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency model experiments and sea trials were the main methods to study the hydrodynamic performance of the otter board alternatively cfd a numerical method for solving the equation of fluid mechanics has been widely used in ocean engineering yelland et al 1996 percival et al 2001 within otter board research takahashi et al 2015 validated the suitability of cfd analysis for otter board design with the similar results between numerical simulation and flume experiments xu et al 2017 a studied the hydrodynamic performance of a full scale rectangular otter board using cfd results showed that the otter board exhibited better performance when the aspect ratio was 0 5 and a higher aspect ratio had a smaller critical aoa in this study we conducted cfd analysis to optimize the parameters of a rectangular cambered otter board investigated the effect on hydrodynamic performance caused by different structure factors of deflectors and aspect ratios and proposed the optimum structures of the otter board 2 materials and methods 2 1 prototype otter board the prototype otter board initial model is a double deflector rectangular cambered structure and working at a speed of 3 4 kn it was made of steel and its main dimensions were a wing span of l 2 2 m a chord of c 2 2 m an aspect ratio of ar 1 and a plane area of s 4 84 m2 fig 1 shows the sketch of the otter board two deflectors d1 and d2 and a main panel p composed it the deflectors were installed on the front with the installation angles da 1 25 da 2 20 and ma 6 the camber ratios of d1 d2 and p were 12 the intervals of the deflectors and the main panel were d1 40 cm and d2 40 cm 2 2 experimental methods there are many installation types of deflectors and main panel with different ars camber ratios and installation angles in this study the orthogonal experiment dey 1985 was used to optimize the otter board and nine parameters were selected as the influencing factors the optimization experiment had three phases the first phase determined the range of values of the selected factors via a preliminary experiment each factor had three levels and an l27 313 orthogonal array taguchi designs 2004 was chosen for the experiment according to the preliminary experiment results the parameters of the otter board were selected as shown in table 1 the second phase analyzed the effect of the selected parameters on the lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio of the otter board and discussed the optimal cooperation form based on the results of the first phase table 1 each factor had five levels an l50 511 orthogonal array taguchi designs 2004 was chosen for the experiment and the prototype otter board was established and defined as the control group the details of the orthogonal design of fifty otter board models are shown in table 2 the third phase compared and investigated the optimal cooperation form based on the results of the second phase meanwhile the hydrodynamic performance and the flow distribution of the optimized otter board were analyzed further 2 3 numerical simulation numerical simulation was carried out by cfx analysis of ansys 15 0 software in the calculations the finite volume method was used to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the k ε earsm turbulence model wallin and johansson 2002 was adapted for the simulation and scalable wall treatment was employed for the wall function before numerical calculation the effect of the computational domain on the computational accuracy was studied to determine the optimal computational domain in this work finally the length width and height of the calculation domain for simulating a full scale otter board were set at 7 l wing span l max 2 6 m 4 5 l and 3 l respectively and the calculation converged with a relative error less than 1 xu et al 2017 b the otter board was fixed at the bottom of water and at a distance of 2 0 l from the flow entrance as shown in fig 2 computational grids were generated to unstructured grids for each case and the number of elements and node elements totaled approximately 2 67 106 and 4 88 105 respectively the grids around the otter board were refined and the value of y was 11 06 68 09 boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 water was assumed to be incompressible with a temperature t of 20 c density ρ of 998 2 kg m 3 and kinematic viscosity v of 1 003 10 6 m2 s 1 the inlet boundary was velocity inlet with a uniform flow in the z direction and turbulence intensity was 2 35 2 78 turbulence viscosity was 6 50 9 42 10 3 m2 s 1 the outlet boundary was pressure outlet with a relative pressure of 0 pa the side and top boundaries of the domain were set to free slip walls while the otter board surfaces and the bottom boundary were assumed to be smooth and non slip walls during the numerical simulation the fluid was set to the typical trawl fishing towing speed of 1 8 m s about 3 5kn and r e 3 05 4 66 106 the aoa varied in the range of 0 70 with a step of 5 2 4 data processing the lift drag coefficients c l and c d respectively the lift to drag ratio k and the moment coefficient c mx c mz were calculated according to the simulated values of the lift force f l and drag force f d as 1 c l f l 1 2 ρ s v 2 2 c d f d 1 2 ρ s v 2 3 k c l c d 4 c m x 2 m x ρ s v 2 l 5 c m z 2 m x ρ s v 2 c where f l and f d i e the force component perpendicular or parallel to the income flow are the measured lift and drag forces respectively ρ is the fluid density s is the plane area of the otter board v is the actual velocity of the incoming flow l is the span c is the chord and m x and m z are moments around the top x axis and the leading edge z axis of the otter board respectively the non dimensional coordinates of the center of pressure location are described as 6 c p l d l l c m x c l cos α c d sin α 7 c p c d c c c m z c l cos α c d sin α here c pl and c pc are the center of pressure coefficients in the span and chord directions respectively expressed as the relative positions of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the otter board in the directions of span and chord d l and d c are the distances from the top and leading edges to the center of pressure point and α is the aoa after obtaining the coefficients the data were analyzed by spss statistics 19 0 the results were analyzed relatively with single variable and multi factor analysis of variance followed by a bonferroni test for multiple comparisons and the maximum lift coefficient c l max and maximum lift to drag ratio k max were regarded as the dependent variables the differences were considered to be significant if p 0 05 3 results the numerical model was verified by flume tank experiments using the same method as xu et al 2017 b and the results shown in fig 4 show similar changing trends between the simulation and experiment results and the critical aoa and the aoa at k max were correctly predicted the c l max of the flume tank experiment was 2 079 and the simulation value was c l max 2 173 simulated error was 4 52 values of the maximum lift to drag ratio were 3 640 in the flume tank experiment and 3 975 in the simulation simulated error was 9 20 although the lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio were overestimated the numerical model predicted the critical aoa correctly and the c l and k values were closed to the flume tank experiment results therefore we believed the numerical model was feasible 3 1 second phase table 3 shows the c l max and k max of fifty otter boards the values of c l max ranged from 1 116 to 2 520 and k max ranged from 2 663 to 5 403 at the same time the hydrodynamic coefficients of the initial otter board were also simulated with a c l max of 1 965 and a k max of 4 394 no 49 otter board had the highest c l max 2 520 and was 1 28 times that of the initial model no 47 otter board had the highest k max 5 430 and was 1 24 times that of the initial model table 4 shows the results of the analysis of variance the factor of da 2 and ma had a very significant influence on the value of k max p 0 01 while the ar da 1 and d 2 had a significant influence p 0 05 the factor of da 1 had a very significant influence on the value of c l max while the ar mc and d 2 had a significant influence the other factors had no significant influence on k max or c l max but the most influential level could be statistically analyzed all of above demonstrated that the ar and the deflectors had a significant influence on the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board according to spss statistical analysis the optimal parameters were obtained as shown in table 5 it illustrated that otter board models no 51 and no 52 had the best complex factor condition on c l max no 51 and k max no 52 3 2 third phase based on the results of the second phase the new otter boards of no 51 and no 52 were established and their hydrodynamic performance was simulated the lift coefficients in relation to the aoa are shown in fig 5 the c l increased with the aoa and then decreased no 51 otter board had a higher lift coefficient when the aoa was greater than 40 and its c l max was 2 287 at an aoa of 50 55 which was 1 16 times that of the initial model table 6 the c l max of no 52 otter board was 2 051 at an aoa of 40 and was 1 04 times that of the initial model fig 6 shows the relationship between the drag coefficient and the aoa it showed that the drag coefficient increased with the increasing aoa the drag coefficients of the optimized otter boards no 51 and no 52 were significantly smaller 6 06 19 30 than that of the initial otter board when the aoa was greater than 25 this phenomenon can possibly be tracked down to the fact that the induced drag coefficient which is proportional to lift squared and inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of the otter board decreases with the increasing of ars therefore the lift to drag ratio c l c d was much higher than that of the initial otter board fig 7 when it was attacked at an aoa of 15 35 no 52 otter board had the highest lift to drag ratio no 51 otter board had the highest values when the aoa was greater than 35 the k max of no 51 otter board was 3 692 at a 25 aoa which was lower than that of the initial otter board no 52 model had a k max of 4 835 at a 20 aoa which was 1 10 times that of the initial model table 6 however when the otter board operated with an aoa of 35 the optimized otter boards had a much higher lift to drag ratio than that of the initial model no 52 otter board had the best hydrodynamic performance with its higher lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio which were 1 02 and 1 20 times comparing with that of the initial otter board respectively the center of pressure coefficients in the wing span direction c pl and chord direction c pc shown in fig 8 show that the three otter boards had the same change tendencies the c pl in the span direction decreased with an increase in the aoa and as a result the center of pressure point moved upward however the c pc in the chord direction decreased first and then increased with an increase in the aoa with it the center of pressure point moved to the leading edge of the otter board first and then moved to the trailing edge the flow streamlines from a horizontal plane cutting through the center section of the otter board are shown in fig 9 as shown in the figures the flow was smooth until the aoa exceeded the critical aoa 50 55 for no 51 otter board 40 for no 52 and 40 45 for the initial otter board after this flow separation was observed and eddies were generated on the lee side of the otter boards the vorticity diagrams fig 10 show that the wing tip vortex developed when the otter board attacked at small aoas when the aoa reached the critical aoa the wing tip vortex was well developed after which the vortex began to breakdown 4 discussions the present work used the orthogonal experiment dey 1985 to optimize the parameters of a double deflector cambered otter board and c l max and k max were selected as the dependent variables to evaluate the effect of each parameter based on these two new optimized otter boards no 51 and no 52 were obtained the optimized otter boards had a better hydrodynamic performance compared with that of the initial model especially when they operated at a 35 aoa no 52 otter board had the best hydrodynamic performance with c l max and k max values were 1 02 and 1 20 times that of the initial otter board respectively these results demonstrated that the orthogonal experiment is a useful method for optimizing otter boards however no 47 and no 48 otter board models seemed to have a good hydrodynamic performance with their high c l max and k max during the simulation experiments therefore the hydrodynamic coefficients of these two otter boards were analyzed and compared to that of no 52 otter board fig 11 it showed that no 47 model had a higher k max and no 48 model had a higher c l max comparing to that of no 52 model nevertheless when it operated at a 30 40 aoa no 52 otter board had the highest lift coefficients and its lift to drag ratios were similar to those of the other two otter boards therefore we recommend the no 52 otter board as the optimal otter board for the double deflector cambered otter board the c l max and k max of the optimal otter board no 52 were 2 051 and 4 835 respectively table 6 and it performed better hydrodynamically than a conventional rectangular otter board c l max 1 07 k max 1 50 xu et al 2016 the v type otter board c l max 1 305 k max 2 19 q c xu et al 2017 b and the vertical v type otter board c l max 1 27 k max 4 03 matuda et al 1990 flow separation fig 9 was observed at a large aoa for this type of otter board it was higher than that of the biplane type otter board flow separated at a 35 aoa takahashi et al 2015 the hyper lift otter board flow separated at a 20 aoa shen et al 2015 and the v type otter board flow separated at a 20 aoa q xu et al 2017 b it revealed that the structure of this otter board can delay the appearance of flow separation therefore the critical aoa of this otter board was larger the vorticity distribution around the otter board fig 10 in the present study showed just one wing tip vortex while the other wing tip vortex was blocked by the bottom wall because the otter board was fixed at the bottom when the otter board attacked at small aoas the range of the wing tip vortex and the vortex core radius increased as the aoa increased at the same time the lift and drag coefficients increased rapidly when the otter board attacked at aoas larger than the critical aoa the wing tip vortex began to break down and caused the lift coefficient to decrease and the drag coefficient to slowly increase the maximum lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio were two vital parameters to evaluate the performance of the otter board therefore we selected c l max and k max as the dependent variables the otter board was optimized and had a better performance than that of the initial model however we found that the hydrodynamic performance at operational aoa was likely to reflect the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board during the process of evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of the optimized otter board table 6 and the no 52 otter board had the best hydrodynamic performance in terms of both maximum values c l max and k max and performance at operational aoa table 6 fig 11 as the maximum lift coefficient appeared at a high aoa aoa at stall and the maximum lift to drag ratio appeared at a low aoa aoa at k max the otter board had to be set at a compromised aoa between the two while fishing therefore we recommend using c l max k max and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the operating aoa to evaluate the performance of the otter board in the further studies moreover the seabed condition was simplified in this study without considering the effect of sand if the seabed were sandy the effect of frictional drag on the otter board should be considered this will be considered in future research 5 conclusions in this study the parameters of a double deflector rectangular cambered otter board were optimized and the hydrodynamic coefficients were investigated numerically by the finite volume method nine otter board parameters were statistically analyzed as the influencing factors and the c l max and k max were selected as the dependent variables an optimal otter board was obtained based on the experimental results and the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 the aspect ratio ar and deflectors have significantly influence on the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board 2 the optimal otter board no 52 otter board has a higher lift to drag ratio efficiency at the operating angle which is 1 20 times that of the initial otter board 3 the deflector structure can delay flow separation 4 the range of the wing tip vortex and the vortex core radius increase with an increase in the aoa then after stall appears the vortex begins to breakdown and the lift coefficient decreases acknowledgement the authors

23278,an otter board is an important device that provides a desired horizontal opening of a trawl net a high lift to drag ratio is required for an otter board to maintain fishing efficiency this study optimized the parameters of a double deflector rectangular cambered otter board based on the maximum lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio and studied the hydrodynamic performance of the optimal otter board computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis was used verified by a flume tank experiment in the optimization process simulation results showed that the aspect ratios and deflectors had a significant influence on the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board the optimal otter board had a better performance when the aspect ratio was 1 4 and the cambered ratios of the deflectors were 10 its maximum lift to drag ratio was 4 835 which was 1 10 times that of the initial otter board the streamlines around the otter board showed that the structure of the deflectors can delay flow separation the range of the wing tip vortex increased with the angle of attack until stall occurred at which time the vortex began to break down keywords otter board numerical simulation optimization design hydrodynamic performance 1 introduction an otter board is a hydrodynamic wing traditionally comprising a flat plate rigged at an angle of attack aoa to produce lift or shear and the desired horizontal force to a trawl system the board creates hydrodynamic forces that horizontally open penaeid trawls to spread ratios typically 0 6 0 8 of their total headline length mchugh et al 2015 the drag force was hypothesized to account for up to 30 of the entire trawl otter board system sterling 2000 drag directly relates to the energy consumption lift characterizes the otter board effectiveness and the lift to drag ratio characterizes the efficiency balash and sterling 2014 therefore improving the lift and reducing the drag are important issues in improving fishing efficiency and saving energy to improve the hydrodynamic efficiency of otter boards extensive research has been carried out during the past decades wang et al 2004 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a vertical v type otter board and optimized the main structure parameters i e the curvature dihedral angle and aspect ratio of the otter board results showed that the otter board had a better hydrodynamic performance when the curvature was 14 the dihedral angle was 12 the aspect ratio was 1 6 and the sweepback angle was 10 yamasaki et al 2007 designed a high lift v type otter board used in a semi pelagic trawl net in ise wan bay model tests and sea trial results showed a higher lift to drag ratio which was 1 41 times that of a conventional rectangular otter board a fundamentally different design of otter board named batwing was proposed by sterling 2008 2010 this design used a flexible sail operated at a low aoa and a seabed contact shoe aligned with the tow direction flume tank experiment results showed that the flexible sails had at least three times greater efficiency at a 20 aoa compared with that of flat rectangular otter boards balash and sterling 2014 balash et al 2015 a b the concurrent sea trials showed about a 20 drag reduction for the entire trawl system when using the batwing otter board mchugh et al 2015 an airfoil shaped otter board named hyper lift trawl door was designed by hu et al 2011 that utilized two wing end plates and the back of the leading edge was modified into an airfoil to improve lift and reduce drag forces flume tank experiments showed a lift improvement of 15 2 compared with a simple cambered plate with the same camber ratio shen et al 2015 many researchers have designed new otter boards or optimized the conventional otter boards to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency model experiments and sea trials were the main methods to study the hydrodynamic performance of the otter board alternatively cfd a numerical method for solving the equation of fluid mechanics has been widely used in ocean engineering yelland et al 1996 percival et al 2001 within otter board research takahashi et al 2015 validated the suitability of cfd analysis for otter board design with the similar results between numerical simulation and flume experiments xu et al 2017 a studied the hydrodynamic performance of a full scale rectangular otter board using cfd results showed that the otter board exhibited better performance when the aspect ratio was 0 5 and a higher aspect ratio had a smaller critical aoa in this study we conducted cfd analysis to optimize the parameters of a rectangular cambered otter board investigated the effect on hydrodynamic performance caused by different structure factors of deflectors and aspect ratios and proposed the optimum structures of the otter board 2 materials and methods 2 1 prototype otter board the prototype otter board initial model is a double deflector rectangular cambered structure and working at a speed of 3 4 kn it was made of steel and its main dimensions were a wing span of l 2 2 m a chord of c 2 2 m an aspect ratio of ar 1 and a plane area of s 4 84 m2 fig 1 shows the sketch of the otter board two deflectors d1 and d2 and a main panel p composed it the deflectors were installed on the front with the installation angles da 1 25 da 2 20 and ma 6 the camber ratios of d1 d2 and p were 12 the intervals of the deflectors and the main panel were d1 40 cm and d2 40 cm 2 2 experimental methods there are many installation types of deflectors and main panel with different ars camber ratios and installation angles in this study the orthogonal experiment dey 1985 was used to optimize the otter board and nine parameters were selected as the influencing factors the optimization experiment had three phases the first phase determined the range of values of the selected factors via a preliminary experiment each factor had three levels and an l27 313 orthogonal array taguchi designs 2004 was chosen for the experiment according to the preliminary experiment results the parameters of the otter board were selected as shown in table 1 the second phase analyzed the effect of the selected parameters on the lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio of the otter board and discussed the optimal cooperation form based on the results of the first phase table 1 each factor had five levels an l50 511 orthogonal array taguchi designs 2004 was chosen for the experiment and the prototype otter board was established and defined as the control group the details of the orthogonal design of fifty otter board models are shown in table 2 the third phase compared and investigated the optimal cooperation form based on the results of the second phase meanwhile the hydrodynamic performance and the flow distribution of the optimized otter board were analyzed further 2 3 numerical simulation numerical simulation was carried out by cfx analysis of ansys 15 0 software in the calculations the finite volume method was used to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the k ε earsm turbulence model wallin and johansson 2002 was adapted for the simulation and scalable wall treatment was employed for the wall function before numerical calculation the effect of the computational domain on the computational accuracy was studied to determine the optimal computational domain in this work finally the length width and height of the calculation domain for simulating a full scale otter board were set at 7 l wing span l max 2 6 m 4 5 l and 3 l respectively and the calculation converged with a relative error less than 1 xu et al 2017 b the otter board was fixed at the bottom of water and at a distance of 2 0 l from the flow entrance as shown in fig 2 computational grids were generated to unstructured grids for each case and the number of elements and node elements totaled approximately 2 67 106 and 4 88 105 respectively the grids around the otter board were refined and the value of y was 11 06 68 09 boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 water was assumed to be incompressible with a temperature t of 20 c density ρ of 998 2 kg m 3 and kinematic viscosity v of 1 003 10 6 m2 s 1 the inlet boundary was velocity inlet with a uniform flow in the z direction and turbulence intensity was 2 35 2 78 turbulence viscosity was 6 50 9 42 10 3 m2 s 1 the outlet boundary was pressure outlet with a relative pressure of 0 pa the side and top boundaries of the domain were set to free slip walls while the otter board surfaces and the bottom boundary were assumed to be smooth and non slip walls during the numerical simulation the fluid was set to the typical trawl fishing towing speed of 1 8 m s about 3 5kn and r e 3 05 4 66 106 the aoa varied in the range of 0 70 with a step of 5 2 4 data processing the lift drag coefficients c l and c d respectively the lift to drag ratio k and the moment coefficient c mx c mz were calculated according to the simulated values of the lift force f l and drag force f d as 1 c l f l 1 2 ρ s v 2 2 c d f d 1 2 ρ s v 2 3 k c l c d 4 c m x 2 m x ρ s v 2 l 5 c m z 2 m x ρ s v 2 c where f l and f d i e the force component perpendicular or parallel to the income flow are the measured lift and drag forces respectively ρ is the fluid density s is the plane area of the otter board v is the actual velocity of the incoming flow l is the span c is the chord and m x and m z are moments around the top x axis and the leading edge z axis of the otter board respectively the non dimensional coordinates of the center of pressure location are described as 6 c p l d l l c m x c l cos α c d sin α 7 c p c d c c c m z c l cos α c d sin α here c pl and c pc are the center of pressure coefficients in the span and chord directions respectively expressed as the relative positions of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the otter board in the directions of span and chord d l and d c are the distances from the top and leading edges to the center of pressure point and α is the aoa after obtaining the coefficients the data were analyzed by spss statistics 19 0 the results were analyzed relatively with single variable and multi factor analysis of variance followed by a bonferroni test for multiple comparisons and the maximum lift coefficient c l max and maximum lift to drag ratio k max were regarded as the dependent variables the differences were considered to be significant if p 0 05 3 results the numerical model was verified by flume tank experiments using the same method as xu et al 2017 b and the results shown in fig 4 show similar changing trends between the simulation and experiment results and the critical aoa and the aoa at k max were correctly predicted the c l max of the flume tank experiment was 2 079 and the simulation value was c l max 2 173 simulated error was 4 52 values of the maximum lift to drag ratio were 3 640 in the flume tank experiment and 3 975 in the simulation simulated error was 9 20 although the lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio were overestimated the numerical model predicted the critical aoa correctly and the c l and k values were closed to the flume tank experiment results therefore we believed the numerical model was feasible 3 1 second phase table 3 shows the c l max and k max of fifty otter boards the values of c l max ranged from 1 116 to 2 520 and k max ranged from 2 663 to 5 403 at the same time the hydrodynamic coefficients of the initial otter board were also simulated with a c l max of 1 965 and a k max of 4 394 no 49 otter board had the highest c l max 2 520 and was 1 28 times that of the initial model no 47 otter board had the highest k max 5 430 and was 1 24 times that of the initial model table 4 shows the results of the analysis of variance the factor of da 2 and ma had a very significant influence on the value of k max p 0 01 while the ar da 1 and d 2 had a significant influence p 0 05 the factor of da 1 had a very significant influence on the value of c l max while the ar mc and d 2 had a significant influence the other factors had no significant influence on k max or c l max but the most influential level could be statistically analyzed all of above demonstrated that the ar and the deflectors had a significant influence on the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board according to spss statistical analysis the optimal parameters were obtained as shown in table 5 it illustrated that otter board models no 51 and no 52 had the best complex factor condition on c l max no 51 and k max no 52 3 2 third phase based on the results of the second phase the new otter boards of no 51 and no 52 were established and their hydrodynamic performance was simulated the lift coefficients in relation to the aoa are shown in fig 5 the c l increased with the aoa and then decreased no 51 otter board had a higher lift coefficient when the aoa was greater than 40 and its c l max was 2 287 at an aoa of 50 55 which was 1 16 times that of the initial model table 6 the c l max of no 52 otter board was 2 051 at an aoa of 40 and was 1 04 times that of the initial model fig 6 shows the relationship between the drag coefficient and the aoa it showed that the drag coefficient increased with the increasing aoa the drag coefficients of the optimized otter boards no 51 and no 52 were significantly smaller 6 06 19 30 than that of the initial otter board when the aoa was greater than 25 this phenomenon can possibly be tracked down to the fact that the induced drag coefficient which is proportional to lift squared and inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of the otter board decreases with the increasing of ars therefore the lift to drag ratio c l c d was much higher than that of the initial otter board fig 7 when it was attacked at an aoa of 15 35 no 52 otter board had the highest lift to drag ratio no 51 otter board had the highest values when the aoa was greater than 35 the k max of no 51 otter board was 3 692 at a 25 aoa which was lower than that of the initial otter board no 52 model had a k max of 4 835 at a 20 aoa which was 1 10 times that of the initial model table 6 however when the otter board operated with an aoa of 35 the optimized otter boards had a much higher lift to drag ratio than that of the initial model no 52 otter board had the best hydrodynamic performance with its higher lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio which were 1 02 and 1 20 times comparing with that of the initial otter board respectively the center of pressure coefficients in the wing span direction c pl and chord direction c pc shown in fig 8 show that the three otter boards had the same change tendencies the c pl in the span direction decreased with an increase in the aoa and as a result the center of pressure point moved upward however the c pc in the chord direction decreased first and then increased with an increase in the aoa with it the center of pressure point moved to the leading edge of the otter board first and then moved to the trailing edge the flow streamlines from a horizontal plane cutting through the center section of the otter board are shown in fig 9 as shown in the figures the flow was smooth until the aoa exceeded the critical aoa 50 55 for no 51 otter board 40 for no 52 and 40 45 for the initial otter board after this flow separation was observed and eddies were generated on the lee side of the otter boards the vorticity diagrams fig 10 show that the wing tip vortex developed when the otter board attacked at small aoas when the aoa reached the critical aoa the wing tip vortex was well developed after which the vortex began to breakdown 4 discussions the present work used the orthogonal experiment dey 1985 to optimize the parameters of a double deflector cambered otter board and c l max and k max were selected as the dependent variables to evaluate the effect of each parameter based on these two new optimized otter boards no 51 and no 52 were obtained the optimized otter boards had a better hydrodynamic performance compared with that of the initial model especially when they operated at a 35 aoa no 52 otter board had the best hydrodynamic performance with c l max and k max values were 1 02 and 1 20 times that of the initial otter board respectively these results demonstrated that the orthogonal experiment is a useful method for optimizing otter boards however no 47 and no 48 otter board models seemed to have a good hydrodynamic performance with their high c l max and k max during the simulation experiments therefore the hydrodynamic coefficients of these two otter boards were analyzed and compared to that of no 52 otter board fig 11 it showed that no 47 model had a higher k max and no 48 model had a higher c l max comparing to that of no 52 model nevertheless when it operated at a 30 40 aoa no 52 otter board had the highest lift coefficients and its lift to drag ratios were similar to those of the other two otter boards therefore we recommend the no 52 otter board as the optimal otter board for the double deflector cambered otter board the c l max and k max of the optimal otter board no 52 were 2 051 and 4 835 respectively table 6 and it performed better hydrodynamically than a conventional rectangular otter board c l max 1 07 k max 1 50 xu et al 2016 the v type otter board c l max 1 305 k max 2 19 q c xu et al 2017 b and the vertical v type otter board c l max 1 27 k max 4 03 matuda et al 1990 flow separation fig 9 was observed at a large aoa for this type of otter board it was higher than that of the biplane type otter board flow separated at a 35 aoa takahashi et al 2015 the hyper lift otter board flow separated at a 20 aoa shen et al 2015 and the v type otter board flow separated at a 20 aoa q xu et al 2017 b it revealed that the structure of this otter board can delay the appearance of flow separation therefore the critical aoa of this otter board was larger the vorticity distribution around the otter board fig 10 in the present study showed just one wing tip vortex while the other wing tip vortex was blocked by the bottom wall because the otter board was fixed at the bottom when the otter board attacked at small aoas the range of the wing tip vortex and the vortex core radius increased as the aoa increased at the same time the lift and drag coefficients increased rapidly when the otter board attacked at aoas larger than the critical aoa the wing tip vortex began to break down and caused the lift coefficient to decrease and the drag coefficient to slowly increase the maximum lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio were two vital parameters to evaluate the performance of the otter board therefore we selected c l max and k max as the dependent variables the otter board was optimized and had a better performance than that of the initial model however we found that the hydrodynamic performance at operational aoa was likely to reflect the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board during the process of evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of the optimized otter board table 6 and the no 52 otter board had the best hydrodynamic performance in terms of both maximum values c l max and k max and performance at operational aoa table 6 fig 11 as the maximum lift coefficient appeared at a high aoa aoa at stall and the maximum lift to drag ratio appeared at a low aoa aoa at k max the otter board had to be set at a compromised aoa between the two while fishing therefore we recommend using c l max k max and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the operating aoa to evaluate the performance of the otter board in the further studies moreover the seabed condition was simplified in this study without considering the effect of sand if the seabed were sandy the effect of frictional drag on the otter board should be considered this will be considered in future research 5 conclusions in this study the parameters of a double deflector rectangular cambered otter board were optimized and the hydrodynamic coefficients were investigated numerically by the finite volume method nine otter board parameters were statistically analyzed as the influencing factors and the c l max and k max were selected as the dependent variables an optimal otter board was obtained based on the experimental results and the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 the aspect ratio ar and deflectors have significantly influence on the hydrodynamic performance of an otter board 2 the optimal otter board no 52 otter board has a higher lift to drag ratio efficiency at the operating angle which is 1 20 times that of the initial otter board 3 the deflector structure can delay flow separation 4 the range of the wing tip vortex and the vortex core radius increase with an increase in the aoa then after stall appears the vortex begins to breakdown and the lift coefficient decreases acknowledgement the authors

23279,different from the traditional time domain methods which usually employ a step by step procedure for response estimation of structures with non zero initial conditions a new time domain response estimation method is proposed by using separated residues corresponding to original external loadings and non zero initial conditions to provide a more efficient algorithm for offshore structures with non zero initial conditions the key of the proposed method is that responses of the system are divided into three contributions in the laplace domain the first comes from the original external loadings the second from the initial displacements and the last from a simultaneous combination of initial displacements and velocities one theoretical development of the proposed method is that these three parts are all represented by separated residues that can be estimated by using the state space model which is also the actual reason why each part of the laplace domain responses of the system can be easily transformed back to the time domain in terms of the inverse laplace transform compared with the traditional time domain methods responses from the proposed method are directly estimated by utilizing the inverse laplace transform which implies that estimated time domain responses will be continuous in the time domain so more accurate results can be expected in addition the proposed method avoids the procedure of a step by step estimation therefore better computational efficiency can also be predicted three numerical examples and one experiment are used to investigate the performance of the proposed method the first is a single degree of freedom sdof system to illustrate the procedure the second is a six dof system aiming at extending the proposed method to multiple dof mdof systems and the last is a typically studied engineering structure i e a beam model to show the potential engineering applications of the proposed method numerical results show that the proposed method not only can provide much more accurate time domain responses compared with those from the traditional time domain methods even when the time step used is not so accurate but also has better computational efficiency e g in the third example the traditional time domain method takes 172 39 s during the estimation of responses with 10 s while the proposed method takes only 13 01 s

introduction in mathematics and particularly in dynamic systems an initial condition is usually defined as a value of an evolving variable at the initial time typically denoted as t 0 baumol 1970 to carry out the design of structures subjected to dynamic loads dynamic responses of the system are usually estimated under the assumption that the structure is initially at rest by employing either time domain or transformed domain methodologies clough and penzien 1993 paz 1997 however the state of non zero conditions is typically treated as fact for dynamic analysis of in service structures such as structural health monitoring or fluid structure interaction analysis of structures mathematically the dynamic behavior of a system can be represented by a set of simultaneous second order linear ordinary differential equations for distributed dynamic systems an appropriate discretization process such as the finite element method can be used to represent them via discrete dynamic system models in both differential equations in continuous time and difference equations in discrete time initial conditions affect the value of the dynamic variables state variables at any future time when the initial conditions of a system are non zero which are traditionally solved in the time domain based on a step by step numerical integration procedure such as central differences newmark wilson theta etc bathe 1996 but the required time step resolution should be carefully determined and usually depends on the desired level of solution precision craig and kurdila 2006 during the determination of the time increment which is often called the time interval three factors must be considered 1 the rate of variation of the applied loading 2 the complexity of the nonlinear damping and stiffness properties and 3 the period of vibration of the structure in general the time interval must be short enough to permit reliable representation of all these factors which also means that reliable results can be achieved only when a proper time interval is used currently there is a great deal of commercial software available based on time domain approaches including a great variety of strategies for linear and non linear analysis and there are excellent pre and post processing modules that enormously simplify the daily design activities reviews of more recent developments can be found in chung and lee 1994 and hulbert and chung 1996 where developments regarding the optimization of numerical dissipation are presented however one serious limitation of time domain methods is that if a very short time interval is used it may be difficult to obtain reasonable computational efficiency especially while evaluating a lengthy response with small time steps and large numbers of degrees of freedom non zero initial conditions are seldom considered in the frequency domain by using traditional frequency domain methods which require that the loading be resolved into its discrete harmonic components by fourier transformation the corresponding harmonic response components are then obtained by multiplying these loading components by the frequency response function of the structure and finally the total response of the structure is obtained by implementing the inverse fourier transform however a major limitation of frequency domain methods is that the computed response is a steady state response i e a response assuming that the initial conditions are all zero by taking into account the initial conditions veletsos and ventura veletsos and ventura 1984 1985 introduced a discrete fourier transform dft based procedure for calculating the transient response of a linear single degree of freedom sdof system from its corresponding steady state response to a periodic extension of the excitation the procedure involves the superposition of a corrective free vibration solution that effectively transforms the steady state response to the desired transient response however it requires the computation of the problem time domain green s function from known frequency domain matrix transfer functions mansur et al mansur et al 2000 2004 used the pseudo force concept by taking into account the non zero initial conditions in the dft based frequency domain analysis of continuous media discretized by the finite element method fem in modal coordinates or in both nodal and modal coordinates in many cases however frequency domain approaches are adequate e g when the physical properties are frequency dependent when design requires the use of spectra etc recently liu et al liu et al 2015 2016 2017 proposed a new frequency domain method that can consider non zero initial conditions however the early time steps of estimated responses always have some errors because of the use of the inverse fourier transform ift besides frequency and time domain methods dynamic responses of a system can also be solved in the laplace domain which solves second order linear ordinary differential equations using the laplace transform and normally consists of three steps 1 the given ordinary differential equation is transformed into an algebraic equation called the subsidiary equation in the laplace domain polking et al 2006 2 the subsidiary equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations and 3 the solution in step 2 is transformed back resulting in the solution of the given problem the laplace transform method is particularly useful if the forward and inverse transforms can be found directly in a table of laplace transforms or can be converted to forms that can be obtained by the table lookup thus traditional laplace methods have been limited to analytical operations for simple forms of input functions hu and liu hu et al 2016 recently developed an efficient pole residue method to numerically compute dynamic responses of multiple dof mdof systems to arbitrary loadings the key concept and development is regarding how to compute the poles and residues of the output from those of the input and system transfer functions and the accuracy of the new method in theory is higher than that of any time domain approach the limitation of reference hu et al 2016 is based on the assumption that the system is initially at rest i e only zero valued initial conditions can be handled this paper aims to develop a new time domain response estimation method for structures with non zero initial conditions specifically we expect that estimated responses from the proposed method are not limited to the chosen time interval and that the proposed method has better computational efficiency to demonstrate and investigate the performance of the proposed method three numerical examples and one experiment are going to be employed the first is a sdof system to illustrate the procedure the second is a six dof system to extend the proposed method from sdof to mdof systems and the last is a 15 element cantilever beam to show the potential applications of the proposed method in engineering at last an experimental fixed offshore platform conducted at the lab of ocean university of china will be used to demonstrate the proposed method 2 preliminaries 2 1 transfer function of linear systems the equations of motion of a mdof linear system with vicious damping can be expressed as clough and penzien 1993 1 m x t c x t k x t f t where m k and c are the mass stiffness and damping matrices respectively with the dimension of n n f t is the original external loads x t and x t are the first and second order time derivatives of displacement x t which are usually called the velocity and acceleration of the system respectively employing the generalized state space form craig and kurdila 2006 eq 1 becomes 2 a z b z f t where a c m m 0 b k 0 0 m z x t x t f t f t 0 from eq 2 the obtained modal matrix with the state eigenvectors has the form 3 θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 2 n and 4 d i a g a r θ t a θ 5 d i a g b r θ t b θ in which the superscript t is transpose operator then the transfer function from the external force f p t to the output x q t is 6 h q p r 1 n θ q r θ p r a r s η r θ q r θ p r a r s η r where θ q is the q th element in the displacement partition of the r th eigenvector θ q is the conjugate of θ q s is referred to as the laplace variable and 7 η r ζ r ω r i ω d r where ω r and ω d r are the r th natural and damped frequencies respectively and ζ r is the r th damping factor 2 2 laplace transform of derivatives the laplace transform is a widely used integral transform in mathematics with many applications in physics and engineering it is a linear operator of a function y t with a real argument t t 0 that transforms y t to a function y s given by the integral 8 y s 0 y t e s t d t where s is a complex variable referred to as the laplace variable the laplace transform of the time dependent variable y t is written symbolically as y s ℒ y t in which ℒ is the operator of the laplace transform accordingly the laplace transforms of x t and x t can be obtained by 9 ℒ x t s ℒ x t x 0 and 10 ℒ x t s 2 ℒ x t s x 0 x 0 respectively in eqs 9 and 10 x 0 and x 0 are the non zero initial conditions of the system 2 3 integration of second order systems for integration of second order systems expressed by eq 1 three related methods are typically used the central difference method newmark β method and wilson θ method of three methods the central difference method is perhaps the most fundamental algorithm for the approximate numerical solution of second order ordinary differential equations but the newmark β method may be the most widely used method in commercial software such as ansys because it can be an unconditionally stable method the newmark β method is an implicit method with a discrete equation of motion being enforced at the time step t n 1 thus from eq 1 one obtains 11 m x n 1 c x n 1 k x n 1 f n 1 in which 12 x n 1 x n 1 γ x n γ x n 1 δ t and 13 x n 1 x n x n δ t 1 2 β x n 2 β x n 1 δ t 2 2 where δ t t n 1 t n γ and β are newmark integration parameters 3 time domain response estimation by estimating residues corresponding to external loadings and non zero initial conditions non zero initial conditions are usually solved in the time domain while they are seldom considered in the frequency domain or laplace domain in this article we will try to handle influences caused by external forces and non zero initial conditions simultaneously in the laplace domain 3 1 separation of residues corresponding to external loadings and non zero initial conditions in the following derivation the initial conditions of the linear system expressed by eq 1 are going to be denoted as x 0 and x 0 then by employing the laplace transform eq 1 changes to 14 m s 2 x s s x 0 x 0 c s x s x 0 k x s f s where x s and f s are the laplace transform of x t and the original external loading f t respectively rearranging eq 14 one obtains 15 m s 2 c s k x s f s m x 0 s m x 0 c x 0 thus responses in the laplace domain can be obtained as follows 16 x s h s f s m x 0 s m x 0 c x 0 where h s represents called transfer functions defined by 17 h s 1 m s 2 c s k from eq 16 one can find that if the inverse laplace transform of the right hand side exists then the time domain responses can be readily estimated actually two difficulties will be encountered during the realization of the above idea the first is that not all the laplace transform pairs of functions f t exist mathematically which means that f t are limited to the simple forms such as dirac delta function unite step function sinusoidal etc craig 1981 the second is that when non zero initial conditions have to be considered directly finding the inverse laplace transform of the right hand side in eq 15 will become a much more challenging math issue to solve the abovementioned issues we can divide eq 16 into three parts 18 x s x f s x d s x h s where x f s x d s and x h s correspond to contributions of the external loadings f s the s term m x 0 s and the hybrid term m x 0 c x 0 respectively in detail they are 19 x d s m x 0 s m s 2 c s k s h s m x 0 20 x h s m x 0 c x 0 m s 2 c s k h s m x 0 c x 0 and 21 x f s f s m s 2 c s k h s f s the remaining problem is how to solve eqs 19 21 and it also requires that their inverse laplace transforms exist mathematically if one wants to estimate the time domain responses of this system by comparing eq 19 to eq 20 one can draw a conclusion that they both share the same denominator m s 2 c s k but have different numerators i e one has the laplace variable s but the other is constant in other words eq 19 and eq 20 share the same poles but have different zeros 3 1 1 solutions to non zero initial conditions here we first take the estimation of x h s as an example mathematically the response at the q th position subjected to m x 0 c x 0 in the laplace domain can be solved using kreyszig 1999 22 x q h s d q s d s p 1 n 1 p q d q p s d s where d s is the determinant of m s 2 c s k i e d s m s 2 c s k and d q s is the determinant obtained from d s by replacing the q th column in d s with the entries m x 0 c x 0 d q p s is obtained by deleting the p th row and q th column estimating the poles of a structure is not challenging one can readily obtain the poles η l h using the state space form where l 1 2 2 n by implementing an eigen analysis of 23 a 0 i m 1 k m 1 c in practice the same state space form eq 23 is expected to be used to obtain the zeros τ t h in d q p s to make the poles and zeros consistent where t 1 2 2 n 1 therefore a in eq 23 changes into 24 a 0 i n 1 n 1 m q p 1 k q p m q p 1 c q p where m q p c q p and k q p are the submatrices of m c and k respectively obtained from m c and k by deleting the p th row and q th column substituting the estimated poles determined from the determinant of matrix a in eq 23 and the zeros from eq 24 into eq 22 yields 25 x q p h s κ q p h t 1 2 n 1 s τ t h l 1 2 n s η l h where κ q p h 1 p q m q p m σ q h here σ q h is the qth element of m x 0 c x 0 numerically the pole zero form of eq 25 can be further written by the corresponding pole residue form as 26 x q p h s l 2 n β l h s η l h where β l h is called the residue of x q p h s which can be calculated by 27 β l h lim s η l h x q p h s following the same procedure that yielded eq 25 one can convert eq 19 into 28 x q p s s κ q p s t 1 2 n 1 s τ t s l 1 2 n s η l s l 2 n β l s s η l s where 29 β l s lim s η l s x q p s s specifically in eqs 26 and 28 one should note that η l h η l s because they are all calculated using eq 23 3 1 2 solutions to external loadings this section will further focus on obtaining solutions of eq 21 which includes two terms one is the transfer function h s and the other is the laplace transform of external loadings f t for the transfer function h s one can also follow the same procedure that yielded eq 25 or use the traditional method by employing eq 6 resulting in 30 h q p s κ q p f t 1 2 n 1 s τ t f l 1 2 n s η l f in which 31 h q p s l 2 n β l f s η l f and 32 β l f lim s η l f x q p f s because η l f are all calculated from eq 23 one can draw the conclusion that η l h η l s η l f for the term f s considering the fact that an external loading is usually regarded as a combination of a number of components which could be purely harmonic damped harmonic or purely damped exponential components we thus assume that f t have the form 33 f t f 1 t f 2 t f p t f n p t where n p is the number of environmental loads and each f p t in eq 33 can be written as a complex exponential liu et al 2016 34 f p t n 1 n p r n e λ n t 0 t t where n p represents the number of terms and λ n α n i ω n is called the nth pole of f p t in this study α n is defined as the damping factor in seconds 1 and ω n is the frequency in radians the coefficients i e residues r n corresponding to the complex exponents λ n must also appear in complex conjugate pairs because f t is a real valued signal in practice thus taking the laplace transform of eq 34 yields 35 f p s n 1 n p r n s λ n typically r n and λ n are also referred to as the residues and poles associated with the function f p s readers can find detailed information on estimating r n and λ n in reference liu et al 2015 substituting eq 30 and eq 35 into eq 21 yields 36 x q p f s l 2 n β l f s η l f n 1 n p r n s λ n rewriting eq 36 in a pole residue form one gets 37 x q p f s n 1 2 n n p χ n s ν n where ν n is a combination of λ n and η l f and 38 χ n lim s ν n s ν n x q p f s lim s ν n s ν n f p s h q p f s 3 2 response estimation by a combination of estimated residues by investigating eqs 26 28 and 37 one can find that eqs 19 21 are all converted to a generalized form characterized by their poles and residues thus by substituting eqs 26 28 and 37 into eq 18 one obtains 39 x q p s n 1 2 n n p χ n s ν n l 2 n β l s s η l s l 2 n β l h s η l h employing the inverse laplace transform on eq 39 the time domain response can be estimated by 40 x q p t x q p f t x q p s t x q p h t n 1 2 n n p χ n e ν n t l 2 n β l s e η l s t l 2 n β l h e η l h t accordingly the velocity of the system x q p t can be obtained by implementing the first derivative of eq 40 as follows 41 x q p t n 1 2 n n p χ n ν n e ν n t l 2 n β l s η l s e η l s t l 2 n β l h η l h e η l h t the key to successfully implementing the laplace domain analysis depends on being able to efficiently compute the pole residue form of the response x q p s in eq 39 at the same time by comparing eq 40 to the results using the newmark β method eq 13 one can predict and expect that the proposed method provides more accurate estimations of responses because the proposed method is independent on the time interval δ t 4 example 1 a sdof mass spring dashpot system an sdof system to an irregular dynamic loading is chosen for the first numerical example to illustrate the procedure as well as to compare the performance of the proposed method with the normally used newmark β method two specialties will be included in this example the first is that non zero initial conditions are going to be taken into account which means that the system is not initially at rest and the second is that external loading is not limited to harmonic composition by letting 42 f t b n e α n t cos 2 π f n t θ n where the parameters b n 2 2 α n 0 001 f n 0 3 hz and θ n π 4 from eq 1 the sdof version of equations of motion can be expressed as 43 m x t c x t k x t f t where mass stiffness and damping are taken to be m 2 2 kg k 2 n m and c 4 ns m respectively the system is subjected to excitation f t with non zero initial conditions x 0 0 2 m and x 0 0 15 m s the following work is to estimated the system s dynamic responses including its displacement velocity and acceleration 4 1 solutions to the non zero initial conditions before estimating responses of this sdof system the first work is to calculate the poles η h or η s for simplification a general symbol η will be used to represent the poles of the system in the following thus substitute m 2 2 kg k 2 n m and c 4 ns m into eq 23 and then implement the eigen analysis yielding the poles η 1 0 4545 1 2695 i and η 2 0 4545 1 2695 i because this example is an sdof system one does not need to calculate the zeros of this system by employing eq 24 and how to use this equation will be left to the next example take the estimation of x q p h s as an example first by employing eq 25 but one should note here that q p 1 the easiest method of estimating x q p h s is just to employ eq 20 yielding 44 x q p h s 1 m s η 1 h s η 1 h m x 0 c x 0 substituting the estimated poles η 1 and η 2 and the pre known non zero initial conditions into the above equation the residues β l h can be readily calculated which are β 1 h 0 0 1307 i and β 2 h 0 0 1307 i respectively likewise one can calculate residues β l s by using eq 19 corresponding to the same system poles η and they are β 1 s 0 1000 0 0358 i and β 2 s 0 1000 0 0358 i 4 2 solutions to the synthesized external loading as discussed in section 3 1 2 obtaining solutions of eq 21 will include two terms i e h s and the laplace transform f s to estimate the transfer function h s eq 6 will be used and one obtains η 1 f 0 4545 1 2695 i and η 2 f 0 4545 1 2695 i their corresponding residues are β 1 f 0 0 1790 i and β 2 f 0 0 1790 i respectively comparing the estimated η l f to those η l h or η l s where l 1 2 the fact that η l f η l h η l s is further demonstrated actually converting an arbitrary loading f t to pole residue form in the laplace domain is a very challenging problem thus writing the external loading f t in its discrete form f t n k by setting the time interval δ t 0 1 s and n k 50 one can construct a hankel matrix with dimensions of 10 10 using the discrete values of f t n k the reason we chose a 10 10 hankel matrix here is based on optical trails and one can change it to any value in the range of 5 25 the interested reader should refer to reference liu et al 2015 for the details and the estimated poles are λ 1 0 1000 1 8850 i and λ 2 0 1000 1 8850 i while the residues are γ 1 0 7778 0 7778 i and γ 2 0 7778 0 7778 i substituting the estimated λ l γ l η l f and β l f into eq 36 and further implementing eq 38 one gets ν 0 4545 1 2695 i 0 1000 1 8850 i and χ 0 2192 0 1107 i 0 2192 0 0333 i implementing the inverse laplace transform on eq 37 one can get the reconstructed external loading using the estimated ν n and χ n where n 1 2 3 4 as shown in fig 1 which also includes the result from eq 42 with δ t 0 1 s and n k 50 fig 1 not only can be used to demonstrate the correctness of the estimated ν n and χ n but it also helps readers understand why we choose the perviously mentioned 10 10 hankel matrix 4 3 response estimation of the system now residues corresponding to the external loading f t the s term m x 0 and the hybrid term m x 0 c x 0 are all obtained therefore if eqs 26 28 and 37 are calculated and then their inverse laplace transforms are implemented as well one can further get their time domain responses i e x q p s t x q p h t and x q p f t as shown in fig 2 respectively readers should note that the solution of the pole residue method is continuous which is why the continuous lines are used in fig 2 from eq 40 one can draw the conclusion that the response of the system subjected to the external loading f t and non zero initial conditions x 0 and x 0 is just a combination of the separated x q p s t x q p h t and x q p f t which is plotted using the red line in fig 2 to demonstrate the correctness of the estimated response x q p t the result of the newmark β method is also calculated in which γ 1 2 and β 1 4 one can find that the results by using the proposed method and the newmark β method match well in addition one should note that the result from the proposed method is continuous while that from the newmark β method is discrete fig 3 shows a comparison of velocities and accelerations from the proposed method and the newmark β method and one can draw the same conclusion as that from fig 2 if one compares the approach with the reference by liu et al 2015 one can find that accuracy of transient response estimation can be significantly improved 5 example 2 a 6 dof system this example aims to extend the proposed method from sdof to ndof systems and investigate the performance of estimated continuous responses by comparison with the results from the numerical time domain method the dynamic system used is identical to that in reference petsounis and fassois 2001 as shown in fig 4 the system is a 6 dof system with x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 where x 4 is a rotational displacement and the others are vertical displacements the mass matrix is a diagonal matrix diag m m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m 6 where m 4 is the mass moment of inertia of the rigid body b at the top of the structure the stiffness matrix can be obtained as 45 k k 1 k 2 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 3 k 3 l 0 0 0 k 3 k 3 k 4 k 3 l k 4 l k 4 0 0 k 3 l k 3 l k 4 l k 3 l 2 k 4 l 2 k 4 l 0 0 0 k 4 k 4 l k 4 k 5 k 5 0 0 0 0 k 5 k 5 k 6 where l is the horizontal distance between the centre of the rigid body b and the springs dashpots the damping matrix c shares the same form as k but replacing k n n 1 2 6 by the corresponding c n throughout the numerical study m 1 m 2 m 3 m 5 m 6 1200 850 4125 850 1220 kg and l kg m2 c 1 c 6 0 c 2 c 5 0 6 10 4 ns m and c 3 c 4 1 8 10 4 ns m k 1 k 6 3 10 7 n m k 2 k 5 1 10 6 n m and k 3 k 4 6 10 6 n m 8 53 m in the following studies we assume that the system is subjected to six external loadings and each is synthesized by eq 42 and imposed on directions of the six dofs the non zero initial conditions are randomly generated by using the matlab function rand in detail they are x 0 0 9501 0 2311 0 6068 0 4860 0 8913 0 7621 and x 0 0 4565 0 0185 0 8214 0 4447 0 6154 0 7919 one can conclude that a scenario such as a combination of a single input and a single non zero initial condition is just a special case of the assumed one 5 1 solutions to the non zero initial conditions first we also use the estimation of x q p h t as an example by employing eq 25 to investigate the performance of the proposed method dealing with mdof systems where p 1 2 6 and q 1 2 6 as discussed before the poles η l h can be calculated using eq 23 where l 1 2 12 because the estimation of η l h has been studied in the first example we move our emphasis to the estimation of zeros τ n h where n 1 2 10 before calculating the zeros τ n h eq 24 should be constructed first which can be easily done by deleting the p th row and q th column of m c and k when the eigen analysis is implemented on eq 24 one can get the zeros τ n h table 1 lists the estimated zeros τ n h when q 2 to calculate eq 25 the coefficient κ q p h needs to be estimated as well by using κ q p h 1 p q m q p m σ q h please note that κ 2 p h will be a vector here corresponding to the six inputs which are 2 5996 10 11 5 4975 10 22 7 8254 10 10 7 3400 10 11 6 1172 10 12 and 1 0043 10 10 from eq 27 the residues β l h can be estimated as listed in table 2 following the same procedure as that for calculating β l h one then can calculate β l s the only difference between β l h and β l s is that the first row of β l s is a zero vector and the left part is exactly the same as β l h 5 2 solutions to the external loadings because the imposed external loadings are all synthesized by eq 42 one just needs to implement eq 35 iteratively however in this example the difference is that the transfer function will be estimated by employing eq 30 actually one can follow the same procedure of estimating x q p h t to calculate h q p s for example let q 2 and p 1 and then one can get κ 1 1 f 5 3470 10 7 and τ n f 6 10 10 166 6667 2 78 159 29 i 20 59 112 99 i 6 96 66 91 i and 1 08 19 67 i accordingly the residues β l f can also be estimated shown in fig 5 is a comparison of the frequency response function h 1 1 using the traditional method eq 6 and that using the proposed method eq 31 with δ f 0 1 hz fig 5 clearly shows that eq 30 can be used to estimate the transfer function of the system 5 3 responses estimation of the system to compare with example 1 we keep the time interval δ t unchanged at first i e δ t 0 1 s and then the estimated displacement at the second dof x 2 p t can be obtained by employing eq 40 where p 1 2 6 as shown in fig 6 which also includes the result from the newmark β method from fig 6 one can find obvious discrepancies between the two results which may lead to the conclusion that the results from the proposed method are wrong actually the true answer is the opposite which means that the newmark β method provides a rough estimation of x 2 p t because of the use of the time interval δ t 0 1 s to further demonstrate the above conclusion and investigate what a proper value of δ t for the newmark β method the time intervals δ t 0 1 0 01 0 001 s will be employed during the response estimation using the newmark β method fig 7 a shows the estimated displacement at the second dof of the system subjected to the former external loadings and non zero initial conditions and one can find good consistency between the results using δ t 0 01 and δ t 0 001 s which also implies that δ t 0 001 s is accurate enough to calculate the displacement using the newmark β method shown in fig 7 b is a comparison between the estimated displacement using the proposed method when δ t 0 1 s for the external loadings and those using the newmark β method with δ t 0 1 s and δ t 0 001 s from fig 7 one can draw two conclusions the first is that the time interval δ t should be carefully selected when using the newmark β method and the second is that the proposed method provides more accurate results when a rough δ t is used e g each estimated point from the proposed method is accurately on the line of x 2 p t when using the newmark β method with δ t 0 001 s 6 example 3 a cantilever beam the proposed method will be further tested on the 15 element concrete cantilever beam shown in fig 8 where each element is modelled as a uniform beam element and each node has 2 dofs i e translational and rotational dofs the beam is of length 3 m breadth 20 cm and thickness 25 cm young s modulus is taken as 3 2 10 10 pa and the mass density is 2500 kg m3 or the mass density per unit length is 125 kg m the cross section area and the associated moment of inertia are 0 05 m2 and 1 66 10 4 m4 respectively following the standard formulation for a uniform beam element in a plane one computes the element stiffness matrix and element consistent mass matrix m n of size 4 4 craig 1981 there are 15 nodal points and each nodal point has 2 dofs thus matrices k and m both have sizes of 30 30 implementing eigen analysis one can obtain the first two natural frequencies of the system f 1 12 8175 and f 2 80 3263 hz because the theoretical purpose of this example is to estimate responses of the structure considering non zero conditions model damping should be selected before implementing dynamic analysis in this example rayleigh damping is used by c α m β k because this model is widely used in most commercial software here α 4 π f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 ξ and β 1 π f 1 f 2 ξ letting ξ 0 03 and substituting f 1 and f 2 into the above two equations one obtains α 4 1671 and β 1 0252 10 4 in the following studies we assume that the system is subjected to two external loadings one imposed at the 29 th dof and the other at the 5th dof and that each is synthesized by eq 42 but with three components the parameters used are listed in table 3 and the external loading is shown in fig 9 with δ t 0 0001 s the reason δ t 0 0001 s is used here is to make sure that the newmark β method can provide accurate results at the same time non zero initial conditions are considered and generated randomly but with an upward sequence for initial displacements as shown in fig 9 b and c following the same procedure that yielded fig 7 responses including displacements velocities and accelerations can be obtained shown in fig 10 are the estimated displacement and velocity of the 29th dof of the system and one can also easily obtain the acceleration just by substituting the estimated displacement and velocity into eq 1 from fig 10 one can draw the conclusion that the proposed method can provide an accurate estimation of dynamic responses even when non zero initial conditions exist finally we will investigate the performance of the computational efficiency of the proposed method in this example because the time interval δ t 0 0001 s it requires 100000 iterations during the estimation of responses with 10 s which took 172 39 s however the proposed method took only 13 01 s during the estimation of responses with the same time duration as shown in fig 10 the actual reason that the proposed method has such good computational efficiency is that the time domain responses are estimated directly by implementing the inverse laplace transform of eq 39 which avoids the process of iterative calculation of responses as performed by the newmark β method shown in fig 11 is a comparison of the required time when using the proposed method and the newmark β method when the time duration changes from 10 to 50 s which implies a potential applications of the proposed method to complicated structures 7 experimental study a fixed offshore platform a five layered three dimensional steel offshore platform will be used to further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method as shown in fig 12 which was rigidly fixed on the shaking table its jacket template is 2 5 m high 400 mm 300 mm on the top and 700 mm 500 mm on the bottom the experimental model is constructed of steel tubes using 22 mm 2 2 mm outer diameter áthickness section as 4 legs and 12 mm 1 6 mm section as all braces 32 horizontal and 16 slant and a steel plate at the top with a thickness of 12 mm to simulate the upside structure one laser rangefinder type of lkg 500 made by keyken was attached to the structure to measure its displacement and 4 accelerometers meas 4803a 0002 were assembled to measure the accelerations the actual reason that the four accelerometers were used is to obtain natural frequencies and corresponding damping factors of the physical model based on modal parameter identification methods which are required parameters for damping model fig 13 shows the refined finite element model of the platform by using the commercial software ansys with 117 elements the mass density used was 7800 k g m 3 poisson s ratio 0 3 and elastic modulus 2 1 10 1 n m 2 by employing modal analysis the platform is shown to have the first five modal frequencies of 13 9511 15 0916 18 8480 49 4291 and 60 5191 hz respectively so not only one can export the mass and stiffness matrices m and k from ansys but also can obtain the damping matrix by c α m β k specially one obtains α 1 1843 and β 1 4248 10 4 respectively in this example two scenarios are going to be considered to investigate the performance of the proposed method the first is to compare results caused only by non zero initial conditions and the second is to make a response comparison when the structure subjected to non zero initial displacements and external loading simultaneously to simulate the external loading an converter was designed and connected to the platform as shown in fig 13 7 1 response comparison when the structure subjected to non zero initial displacements to generate the free vibration response data mcconnell and varoto 2008 caused by non zero initial conditions we apply a wirerope and linearly increasing force from 0 to pull the platform to reach a stable position and keep the force for at least 10 s then remove the force abruptly and record the free vibration response by using the assembled laser rangefinder at node 23 with a sampling frequency of 500 hz i e δ t 0 002 s as shown in fig 14 by the blue line which was caused by a horizontal initial displacement 4 5 mm at node 23 one note that the recorded responses are caused only by non zero initial displacements which means that x 0 0 in eq 20 based on the same procedure obtaining eqs 26 and 28 one can get poles and residues corresponding to the hybrid and s terms then substituting these poles and residues into eq 40 the estimated displacement at the same measured position can be obtained as shown in fig 14 by the red line from fig 14 one can find that responses from the proposed method and the recorded have a good agreement 7 2 response comparison when the structure subjected to non zero initial displacements and external loading simultaneously a more practical and complicated case is that the structure vibrates with non zero initial conditions and subjected to external loadings to investigate the capacity of the proposed method dealing with non zero initial conditions and external loadings simultaneously the horizontal shaking table at lab of ocean university of china is used to provide a force and the wirerope is also used to generate a non zero displacement with a value of 4 5 mm at node 23 in this experiment a force sensor k3d120 is also used to measure actual force that imposed on the structure with a sampling frequency of 500 hz as shown in fig 15 however different from obtaining fig 14 one work should be done carefully before implementing eq 40 is to make sure the estimated poles λ n and residues γ n can represent the original force in the laplace domain as discussed above one can compare the consistence between the reconstructed force by using eq 34 and the original one specially the used point number is 4000 and n p 60 following the same procedure that yielded fig 7 the estimated response at node 23 with the same time interval is plotted in fig 16 with a red line from fig 16 one can find some discrepancies in the zoomed window such as time from 4 to 5 s or 0 5 1 s the first reason comes from the used raleigh damping model which considers only two frequencies and damping factors and the second comes from the inevitable errors because of the difficulty in exactly synchronizing initial displacements and external loading in time in general it appears that the proposed makes good estimate in a more efficient manner than the traditional time domain methods 8 concluding remarks a new time domain response estimation method is proposed by using separated residues corresponding to original external loadings and non zero initial conditions which is based on the concept that laplace domain responses of the system can be divided into three contributions i e the term corresponding to the original external loadings the s term and the hybrid term respectively because each term shares the same poles but different residues in the laplace domain time domain responses can be easily obtained by utilizing the inverse laplace transform specifically the poles are estimated by implementing eigen analysis of the system which is represented by the used state space model residues corresponding to the above mentioned three terms are calculated based on the estimated zeros of the system as well furthermore because of the utilization of the inverse laplace transform during the estimation of time domain responses of the system one can draw the conclusion that results from the proposed method are continuous and thus more accurate results can be expected as shown in fig 7 where a rough δ t was used which is different from the use of the traditional time domain methods by employing the newmark β method in addition the proposed method does not require a step by step estimation procedure therefore better computational efficiency can also be expected the results from the three numerical examples i e the single degree of freedom dof system the six dof system and the cantilever beam show not only that the proposed method can provide much more accurate time domain responses compared with those from the traditional time domain methods even when the used time step is not so accurate but also that it has better computational efficiency e g in the third example the traditional time domain method takes 172 39 s during the estimation of responses with 10 s but the proposed method only takes 13 01 s results from the experimental fixed offshore platform further demonstrated the capacity of the proposed method of making good response estimation in a more efficient manner however one should note that the estimation of residues corresponding to the original external loadings is the most time consuming process so one must pay great attentions to this process when applying the proposed method to real engineering issues one possible way of dealing this issue is to combine some optimization algorithms into the approach in addition we will also consider how to extend the proposed method from fixed offshore structures to deep sea floating platforms in our future work acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support of the national natural

23279,different from the traditional time domain methods which usually employ a step by step procedure for response estimation of structures with non zero initial conditions a new time domain response estimation method is proposed by using separated residues corresponding to original external loadings and non zero initial conditions to provide a more efficient algorithm for offshore structures with non zero initial conditions the key of the proposed method is that responses of the system are divided into three contributions in the laplace domain the first comes from the original external loadings the second from the initial displacements and the last from a simultaneous combination of initial displacements and velocities one theoretical development of the proposed method is that these three parts are all represented by separated residues that can be estimated by using the state space model which is also the actual reason why each part of the laplace domain responses of the system can be easily transformed back to the time domain in terms of the inverse laplace transform compared with the traditional time domain methods responses from the proposed method are directly estimated by utilizing the inverse laplace transform which implies that estimated time domain responses will be continuous in the time domain so more accurate results can be expected in addition the proposed method avoids the procedure of a step by step estimation therefore better computational efficiency can also be predicted three numerical examples and one experiment are used to investigate the performance of the proposed method the first is a single degree of freedom sdof system to illustrate the procedure the second is a six dof system aiming at extending the proposed method to multiple dof mdof systems and the last is a typically studied engineering structure i e a beam model to show the potential engineering applications of the proposed method numerical results show that the proposed method not only can provide much more accurate time domain responses compared with those from the traditional time domain methods even when the time step used is not so accurate but also has better computational efficiency e g in the third example the traditional time domain method takes 172 39 s during the estimation of responses with 10 s while the proposed method takes only 13 01 s

introduction in mathematics and particularly in dynamic systems an initial condition is usually defined as a value of an evolving variable at the initial time typically denoted as t 0 baumol 1970 to carry out the design of structures subjected to dynamic loads dynamic responses of the system are usually estimated under the assumption that the structure is initially at rest by employing either time domain or transformed domain methodologies clough and penzien 1993 paz 1997 however the state of non zero conditions is typically treated as fact for dynamic analysis of in service structures such as structural health monitoring or fluid structure interaction analysis of structures mathematically the dynamic behavior of a system can be represented by a set of simultaneous second order linear ordinary differential equations for distributed dynamic systems an appropriate discretization process such as the finite element method can be used to represent them via discrete dynamic system models in both differential equations in continuous time and difference equations in discrete time initial conditions affect the value of the dynamic variables state variables at any future time when the initial conditions of a system are non zero which are traditionally solved in the time domain based on a step by step numerical integration procedure such as central differences newmark wilson theta etc bathe 1996 but the required time step resolution should be carefully determined and usually depends on the desired level of solution precision craig and kurdila 2006 during the determination of the time increment which is often called the time interval three factors must be considered 1 the rate of variation of the applied loading 2 the complexity of the nonlinear damping and stiffness properties and 3 the period of vibration of the structure in general the time interval must be short enough to permit reliable representation of all these factors which also means that reliable results can be achieved only when a proper time interval is used currently there is a great deal of commercial software available based on time domain approaches including a great variety of strategies for linear and non linear analysis and there are excellent pre and post processing modules that enormously simplify the daily design activities reviews of more recent developments can be found in chung and lee 1994 and hulbert and chung 1996 where developments regarding the optimization of numerical dissipation are presented however one serious limitation of time domain methods is that if a very short time interval is used it may be difficult to obtain reasonable computational efficiency especially while evaluating a lengthy response with small time steps and large numbers of degrees of freedom non zero initial conditions are seldom considered in the frequency domain by using traditional frequency domain methods which require that the loading be resolved into its discrete harmonic components by fourier transformation the corresponding harmonic response components are then obtained by multiplying these loading components by the frequency response function of the structure and finally the total response of the structure is obtained by implementing the inverse fourier transform however a major limitation of frequency domain methods is that the computed response is a steady state response i e a response assuming that the initial conditions are all zero by taking into account the initial conditions veletsos and ventura veletsos and ventura 1984 1985 introduced a discrete fourier transform dft based procedure for calculating the transient response of a linear single degree of freedom sdof system from its corresponding steady state response to a periodic extension of the excitation the procedure involves the superposition of a corrective free vibration solution that effectively transforms the steady state response to the desired transient response however it requires the computation of the problem time domain green s function from known frequency domain matrix transfer functions mansur et al mansur et al 2000 2004 used the pseudo force concept by taking into account the non zero initial conditions in the dft based frequency domain analysis of continuous media discretized by the finite element method fem in modal coordinates or in both nodal and modal coordinates in many cases however frequency domain approaches are adequate e g when the physical properties are frequency dependent when design requires the use of spectra etc recently liu et al liu et al 2015 2016 2017 proposed a new frequency domain method that can consider non zero initial conditions however the early time steps of estimated responses always have some errors because of the use of the inverse fourier transform ift besides frequency and time domain methods dynamic responses of a system can also be solved in the laplace domain which solves second order linear ordinary differential equations using the laplace transform and normally consists of three steps 1 the given ordinary differential equation is transformed into an algebraic equation called the subsidiary equation in the laplace domain polking et al 2006 2 the subsidiary equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations and 3 the solution in step 2 is transformed back resulting in the solution of the given problem the laplace transform method is particularly useful if the forward and inverse transforms can be found directly in a table of laplace transforms or can be converted to forms that can be obtained by the table lookup thus traditional laplace methods have been limited to analytical operations for simple forms of input functions hu and liu hu et al 2016 recently developed an efficient pole residue method to numerically compute dynamic responses of multiple dof mdof systems to arbitrary loadings the key concept and development is regarding how to compute the poles and residues of the output from those of the input and system transfer functions and the accuracy of the new method in theory is higher than that of any time domain approach the limitation of reference hu et al 2016 is based on the assumption that the system is initially at rest i e only zero valued initial conditions can be handled this paper aims to develop a new time domain response estimation method for structures with non zero initial conditions specifically we expect that estimated responses from the proposed method are not limited to the chosen time interval and that the proposed method has better computational efficiency to demonstrate and investigate the performance of the proposed method three numerical examples and one experiment are going to be employed the first is a sdof system to illustrate the procedure the second is a six dof system to extend the proposed method from sdof to mdof systems and the last is a 15 element cantilever beam to show the potential applications of the proposed method in engineering at last an experimental fixed offshore platform conducted at the lab of ocean university of china will be used to demonstrate the proposed method 2 preliminaries 2 1 transfer function of linear systems the equations of motion of a mdof linear system with vicious damping can be expressed as clough and penzien 1993 1 m x t c x t k x t f t where m k and c are the mass stiffness and damping matrices respectively with the dimension of n n f t is the original external loads x t and x t are the first and second order time derivatives of displacement x t which are usually called the velocity and acceleration of the system respectively employing the generalized state space form craig and kurdila 2006 eq 1 becomes 2 a z b z f t where a c m m 0 b k 0 0 m z x t x t f t f t 0 from eq 2 the obtained modal matrix with the state eigenvectors has the form 3 θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 2 n and 4 d i a g a r θ t a θ 5 d i a g b r θ t b θ in which the superscript t is transpose operator then the transfer function from the external force f p t to the output x q t is 6 h q p r 1 n θ q r θ p r a r s η r θ q r θ p r a r s η r where θ q is the q th element in the displacement partition of the r th eigenvector θ q is the conjugate of θ q s is referred to as the laplace variable and 7 η r ζ r ω r i ω d r where ω r and ω d r are the r th natural and damped frequencies respectively and ζ r is the r th damping factor 2 2 laplace transform of derivatives the laplace transform is a widely used integral transform in mathematics with many applications in physics and engineering it is a linear operator of a function y t with a real argument t t 0 that transforms y t to a function y s given by the integral 8 y s 0 y t e s t d t where s is a complex variable referred to as the laplace variable the laplace transform of the time dependent variable y t is written symbolically as y s ℒ y t in which ℒ is the operator of the laplace transform accordingly the laplace transforms of x t and x t can be obtained by 9 ℒ x t s ℒ x t x 0 and 10 ℒ x t s 2 ℒ x t s x 0 x 0 respectively in eqs 9 and 10 x 0 and x 0 are the non zero initial conditions of the system 2 3 integration of second order systems for integration of second order systems expressed by eq 1 three related methods are typically used the central difference method newmark β method and wilson θ method of three methods the central difference method is perhaps the most fundamental algorithm for the approximate numerical solution of second order ordinary differential equations but the newmark β method may be the most widely used method in commercial software such as ansys because it can be an unconditionally stable method the newmark β method is an implicit method with a discrete equation of motion being enforced at the time step t n 1 thus from eq 1 one obtains 11 m x n 1 c x n 1 k x n 1 f n 1 in which 12 x n 1 x n 1 γ x n γ x n 1 δ t and 13 x n 1 x n x n δ t 1 2 β x n 2 β x n 1 δ t 2 2 where δ t t n 1 t n γ and β are newmark integration parameters 3 time domain response estimation by estimating residues corresponding to external loadings and non zero initial conditions non zero initial conditions are usually solved in the time domain while they are seldom considered in the frequency domain or laplace domain in this article we will try to handle influences caused by external forces and non zero initial conditions simultaneously in the laplace domain 3 1 separation of residues corresponding to external loadings and non zero initial conditions in the following derivation the initial conditions of the linear system expressed by eq 1 are going to be denoted as x 0 and x 0 then by employing the laplace transform eq 1 changes to 14 m s 2 x s s x 0 x 0 c s x s x 0 k x s f s where x s and f s are the laplace transform of x t and the original external loading f t respectively rearranging eq 14 one obtains 15 m s 2 c s k x s f s m x 0 s m x 0 c x 0 thus responses in the laplace domain can be obtained as follows 16 x s h s f s m x 0 s m x 0 c x 0 where h s represents called transfer functions defined by 17 h s 1 m s 2 c s k from eq 16 one can find that if the inverse laplace transform of the right hand side exists then the time domain responses can be readily estimated actually two difficulties will be encountered during the realization of the above idea the first is that not all the laplace transform pairs of functions f t exist mathematically which means that f t are limited to the simple forms such as dirac delta function unite step function sinusoidal etc craig 1981 the second is that when non zero initial conditions have to be considered directly finding the inverse laplace transform of the right hand side in eq 15 will become a much more challenging math issue to solve the abovementioned issues we can divide eq 16 into three parts 18 x s x f s x d s x h s where x f s x d s and x h s correspond to contributions of the external loadings f s the s term m x 0 s and the hybrid term m x 0 c x 0 respectively in detail they are 19 x d s m x 0 s m s 2 c s k s h s m x 0 20 x h s m x 0 c x 0 m s 2 c s k h s m x 0 c x 0 and 21 x f s f s m s 2 c s k h s f s the remaining problem is how to solve eqs 19 21 and it also requires that their inverse laplace transforms exist mathematically if one wants to estimate the time domain responses of this system by comparing eq 19 to eq 20 one can draw a conclusion that they both share the same denominator m s 2 c s k but have different numerators i e one has the laplace variable s but the other is constant in other words eq 19 and eq 20 share the same poles but have different zeros 3 1 1 solutions to non zero initial conditions here we first take the estimation of x h s as an example mathematically the response at the q th position subjected to m x 0 c x 0 in the laplace domain can be solved using kreyszig 1999 22 x q h s d q s d s p 1 n 1 p q d q p s d s where d s is the determinant of m s 2 c s k i e d s m s 2 c s k and d q s is the determinant obtained from d s by replacing the q th column in d s with the entries m x 0 c x 0 d q p s is obtained by deleting the p th row and q th column estimating the poles of a structure is not challenging one can readily obtain the poles η l h using the state space form where l 1 2 2 n by implementing an eigen analysis of 23 a 0 i m 1 k m 1 c in practice the same state space form eq 23 is expected to be used to obtain the zeros τ t h in d q p s to make the poles and zeros consistent where t 1 2 2 n 1 therefore a in eq 23 changes into 24 a 0 i n 1 n 1 m q p 1 k q p m q p 1 c q p where m q p c q p and k q p are the submatrices of m c and k respectively obtained from m c and k by deleting the p th row and q th column substituting the estimated poles determined from the determinant of matrix a in eq 23 and the zeros from eq 24 into eq 22 yields 25 x q p h s κ q p h t 1 2 n 1 s τ t h l 1 2 n s η l h where κ q p h 1 p q m q p m σ q h here σ q h is the qth element of m x 0 c x 0 numerically the pole zero form of eq 25 can be further written by the corresponding pole residue form as 26 x q p h s l 2 n β l h s η l h where β l h is called the residue of x q p h s which can be calculated by 27 β l h lim s η l h x q p h s following the same procedure that yielded eq 25 one can convert eq 19 into 28 x q p s s κ q p s t 1 2 n 1 s τ t s l 1 2 n s η l s l 2 n β l s s η l s where 29 β l s lim s η l s x q p s s specifically in eqs 26 and 28 one should note that η l h η l s because they are all calculated using eq 23 3 1 2 solutions to external loadings this section will further focus on obtaining solutions of eq 21 which includes two terms one is the transfer function h s and the other is the laplace transform of external loadings f t for the transfer function h s one can also follow the same procedure that yielded eq 25 or use the traditional method by employing eq 6 resulting in 30 h q p s κ q p f t 1 2 n 1 s τ t f l 1 2 n s η l f in which 31 h q p s l 2 n β l f s η l f and 32 β l f lim s η l f x q p f s because η l f are all calculated from eq 23 one can draw the conclusion that η l h η l s η l f for the term f s considering the fact that an external loading is usually regarded as a combination of a number of components which could be purely harmonic damped harmonic or purely damped exponential components we thus assume that f t have the form 33 f t f 1 t f 2 t f p t f n p t where n p is the number of environmental loads and each f p t in eq 33 can be written as a complex exponential liu et al 2016 34 f p t n 1 n p r n e λ n t 0 t t where n p represents the number of terms and λ n α n i ω n is called the nth pole of f p t in this study α n is defined as the damping factor in seconds 1 and ω n is the frequency in radians the coefficients i e residues r n corresponding to the complex exponents λ n must also appear in complex conjugate pairs because f t is a real valued signal in practice thus taking the laplace transform of eq 34 yields 35 f p s n 1 n p r n s λ n typically r n and λ n are also referred to as the residues and poles associated with the function f p s readers can find detailed information on estimating r n and λ n in reference liu et al 2015 substituting eq 30 and eq 35 into eq 21 yields 36 x q p f s l 2 n β l f s η l f n 1 n p r n s λ n rewriting eq 36 in a pole residue form one gets 37 x q p f s n 1 2 n n p χ n s ν n where ν n is a combination of λ n and η l f and 38 χ n lim s ν n s ν n x q p f s lim s ν n s ν n f p s h q p f s 3 2 response estimation by a combination of estimated residues by investigating eqs 26 28 and 37 one can find that eqs 19 21 are all converted to a generalized form characterized by their poles and residues thus by substituting eqs 26 28 and 37 into eq 18 one obtains 39 x q p s n 1 2 n n p χ n s ν n l 2 n β l s s η l s l 2 n β l h s η l h employing the inverse laplace transform on eq 39 the time domain response can be estimated by 40 x q p t x q p f t x q p s t x q p h t n 1 2 n n p χ n e ν n t l 2 n β l s e η l s t l 2 n β l h e η l h t accordingly the velocity of the system x q p t can be obtained by implementing the first derivative of eq 40 as follows 41 x q p t n 1 2 n n p χ n ν n e ν n t l 2 n β l s η l s e η l s t l 2 n β l h η l h e η l h t the key to successfully implementing the laplace domain analysis depends on being able to efficiently compute the pole residue form of the response x q p s in eq 39 at the same time by comparing eq 40 to the results using the newmark β method eq 13 one can predict and expect that the proposed method provides more accurate estimations of responses because the proposed method is independent on the time interval δ t 4 example 1 a sdof mass spring dashpot system an sdof system to an irregular dynamic loading is chosen for the first numerical example to illustrate the procedure as well as to compare the performance of the proposed method with the normally used newmark β method two specialties will be included in this example the first is that non zero initial conditions are going to be taken into account which means that the system is not initially at rest and the second is that external loading is not limited to harmonic composition by letting 42 f t b n e α n t cos 2 π f n t θ n where the parameters b n 2 2 α n 0 001 f n 0 3 hz and θ n π 4 from eq 1 the sdof version of equations of motion can be expressed as 43 m x t c x t k x t f t where mass stiffness and damping are taken to be m 2 2 kg k 2 n m and c 4 ns m respectively the system is subjected to excitation f t with non zero initial conditions x 0 0 2 m and x 0 0 15 m s the following work is to estimated the system s dynamic responses including its displacement velocity and acceleration 4 1 solutions to the non zero initial conditions before estimating responses of this sdof system the first work is to calculate the poles η h or η s for simplification a general symbol η will be used to represent the poles of the system in the following thus substitute m 2 2 kg k 2 n m and c 4 ns m into eq 23 and then implement the eigen analysis yielding the poles η 1 0 4545 1 2695 i and η 2 0 4545 1 2695 i because this example is an sdof system one does not need to calculate the zeros of this system by employing eq 24 and how to use this equation will be left to the next example take the estimation of x q p h s as an example first by employing eq 25 but one should note here that q p 1 the easiest method of estimating x q p h s is just to employ eq 20 yielding 44 x q p h s 1 m s η 1 h s η 1 h m x 0 c x 0 substituting the estimated poles η 1 and η 2 and the pre known non zero initial conditions into the above equation the residues β l h can be readily calculated which are β 1 h 0 0 1307 i and β 2 h 0 0 1307 i respectively likewise one can calculate residues β l s by using eq 19 corresponding to the same system poles η and they are β 1 s 0 1000 0 0358 i and β 2 s 0 1000 0 0358 i 4 2 solutions to the synthesized external loading as discussed in section 3 1 2 obtaining solutions of eq 21 will include two terms i e h s and the laplace transform f s to estimate the transfer function h s eq 6 will be used and one obtains η 1 f 0 4545 1 2695 i and η 2 f 0 4545 1 2695 i their corresponding residues are β 1 f 0 0 1790 i and β 2 f 0 0 1790 i respectively comparing the estimated η l f to those η l h or η l s where l 1 2 the fact that η l f η l h η l s is further demonstrated actually converting an arbitrary loading f t to pole residue form in the laplace domain is a very challenging problem thus writing the external loading f t in its discrete form f t n k by setting the time interval δ t 0 1 s and n k 50 one can construct a hankel matrix with dimensions of 10 10 using the discrete values of f t n k the reason we chose a 10 10 hankel matrix here is based on optical trails and one can change it to any value in the range of 5 25 the interested reader should refer to reference liu et al 2015 for the details and the estimated poles are λ 1 0 1000 1 8850 i and λ 2 0 1000 1 8850 i while the residues are γ 1 0 7778 0 7778 i and γ 2 0 7778 0 7778 i substituting the estimated λ l γ l η l f and β l f into eq 36 and further implementing eq 38 one gets ν 0 4545 1 2695 i 0 1000 1 8850 i and χ 0 2192 0 1107 i 0 2192 0 0333 i implementing the inverse laplace transform on eq 37 one can get the reconstructed external loading using the estimated ν n and χ n where n 1 2 3 4 as shown in fig 1 which also includes the result from eq 42 with δ t 0 1 s and n k 50 fig 1 not only can be used to demonstrate the correctness of the estimated ν n and χ n but it also helps readers understand why we choose the perviously mentioned 10 10 hankel matrix 4 3 response estimation of the system now residues corresponding to the external loading f t the s term m x 0 and the hybrid term m x 0 c x 0 are all obtained therefore if eqs 26 28 and 37 are calculated and then their inverse laplace transforms are implemented as well one can further get their time domain responses i e x q p s t x q p h t and x q p f t as shown in fig 2 respectively readers should note that the solution of the pole residue method is continuous which is why the continuous lines are used in fig 2 from eq 40 one can draw the conclusion that the response of the system subjected to the external loading f t and non zero initial conditions x 0 and x 0 is just a combination of the separated x q p s t x q p h t and x q p f t which is plotted using the red line in fig 2 to demonstrate the correctness of the estimated response x q p t the result of the newmark β method is also calculated in which γ 1 2 and β 1 4 one can find that the results by using the proposed method and the newmark β method match well in addition one should note that the result from the proposed method is continuous while that from the newmark β method is discrete fig 3 shows a comparison of velocities and accelerations from the proposed method and the newmark β method and one can draw the same conclusion as that from fig 2 if one compares the approach with the reference by liu et al 2015 one can find that accuracy of transient response estimation can be significantly improved 5 example 2 a 6 dof system this example aims to extend the proposed method from sdof to ndof systems and investigate the performance of estimated continuous responses by comparison with the results from the numerical time domain method the dynamic system used is identical to that in reference petsounis and fassois 2001 as shown in fig 4 the system is a 6 dof system with x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 where x 4 is a rotational displacement and the others are vertical displacements the mass matrix is a diagonal matrix diag m m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m 6 where m 4 is the mass moment of inertia of the rigid body b at the top of the structure the stiffness matrix can be obtained as 45 k k 1 k 2 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 3 k 3 l 0 0 0 k 3 k 3 k 4 k 3 l k 4 l k 4 0 0 k 3 l k 3 l k 4 l k 3 l 2 k 4 l 2 k 4 l 0 0 0 k 4 k 4 l k 4 k 5 k 5 0 0 0 0 k 5 k 5 k 6 where l is the horizontal distance between the centre of the rigid body b and the springs dashpots the damping matrix c shares the same form as k but replacing k n n 1 2 6 by the corresponding c n throughout the numerical study m 1 m 2 m 3 m 5 m 6 1200 850 4125 850 1220 kg and l kg m2 c 1 c 6 0 c 2 c 5 0 6 10 4 ns m and c 3 c 4 1 8 10 4 ns m k 1 k 6 3 10 7 n m k 2 k 5 1 10 6 n m and k 3 k 4 6 10 6 n m 8 53 m in the following studies we assume that the system is subjected to six external loadings and each is synthesized by eq 42 and imposed on directions of the six dofs the non zero initial conditions are randomly generated by using the matlab function rand in detail they are x 0 0 9501 0 2311 0 6068 0 4860 0 8913 0 7621 and x 0 0 4565 0 0185 0 8214 0 4447 0 6154 0 7919 one can conclude that a scenario such as a combination of a single input and a single non zero initial condition is just a special case of the assumed one 5 1 solutions to the non zero initial conditions first we also use the estimation of x q p h t as an example by employing eq 25 to investigate the performance of the proposed method dealing with mdof systems where p 1 2 6 and q 1 2 6 as discussed before the poles η l h can be calculated using eq 23 where l 1 2 12 because the estimation of η l h has been studied in the first example we move our emphasis to the estimation of zeros τ n h where n 1 2 10 before calculating the zeros τ n h eq 24 should be constructed first which can be easily done by deleting the p th row and q th column of m c and k when the eigen analysis is implemented on eq 24 one can get the zeros τ n h table 1 lists the estimated zeros τ n h when q 2 to calculate eq 25 the coefficient κ q p h needs to be estimated as well by using κ q p h 1 p q m q p m σ q h please note that κ 2 p h will be a vector here corresponding to the six inputs which are 2 5996 10 11 5 4975 10 22 7 8254 10 10 7 3400 10 11 6 1172 10 12 and 1 0043 10 10 from eq 27 the residues β l h can be estimated as listed in table 2 following the same procedure as that for calculating β l h one then can calculate β l s the only difference between β l h and β l s is that the first row of β l s is a zero vector and the left part is exactly the same as β l h 5 2 solutions to the external loadings because the imposed external loadings are all synthesized by eq 42 one just needs to implement eq 35 iteratively however in this example the difference is that the transfer function will be estimated by employing eq 30 actually one can follow the same procedure of estimating x q p h t to calculate h q p s for example let q 2 and p 1 and then one can get κ 1 1 f 5 3470 10 7 and τ n f 6 10 10 166 6667 2 78 159 29 i 20 59 112 99 i 6 96 66 91 i and 1 08 19 67 i accordingly the residues β l f can also be estimated shown in fig 5 is a comparison of the frequency response function h 1 1 using the traditional method eq 6 and that using the proposed method eq 31 with δ f 0 1 hz fig 5 clearly shows that eq 30 can be used to estimate the transfer function of the system 5 3 responses estimation of the system to compare with example 1 we keep the time interval δ t unchanged at first i e δ t 0 1 s and then the estimated displacement at the second dof x 2 p t can be obtained by employing eq 40 where p 1 2 6 as shown in fig 6 which also includes the result from the newmark β method from fig 6 one can find obvious discrepancies between the two results which may lead to the conclusion that the results from the proposed method are wrong actually the true answer is the opposite which means that the newmark β method provides a rough estimation of x 2 p t because of the use of the time interval δ t 0 1 s to further demonstrate the above conclusion and investigate what a proper value of δ t for the newmark β method the time intervals δ t 0 1 0 01 0 001 s will be employed during the response estimation using the newmark β method fig 7 a shows the estimated displacement at the second dof of the system subjected to the former external loadings and non zero initial conditions and one can find good consistency between the results using δ t 0 01 and δ t 0 001 s which also implies that δ t 0 001 s is accurate enough to calculate the displacement using the newmark β method shown in fig 7 b is a comparison between the estimated displacement using the proposed method when δ t 0 1 s for the external loadings and those using the newmark β method with δ t 0 1 s and δ t 0 001 s from fig 7 one can draw two conclusions the first is that the time interval δ t should be carefully selected when using the newmark β method and the second is that the proposed method provides more accurate results when a rough δ t is used e g each estimated point from the proposed method is accurately on the line of x 2 p t when using the newmark β method with δ t 0 001 s 6 example 3 a cantilever beam the proposed method will be further tested on the 15 element concrete cantilever beam shown in fig 8 where each element is modelled as a uniform beam element and each node has 2 dofs i e translational and rotational dofs the beam is of length 3 m breadth 20 cm and thickness 25 cm young s modulus is taken as 3 2 10 10 pa and the mass density is 2500 kg m3 or the mass density per unit length is 125 kg m the cross section area and the associated moment of inertia are 0 05 m2 and 1 66 10 4 m4 respectively following the standard formulation for a uniform beam element in a plane one computes the element stiffness matrix and element consistent mass matrix m n of size 4 4 craig 1981 there are 15 nodal points and each nodal point has 2 dofs thus matrices k and m both have sizes of 30 30 implementing eigen analysis one can obtain the first two natural frequencies of the system f 1 12 8175 and f 2 80 3263 hz because the theoretical purpose of this example is to estimate responses of the structure considering non zero conditions model damping should be selected before implementing dynamic analysis in this example rayleigh damping is used by c α m β k because this model is widely used in most commercial software here α 4 π f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 ξ and β 1 π f 1 f 2 ξ letting ξ 0 03 and substituting f 1 and f 2 into the above two equations one obtains α 4 1671 and β 1 0252 10 4 in the following studies we assume that the system is subjected to two external loadings one imposed at the 29 th dof and the other at the 5th dof and that each is synthesized by eq 42 but with three components the parameters used are listed in table 3 and the external loading is shown in fig 9 with δ t 0 0001 s the reason δ t 0 0001 s is used here is to make sure that the newmark β method can provide accurate results at the same time non zero initial conditions are considered and generated randomly but with an upward sequence for initial displacements as shown in fig 9 b and c following the same procedure that yielded fig 7 responses including displacements velocities and accelerations can be obtained shown in fig 10 are the estimated displacement and velocity of the 29th dof of the system and one can also easily obtain the acceleration just by substituting the estimated displacement and velocity into eq 1 from fig 10 one can draw the conclusion that the proposed method can provide an accurate estimation of dynamic responses even when non zero initial conditions exist finally we will investigate the performance of the computational efficiency of the proposed method in this example because the time interval δ t 0 0001 s it requires 100000 iterations during the estimation of responses with 10 s which took 172 39 s however the proposed method took only 13 01 s during the estimation of responses with the same time duration as shown in fig 10 the actual reason that the proposed method has such good computational efficiency is that the time domain responses are estimated directly by implementing the inverse laplace transform of eq 39 which avoids the process of iterative calculation of responses as performed by the newmark β method shown in fig 11 is a comparison of the required time when using the proposed method and the newmark β method when the time duration changes from 10 to 50 s which implies a potential applications of the proposed method to complicated structures 7 experimental study a fixed offshore platform a five layered three dimensional steel offshore platform will be used to further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method as shown in fig 12 which was rigidly fixed on the shaking table its jacket template is 2 5 m high 400 mm 300 mm on the top and 700 mm 500 mm on the bottom the experimental model is constructed of steel tubes using 22 mm 2 2 mm outer diameter áthickness section as 4 legs and 12 mm 1 6 mm section as all braces 32 horizontal and 16 slant and a steel plate at the top with a thickness of 12 mm to simulate the upside structure one laser rangefinder type of lkg 500 made by keyken was attached to the structure to measure its displacement and 4 accelerometers meas 4803a 0002 were assembled to measure the accelerations the actual reason that the four accelerometers were used is to obtain natural frequencies and corresponding damping factors of the physical model based on modal parameter identification methods which are required parameters for damping model fig 13 shows the refined finite element model of the platform by using the commercial software ansys with 117 elements the mass density used was 7800 k g m 3 poisson s ratio 0 3 and elastic modulus 2 1 10 1 n m 2 by employing modal analysis the platform is shown to have the first five modal frequencies of 13 9511 15 0916 18 8480 49 4291 and 60 5191 hz respectively so not only one can export the mass and stiffness matrices m and k from ansys but also can obtain the damping matrix by c α m β k specially one obtains α 1 1843 and β 1 4248 10 4 respectively in this example two scenarios are going to be considered to investigate the performance of the proposed method the first is to compare results caused only by non zero initial conditions and the second is to make a response comparison when the structure subjected to non zero initial displacements and external loading simultaneously to simulate the external loading an converter was designed and connected to the platform as shown in fig 13 7 1 response comparison when the structure subjected to non zero initial displacements to generate the free vibration response data mcconnell and varoto 2008 caused by non zero initial conditions we apply a wirerope and linearly increasing force from 0 to pull the platform to reach a stable position and keep the force for at least 10 s then remove the force abruptly and record the free vibration response by using the assembled laser rangefinder at node 23 with a sampling frequency of 500 hz i e δ t 0 002 s as shown in fig 14 by the blue line which was caused by a horizontal initial displacement 4 5 mm at node 23 one note that the recorded responses are caused only by non zero initial displacements which means that x 0 0 in eq 20 based on the same procedure obtaining eqs 26 and 28 one can get poles and residues corresponding to the hybrid and s terms then substituting these poles and residues into eq 40 the estimated displacement at the same measured position can be obtained as shown in fig 14 by the red line from fig 14 one can find that responses from the proposed method and the recorded have a good agreement 7 2 response comparison when the structure subjected to non zero initial displacements and external loading simultaneously a more practical and complicated case is that the structure vibrates with non zero initial conditions and subjected to external loadings to investigate the capacity of the proposed method dealing with non zero initial conditions and external loadings simultaneously the horizontal shaking table at lab of ocean university of china is used to provide a force and the wirerope is also used to generate a non zero displacement with a value of 4 5 mm at node 23 in this experiment a force sensor k3d120 is also used to measure actual force that imposed on the structure with a sampling frequency of 500 hz as shown in fig 15 however different from obtaining fig 14 one work should be done carefully before implementing eq 40 is to make sure the estimated poles λ n and residues γ n can represent the original force in the laplace domain as discussed above one can compare the consistence between the reconstructed force by using eq 34 and the original one specially the used point number is 4000 and n p 60 following the same procedure that yielded fig 7 the estimated response at node 23 with the same time interval is plotted in fig 16 with a red line from fig 16 one can find some discrepancies in the zoomed window such as time from 4 to 5 s or 0 5 1 s the first reason comes from the used raleigh damping model which considers only two frequencies and damping factors and the second comes from the inevitable errors because of the difficulty in exactly synchronizing initial displacements and external loading in time in general it appears that the proposed makes good estimate in a more efficient manner than the traditional time domain methods 8 concluding remarks a new time domain response estimation method is proposed by using separated residues corresponding to original external loadings and non zero initial conditions which is based on the concept that laplace domain responses of the system can be divided into three contributions i e the term corresponding to the original external loadings the s term and the hybrid term respectively because each term shares the same poles but different residues in the laplace domain time domain responses can be easily obtained by utilizing the inverse laplace transform specifically the poles are estimated by implementing eigen analysis of the system which is represented by the used state space model residues corresponding to the above mentioned three terms are calculated based on the estimated zeros of the system as well furthermore because of the utilization of the inverse laplace transform during the estimation of time domain responses of the system one can draw the conclusion that results from the proposed method are continuous and thus more accurate results can be expected as shown in fig 7 where a rough δ t was used which is different from the use of the traditional time domain methods by employing the newmark β method in addition the proposed method does not require a step by step estimation procedure therefore better computational efficiency can also be expected the results from the three numerical examples i e the single degree of freedom dof system the six dof system and the cantilever beam show not only that the proposed method can provide much more accurate time domain responses compared with those from the traditional time domain methods even when the used time step is not so accurate but also that it has better computational efficiency e g in the third example the traditional time domain method takes 172 39 s during the estimation of responses with 10 s but the proposed method only takes 13 01 s results from the experimental fixed offshore platform further demonstrated the capacity of the proposed method of making good response estimation in a more efficient manner however one should note that the estimation of residues corresponding to the original external loadings is the most time consuming process so one must pay great attentions to this process when applying the proposed method to real engineering issues one possible way of dealing this issue is to combine some optimization algorithms into the approach in addition we will also consider how to extend the proposed method from fixed offshore structures to deep sea floating platforms in our future work acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support of the national natural
