been adopted in many regions of the world one way to accomplish this situation is introducing advanced water treatment trains e g microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro and ultraviolet light and advanced oxidation process uv aop which treat wastewater to produce high quality pathogen free water virus removal is a key factor in the regulation of the planned potable reuse facilities because wastewater contains high virus concentrations ccr 2015 2021 twdb 2015 for potable reuse viruses in wastewater must be reduced to levels that do not impact human health sano et al 2016 reportedly the number of fecal viruses in stools has been as high as 1012 copies g kirby et al 2014 furthermore viruses have been found to persist in water supply systems who world health organization 2011 the who set 10 6 dalys per person per year as an upper limit of health risk for potable water and suggested 10 5 or 10 4 daly per person per year as more realistic targets to achieve this level of protection strong guidelines and testing protocols are required regulatory guidelines rely on log removal values lrvs to estimate virus removal during treatment which are allocated to each qualified unit process within a treatment train e g mf uf ro and uv aop the potable reuse regulation guideline in california set 12 logs for indirect potable reuse and 20 logs for direct potable reuse as performance targets to remove viruses in total from wastewater to finished water ccr 2015 2021 and a single treatment may be credited with no more than 6 logs reduction ccr 2015 2021 the reported virus lrvs for mf uf and ro in challenge tests using surface water were 0 4 log otaki et al 1998 jacangelo et al 1995 matsushita et al 2013 1 5 6 log jacangelo et al 1995 matsushita et al 2013 and 7 log hornstra et al 2019 respectively these studies used bacteriophage ms2 or qbeta as a model virus however the credited lrvs for uf and ro allotted by regulatory agencies are lower than the values achieved in challenge tests usepa 2005 who 2017 one explanation for the low credited lrv for uf is the limitation of direct integrity testing usepa 2005 which is a physical test that is performed during operation owing to the small size of viruses 300 nm it is difficult to identify a reliable parameter that directly represents the virus size breaches on the membranes continuous indirect integrity testing is required to evaluate ro performance indirect parameters such as turbidity electric conductivity and total organic carbon are used to measure membrane integrity pype et al 2016 usepa 2005 and the validated virus lrv of ro is determined based on the removal values of these indirect parameters as a conservative measure constrained by limitations on feed concentration and product water measurement sensitivity recognizing that the actual virus removal is likely much greater who 2017 in treated water sources enteric viruses are sometimes present at very low concentrations therefore to quantify human enteric viruses to calculate an lrv efficient concentration techniques must be utilized to recover viruses from large sample volumes to increase the sensitivity of detection to understand the fate of enteric viruses during the treatment processes indicator viruses are often used because of their higher concentrations compared to indigenous enteric viruses in the source and treated water canh et al 2019 kato et al 2018 the indicator viruses should be consistently present in feedwater at high concentrations and their removal by the treatment process should be equal to or lower than the indigenous enteric viruses if the fate of indicator viruses and indigenous enteric viruses is similar then it is possible to assess the lrvs of human enteric viruses in the water treatment by measuring those of the indicator viruses in this study we focused on aichi virus aiv pepper mild mottle virus pmmov cucumber green mottle mosaic virus cgmmv and cross assembly phage crassphage as candidates of a process indicator virus aiv pmmov and crassphage are excreted in the human stool and are ubiquitously found in raw sewage and reported as globally abundant viruses in the wastewater ahmed et al 2018 2020 bivins et al 2020 dutilh et al 2014 hata et al 2014 kitajima and gerba 2015 lodder et al 2013 wu et al 2020 the abundance of cgmmv in wastewater and sewage samples was also reported in various countries bačnik et al 2020 jumat et al 2017 robledo mahón et al 2019 yang et al 2021 although aiv concentration in wastewater was not as high as that of pmmov and crassphage kitajima and gerba 2015 kitajima et al 2018 bivins et al 2020 it belongs to the enteric viruses that have a non enveloped and icosahedral shape to be a promising process indicator kitajima and gerba 2015 pmmov and cgmmv have been isolated from sewage and treated wastewater samples throughout the world bačnik et al 2020 jumat et al 2017 robledo mahón et al 2019 yang et al 2021 owing to their abundance in wastewater pmmov and cgmmv are strong candidates as human specific indicators in many geographical regions pmmov has been identified and reported as a promising process indicator during water treatment processes canh et al 2019 kato et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 crassphage also attracted attentions as a promising process indicator in recent studies ahmed et al 2020 tandukar et al 2020 however the shapes of these three viruses are different from that of most human enteric viruses and their difference of surface properties is still unclear therefore in order to evaluate the applicability of these viruses as process indicators the behavior and removal of these viruses during water treatment needs to be tested and compared with those of human enteric viruses to the best of our knowledge few other studies have evaluated virus removal by membrane treatment in water reuse facilities at full scale stamps et al 2018 rock et al 2019 in this study we investigated virus concentrations before and after membrane treatment processes at an indirect potable reuse treatment facility in california usa our study objectives were 1 to evaluate virus lrvs for mf uf and ro processes at the potable reuse plant using molecular methods and 2 to compare the lrvs of enteric viruses and the candidate process indicator viruses and evaluate the potential of using these indicator viruses in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection water samples were collected at an indirect potable reuse facility in ca usa fig 1 shows the schematic of the treatment processes and the sample collection points water samples were collected at six points i e the secondary effluent from the wastewater treatment facility secondary effluent after a chlorine chloramine treatment mf uf feed mf filtrate mf ef uf filtrate uf ef a blend of mf and uf filtrates in a break tank ro feed and ro permeate the samples were collected once in september 2019 and twice in november 2019 to investigate the usual removability of membrane treatments table 1 lists the sample volumes collected at each process point and the equivalent volumes for each virus quantification the water quality of samples was within the ordinary range 2 2 concentration of wastewater samples the water samples were concentrated using the acid rinse alkaline mg2 method with a cartridge type electronegative filter opticap xl2 milligard 0 5 µm 9 16 in hb hb kw06a02hh3 merck millipore as described previously hata et al 2014 more than 10 recovery efficiencies of viruses and lower recovery of naked rnas using this primary and secondary concentration method were reported in previous studies haramoto et al 2007 hata et al 2014 the sample volumes applied at point 1 and 2 secondary effluent and mf uf feed varied according to the clogging of the filter the opticap xl2 filter was refrigerated at 4 c the filters were placed on gel ice and transported to the university of tokyo tokyo japan the subsequent concentration process including filter rinse and elution was performed in tokyo within 5 days of sample collection the opticap xl2 filter was connected to an aspirator and 2 l of a 0 5 mm h2so4 solution and 1 l of distilled water were passed in that order to wash off the remaining mg2 from the membrane surface subsequently 200 ml of a 1 0 mm naoh solution was passed through the opticap xl2 filter to collect the virus from the membrane the filtrates were collected in a centrifuge tube containing 1 ml of 100 mm h2so4 solution and 2 ml of 100 te buffer final 200 ml concentrates virus in naohaq h2so4aq te buffer were obtained for each sample the solutions were kept in a refrigerator until the next concentration step when passing any liquid through the filter it was confirmed that the filter housing was filled with liquid to collect viruses from all the areas of the membrane the process up to this point is designated as the primary concentration step the concentrates were further concentrated using a centricon plus 70 filter device merck millipore to obtain approximately 1 ml of final concentrates according to the manufacturer s protocol 2 3 evaluation of the primary concentration efficiency to assess the collection efficiency in the primary concentration step a 1 100 scale experiment was performed katayama et al 2008 confirmed the high virus concentration efficiency of the method using secondary treated wastewater in our study ro feed and ro permeate were tested for the primary concentration efficiency the volumes applied were exactly 1 100 of the full scale experiments described in section 2 2 table 1 100 ml and 10 l of the ro feed and the ro permeate grab samples were collected respectively pmmov murine norovirus mnv and aiv were spiked into each sample to obtain a concentration of 105 106 copies ml of each an mgcl2 solution 5 m was also added to the water samples to a final concentration of 25 mm the volumes of chemical solutions were also 1 100 of full scale experiments after thoroughly mixing the sample was passed through the flat membrane i e a mixed cellulose esters membrane merk millipore hawp 047 00 the membrane surface area was approximately 1 100th of that of the opticap xl2 filter merk millipore mixed cellulose esters membrane surface area 1000 cm2 the pore sizes of the flat membrane and the opticap xl2 are 0 45 µm and 0 5 µm respectively subsequently 200 ml of a 0 5 mm h2so4 solution was passed through finally 10 ml of a 1 0 mm naoh solution was passed through using a vacuum pump the filtrate was collected into a tube containing 50 µl of a 100 mm h2so4 solution and 100 µl of 100 te buffer based on the virus concentrations measured before and after filtration the primary concentration efficiency pce was calculated using the following formula pce c c 0 100 where c is the number of copies of spiked virus obtained from the sample after the primary concentration and c0 is the number of copies of spiked virus obtained directly from the virus stock solution 2 4 preparation of molecular process controls inhibitory substances have been shown to be co concentrated during sample concentration and purification these substances have been shown to interfere with molecular detection assays by hindering the extraction of nucleic acids degrading nucleic acids and inhibiting pcr amplification by interacting with polymerases wilson 1997 hata et al 2015 to monitor nucleic acid extraction and qpcr inhibitory effects molecular process controls mpcs representative of different virus types mnv odontoglossum ringspot virus orsv and bacteriophage p22 were used mpcs enabled the measurement of the molecular detection efficiency of the extraction method nucleic acid purification method and its amplification according to virus type for each water matrix sample location mnv strain s7 pp3 was propagated in raw 264 7 cells and used as the mpc for aiv orsv was purchased from the national agriculture and food research organization japan and used as the mpc for pmmov and cgmmv these mpcs were selected based on the similarity of their morphologies compared with the process indicator viruses bacteriophage p22 nbrc 20 023 was used as the mpc for crassphage which was provided by the nite biological resource center nbrc japan bacteriophage p22 has double stranded dna and a large head with a short tail which is morphologically similar to crassphage guerin et al 2018 shkoporov et al 2018 sausset et al 2020 it was propagated overnight at 38 c with salmonella enterica nbrc 13 245 this solution was centrifuged and then passed through a membrane filter pore size 0 2 µm cellulose acetate advantec bacteriophage p22 was mixed with the samples prior to dna extraction molecular method efficiencies mmes were calculated by the following formula m m e c c o 100 where c is the number of copies of mpc in the sample and co is the number of copies of mpc in the control 2 5 nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription rt 2 5 1 rna extraction and rt in this study the concentrations of five types of rna viruses norovirus gi gii aiv pmmov and cgmmv in wastewater were quantified shown in table 2 mnv and orsv were used as the mpcs a 140 μl aliquot of each virus concentrate was spiked with 2 μl of mnv with a final concentration of 107 copies ml and subjected to rna extraction using a qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen the final volume of the rna extract was 60 μl the rna extract was then subjected to rt using a high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems rna extraction of 10 fold dilution samples of all concentrates was also conducted 2 5 2 dna extraction in this study the concentrations of two types of dna viruses adenovirus and crassphage were quantified shown in table 2 and p22 was used as the mpc all sample concentrates were diluted 10 fold in milliq water before dna extraction because of the limited sample amount a 200 μl aliquot of each virus concentrate was spiked with 5 μl of bacteriophage p22 with a final concentration of 5 2 105 copies ml and subjected to dna extraction using qiaamp dna mini kit qiagen the final volume of the dna extract was 200 μl 2 6 qpcr the concentration of the cdna obtained in the reverse transcription step was quantified using the steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems the cdna sample 5 μl was mixed with 10 μl of primetime gene expression master mix forward and reverse primer taqman probe and distilled water which added up to a total of 20 μl in each pcr reaction the primer and probe sets were used according to previous reports as shown in table s1 eun et al 2000 hongyun et al 2008 kageyama et al 2003 kitajima et al 2008 kitajima et al 2013 ko et al 2005 masago et al 2008 stachler et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 the reaction conditions are shown in table s2 plasmid dnas or oligo dnas containing the qpcr target sequences were used as the dna standards for qpcr the pcr efficiencies of all runs were calculated in reference to bustin et al 2009 and all of them were within the range of 81 100 the calculation of qpcr efficiencies was described in supplementary information the concentrations of 1 copy well 0 11 120 copies l were described as the detection limits although the detected samples exhibited ct values of less than 39 only aiv in ro permeate showed 41 of ct value to which the detection limit value was given all detection limit concentrations were shown in table s3 2 7 data selection policy in our study the rna virus concentrations of the concentrates with and without 10 fold dilution were quantified when multiple quantifications of the same sample were performed only the first set of data was used first data with 10 mme were omitted followed by those that were under the detection limits the highest of the remaining data were selected as the final virus concentration of the sample in case all of the data were under the detection limits the higher detection limit was selected regarding dna viruses all the concentrates were diluted 10 times before dna extraction and their mmes were 10 in all cases therefore only the first set of data was used for evaluation 3 results and discussion 3 1 primary concentration efficiency to confirm the effect of water matrix on the primary concentration step the primary concentration efficiencies pces in the 1 100 scale experiments were investigated they are shown in table 3 the pces for aiv mnv and pmmov for ro feed and ro permeate were consistently higher than 30 which indicates that this protocol recovered at least 30 of the viruses in each sample according to haramoto et al 2018 a collection efficiency of 10 is an acceptable level of virus concentration our results suggest that the collection efficiency in the primary concentration step was sufficiently high 3 2 molecular method efficiency mme the mmes were calculated using mnv orsv and p22 as the molecular process controls the mmes of mnv and orsv without dilution were 10 in mf feed and ro permeate table 4 however the mmes were 20 when a 10 fold dilution was applied table 5 indicating that a 10 fold dilution before rna extraction mitigated sample qpcr inhibition according to haramoto et al 2018 an mme of 10 is classified as acceptable hereafter samples with mmes 10 were adopted for evaluation table 4 and 5 the details of this selection policy are explained in section 2 7 further research is needed to determine whether reducing the volume by one tenth instead of 10 fold dilution to concentrate the original water sample is an effective measure 3 3 abundance of viruses in water samples the most prevalent virus in the secondary effluent with no chlorine secondary effluent was cgmmv followed by pmmov aiv nv gii adv crassphage and nv gi with mean concentrations of 7 3 6 6 4 6 4 5 4 4 3 8 and 3 7 log copies l respectively the pmmov and aiv concentrations obtained in the secondary effluent were similar to those reported previously table 6 although cgmmv concentrations were not reported there this virus is as abundant as pmmov in treated wastewater bačnik et al 2020 jumat et al 2017 cgmmv and pmmov were the most prevalent viruses at all sample locations i e 1 6 3 4 log higher than aiv even after ro treatment pmmov and cgmmv were detected consistently by qpcr this indicated that cgmmv and pmmov may be suitable as the process indicators including the downstream of water treatment system it should be noted that detection of rna dna by qpcr does not infer the presence of an infectious virus in the case of crassphage its initial concentration secondary effluent was 3 8 log copies l which was lower than that of enteric viruses nv gii and adv some studies reported substantially higher crassphage concentrations in treated wastewater than our results table 6 in turn morrison et al 2020 reported a lower concentration 4 4 log copies l of crassphage in wastewater effluents in arizona state usa which is similar to our study in studies which exhibited lower crassphage concentration the secondary treatments might be effective to remove crassphages from sewage and their original concentration might be really low of course the sampling time and the sewage composition also differed from research to research it might be possible that the water was collected from sources with fewer crassphages another possible reason was that the primary concentration efficiency pce of crassphages might be lower in this study pce was confirmed by a 1 100 scale experiment using only rna viruses i e mnv pmmov and aiv and a previous study also didn t use crassphage to confirm virus recovery katayama et al 2008 thus the pces of crassphages in our method remain unclear the mismatch of primer and probe design is also possible because of the geographical diversity of crassphages cinek et al 2018 3 4 virus lrvs after mf uf and ro fig 2 shows the virus concentrations before x axis and after y axis the mf uf and ro processes respectively the mf uf feed was collected after adding sodium hypochlorite to secondary effluent nv gi and gii concentrations were decreased after the sodium hypochlorite treatment table s3 however a consistent effect of the sodium hypochlorite was not observed for other viruses table s3 almost all plots exhibited an lrv of 3 fig 2 in this section we considered that all virus lrvs were similar to explain this similarity we conducted analysis of variance anova the results of these analyses are discussed in section 3 5 the median lrvs of each virus among the three pairs of samples are shown in table 7 all calculated lrvs including detection limit values are shown in table s3 the median virus lrvs of mf and uf were 3 0 n 21 range 1 0 4 6 and 3 2 n 21 range 1 2 4 6 respectively in the case of ro viruses in 13 samples of 21 samples were undetected from ro permeate table s3 and its actual lrv was not able to be determined its median lrv was 2 0 n 17 range 0 58 3 8 in addition it must be noted that these lrvs reflect the removal of rna dna gene copies and not the lrvs of cultivable or live viruses however haramoto et al 2007 reported that our concentration method led to lower recovery yields of naked rna although their infectivity was unclear the quantified values are expected to reflect the number of virions not necessarily infective the lrvs of the mf and uf processes in the who report were lower than that of the ro process who 2017 although their validated lrvs were 0 who 2017 the comparable lrvs to ro 2 9 mf and 3 3 uf were obtained in the present study a possible explanation is the presence of higher turbidity in the feed water than the ro feed in this water reuse facility the mf and uf processes are located upstream of the ro process therefore there were more suspended solids in the feed water contained than in that of the ro process therefore a cake layer is expected to easily form on the membrane many studies reported that the cake layer increased virus removal by the membrane filtration because large pores were blocked by substances kreishel et al 2012 yin et al 2015 in a previous study the reported lrv of bacteriophage ms2 and natural occurring viruses in the ro challenge test was more than 7 log using surface water as a feed hornstra et al 2019 as described ro treatment is expected to exhibit high virus removal based on the much larger size of viruses compared with ro membrane pores size exclusion mechanism as documented in many studies showing high log removal of ms2 bacteriophage during challenge testing hornstra et al 2019 however in the present study which was performed at a full scale water reuse facility the lrv of ro based on detected samples seemed to be not much higher than those of mf and uf table 7 here many lrvs of ro were not determined uniquely table s3 because of the undetected samples therefore it is difficult to discuss the difference in lrvs between membranes the lower lrvs of ro detected in the present study compared with past challenge tests may also indicate that a full scale ro membrane system has some degree of system or membrane breach through which viruses can potentially pass via an advective transport mechanism trussell et al 2020 viruses detected after the ro process in this study were rod shaped ones therefore virus removal by ro might be affected by morphologies further study is needed to evaluate the virus lrvs of ro it should be noted that we detected gene copies in the ro permeate rather than infectious viruses as an indicator of water quality the who 2017 reported the validated lrvs of mf uf and ro based on operational monitoring of turbidity for mf and uf and conductivity total organic carbon for ro which were 0 0 and 1 5 2 respectively the lrvs of mf uf and ro approved by groundwater replenishment projects in ca were 0 0 and 1 0 2 0 respectively olivieri et al 2016 which is the regulatory credit granted toward virus lrv requirements in the california regulatory framework compared with such conservative regulatory credit values mf and uf removed more viruses in the actual water reuse facility the actual lrv of ro calculated in the detected samples was within the range recommended by the who and higher than that allowed in ca 3 5 comparison of process indicator lrvs with those of other viruses as mentioned above all indicator viruses assessed here showed similar lrvs in the mf and uf processes table 7 the mf and uf lrvs were not significantly different between pmmov aiv and crassphage one way anova mf p 0 518 uf p 0 580 n 3 even though their morphologies are different the virus concentration method used in this study concentrated virions more efficiently than naked rnas haramoto et al 2007 suggesting that the observed number of gene copies can be regarded as that of virions these results suggest that morphology differences while their surface properties are still unclear did not affect the physical removal of viruses using full scale membrane processes in the mf and uf processes adv showed the highest lrvs among the seven types of viruses examined which were under the detection limits in almost all filtrate samples the median lrvs of adv in mf and uf were 4 2 and 3 5 respectively the median lrvs of nv gi and gii were 2 0 and 3 2 by mf and 3 0 and 3 8 by uf respectively the lrvs of two enteric viruses adv and nv gii were higher than those of indicator viruses in the case of nv gi although its apparent lrvs were lower than those of indicator viruses it was not detected from mf and uf filtrate and its actual lrvs might be higher therefore all indicator viruses exhibited conservative results and might be suitable as process indicators of human enteric viruses in the mf and uf processes regarding the ro process all human enteric viruses and two of the indicator viruses aiv and crassphage were almost completely undetected in the ro permeate table s3 in addition adv and nv gi were not detected in the ro feed thus the lrvs of human enteric viruses after ro were not evaluated quantitatively the median lrvs of nv gii aiv and crassphage were 0 59 1 83 and 1 92 respectively table 7 among the viruses investigated here only pmmov and cgmmv were quantifiable in the ro influent and ro effluent therefore their lrvs could be calculated their ct values in ro permeate for these two viruses were 31 2 36 7 which are in the range of reliable quantification values the median lrvs of pmmov and cgmmv across the ro were 2 8 and 2 5 respectively only one lrv for aiv was calculated to be 3 8 from one paired sample among the three sample pairs collected which was higher than that of pmmov lrv 2 8 and cgmmv lrv 2 5 these data suggest that pmmov and cgmmv are suitable for use as conservative process indicators for ro notably the lrvs of nv gi and adv after the ro process were not obtained in our study thus the applicability of pmmov and cgmmv as process indicators for these viruses was not evaluated further investigations are needed to determine whether pmmov and cgmmv are suitable as process indicators for all types of human enteric viruses in the ro process based on our results pmmov and cgmmv were the most promising process indicators for mf uf and ro because of their high concentration in the feedwater these viruses were also quantified in samples after the ro process therefore they can possibly be used to calculate the virus lrvs of in both upstream and downstream treatments furthermore their removal by mf and uf processes was not significantly different from those of other candidate process indicator viruses with different morphologies their removal values by mf and uf were slightly lower than those of human enteric viruses these removal characteristics and high feedwater loads render pmmov and cgmmv good candidates as process indicators for the whole water treatment process aiv and crassphage were also suitable process indicators for the mf and uf processes their removal values were lower than those of human enteric viruses in the case of aiv its concentration in samples was always 2 3 log lower than that of pmmov and cgmmv which suggests that a larger volume was needed to concentrate and quantify aiv compared with pmmov and cgmmv based on the virus concentrations determined in mf filtrates in the present study the volume of concentration was calculated assuming that 10 copies well was needed to quantify virus concentration for pmmov 7 2 ml of the actual sample was required for quantification whereas for aiv 310 ml was needed for quantification in the case of uf filtrates 35 ml and 1 1 l of the actual sample were required for pmmov and aiv quantification respectively these required concentration volumes for aiv pmmov and cgmmv were summarized in table 8 suitable process indicator viruses should be selected based on the concentrated volumes in the case of crassphage quantification methods should be optimized to determine its concentrations accurately the open symbols with the arrow indicate samples that were under the detection limits the symbols on the dotted line indicate an lrv of 0 whereas those on the dashed line indicate an lrv of 3 almost all detected values were on the dashed line therefore their lrvs were approximately 3 4 conclusion the concentrations of four naturally occurring process indicator viruses pmmov cgmmv aiv and crassphage and three human enteric viruses nv gi nv gii and adv were determined in a full scale indirect potable water reuse facility based on their concentrations the virus lrvs of the mf uf and ro processes were calculated under regular operation the median lrvs of mf and uf were 2 9 n 21 range 1 0 to 4 6 and 3 1 n 21 range 1 2 to 4 5 respectively in the case of the ro process most viruses excluding pmmov and cgmmv were not detected in ro permeate samples the median ro lrvs for pmmov and cgmmv were 2 8 and 2 5 respectively it should be noted that the ro lrv of the measured human enteric virus is still unclear and further investigations are needed to better estimate the ro lrv in mf and uf the median lrv of all four indicator viruses ranged between 2 8 and 3 0 showing similar results even though their morphologies were different all indicator viruses i e aiv pmmov cgmmv and crassphage exhibited slightly lower lrvs than enteric viruses therefore they were suitable as process indicators of mf and uf pmmov and cgmmv had 2 3 log higher concentrations at all collection points than did other indicator viruses and were also detected in ro permeate their lrvs after ro were lower than the lrv of aiv and lower than the values reported in challenge tests using ms2 coliphage spiked into feed water and new virgin ro membranes based on these results pmmov and cgmmv might be conservative process indicators for mf uf and ro the quantification of pmmov and cgmmv requires lower volume of sample for detection in mf

been adopted in many regions of the world one way to accomplish this situation is introducing advanced water treatment trains e g microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro and ultraviolet light and advanced oxidation process uv aop which treat wastewater to produce high quality pathogen free water virus removal is a key factor in the regulation of the planned potable reuse facilities because wastewater contains high virus concentrations ccr 2015 2021 twdb 2015 for potable reuse viruses in wastewater must be reduced to levels that do not impact human health sano et al 2016 reportedly the number of fecal viruses in stools has been as high as 1012 copies g kirby et al 2014 furthermore viruses have been found to persist in water supply systems who world health organization 2011 the who set 10 6 dalys per person per year as an upper limit of health risk for potable water and suggested 10 5 or 10 4 daly per person per year as more realistic targets to achieve this level of protection strong guidelines and testing protocols are required regulatory guidelines rely on log removal values lrvs to estimate virus removal during treatment which are allocated to each qualified unit process within a treatment train e g mf uf ro and uv aop the potable reuse regulation guideline in california set 12 logs for indirect potable reuse and 20 logs for direct potable reuse as performance targets to remove viruses in total from wastewater to finished water ccr 2015 2021 and a single treatment may be credited with no more than 6 logs reduction ccr 2015 2021 the reported virus lrvs for mf uf and ro in challenge tests using surface water were 0 4 log otaki et al 1998 jacangelo et al 1995 matsushita et al 2013 1 5 6 log jacangelo et al 1995 matsushita et al 2013 and 7 log hornstra et al 2019 respectively these studies used bacteriophage ms2 or qbeta as a model virus however the credited lrvs for uf and ro allotted by regulatory agencies are lower than the values achieved in challenge tests usepa 2005 who 2017 one explanation for the low credited lrv for uf is the limitation of direct integrity testing usepa 2005 which is a physical test that is performed during operation owing to the small size of viruses 300 nm it is difficult to identify a reliable parameter that directly represents the virus size breaches on the membranes continuous indirect integrity testing is required to evaluate ro performance indirect parameters such as turbidity electric conductivity and total organic carbon are used to measure membrane integrity pype et al 2016 usepa 2005 and the validated virus lrv of ro is determined based on the removal values of these indirect parameters as a conservative measure constrained by limitations on feed concentration and product water measurement sensitivity recognizing that the actual virus removal is likely much greater who 2017 in treated water sources enteric viruses are sometimes present at very low concentrations therefore to quantify human enteric viruses to calculate an lrv efficient concentration techniques must be utilized to recover viruses from large sample volumes to increase the sensitivity of detection to understand the fate of enteric viruses during the treatment processes indicator viruses are often used because of their higher concentrations compared to indigenous enteric viruses in the source and treated water canh et al 2019 kato et al 2018 the indicator viruses should be consistently present in feedwater at high concentrations and their removal by the treatment process should be equal to or lower than the indigenous enteric viruses if the fate of indicator viruses and indigenous enteric viruses is similar then it is possible to assess the lrvs of human enteric viruses in the water treatment by measuring those of the indicator viruses in this study we focused on aichi virus aiv pepper mild mottle virus pmmov cucumber green mottle mosaic virus cgmmv and cross assembly phage crassphage as candidates of a process indicator virus aiv pmmov and crassphage are excreted in the human stool and are ubiquitously found in raw sewage and reported as globally abundant viruses in the wastewater ahmed et al 2018 2020 bivins et al 2020 dutilh et al 2014 hata et al 2014 kitajima and gerba 2015 lodder et al 2013 wu et al 2020 the abundance of cgmmv in wastewater and sewage samples was also reported in various countries bačnik et al 2020 jumat et al 2017 robledo mahón et al 2019 yang et al 2021 although aiv concentration in wastewater was not as high as that of pmmov and crassphage kitajima and gerba 2015 kitajima et al 2018 bivins et al 2020 it belongs to the enteric viruses that have a non enveloped and icosahedral shape to be a promising process indicator kitajima and gerba 2015 pmmov and cgmmv have been isolated from sewage and treated wastewater samples throughout the world bačnik et al 2020 jumat et al 2017 robledo mahón et al 2019 yang et al 2021 owing to their abundance in wastewater pmmov and cgmmv are strong candidates as human specific indicators in many geographical regions pmmov has been identified and reported as a promising process indicator during water treatment processes canh et al 2019 kato et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 crassphage also attracted attentions as a promising process indicator in recent studies ahmed et al 2020 tandukar et al 2020 however the shapes of these three viruses are different from that of most human enteric viruses and their difference of surface properties is still unclear therefore in order to evaluate the applicability of these viruses as process indicators the behavior and removal of these viruses during water treatment needs to be tested and compared with those of human enteric viruses to the best of our knowledge few other studies have evaluated virus removal by membrane treatment in water reuse facilities at full scale stamps et al 2018 rock et al 2019 in this study we investigated virus concentrations before and after membrane treatment processes at an indirect potable reuse treatment facility in california usa our study objectives were 1 to evaluate virus lrvs for mf uf and ro processes at the potable reuse plant using molecular methods and 2 to compare the lrvs of enteric viruses and the candidate process indicator viruses and evaluate the potential of using these indicator viruses in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection water samples were collected at an indirect potable reuse facility in ca usa fig 1 shows the schematic of the treatment processes and the sample collection points water samples were collected at six points i e the secondary effluent from the wastewater treatment facility secondary effluent after a chlorine chloramine treatment mf uf feed mf filtrate mf ef uf filtrate uf ef a blend of mf and uf filtrates in a break tank ro feed and ro permeate the samples were collected once in september 2019 and twice in november 2019 to investigate the usual removability of membrane treatments table 1 lists the sample volumes collected at each process point and the equivalent volumes for each virus quantification the water quality of samples was within the ordinary range 2 2 concentration of wastewater samples the water samples were concentrated using the acid rinse alkaline mg2 method with a cartridge type electronegative filter opticap xl2 milligard 0 5 µm 9 16 in hb hb kw06a02hh3 merck millipore as described previously hata et al 2014 more than 10 recovery efficiencies of viruses and lower recovery of naked rnas using this primary and secondary concentration method were reported in previous studies haramoto et al 2007 hata et al 2014 the sample volumes applied at point 1 and 2 secondary effluent and mf uf feed varied according to the clogging of the filter the opticap xl2 filter was refrigerated at 4 c the filters were placed on gel ice and transported to the university of tokyo tokyo japan the subsequent concentration process including filter rinse and elution was performed in tokyo within 5 days of sample collection the opticap xl2 filter was connected to an aspirator and 2 l of a 0 5 mm h2so4 solution and 1 l of distilled water were passed in that order to wash off the remaining mg2 from the membrane surface subsequently 200 ml of a 1 0 mm naoh solution was passed through the opticap xl2 filter to collect the virus from the membrane the filtrates were collected in a centrifuge tube containing 1 ml of 100 mm h2so4 solution and 2 ml of 100 te buffer final 200 ml concentrates virus in naohaq h2so4aq te buffer were obtained for each sample the solutions were kept in a refrigerator until the next concentration step when passing any liquid through the filter it was confirmed that the filter housing was filled with liquid to collect viruses from all the areas of the membrane the process up to this point is designated as the primary concentration step the concentrates were further concentrated using a centricon plus 70 filter device merck millipore to obtain approximately 1 ml of final concentrates according to the manufacturer s protocol 2 3 evaluation of the primary concentration efficiency to assess the collection efficiency in the primary concentration step a 1 100 scale experiment was performed katayama et al 2008 confirmed the high virus concentration efficiency of the method using secondary treated wastewater in our study ro feed and ro permeate were tested for the primary concentration efficiency the volumes applied were exactly 1 100 of the full scale experiments described in section 2 2 table 1 100 ml and 10 l of the ro feed and the ro permeate grab samples were collected respectively pmmov murine norovirus mnv and aiv were spiked into each sample to obtain a concentration of 105 106 copies ml of each an mgcl2 solution 5 m was also added to the water samples to a final concentration of 25 mm the volumes of chemical solutions were also 1 100 of full scale experiments after thoroughly mixing the sample was passed through the flat membrane i e a mixed cellulose esters membrane merk millipore hawp 047 00 the membrane surface area was approximately 1 100th of that of the opticap xl2 filter merk millipore mixed cellulose esters membrane surface area 1000 cm2 the pore sizes of the flat membrane and the opticap xl2 are 0 45 µm and 0 5 µm respectively subsequently 200 ml of a 0 5 mm h2so4 solution was passed through finally 10 ml of a 1 0 mm naoh solution was passed through using a vacuum pump the filtrate was collected into a tube containing 50 µl of a 100 mm h2so4 solution and 100 µl of 100 te buffer based on the virus concentrations measured before and after filtration the primary concentration efficiency pce was calculated using the following formula pce c c 0 100 where c is the number of copies of spiked virus obtained from the sample after the primary concentration and c0 is the number of copies of spiked virus obtained directly from the virus stock solution 2 4 preparation of molecular process controls inhibitory substances have been shown to be co concentrated during sample concentration and purification these substances have been shown to interfere with molecular detection assays by hindering the extraction of nucleic acids degrading nucleic acids and inhibiting pcr amplification by interacting with polymerases wilson 1997 hata et al 2015 to monitor nucleic acid extraction and qpcr inhibitory effects molecular process controls mpcs representative of different virus types mnv odontoglossum ringspot virus orsv and bacteriophage p22 were used mpcs enabled the measurement of the molecular detection efficiency of the extraction method nucleic acid purification method and its amplification according to virus type for each water matrix sample location mnv strain s7 pp3 was propagated in raw 264 7 cells and used as the mpc for aiv orsv was purchased from the national agriculture and food research organization japan and used as the mpc for pmmov and cgmmv these mpcs were selected based on the similarity of their morphologies compared with the process indicator viruses bacteriophage p22 nbrc 20 023 was used as the mpc for crassphage which was provided by the nite biological resource center nbrc japan bacteriophage p22 has double stranded dna and a large head with a short tail which is morphologically similar to crassphage guerin et al 2018 shkoporov et al 2018 sausset et al 2020 it was propagated overnight at 38 c with salmonella enterica nbrc 13 245 this solution was centrifuged and then passed through a membrane filter pore size 0 2 µm cellulose acetate advantec bacteriophage p22 was mixed with the samples prior to dna extraction molecular method efficiencies mmes were calculated by the following formula m m e c c o 100 where c is the number of copies of mpc in the sample and co is the number of copies of mpc in the control 2 5 nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription rt 2 5 1 rna extraction and rt in this study the concentrations of five types of rna viruses norovirus gi gii aiv pmmov and cgmmv in wastewater were quantified shown in table 2 mnv and orsv were used as the mpcs a 140 μl aliquot of each virus concentrate was spiked with 2 μl of mnv with a final concentration of 107 copies ml and subjected to rna extraction using a qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen the final volume of the rna extract was 60 μl the rna extract was then subjected to rt using a high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems rna extraction of 10 fold dilution samples of all concentrates was also conducted 2 5 2 dna extraction in this study the concentrations of two types of dna viruses adenovirus and crassphage were quantified shown in table 2 and p22 was used as the mpc all sample concentrates were diluted 10 fold in milliq water before dna extraction because of the limited sample amount a 200 μl aliquot of each virus concentrate was spiked with 5 μl of bacteriophage p22 with a final concentration of 5 2 105 copies ml and subjected to dna extraction using qiaamp dna mini kit qiagen the final volume of the dna extract was 200 μl 2 6 qpcr the concentration of the cdna obtained in the reverse transcription step was quantified using the steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems the cdna sample 5 μl was mixed with 10 μl of primetime gene expression master mix forward and reverse primer taqman probe and distilled water which added up to a total of 20 μl in each pcr reaction the primer and probe sets were used according to previous reports as shown in table s1 eun et al 2000 hongyun et al 2008 kageyama et al 2003 kitajima et al 2008 kitajima et al 2013 ko et al 2005 masago et al 2008 stachler et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 the reaction conditions are shown in table s2 plasmid dnas or oligo dnas containing the qpcr target sequences were used as the dna standards for qpcr the pcr efficiencies of all runs were calculated in reference to bustin et al 2009 and all of them were within the range of 81 100 the calculation of qpcr efficiencies was described in supplementary information the concentrations of 1 copy well 0 11 120 copies l were described as the detection limits although the detected samples exhibited ct values of less than 39 only aiv in ro permeate showed 41 of ct value to which the detection limit value was given all detection limit concentrations were shown in table s3 2 7 data selection policy in our study the rna virus concentrations of the concentrates with and without 10 fold dilution were quantified when multiple quantifications of the same sample were performed only the first set of data was used first data with 10 mme were omitted followed by those that were under the detection limits the highest of the remaining data were selected as the final virus concentration of the sample in case all of the data were under the detection limits the higher detection limit was selected regarding dna viruses all the concentrates were diluted 10 times before dna extraction and their mmes were 10 in all cases therefore only the first set of data was used for evaluation 3 results and discussion 3 1 primary concentration efficiency to confirm the effect of water matrix on the primary concentration step the primary concentration efficiencies pces in the 1 100 scale experiments were investigated they are shown in table 3 the pces for aiv mnv and pmmov for ro feed and ro permeate were consistently higher than 30 which indicates that this protocol recovered at least 30 of the viruses in each sample according to haramoto et al 2018 a collection efficiency of 10 is an acceptable level of virus concentration our results suggest that the collection efficiency in the primary concentration step was sufficiently high 3 2 molecular method efficiency mme the mmes were calculated using mnv orsv and p22 as the molecular process controls the mmes of mnv and orsv without dilution were 10 in mf feed and ro permeate table 4 however the mmes were 20 when a 10 fold dilution was applied table 5 indicating that a 10 fold dilution before rna extraction mitigated sample qpcr inhibition according to haramoto et al 2018 an mme of 10 is classified as acceptable hereafter samples with mmes 10 were adopted for evaluation table 4 and 5 the details of this selection policy are explained in section 2 7 further research is needed to determine whether reducing the volume by one tenth instead of 10 fold dilution to concentrate the original water sample is an effective measure 3 3 abundance of viruses in water samples the most prevalent virus in the secondary effluent with no chlorine secondary effluent was cgmmv followed by pmmov aiv nv gii adv crassphage and nv gi with mean concentrations of 7 3 6 6 4 6 4 5 4 4 3 8 and 3 7 log copies l respectively the pmmov and aiv concentrations obtained in the secondary effluent were similar to those reported previously table 6 although cgmmv concentrations were not reported there this virus is as abundant as pmmov in treated wastewater bačnik et al 2020 jumat et al 2017 cgmmv and pmmov were the most prevalent viruses at all sample locations i e 1 6 3 4 log higher than aiv even after ro treatment pmmov and cgmmv were detected consistently by qpcr this indicated that cgmmv and pmmov may be suitable as the process indicators including the downstream of water treatment system it should be noted that detection of rna dna by qpcr does not infer the presence of an infectious virus in the case of crassphage its initial concentration secondary effluent was 3 8 log copies l which was lower than that of enteric viruses nv gii and adv some studies reported substantially higher crassphage concentrations in treated wastewater than our results table 6 in turn morrison et al 2020 reported a lower concentration 4 4 log copies l of crassphage in wastewater effluents in arizona state usa which is similar to our study in studies which exhibited lower crassphage concentration the secondary treatments might be effective to remove crassphages from sewage and their original concentration might be really low of course the sampling time and the sewage composition also differed from research to research it might be possible that the water was collected from sources with fewer crassphages another possible reason was that the primary concentration efficiency pce of crassphages might be lower in this study pce was confirmed by a 1 100 scale experiment using only rna viruses i e mnv pmmov and aiv and a previous study also didn t use crassphage to confirm virus recovery katayama et al 2008 thus the pces of crassphages in our method remain unclear the mismatch of primer and probe design is also possible because of the geographical diversity of crassphages cinek et al 2018 3 4 virus lrvs after mf uf and ro fig 2 shows the virus concentrations before x axis and after y axis the mf uf and ro processes respectively the mf uf feed was collected after adding sodium hypochlorite to secondary effluent nv gi and gii concentrations were decreased after the sodium hypochlorite treatment table s3 however a consistent effect of the sodium hypochlorite was not observed for other viruses table s3 almost all plots exhibited an lrv of 3 fig 2 in this section we considered that all virus lrvs were similar to explain this similarity we conducted analysis of variance anova the results of these analyses are discussed in section 3 5 the median lrvs of each virus among the three pairs of samples are shown in table 7 all calculated lrvs including detection limit values are shown in table s3 the median virus lrvs of mf and uf were 3 0 n 21 range 1 0 4 6 and 3 2 n 21 range 1 2 4 6 respectively in the case of ro viruses in 13 samples of 21 samples were undetected from ro permeate table s3 and its actual lrv was not able to be determined its median lrv was 2 0 n 17 range 0 58 3 8 in addition it must be noted that these lrvs reflect the removal of rna dna gene copies and not the lrvs of cultivable or live viruses however haramoto et al 2007 reported that our concentration method led to lower recovery yields of naked rna although their infectivity was unclear the quantified values are expected to reflect the number of virions not necessarily infective the lrvs of the mf and uf processes in the who report were lower than that of the ro process who 2017 although their validated lrvs were 0 who 2017 the comparable lrvs to ro 2 9 mf and 3 3 uf were obtained in the present study a possible explanation is the presence of higher turbidity in the feed water than the ro feed in this water reuse facility the mf and uf processes are located upstream of the ro process therefore there were more suspended solids in the feed water contained than in that of the ro process therefore a cake layer is expected to easily form on the membrane many studies reported that the cake layer increased virus removal by the membrane filtration because large pores were blocked by substances kreishel et al 2012 yin et al 2015 in a previous study the reported lrv of bacteriophage ms2 and natural occurring viruses in the ro challenge test was more than 7 log using surface water as a feed hornstra et al 2019 as described ro treatment is expected to exhibit high virus removal based on the much larger size of viruses compared with ro membrane pores size exclusion mechanism as documented in many studies showing high log removal of ms2 bacteriophage during challenge testing hornstra et al 2019 however in the present study which was performed at a full scale water reuse facility the lrv of ro based on detected samples seemed to be not much higher than those of mf and uf table 7 here many lrvs of ro were not determined uniquely table s3 because of the undetected samples therefore it is difficult to discuss the difference in lrvs between membranes the lower lrvs of ro detected in the present study compared with past challenge tests may also indicate that a full scale ro membrane system has some degree of system or membrane breach through which viruses can potentially pass via an advective transport mechanism trussell et al 2020 viruses detected after the ro process in this study were rod shaped ones therefore virus removal by ro might be affected by morphologies further study is needed to evaluate the virus lrvs of ro it should be noted that we detected gene copies in the ro permeate rather than infectious viruses as an indicator of water quality the who 2017 reported the validated lrvs of mf uf and ro based on operational monitoring of turbidity for mf and uf and conductivity total organic carbon for ro which were 0 0 and 1 5 2 respectively the lrvs of mf uf and ro approved by groundwater replenishment projects in ca were 0 0 and 1 0 2 0 respectively olivieri et al 2016 which is the regulatory credit granted toward virus lrv requirements in the california regulatory framework compared with such conservative regulatory credit values mf and uf removed more viruses in the actual water reuse facility the actual lrv of ro calculated in the detected samples was within the range recommended by the who and higher than that allowed in ca 3 5 comparison of process indicator lrvs with those of other viruses as mentioned above all indicator viruses assessed here showed similar lrvs in the mf and uf processes table 7 the mf and uf lrvs were not significantly different between pmmov aiv and crassphage one way anova mf p 0 518 uf p 0 580 n 3 even though their morphologies are different the virus concentration method used in this study concentrated virions more efficiently than naked rnas haramoto et al 2007 suggesting that the observed number of gene copies can be regarded as that of virions these results suggest that morphology differences while their surface properties are still unclear did not affect the physical removal of viruses using full scale membrane processes in the mf and uf processes adv showed the highest lrvs among the seven types of viruses examined which were under the detection limits in almost all filtrate samples the median lrvs of adv in mf and uf were 4 2 and 3 5 respectively the median lrvs of nv gi and gii were 2 0 and 3 2 by mf and 3 0 and 3 8 by uf respectively the lrvs of two enteric viruses adv and nv gii were higher than those of indicator viruses in the case of nv gi although its apparent lrvs were lower than those of indicator viruses it was not detected from mf and uf filtrate and its actual lrvs might be higher therefore all indicator viruses exhibited conservative results and might be suitable as process indicators of human enteric viruses in the mf and uf processes regarding the ro process all human enteric viruses and two of the indicator viruses aiv and crassphage were almost completely undetected in the ro permeate table s3 in addition adv and nv gi were not detected in the ro feed thus the lrvs of human enteric viruses after ro were not evaluated quantitatively the median lrvs of nv gii aiv and crassphage were 0 59 1 83 and 1 92 respectively table 7 among the viruses investigated here only pmmov and cgmmv were quantifiable in the ro influent and ro effluent therefore their lrvs could be calculated their ct values in ro permeate for these two viruses were 31 2 36 7 which are in the range of reliable quantification values the median lrvs of pmmov and cgmmv across the ro were 2 8 and 2 5 respectively only one lrv for aiv was calculated to be 3 8 from one paired sample among the three sample pairs collected which was higher than that of pmmov lrv 2 8 and cgmmv lrv 2 5 these data suggest that pmmov and cgmmv are suitable for use as conservative process indicators for ro notably the lrvs of nv gi and adv after the ro process were not obtained in our study thus the applicability of pmmov and cgmmv as process indicators for these viruses was not evaluated further investigations are needed to determine whether pmmov and cgmmv are suitable as process indicators for all types of human enteric viruses in the ro process based on our results pmmov and cgmmv were the most promising process indicators for mf uf and ro because of their high concentration in the feedwater these viruses were also quantified in samples after the ro process therefore they can possibly be used to calculate the virus lrvs of in both upstream and downstream treatments furthermore their removal by mf and uf processes was not significantly different from those of other candidate process indicator viruses with different morphologies their removal values by mf and uf were slightly lower than those of human enteric viruses these removal characteristics and high feedwater loads render pmmov and cgmmv good candidates as process indicators for the whole water treatment process aiv and crassphage were also suitable process indicators for the mf and uf processes their removal values were lower than those of human enteric viruses in the case of aiv its concentration in samples was always 2 3 log lower than that of pmmov and cgmmv which suggests that a larger volume was needed to concentrate and quantify aiv compared with pmmov and cgmmv based on the virus concentrations determined in mf filtrates in the present study the volume of concentration was calculated assuming that 10 copies well was needed to quantify virus concentration for pmmov 7 2 ml of the actual sample was required for quantification whereas for aiv 310 ml was needed for quantification in the case of uf filtrates 35 ml and 1 1 l of the actual sample were required for pmmov and aiv quantification respectively these required concentration volumes for aiv pmmov and cgmmv were summarized in table 8 suitable process indicator viruses should be selected based on the concentrated volumes in the case of crassphage quantification methods should be optimized to determine its concentrations accurately the open symbols with the arrow indicate samples that were under the detection limits the symbols on the dotted line indicate an lrv of 0 whereas those on the dashed line indicate an lrv of 3 almost all detected values were on the dashed line therefore their lrvs were approximately 3 4 conclusion the concentrations of four naturally occurring process indicator viruses pmmov cgmmv aiv and crassphage and three human enteric viruses nv gi nv gii and adv were determined in a full scale indirect potable water reuse facility based on their concentrations the virus lrvs of the mf uf and ro processes were calculated under regular operation the median lrvs of mf and uf were 2 9 n 21 range 1 0 to 4 6 and 3 1 n 21 range 1 2 to 4 5 respectively in the case of the ro process most viruses excluding pmmov and cgmmv were not detected in ro permeate samples the median ro lrvs for pmmov and cgmmv were 2 8 and 2 5 respectively it should be noted that the ro lrv of the measured human enteric virus is still unclear and further investigations are needed to better estimate the ro lrv in mf and uf the median lrv of all four indicator viruses ranged between 2 8 and 3 0 showing similar results even though their morphologies were different all indicator viruses i e aiv pmmov cgmmv and crassphage exhibited slightly lower lrvs than enteric viruses therefore they were suitable as process indicators of mf and uf pmmov and cgmmv had 2 3 log higher concentrations at all collection points than did other indicator viruses and were also detected in ro permeate their lrvs after ro were lower than the lrv of aiv and lower than the values reported in challenge tests using ms2 coliphage spiked into feed water and new virgin ro membranes based on these results pmmov and cgmmv might be conservative process indicators for mf uf and ro the quantification of pmmov and cgmmv requires lower volume of sample for detection in mf

16556,biofilms can harbor a wide range of microorganisms including opportunistic respiratory pathogens and their establishment on engineered surfaces poses a risk to public health and industry the emergence of compact germicidal ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds may enable their incorporation into confined spaces to inhibit bacterial surface colonization on inaccessible surfaces such as those in premise plumbing such applications necessitate knowledge of the quantitative response of biofilm growth rates to uv exposure on continuously irradiated surfaces herein we performed experiments at varying flow cell temperatures in order to control baseline biofilm growth rates in the absence of uv then biofilm growth was compared under the same conditions but with simultaneous uvc irradiation the inhibiting effect of uv irradiation on biofilm growth kinetics was diminished by more favorable growth conditions higher temperature increasing the temperature by 10 c resulted in an increase in biovolume by 193 under a uvc 254 nm intensity of 60 µw cm2 we further fitted an existing intensity response model to the biofilm growth data and analyzed the effects of temperature on model parameters which were consistent with a hypothesized shielding effect arising from the deposition of extracellular colloidal materials the shielding effect was found to result in breakthrough behavior of irradiated biofilms after 48 h wherein accumulation of shielding substances eventually enabled biofilm establishment at even relatively high irradiation intensities 102 3 µw cm2 with respect to applications of uvc irradiation for biofilm prevention these results imply that surfaces more prone to bacterial colonization require disproportionately higher intensity uvc irradiation for prevention of biofilm establishment and continuous surface irradiation may be inadequate as a sole intervention for biofilm prevention in many scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract

water distribution systems act as environmental reservoirs for waterborne opportunistic bacterial pathogens which are responsible for an increasing number of life threatening pulmonary infections in developed countries berry et al 2006 falkinham et al 2015 storey et al 2004 furthermore the prevention of biofilms in engineered systems with inaccessible wetted interior surfaces remains a challenge

incapability of municipal scale disinfection in averting biofilm establishment in drinking water distribution systems point of entry disinfection systems are similarly unable to prevent biofilm formation on downstream plumbing components thus fixtures that incorporate uvc sources and prevent biofilm growth at the point of dispensing and simultaneously acting as a one pass uvc reactor may offer a more effective barrier against opportunistic pathogens with the advancement of increasingly efficient and compact uvc leds the use of uvc irradiation as a direct in situ measure for biofilm deterrence within confined internal spaces is becoming more feasible examples of potential application spaces for uvc leds include showerheads faucets hvac systems and beverage dispensers hypothetically the incorporation of leds into such confined spaces could inhibit colonization on high priority surfaces by continually irradiating and inactivating bacteria as they attach due to the complex geometries of such systems however uvc intensities received by different portions of the internal surfaces may vary significantly due to optical divergence and line of sight aspects therefore quantitative knowledge of biofilm growth rate reductions in response to continuous surface irradiation intensities is indispensable in developing such devices unlike uvc inactivation of planktonic bacteria supported by copious literature quantitative research on biofilm growth inhibition by continuous irradiation is in its infancy the first experiments and models used to quantify the uvc intensity response of biofilm growth were reported in our recent publication torkzadeh et al 2021 therein we developed an apparatus and methodology that allowed for biofilm growth under controlled uvc irradiation intensities and quantification of their growth rates furthermore a biofilm uvc intensity response model was created for the first time enabling quantitative prediction of escherichia coli biofilm formation rates as a function of surface irradiation intensity λ 254 nm although biofilm formation was suppressed under the intensities employed a minimum nonzero threshold of surface biovolume was observed even when comparatively high uvc intensities were used this minimum threshold was attributed to the deposition of colloidal material and bacterial secretions which provided shielding against uvc photons torkzadeh et al 2021 such shielding likely enabled biofilm growth and has implications for the long term efficacy of continuous uvc irradiation theoretically the shielding effect might become more pronounced as surface fouling continues over time leading to the possibility of breakthrough behavior characterized by a drastic decrease in biofilm uvc intensity response the previous research and the developed model laid the groundwork for uvc biofilm intensity response studies however they were restricted to a single microorganism and one set of biofilm growth conditions and growth time environmental conditions such as temperature and nutrient availability indisputably impact biofilm growth rates and thus presumably uvc intensity response behavior nutrient availability has been described as a determining factor for biofilm thickness activity and robustness salgar chaparro et al 2020 similarly by increasing the growth temperature from 15 to 35 c silhan et al 2006 observed a 100 fold increase in colony forming units as a parameter in our developed model baseline biofilm growth rate was defined as the rate of biofilm formation in the dark control experiments no uvc applied during growth and is thus a direct function of environmental conditions such as those mentioned above in addition to the organism type an increase in baseline growth rate quantitatively impacts the biofilm inhibitory effects of continuous uvc irradiation as higher uvc intensities are needed to counterbalance the inherently higher attachment and growth rates moreover despite the negligible influence of temperature 50 c on the uvc resistance of planktonic bacteria gayán et al 2011 its effect on biofilm establishment on surfaces exposed to uvc irradiation on a continual basis is unknown both temperature variations and exposure to uvc impact quorum sensing the chemical signaling system bacteria use to coordinate biofilm forming behaviors which may synergistically affect biofilm growth lee et al 2008 van der berg et al 2015 yin et al 2019 in this effort our objectives were to experimentally determine the effect of e coli baseline biofilm growth rate controlled via flow cell temperature on the uvc intensity response of biofilm growth and how it impacts the previously developed model evaluate the long term efficacy of continuous uvc irradiation on biofilm inhibition to assess the previously discussed shielding effect and possible breakthrough of growth 2 materials and methods experiments were carried out using two timeframes wherein biofilms were grown for either 48 or 288 h the shorter period experiments aimed to address the first objective and the extended duration experiments were designed to address the latter 2 1 bacteria strains and growth medium e coli atcc 25 922 and atcc 25922gfp were used as model biofilm forming bacteria for short and extended duration experiments respectively the growth medium contents were optimized for high uvc transmittance and described previously except for extended experiments wherein 100 µg ml ampicillin and 60 µg ml of l ascorbic acid were added torkzadeh et al 2021 l ascorbic acid was added to scavenge uv induced reactive oxygen species which would otherwise damage green fluorescent protein gfp and result in loss of fluorescence alnuami et al 2008 2 2 flow cell biofilm growth and surface irradiation biofilm growth for both 48 h and extended experiments were carried out following the same procedures and using the same experimental setup discussed in our previous effort torkzadeh et al 2021 however the extended duration experiments were interrupted for biofilm analysis at fixed time points and resumed subsequently in order to avoid contamination upstream of the flow cell the tubing nutrient feed solutions and feed containers were substituted with sterile ones at a minimum of every 48 h and additionally after each analysis the authors recent research discussed the apparatus and methods development for continuous surface irradiation torkzadeh et al 2021 2 3 biofilm analysis and data analysis biofilm analysis and quantification were carried out utilizing confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm in accordance with methods discussed previously with minor modifications for extended duration experiments torkzadeh et al 2021 therein the rinse solution was enriched with 60 µg ml of l ascorbic acid to preserve gfp during exposure to the laser beam moreover the dye staining step was eliminated for extended period experiments since the use of gfp modified bacterial strain enabled clsm imaging via autofluorescence the experimental methods utilizing gfp modified strain were implemented in our lab at a later stage when a need for frequent and nondestructive biofilm analysis throughout the experiments was determined thus dye staining was used for earlier experiments addressing the first objective prior to switching to the gfp modified strain which does not require dye staining for analysis to complete the second objective both methods resulted in similar clsm images which were analyzed in the same manner therein clsm images were analyzed utilizing the same computational techniques previously described wherein specific biovolume sbv was used as the primary quantifiable parameter for biofilm surface coverage biofilm sbv was defined as the volume of fluorescing cells µm3 per unit area of the test surface µm2 reported in units of µm3 µm2 i e µm similar methods were employed for data analysis and curve fitting as used in our previous research torkzadeh et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 control of biofilm growth rate using temperature fig 1 a f show representative clsm images of e coli atcc25922 biofilms grown for 48 h in the control and irradiated chambers at 23 28 and 33 c biofilms were stained using syto9 fluorescent dye syto9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain invitrogen usa which stains nucleic acids of both live in tact membrane and ruptured bacterial cells and emits green light upon excitation stiefel et al 2015 as expected and reported previously higher flow cell temperatures resulted in higher biofilm growth rates in the control experiments diaz villanueva et al 2011 silhan et al 2006 evidenced by the dense biofilms in fig 1 a c and complete averaged data shown in fig s1 when the flow cell temperature was increased from 23 to 33 c resulting biovolume increased by 101 from 13 5 μm at 23 c to 26 85 μm at 33 c corresponding images of the irradiated test surfaces under otherwise identical conditions are shown in fig 1 d f and quantitative data in fig s2 similarly biofilm growth under uvc irradiation intensities of 59 5 60 µw cm2 showed 193 more biovolume when grown at higher temperature from 0 74 μm at 23 c to 2 16 μm at 33 c this finding supports the hypothesis that under constant intensities higher baseline growth rate i e higher temperatures results in more biofilm coverage despite inhibition from uvc thus from a biofilm prevention perspective higher uvc intensities would be required to counterbalance the increased baseline growth rates accompanying more optimal growth environments thus the induction of faster growth rate under fixed uv intensity caused bacterial accretion to rise exponentially presumably this was a result of greater protection provided by bacterial depositions and active biofilm growth as the growth rate outpaced the uvc inactivation rate the surviving bacterial cells were able to establish biofilms which along with the bacterial exudates acted as shields against uvc irradiation and protected new bacterial cells we note that a portion of the observed sbv on the surfaces might have been attributed to a greater degree of bacterial growth in the injection ports upstream from the irradiated flow channel sloughing of the extraneous biofilms into the growth chamber may therefore have affected the results furthermore although biofilm growth in the injection ports which was discussed in our previous effort torkzadeh et al 2021 occurred at all temperatures in this work it was elevated at higher temperatures which may have intensified the release of bacterial cells into the bulk water nonetheless the contribution of increased upstream bacterial cell release was found to be insignificant as the effect of temperature on downstream biofilm growth in the flow cells at higher uvc intensities low biofilm coverage was negligible moreover in real applications upstream biofilms would have similar effects on surfaces in the irradiation zone s 3 2 biofilm intensity response and model parameters biofilm clsm images were analyzed for sbv with results shown in fig 2 the inhibitory effect of uvc irradiation was observed at all temperatures at higher uvc intensities 50 µw cm2 the effect of growth temperature on sbv was more subtle a result of prohibitively slow growth rates under higher irradiation intensities conversely the effect of temperature on biofilm coverage and thus growth rate was more prominent at lower irradiation intensities in order to determine how the baseline growth rates impacted uvc intensity response we employed the biofilm uvc intensity response model that was developed in our previous effort 1 x f x 0 e x p μ 0 t 1 α λ i where xf is the final sbv µm under uvc irradiation with the intensity of i µw cm2 x0 is the initial residual biovolume µm αλ is the biofilm intensity response factor cm2 µw and µ0 is the specific growth rate constant in the absence of uvc irradiation h 1 the model presented in eq 1 was fitted to the sbv experimental data with the fits shown in fig 2 the values of model parameters including x0 αλ µ0 and nagelkerke pseudo r2 for each temperature was calculated and listed in table 1 the data in our previous work as well as those herein exhibited biofilm intensity response curves that flattened at higher intensities and never achieved zero biovolume coverage making the discernment of minimum preventative intensity less meaningful thus the parameter i5 which was defined as uvc intensity that results in sbv that is 5 of that observed on control dark surfaces grown under the same conditions was used as the primary metric of biofilm uvc intensity response torkzadeh et al 2021 with respect to the intensity response model eq 1 i5 may be illustrated as follows 2 x f x 0 0 05 e x p μ 0 t 1 α λ i 5 fig 3 a depicts the temperature dependence of baseline specific growth rate constants as expected and discussed earlier the specific growth rate constant without uvc irradiation µ0 exponentially increased as temperature rose consequently a higher rate of uvc inactivation governed by uvc intensity was required to offset the increased growth rate this resulted in a similar upward trend for i5 versus µ0 illustrated in fig 3b the exponential correlation between µ0 and i5 observed in fig 3b further confirms the shielding effect discussed earlier as an increase in µ0 results in a disproportionate upsurge in i5 in other words based on eq 2 when other parameters are constant adjustment of µ0 affects i5 in a linear fashion unless another parameter is changing due to a phenomenon other than the competition between growth and inactivation rate the observed nonlinearity was likely due to a shielding effect during biofilm growth the most affirmative evidence for a shielding effect is seen in fig 3c wherein the biofilm uvc intensity response factor αλ was lower when µ0 was greater αλ is affected by parameters that may impact the intensity and biocidal nature of the photons received by bacterial cells such as water transmittance and wavelength it is also impacted by the type of microorganism as uvc action spectra vary between organisms of the variables above transmittance of uvc to the attached organisms is the only one which could have varied during the experiments and likely did so as a result attenuating materials entering and accumulating in the flow cell followed by additional attenuation from biofilm materials synthesized in place such protection and shielding by biofilm complex assembly provided by extracellular polymeric substances have been observed in previous studies argyraki et al 2016a bak et al 2009 having the correlation between µ0 and i5 developed a predictive biofilm inhibition model similar to inactivation models for planktonic bacteria may be pursued in future work the ultimate predictive model should account for more environmentally relevant growth conditions as different environmental conditions may impact αλ differently for instance herein temperature served as the regulator for the baseline growth rate while parameters such as nutrient availability could play a similar role however its impact on αλ may differ from that of temperature as it may alter the water uvc transmittance and biofilm extracellular polymeric substance yield and composition diaz villanueva et al 2011 myszka and czaczyk 2009 pinel et al 2021 3 3 long term trends in biofilm uvc intensity response e coli atcc25922gfp biofilms were grown at 25 c and under continuous uvc irradiation with intensities of 0 24 75 and 102 3 µw cm2 throughout 288 h growth periods biofilm clsm images were taken at 24 48 96 192 288 h after the start of experiments frequent biofilm analysis throughout the 288 h of growth irradiation required the use of a non destructive method of analysis since phototoxicity of fluorescent dyes used in the previous experiments could affect growth rates therefore e coli atcc25922gfp derived from e coli atcc25922 was chosen due to the stability of gfp fluorophores negligible photodamage under 488 nm laser excitation and ease of expression dobrucki et al 2007 march et al 2003 furthermore since it was derived from the same strain used in short experiments its response to 254 nm irradiation is likely to be similar to the parent strain the uvc intensities used 24 75 and 102 3 µw cm2 were selected to be significantly greater than and significantly less than the previously determined value of i5 for e coli atcc25922 at 25 c i5 50 57 µw cm2 thereby revealing differences between long term efficacy and the shorter experiments discussed above fig 4 a c depict clsm images of biofilms green fluorescing cells grown for 24 h under uvc irradiation intensities of 0 24 75 and 102 3 µw cm2 respectively as expected density of biofilm coverage was significantly higher in the control chamber fig 4a compared to that of irradiated chambers fig 4b and c however after 288 h of growth fig 4d f under the same intensities there were significant clusters of green fluorescing cells present even when irradiated at the highest uvc intensity employed in this study unlike the results from 24 h of growth the biovolume at 288 h under irradiation did not resemble deposited discrete cells but rather larger isolated patches of biofilm structures this observation raises doubt about the long term efficacy of continuous uvc irradiation as the sole intervention for complete biofilm prevention it should again be noted that due to the biocidal mechanism of uvc inactivated cells may still have shown green fluorescence in these experiments and thus the analyzes could not distinguish or exclude all inactivated cells we speculate that most of the discrete cells observed in fig 4b c 24 h were inactivated since they had minimal protection from irradiation whereas a greater fraction of live cells was likely present in the biofilm structures observed at 288 h fig 4e f fig 5 shows the associated kinetic data of biofilm sbv grown over the period of 288 h under continuous uvc irradiation although growth was significantly inhibited under both uvc intensities over the first 48 h surface biovolume eventually emerged and grew over the first 48 h the rates of colloidal deposition were presumably similar for both intensities as the same feed solution and setup was employed this is consistent with breakthrough of growth occurring around the same time in both cases after the breakthrough the slope of biofilm growth was substantially higher under lower uvc intensity owing to the bacterial inactivation being outcompeted by the bacterial growth rate arising from the synthesis of more shielding substances this observation further supports the hypothesis of uvc attenuation by deposited colloidal material resulting in reduced intensity response for reference an intensity of 102 3 µw cm2 is capable of reducing the viability of planktonic e coli atcc25922 whose uvc dose response was previously determined by 7 5 log in less than 5 min torkzadeh et al 2021 combined with our data herein such a value implies a drastic difference in uvc response between planktonic cells in the bulk water and cells which have attached to the surface in the context of biofilm prevention adsorption of bacterial exudates and colloidal material to the glass attenuates the uvc photons and provides the opportunity for the proliferation of bacterial cells underneath moreover the higher the intensity was the more slowly the shielding effect intensified these data suggest that despite slower biofilm growth under high intensities biofilms might inevitably be able to colonize even directly irradiated surfaces under realistic conditions in water conduits finally interpretation of these results within the context of opportunistic pathogen deterrence warrants certain caveats despite possible biofilm establishment even under relatively high uvc intensities mitigation of biofilm intercalated pathogens by uvc irradiation may still be worthy of consideration since biofilms grown on irradiated surfaces may harbor fewer pathogens due to their higher uvc sensitivity for instance planktonic legionella was reduced by 4 5 2 logs by a dose of 5 6 mj cm2 cervero aragó et al 2014 schmid et al 2017 moreover in the same study cervero aragó et al 2014 found that legionella hosted by amoebae underwent 4 log inactivation after receiving a dose of 8 7 10 8 mj cm2 the planktonic form of the e coli strain used in this study requires a dose of approximately 14 mj cm2 for 4 log inactivation torkzadeh et al 2021 thus the primary goal of mitigating opportunistic pathogens with continuous uvc irradiation may still be achievable and requires further investigation 4 conclusion more favorable growth conditions temperatures diminished the ability of continuous uvc irradiation to prevent biofilm establishment on submerged test surfaces trends relating to the effects of baseline biofilm growth rates on the parameters of a previously developed intensity response model were established continuous uvc irradiation as the sole intervention for biofilm prevention on fouling prone surfaces is likely to be ineffective in many real applications over the long term as a breakthrough of biofilm growth was found to occur even at relatively high intensities the observed reduction in biofilm inhibitory effect of uvc was attributed to the deposition of biological colloids from upstream of the flow cell and their

16556,biofilms can harbor a wide range of microorganisms including opportunistic respiratory pathogens and their establishment on engineered surfaces poses a risk to public health and industry the emergence of compact germicidal ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds may enable their incorporation into confined spaces to inhibit bacterial surface colonization on inaccessible surfaces such as those in premise plumbing such applications necessitate knowledge of the quantitative response of biofilm growth rates to uv exposure on continuously irradiated surfaces herein we performed experiments at varying flow cell temperatures in order to control baseline biofilm growth rates in the absence of uv then biofilm growth was compared under the same conditions but with simultaneous uvc irradiation the inhibiting effect of uv irradiation on biofilm growth kinetics was diminished by more favorable growth conditions higher temperature increasing the temperature by 10 c resulted in an increase in biovolume by 193 under a uvc 254 nm intensity of 60 µw cm2 we further fitted an existing intensity response model to the biofilm growth data and analyzed the effects of temperature on model parameters which were consistent with a hypothesized shielding effect arising from the deposition of extracellular colloidal materials the shielding effect was found to result in breakthrough behavior of irradiated biofilms after 48 h wherein accumulation of shielding substances eventually enabled biofilm establishment at even relatively high irradiation intensities 102 3 µw cm2 with respect to applications of uvc irradiation for biofilm prevention these results imply that surfaces more prone to bacterial colonization require disproportionately higher intensity uvc irradiation for prevention of biofilm establishment and continuous surface irradiation may be inadequate as a sole intervention for biofilm prevention in many scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract

available hall stoodley et al 2004 sweet et al 2011 biofilms have the potential to host a diverse range of microorganisms and promote their proliferation and spread for instance biofilms in drinking water distribution systems act as environmental reservoirs for waterborne opportunistic bacterial pathogens which are responsible for an increasing number of life threatening pulmonary infections in developed countries berry et al 2006 falkinham et al 2015 storey et al 2004 furthermore the prevention of biofilms in engineered systems with inaccessible wetted interior surfaces remains a challenge

argyraki et al 2016b ben said et al 2011 cates and torkzadeh 2020 linden et al 2019 torkzadeh et al 2021 traditionally its use has been limited mainly to conventional one pass uvc disinfection reactors which may act as indirect measures of biofilm control reducing the burden of planktonic microorganisms to downstream surfaces lakretz et al 2011 2010 sperle et al 2020 however as with the incapability of municipal scale disinfection in averting biofilm establishment in drinking water distribution systems point of entry disinfection systems are similarly unable to prevent biofilm formation on downstream plumbing components thus fixtures that incorporate uvc sources and prevent biofilm growth at the point of dispensing and simultaneously acting as a one pass uvc reactor may offer a more effective barrier against opportunistic pathogens with the advancement of increasingly efficient and compact uvc leds the use of uvc irradiation as a direct in situ measure for biofilm

composition diaz villanueva et al 2011 myszka and czaczyk 2009 pinel et al 2021 3 3 long term trends in biofilm uvc intensity response e coli atcc25922gfp biofilms were grown at 25 c and under continuous uvc irradiation with intensities of 0 24 75 and 102 3 µw cm2 throughout 288 h growth periods biofilm clsm images were taken at 24 48 96 192 288 h after the start of experiments frequent biofilm analysis throughout the 288 h of growth irradiation required the use of a non destructive method of analysis since phototoxicity of fluorescent dyes used in the previous experiments could affect growth rates therefore e coli atcc25922gfp derived from e coli atcc25922 was chosen due to the stability of gfp fluorophores negligible photodamage under 488 nm laser excitation and ease of expression dobrucki et al 2007 march et al 2003 furthermore since it was derived from the same strain used in short experiments its response to 254 nm irradiation is likely to be similar to the parent strain the uvc intensities used 24 75 and 102 3 µw cm2 were selected to be significantly greater than and significantly less than the previously determined value of i5 for e coli atcc25922 at 25 c i5 50 57 µw cm2 thereby revealing differences between long term efficacy and the shorter experiments discussed above fig 4 a c depict clsm images of biofilms green fluorescing cells grown for 24 h under uvc irradiation intensities of 0 24 75 and 102 3 µw cm2 respectively as expected density of biofilm coverage was significantly higher in the control chamber fig 4a compared to that of irradiated chambers fig 4b and c however after 288 h of growth fig 4d f under the same intensities there were significant clusters of green fluorescing cells present even when irradiated at the highest uvc intensity employed in this study unlike the results from 24 h of growth the biovolume at 288 h under irradiation did not resemble deposited discrete cells but rather larger isolated patches of biofilm structures this observation raises doubt about the long term efficacy of continuous uvc irradiation as the sole intervention for complete biofilm prevention it should again be noted that due to the biocidal mechanism of uvc inactivated cells may still have shown green fluorescence in these experiments and thus the analyzes could not distinguish or exclude all inactivated cells we speculate that most of the discrete cells observed in fig 4b c 24 h were inactivated since they had minimal protection from irradiation whereas a greater fraction of live cells was likely present in the biofilm structures observed at 288 h fig 4e f fig 5 shows the associated kinetic data of biofilm sbv grown over the period of 288 h under continuous uvc irradiation although growth was significantly inhibited under both uvc intensities over the first 48 h surface biovolume eventually emerged and grew over the first 48 h the rates of colloidal deposition were presumably similar for both intensities as the same feed solution and setup was employed this is consistent with breakthrough of growth occurring around the same time in both cases after the breakthrough the slope of biofilm growth was substantially higher under lower uvc intensity owing to the bacterial inactivation being outcompeted by the bacterial growth rate arising from the synthesis of more shielding substances this observation further supports the hypothesis of uvc attenuation by deposited colloidal material resulting in reduced intensity response for reference an intensity of 102 3 µw cm2 is capable of reducing the viability of planktonic e coli atcc25922 whose uvc dose response was previously determined by 7 5 log in less than 5 min torkzadeh et al 2021 combined with our data herein such a value implies a drastic difference in uvc response between planktonic cells in the bulk water and cells which have attached to the surface in the context of biofilm prevention adsorption of bacterial exudates and colloidal material to the glass attenuates the uvc photons and provides the opportunity for the proliferation of bacterial cells underneath moreover the higher the intensity was the more slowly the shielding effect intensified these data suggest that despite slower biofilm growth under high intensities biofilms might inevitably be able to colonize even directly irradiated surfaces under realistic conditions in water conduits finally interpretation of these results within the context of opportunistic pathogen deterrence warrants certain caveats despite possible biofilm establishment even under relatively high uvc intensities mitigation of biofilm intercalated pathogens by uvc irradiation may still be worthy of consideration since biofilms grown on irradiated surfaces may harbor fewer pathogens due to their higher uvc sensitivity for instance planktonic legionella was reduced by 4 5 2 logs by a dose of 5 6 mj cm2 cervero aragó et al 2014 schmid et al 2017 moreover in the same study cervero aragó et al 2014 found that legionella hosted by amoebae underwent 4 log inactivation after receiving a dose of 8 7 10 8 mj cm2 the planktonic form of the e coli strain used in this study requires a dose of approximately 14 mj cm2 for 4 log inactivation torkzadeh et al 2021 thus the primary goal of mitigating opportunistic pathogens with continuous uvc irradiation may still be achievable and requires further investigation 4 conclusion more favorable growth conditions temperatures diminished the ability of continuous uvc irradiation to prevent biofilm establishment on submerged test surfaces trends relating to the effects of baseline biofilm growth rates on the parameters of a previously developed intensity response model were established continuous uvc irradiation as the sole intervention for biofilm prevention on fouling prone surfaces is likely to be ineffective in many real applications over the long term as a breakthrough of biofilm growth was found to occur even at relatively high intensities the observed reduction in biofilm inhibitory effect of uvc was attributed to the deposition of biological colloids from upstream of the flow cell and their

16557,the use of nanobubbles nbs has gained significant attention in various applications e g aeration in biological water treatment water disinfection membrane defouling and ground water and sediment remediation in recent decades because of their superior characteristics such as the improved mass transfer at the gas liquid interfaces their lifetime up to a couple of weeks the formation of reactive oxygen species ros with high oxidative potential however there is a lack of information about the effect of various factors on the stability of nbs for a long storage period under freshwater conditions in this study a comprehensive investigation was conducted to systematically examine the stability of oxygen nbs in water under various conditions which are closely related to a typical freshwater or the drinking water treatment the oxygen nb stability in water was evaluated by monitoring the change in the bubble concentrations size distribution average diameter and zeta potential for 60 days of storage time under different ph hardness ionic strength natural organic matter nom chlorine and temperature conditions in addition the formation of hydroxyl radical oh was investigated using disodium terephthalate which form fluorescent adducts with oh in the presence of oxygen nbs among the parameters investigated the impacts of cations low ph and high suva254 nom on the stability of oxygen nbs were more significant than other conditions the half lives of oxygen nbs under various conditions follow the order ca2 na ph 3 high suva254 nom ph 5 30 c oxygen nbs were more stable in softwater than hardwater oxygen nbs were relatively stable for 3 days regardless of ph for a longer storage period oxygen nbs disappeared faster at ph 3 than at high ph high suva254 nom destabilized nbs more than low suva254 nom indicating the impact of hydrophobicity on the nb stability the temperature effect on the nb stability was negligible for a short storage time while higher temperature destabilized oxygen nbs for a longer storage time one of the main disappearance pathway of oxygen nbs in water was found to be coalescing rising and leaving the container which would be promoted greatly by cations low ph and nom with high aromaticity the formation of hydroxyl radical in nb solutions was detected at ph 3 by a florescent probe molecule when oxygen nbs are released in water bodies high calcium high suva254 nom and low ph would significantly reduce the availability of nbs and their residence time in freshwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxygen nanobubbles ph hardness specific uv absorbance suva254 at 254 nm temperature hydroxyl radical 1 introduction nanobubbles nbs are spherical packages of gas within liquid and are operationally defined as having diameters less than 1000 nm though typically the average size is around 100 nm atkinson et al 2019 superior characteristics of nbs e g improving the mass transfer in the gas liquid interface being stable up to a couple of weeks and forming reactive oxygen species ros with high oxidative potential have been suggested to promise great potential for addressing a variety of challenges in water treatment in recent decades atkinson et al 2019 various lab scale studies have tested their potential for aeration in biological water treatment water disinfection membrane defouling and ground water and sediment remediation these studies aimed to downsize facilities and reduce operational time and maintenance costs of water treatment plants while achieving greater contaminant removal efficiency agarwal et al 2011 hewa et al 2019 rosa and rubio 2018 hu and xia 2018 the nb technology has also been examined in many other sectors such as agriculture wu et al 2019 medical science hayakumo et al 2014 lukianova hleb et al 2014 yin et al 2012 and pollution remediation zhu et al 2016 although nbs are attracting significant attention due to their unique physiochemical characteristics their existence and stability have been questioned since the pressure inside a bubble is higher than the outside liquid pressure due to surface tension such excess pressure which is called laplace pressure can be expressed as 2σ r where σ is surface tension and r is a bubble radius a bubble with r 100 nm surface tension 72 mn m and atmospheric pressure in the surrounding water 105 n m2 would give an internal pressure of 1 5 mpa attard 2013 millero 2001 thus such a bubble is supposed to be immediately dissolving into the surrounding liquid with a driving force between the gas interface and the liquid interface nevertheless the existence of nbs has been reported in various experimental observations and a lifetime of nbs have been reported to be days to months liu et al 2013 ohgaki et al 2010 ushikubo et al 2010 duval et al 2012 nirmalkar et al 2018 the stability of nbs has often been attributed to a high negative zeta potential meegoda et al 2018 hewage et al 2021 several studies revealed that the negative surface charge on nbs is most likely due to the preferential adsorption of hydroxide ions and thus nbs are more stable at higher ph hamamoto et al 2018 wang et al 2020 a number of speculative interpretations have been postulated but either complete physical model or convincing theory on nb stability has yet to emerge the most distinguishing property of nbs is their unusually long lifetime nbs once formed are highly persistent zimmerman et al 2011 and stable for hours lou et al 2000 days liu et al 2013 ohgaki et al 2010 ushikubo et al 2010 and even months duval et al 2012 nirmalkar et al 2018 monitoring nb suspensions over long periods of time showed that the mean bubble diameter and zeta potential remined approximately unchanged but the bubble number density gradually decreased with time on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations weijs et al 2012 had reported earlier that diffusive shielding stabilizes bulk nanobubble clusters more recently nirmalkar et al 2018 suggested the following three possible mechanisms by which nanobubbles can disappear i if their surface charge is neutralized ii if they come in contact with the hydrophilic surface of the glass storage vial and iii if they interact with the free surface of the suspension today the impacts of a number freshwater background parameters such as ph temperature ionic strength hardness and the presence of oxidants salts and natural organic matter nom on the stability of nbs are still largely unknown tyrrell and attard 2002 reported that bubble size increases as ph decreases and vice versa and discrete nature of the bubbles is enhanced as a result of the increase in surface charge and corresponding repulsion between neighboring sites at high ph nbs may also stabilize themselves through ionic shielding and diffusive shielding for instance ohgaki et al 2010 showed that the interface of nbs consists of hard hydrogen bonds that can markedly reduce the diffusivity of gas from the nbs although some pieces of information are available in literature as summarized in table s1 a consensus has not yet been reached and information about the impacts of the solution environment on the stability of nbs for a long storage period under typical freshwater conditions remains elusive this is partially because of lack of analytical techniques to measure nb concentrations accurately in freshwaters or other natural waters due to the interferences from background particles the main objective of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive investigation to systematically examine the stability of oxygen nbs in water under various conditions which are closely related to a typical freshwater or the drinking water treatment e g soft water vs hard water low specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 vs high suva254 water ph temperature ionic strength and the presence of an oxidant understanding the impact of water chemistry conditions on the stability of nbs is critical for development of different applications in aquatic systems the nb stability was evaluated by monitoring the change in the bubble concentrations and size distribution including average diameter and zeta potential with time in addition the formation of hydroxyl radical oh was investigated using disodium terephthalate which form fluorescent adducts with oh in the presence of oxygen nbs under the selected conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 nb generation and storage for 60 days under various conditions oxygen nbs were generated in distilled and deionized ddi water using a commercially available nb generator nano bubble technologies nbt sydney australia ultra high purity oxygen 99 994 was used as the gas source for preparing oxygen nanobubbles at 4 l min of oxygen gas flowrate for 60 psi gas pressure after 90 min of nb generation nb samples were transferred into 40 ml amber glass vials with no headspace we examined if container materials affect the nb stability since nirmalkar et al 2018 have reported that nbs could collapse if they come in contact with the hydrophilic surface of the glass storage vial however no significant difference was observed in the nb concentrations stored in amber glass vials and polypropylene tubes data not shown the initial oxygen nb concentration and dissolved oxygen do concentration were 1 0 108 particles ml and 42 9 mg l respectively do concentration was measured by placing the probe of a dissolved oxygen meter thermo scientific orion 5 star directly into the samples the vials were stored at room temperature except for the temperature effect experiments the initial ph of the nb samples was 6 5 after 1 3 7 14 21 28 35 42 and 60 days the vials were opened and the stability of nbs were monitored by measuring nb concentrations and size distributions along with do levels zeta potential ph uv absorbance at 254 nm and dissolved organic carbon concentration doc to examine ph effect the solution ph was adjusted in the vials at 3 5 6 5 and 9 with hcl and naoh no buffer used to test the effect of aromaticity of nom on the nb stability two nom extracts which were available in our laboratory for a previous study song et al 2009 were used at 5 mg doc l 1 7 l mg m for low suva254 and 4 1 l mg m for high suva254 suva254 which is the ratio of uva254 to doc can be used to estimate the percentage of aromatic carbon content of nom it is also an indicator of aromaticity and chemical reactivity for aquatic organic matter samples from a wide range of water sources karanfil et al 2002 for the cation and ionic strength effects 9 mm cacl2 or nacl was added to the nb samples hardness was created by adding cacl2 to achieve 300 mg l as caco3 lastly for the temperature effect samples were stored at 10 20 and 30 c nb stability was also examined in the presence of chlorine a commonly used oxidant during water treatment all samples and blanks controls were prepared and analyzed in triplicates or duplicates and the average values were presented overall our approach in this study was to create the key components of fresh waters by systematically controlling them in ddi and examining the change in nb levels and characteristics in water 2 2 measurement of nb concentrations and zeta potentials the concentration mean and mode size and size distribution of oxygen nbs were measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis nta instrument nanosight ns300 malvern uk nirmalkar et al 2018 jadhav and barigou 2020 the nanosight instrument works with particle concentrations in the range of 107 109 particles ml which is approximately 20 100 particles in the field of view before determining the particle size distribution of generated nbs nanosight analysis chamber was flushed with 1 2 ml of ddi water to remove any residual from the analysis chamber after the flush the syringe was carefully removed while holding the end of the injection line and 2 3 drops of ddi water were added to the injection line connector to create a water seal that is required to prevent the introduction of larger bubbles when switching between the ddi rinse syringe and the 1 ml nb sample syringe after adjusting the quick or standard measurements parameters e g number of captures 5 and duration 60 s camera level 13 16 and threshold 9 20 the measurement of nbs was started see more details in table s2 the background nano sized particle level in the ddi water ranged 1 6 to 2 0 107 particles ml the reported nb concentrations in this manuscript was adjusted by subtracting background particles concentrations and their changes over time are plotted in figure s1 five captures were taken per a sample run and the average values of these five data points were presented in this report the standard deviation of nb size and concentration for each measurement was less than 10 the zeta potential was measured to characterize the nb stability using a brookhaven 90plus particle size analyzer the fundamental zeta potential ζ was determined from electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski model or equation that depends on the viscosity permittivity and mobility of a solution at absolute temperature takahashi 2005 a 1 6 ml of nb sample taken from a vial after the designated storage time was filled into the sample cell and the zeta potential was measured after measurement parameters e g ph water type viscosity temperature run time and cycle time were properly added for each sample 10 replications were measured for the accuracy and quality with less than 5 standard error before measuring each batch of nb samples a bi zr5 standard solution with the known specific zeta potential was tested to verify the performance of the analyzer 2 3 determination of hydroxyl radicals in nb solutions disodium terephthalate tp purchased from alfa aesar 99 is barely a fluorescent probe molecule but it yields highly fluorescent adducts upon reacting with oh ishibashi et al 2000 page et al 2010 hirano et al 2016 tp was chosen because it selectively reacts with oh over specific reaction phases tp a dianion in the aqueous solution resides in the hydrophilic area and captures only oh in the bulk solution song et al 2007 it has been known that the reaction between tp and oh produces 2 hydroxyterephthalate tpoh with a percent yield of 35 and other adducts fang et al 1996 žerjav et al 2020 tpoh purchased from sigma aldrich 97 calibration curves 1 1000 nm were obtained from fluorescence spectra to determine the concentrations of tpoh formed in nb solutions more details how to determine tp and tpoh are described in si to observe the formation of oh under selected storage conditions oxygen nb solutions were in 500 ml volumetric flasks with 50 µm tp spiked at room temperature 20 c i oxygen nb alone and ph 6 5 ii nb at ph 3 adjusted with hcl and iii nb in the presence of 3 mm ca2 at ph 6 5 each solution was transferred into eight 40 ml amber glass vials without headspace and left on the bench top vials were then opened after designated storage times i e 1 3 7 14 21 28 and 35 days to measure the concentration of oxygen nb tp and tpoh uv visible spectroscopic and spectrofluorometric measurements were conducted to determine tp and tpoh respectively the decay of tp in nb solutions was measured with the uv visible optical spectra measurements using a shimadzu 1800 spectrophotometer nb samples were exited at 315 nm and the formation of tpoh was determined from the fluorescence intensity emitted at 425 nm using a shimadzu rf5301pc spectrofluorometer to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to prove the formation of oh in ddi water containing oxygen nbs using tp 3 results and discussion 3 1 disappearance of oxygen nbs in ddi water and changes of do concentration the disappearance of oxygen nbs in ddi water at room temperature and ambient ph i e ph 6 5 was linear with respect to storage time fig 1 the average of nb concentrations in independent triplicates was plotted along with standard deviation error bars overall the results showed that the change in nb concentrations remained within 10 in the triplicates do concentrations in the stored nb vials quickly decreased from 42 9 mg l of the initial supersaturation level over time fig 1 although the vials were closed tightly with caps and there was no headspace oxygen was quickly released from the system since do was supersaturated in water almost half of do escaped within 24 h and do reached its saturated level of 9 mg l in about 21 days during the entire period of storage time the ph of nb solutions remained constant hamamoto et al 2018 reported no significant change of ph during the stored periods up to 18 days but do decreased from approximately 15 mg l to 8 mg l within 7 days and remained constant for the rest which is in agreement with our observations the excess do likely escaped through the caps 3 2 effect of ph until day 3 nbs remained relatively stable regardless of ph fig 2 a the supersaturated liquid condition or high bubble density may keep a small concentration gradient between bubble interface and liquid that can enhance the stability of nbs in solutions while reducing the gas transfer rate from nbs to liquid meegoda et al 2018 ushikubo et al 2010 however oxygen nb concentrations at ph 3 and 5 started to drastically decrease from day 7 while those at ph 6 5 and 9 decreased very slowly with increasing storage time these observations were attributed to the coalescence of the nbs and their rise in the containers with increasing bubble diameter the terminal rising velocity υ of a spherical bubble can be described by the following equation park et al 2017 υ g ρ l d e 2 12 μ l where g is the gravitational acceleration ρl is the density of the liquid medium de is the volume equivalent diameter of the bubble and µl is the viscosity of the liquid medium calculated rising velocity in the unit of cm day of bubbles with different diameters at three different temperature is plotted in fig 3 the terminal rising velocity of nbs with a diameter around 100 nm is only 0 08 cm day at 20 c however if nbs coalesce and form bigger bubbles with a diameter of 300 500 nm they will begin to rise at 0 7 2 0 cm day during the rise they will likely collide further with other bubbles and grow in size and eventually bubbles would reach to the top of the 9 5 cm long vials used in the experiments and escape the lower negative zeta potential values e g 8 mv and 12 mv for day 1 respectively compared to 22 mv at ph 6 5 and 35 mv at ph 9 at ph 3 and 5 would reduce inter bubble repulsions promoting successful collisions table 1 show the changes in zeta potential of oxygen nbs during the experiments however it appears that even at ph 3 and lower zeta potential values it takes 3 4 days for nbs to reach certain size levels to begin to rise in the vials as a result there was no significant difference in observed nb concentrations at different ph for the early period of storage many previous studies revealed that nbs are more stable at high ph jin et al 2007 meegoda et al 2018 hamamoto et al 2018 wang et al 2020 for instance jin et al 2007 investigated the ph influence on the formation of stable nbs in aqueous solutions of r cyclodextrin they revealed that for a given ionic strength the nbs were more stable in alkaline solution because the adsorption of more oh ions at the gas water interface enhanced the double layer repulsion resulting in a repulsive force to prevent bubble aggregation and coalescence in agreement nbs at ph 9 were more stable than those at ph 3 which was attributed to the greater negative charge on the bubble surface moreover an increasing oh concentration at ph 9 will increase hydrogen bonds around the bubbles which can eventually increase the stability of bubbles meegoda et al 2018 this was also supported by the zeta potential at different ph over time table 1 the magnitude of zeta potential at lower ph decreased considerably with increasing time while those at ph 9 were even higher than 24 mv of the initial value the half lives of oxygen nbs in ddi water at room temperature increased as ph increased e g 12 days at ph 3 and 80 days at ph 9 table 2 it is noted that the bubble concentrations were substantially reduced over time at ph 3 while the diameter of bubbles was not shifted to the range greater than 400 nm fig 4 a c once ph adjusted at 3 the mode of nb diameter slightly moved from 90 nm to 133 nm in day 3 an increase of nbs with 286 nm diameter which will have about 0 6 cm day of rise velocity fig 3 was captured however even in day 14 no large bubble with near µm level diameter was observed these measurements suggest that oxygen nbs in ddi water coalesce grow move up very slowly and finally escape before or as soon as the vials are opened to collect samples for analysis unlike both thermodynamic and kinetic arguments that indicate instability of bulk nbs where the survival time for nano sized bubbles is predicted to be less than 0 02 s chen et al 2020 oxygen nbs in the current study lasted for more than 5 weeks even at low ph meegoda et al 2018 also found that the absolute value of zeta potential of bubbles decreased while the bubble size increased even though bubble sizes are expected to decrease with time due to gas diffusion their experimental results indicated increased bubble sizes they conclude that this is because of decrease in the absolute value of zeta potential and bubble movement due to brownian motion which may cause bubble coalescence over time to form larger bubbles to sum up the effect of ph on the oxygen nb stability was insignificant for a short storage time 3 4 days probably due to the gradual bubble growth and rise while the difference of oxygen nb concentrations at different ph became more noticeable for longer storage time 3 3 effect of nom amphiphilic nom macromolecules may interact with nb surfaces through hydrophobic interactions or adhesion and affect the stability of nbs e g by imparting negative charge to nbs and thus increasing their overall surface potentials sugano et al 2017 after nom added to the nb samples the magnitude of zeta potential slightly increased from 24 mv to 27 mv and 25 mv with low and high suva254 nom respectively and then decreased with increasing storage time table 1 nom with low suva254 1 7 l mg m did not significantly affect the oxygen nb concentrations fig 2b while nom with high suva254 4 1 l mg m resulted in a decrease in nb levels indicating that more hydrophobic nom with higher aromaticity reduced the oxygen nb stability in ddi water the half lives for both nbs with and without low suva254 nom in ddi water were 46 days while the nb half life in the presence of high suva254 nom dropped to 17 days table 2 one possible explanation is that hydrophobic nom forms a complex with nbs in which nom can serve as a bridge this type of aggregation of a negatively charged colloid dispersion with an anionic polymer has been reported in a destabilization study of colloids black et al 1965 a linear regression was not well fitted to the disappearance of oxygen nbs in the presence of high suva254 nom showing two apparent decay curves i e fast initially and then slow fig 2b the disappearance rate constant and half life for nbs in the presence of high suva254 nom were determined using the initial fast decay it is also noteworthy that by day 21 approximately 60 of oxygen nbs disappeared from both ph adjusted at 5 and high suva254 nom added nb samples but their zeta potentials were very different from each other i e 5 mv and 22 mv respectively table 1 this indicates that different mechanisms have been involved in nb interactions in these systems as discussed above although the change of zeta potential is closely related to the stability of nbs a simple comparison of zeta potential values cannot predict how much nbs would disappear from a system over time which was also observed by hamamoto et al 2018 like the case of ph 3 the bubble concentrations in the presence of high suva254 4 1 l mg m nom at 5 mg doc l during the storage period were substantially reduced over time while the diameter of bubbles was not shifted to the larger range fig 4d f the mode of nb diameter did not change probably because zeta potential did not change significantly compared to the control with no nom added 3 4 effect of ionic strength hardness and charge of cation negatively charged surface potentials of nbs can be affected by positively charged neighbor ions nb stability decreased with increasing ionic strength fig 2c at 9 mm ionic strength in ddi water oxygen nb concentrations decreased immediately unlike the cases of low ph and high suva254 nom in which nbs were relatively stable for initial 3 days of storage this observation is likely due to difference in the cation concentration which would greatly affect the behavior of negatively charged nbs the concentration of cationic species h in ddi water at ph 3 was only 1 mm which is less than the concentrations of na or ca2 the higher ionic strength clearly led to the faster disappearance of oxygen nbs compared to the ddi control in terms of the effect of cationic charge on the nb stability ca2 a divalent cation destabilized oxygen nbs more than na a monovalent cation the magnitude of zeta potential of nbs was reduced more by ca2 than na table 1 indicating that charge density of cation affects the nb stability it has been known that the high valency cations have the potential to neutralize or completely reverse the bubble charge hewage et al 2021 these results show that nbs are more stable in soft waters than hard waters the zeta potential reduction by ca2 was much faster than that by na table 1 like the case of ph 3 the mode of nb diameter slightly moved from 90 nm to 140 nm upon adding ca2 and a spike around 510 nm was observed fig 4g probably because of an abrupt change in zeta potentials caused by ca2 we further investigated the bubble size distributions in the presence of ca2 every 10 min within a very short i e 60 min period of storage time the pure oxygen nb solution always showed the mode of the bubble diameter at around 90 nm but the concentration of this sized nb started decreasing immediately after adding ca2 the mode of bubble size shifted to the right about 10 nm larger in every 10 min and the concentrations of bubbles with diameter ranging 200 400 nm increased figure s2 indicating that ca2 promotes oxygen nbs coalescing these results also show that the main disappearance pathway of the oxygen nbs in ddi water is merging to be slightly larger bubbles rising and leaving the containers again a linear regression was not well fitted to the disappearance of oxygen nbs in the presence of cations fig 2c the disappearance rate constant and half life for nbs in the presence of na or ca2 were determined using the initial fast decay the calculated half lives of nbs in the presence of na and ca2 were 5 days and 3 days respectively table 2 the oxygen nbs in ddi water decreased below the detection limit after 35 42 days of storage 3 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the oxygen nb stability was insignificant for a short storage time fig 2d this is probably because of the effect of temperature in the range of 10 30 c on the rise velocity of small sized bubbles e g bubbles with 100 400 nm range diameter is relatively small fig 3 the temperature effect would be more significant as the bubble size becomes larger there was no significant difference among oxygen nb concentrations of the samples stored at three different temperature until day 14 while the oxygen nbs were more stable at lower temperature from day 21 the zeta potentials of nb solutions stored at 10 c and 20 c were almost constant for 60 days while the zeta potential gradually reduced at 30 c from 24 mv to 17 mv table 1 the half lives of oxygen nbs decreased from 77 days at 10 c to 30 days at 30 c table 2 at higher temperature nbs would have more chances to encounter neighbor bubbles collide or coalesce and become larger bubbles which may move up and eventually escape from the vials 3 6 effect of combined hardness and nom the change of nb concentrations was further investigated under a mixed water chemistry condition which represents a hard freshwater fig 2e in the presence of both high suva254 4 1 l mg m nom at 5 mg doc l and 3 mm ca2 as caco3 nbs in ddi water started to disappear rapidly at ph 6 5 and no nbs were observed after 7 days while the disappearance rates for both combined and ca2 alone conditions were very close for individual applications high suva254 nom showed less impacts on the oxygen nb stability than ca2 however when they were combined high suva254 nom made an additional contribution to a complete depletion of nbs in ddi water therefore the results show that oxygen nbs in water with higher hardness and hydrophobic nom will start to coalesce and escape rapidly from water to atmosphere 3 7 effect of chlorine to examine the impact of oxidant presence on the nb stability a set of nb samples was spiked with 2 mg l chlorine which prepared by diluting a 5 naocl solution and the concentration of nbs were monitored the oxygen nb stability was not affected by the presence of chlorine in ddi water fig 2f although there was unintendedly a low level i e 0 038 mm of cationic species na which may facilitate the disappearance of oxygen nbs the overall disappearance of oxygen nbs was almost identical with that of the control without chlorine this is probably because of increasing ph up to ph 7 8 by added chlorine which would cancel out the na effect on the nb stability when they are combined therefore no real effect can be observed 3 8 hydroxyl radical formation in oxygen nb solutions nbs have been shown to generate ros including oh superoxide anion radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 during nb collapse atkinson et al 2019 minamikawa et al 2015 liu et al 2016 showed using a sensitive fluorescent probe 3 p aminophenyl fluorescein that without any stimuli such as h2o2 metals etc nb water continually produced ros the collapse of nbs was used to explain the formation of free radicals characterized by electron spin resonance esr spectra minamikawa et al 2015 to examine the formation and presence of oh in oxygen nb solutions two extreme conditions i e ph 3 and 3 mm ca2 where nbs disappeared more rapidly than the other storage conditions were selected and compared to the ph 6 5 condition fang et al 1996 reported that the hydroxylation reaction in oxygen containing solutions has an efficiency of 35 during 35 days of the storage period approximately 20 and 50 of tp 50 µm of initial concentration in oxygen nb solutions was degraded at ph 6 5 and ph 3 respectively table s2 in the presence of ca2 about 40 of tp decayed after the same period however the formation of tpoh was not corresponding to the decay of tp only 1 9 nm of tpoh in oxygen nb solutions was observed at ph 6 5 and the formation of tpoh in the presence of ca2 was even lower fig 5 at ph 3 up to 28 nm of tpoh formed as a result of the hydroxylation reaction these major differences between degraded tp and formed tpoh concentrations indicate that collapsed oxygen nbs produce not only oh but also other ros which were not chased in this study in addition tpoh is not a single product from the hydroxylation of tp and tpoh can further react with ros such as oh o2 and 1o2 if radicals are still available in the vials a complete quantitative analysis of oh therefore was unable using just tp as a probe molecule because of various possible reaction pathways which were not monitored in this study nevertheless the formation of oh during the storage of oxygen nbs in ddi water was confirmed by the formation of tpoh unlike ph 3 condition ca2 is likely to create more complicated chemistry in oxygen nb solutions although the fastest disappearance of nbs occurred in the presence of ca2 among all storage conditions investigated the formation of tpoh was insignificant this is probably because nb collapse is greatly inhibited by a rapid reduction in the magnitude of zeta potentials in the presence of ca2 table 1 such a sudden change of zeta potential may not allow nb collapse to form oh tp may also form a coordination complex with ca2 byler et al 1989 if such complex reacts with oh its hydroxylation product cannot be detected as readily as tpoh another explanation is that oh can be scavenged immediately by cl 6 mm which co exists with ca2 in the nb solutions liao et al 2001 grebel et al 2010 4 conclusions the stability of oxygen nbs was investigated under various ph nom cation hardness and temperature conditions for 60 days calcium was the most influential parameter significantly decreasing nb levels among all parameters investigated in the presence of cations i e ca2 na and h the half lives of nbs in the solution were in the order of ca2 na h oxygen nbs were more stable in softr than hard water oxygen nbs were relatively stable for 3 days regardless of ph due to very slow rise velocity 1 cm day of coalesced bubbles with their diameter around 200 300 nm however nbs disappeared more rapidly at acidic than basic ph as storage time increased the formation of hydroxyl radical at ph 3 was also observed high suva254 nom destabilized nbs more than low suva254 nom indicating the impact of hydrophobicity on the nb stability the temperature effect on the nb stability was negligible for a short storage time while the effect of higher temperature 30 c has become more apparent for a longer storage time different mechanisms coalescence and collapse play role in the nb disappearance at the neutral ph in freshwaters the results obtained in this study suggest that coalescence growth of bubble size and rise is the most important mechanism while at ph 3 nb collapse also contribute to the disappearance of oxygen nbs from water when nbs are released in water bodies high calcium high suva254 nom and low ph would significantly reduce the availability of nbs and their residence time in freshwater since such parameters can promote nb coalescing therefore the location and depth of bubble release in the treatment systems can also influence nb concentrations and residence time in natural waters furthermore the results show the importance of conducting nb studies at the environmentally relevant water chemistry conditions as studies conducted in pure water matrix e g ddi water would not be able to predict the behavior of nbs in freshwaters because cations and nom which are commonly present in natural waters greatly affect the nb fate and reactions in

16557,the use of nanobubbles nbs has gained significant attention in various applications e g aeration in biological water treatment water disinfection membrane defouling and ground water and sediment remediation in recent decades because of their superior characteristics such as the improved mass transfer at the gas liquid interfaces their lifetime up to a couple of weeks the formation of reactive oxygen species ros with high oxidative potential however there is a lack of information about the effect of various factors on the stability of nbs for a long storage period under freshwater conditions in this study a comprehensive investigation was conducted to systematically examine the stability of oxygen nbs in water under various conditions which are closely related to a typical freshwater or the drinking water treatment the oxygen nb stability in water was evaluated by monitoring the change in the bubble concentrations size distribution average diameter and zeta potential for 60 days of storage time under different ph hardness ionic strength natural organic matter nom chlorine and temperature conditions in addition the formation of hydroxyl radical oh was investigated using disodium terephthalate which form fluorescent adducts with oh in the presence of oxygen nbs among the parameters investigated the impacts of cations low ph and high suva254 nom on the stability of oxygen nbs were more significant than other conditions the half lives of oxygen nbs under various conditions follow the order ca2 na ph 3 high suva254 nom ph 5 30 c oxygen nbs were more stable in softwater than hardwater oxygen nbs were relatively stable for 3 days regardless of ph for a longer storage period oxygen nbs disappeared faster at ph 3 than at high ph high suva254 nom destabilized nbs more than low suva254 nom indicating the impact of hydrophobicity on the nb stability the temperature effect on the nb stability was negligible for a short storage time while higher temperature destabilized oxygen nbs for a longer storage time one of the main disappearance pathway of oxygen nbs in water was found to be coalescing rising and leaving the container which would be promoted greatly by cations low ph and nom with high aromaticity the formation of hydroxyl radical in nb solutions was detected at ph 3 by a florescent probe molecule when oxygen nbs are released in water bodies high calcium high suva254 nom and low ph would significantly reduce the availability of nbs and their residence time in freshwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxygen nanobubbles ph hardness specific uv absorbance suva254 at 254 nm temperature hydroxyl radical 1 introduction nanobubbles nbs are spherical packages of gas within liquid and are operationally defined as having diameters less than 1000 nm though typically the average size is around 100 nm atkinson et al 2019 superior characteristics of nbs e g improving the mass transfer in the gas liquid interface being stable up to a couple of weeks and forming reactive oxygen species ros with high oxidative potential have been suggested to promise great potential for addressing a variety of challenges in water treatment in recent decades atkinson et al 2019 various lab scale studies have tested their potential for aeration in biological water treatment water disinfection membrane defouling and ground water and sediment remediation these studies aimed to downsize facilities and reduce operational time and maintenance costs of water treatment plants while achieving greater contaminant removal efficiency agarwal et al 2011 hewa et al 2019 rosa and rubio 2018 hu and xia 2018 the nb technology has also been examined in many other sectors such as agriculture wu et al 2019 medical science hayakumo et al 2014 lukianova hleb et al 2014 yin et al 2012 and pollution remediation zhu et al 2016 although nbs are attracting significant attention due to their unique physiochemical characteristics their existence and stability have been questioned since the pressure inside a bubble is higher than the outside liquid pressure due to surface tension such excess pressure which is called laplace pressure can be expressed as 2σ r where σ is surface tension and r is a bubble radius a bubble with r 100 nm surface tension 72 mn m and atmospheric pressure in the surrounding water 105 n m2 would give an internal pressure of 1 5 mpa attard 2013 millero 2001 thus such a bubble is supposed to be immediately dissolving into the surrounding liquid with a driving force between the gas interface and the liquid interface nevertheless the existence of nbs has been reported in various experimental observations and a lifetime of nbs have been reported to be days to months liu et al 2013 ohgaki et al 2010 ushikubo et al 2010 duval et al 2012 nirmalkar et al 2018 the stability of nbs has often been attributed to a high negative zeta potential meegoda et al 2018 hewage et al 2021 several studies revealed that the negative surface charge on nbs is most likely due to the preferential adsorption of hydroxide ions and thus nbs are more stable at higher ph hamamoto et al 2018 wang et al 2020 a number of speculative interpretations have been postulated but either complete physical model or convincing theory on nb stability has yet to emerge the most distinguishing property of nbs is their unusually long lifetime nbs once formed are highly persistent zimmerman et al 2011 and stable for hours lou et al 2000 days liu et al 2013 ohgaki et al 2010 ushikubo et al 2010 and even months duval et al 2012 nirmalkar et al 2018 monitoring nb suspensions over long periods of time showed that the mean bubble diameter and zeta potential remined approximately unchanged but the bubble number density gradually decreased with time on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations weijs et al 2012 had reported earlier that diffusive shielding stabilizes bulk nanobubble clusters more recently nirmalkar et al 2018 suggested the following three possible mechanisms by which nanobubbles can disappear i if their surface charge is neutralized ii if they come in contact with the hydrophilic surface of the glass storage vial and iii if they interact with the free surface of the suspension today the impacts of a number freshwater background parameters such as ph temperature ionic strength hardness and the presence of oxidants salts and natural organic matter nom on the stability of nbs are still largely unknown tyrrell and attard 2002 reported that bubble size increases as ph decreases and vice versa and discrete nature of the bubbles is enhanced as a result of the increase in surface charge and corresponding repulsion between neighboring sites at high ph nbs may also stabilize themselves through ionic shielding and diffusive shielding for instance ohgaki et al 2010 showed that the interface of nbs consists of hard hydrogen bonds that can markedly reduce the diffusivity of gas from the nbs although some pieces of information are available in literature as summarized in table s1 a consensus has not yet been reached and information about the impacts of the solution environment on the stability of nbs for a long storage period under typical freshwater conditions remains elusive this is partially because of lack of analytical techniques to measure nb concentrations accurately in freshwaters or other natural waters due to the interferences from background particles the main objective of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive investigation to systematically examine the stability of oxygen nbs in water under various conditions which are closely related to a typical freshwater or the drinking water treatment e g soft water vs hard water low specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 vs high suva254 water ph temperature ionic strength and the presence of an oxidant understanding the impact of water chemistry conditions on the stability of nbs is critical for development of different applications in aquatic systems the nb stability was evaluated by monitoring the change in the bubble concentrations and size distribution including average diameter and zeta potential with time in addition the formation of hydroxyl radical oh was investigated using disodium terephthalate which form fluorescent adducts with oh in the presence of oxygen nbs under the selected conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 nb generation and storage for 60 days under various conditions oxygen nbs were generated in distilled and deionized ddi water using a commercially available nb generator nano bubble technologies nbt sydney australia ultra high purity oxygen 99 994 was used as the gas source for preparing oxygen nanobubbles at 4 l min of oxygen gas flowrate for 60 psi gas pressure after 90 min of nb generation nb samples were transferred into 40 ml amber glass vials with no headspace we examined if container materials affect the nb stability since nirmalkar et al 2018 have reported that nbs could collapse if they come in contact with the hydrophilic surface of the glass storage vial however no significant difference was observed in the nb concentrations stored in amber glass vials and polypropylene tubes data not shown the initial oxygen nb concentration and dissolved oxygen do concentration were 1 0 108 particles ml and 42 9 mg l respectively do concentration was measured by placing the probe of a dissolved oxygen meter thermo scientific orion 5 star directly into the samples the vials were stored at room temperature except for the temperature effect experiments the initial ph of the nb samples was 6 5 after 1 3 7 14 21 28 35 42 and 60 days the vials were opened and the stability of nbs were monitored by measuring nb concentrations and size distributions along with do levels zeta potential ph uv absorbance at 254 nm and dissolved organic carbon concentration doc to examine ph effect the solution ph was adjusted in the vials at 3 5 6 5 and 9 with hcl and naoh no buffer used to test the effect of aromaticity of nom on the nb stability two nom extracts which were available in our laboratory for a previous study song et al 2009 were used at 5 mg doc l 1 7 l mg m for low suva254 and 4 1 l mg m for high suva254 suva254 which is the ratio of uva254 to doc can be used to estimate the percentage of aromatic carbon content of nom it is also an indicator of aromaticity and chemical reactivity for aquatic organic matter samples from a wide range of water sources karanfil et al 2002 for the cation and ionic strength effects 9 mm cacl2 or nacl was added to the nb samples hardness was created by adding cacl2 to achieve 300 mg l as caco3 lastly for the temperature effect samples were stored at 10 20 and 30 c nb stability was also examined in the presence of chlorine a commonly used oxidant during water treatment all samples and blanks controls were prepared and analyzed in triplicates or duplicates and the average values were presented overall our approach in this study was to create the key components of fresh waters by systematically controlling them in ddi and examining the change in nb levels and characteristics in water 2 2 measurement of nb concentrations and zeta potentials the concentration mean and mode size and size distribution of oxygen nbs were measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis nta instrument nanosight ns300 malvern uk nirmalkar et al 2018 jadhav and barigou 2020 the nanosight instrument works with particle concentrations in the range of 107 109 particles ml which is approximately 20 100 particles in the field of view before determining the particle size distribution of generated nbs nanosight analysis chamber was flushed with 1 2 ml of ddi water to remove any residual from the analysis chamber after the flush the syringe was carefully removed while holding the end of the injection line and 2 3 drops of ddi water were added to the injection line connector to create a water seal that is required to prevent the introduction of larger bubbles when switching between the ddi rinse syringe and the 1 ml nb sample syringe after adjusting the quick or standard measurements parameters e g number of captures 5 and duration 60 s camera level 13 16 and threshold 9 20 the measurement of nbs was started see more details in table s2 the background nano sized particle level in the ddi water ranged 1 6 to 2 0 107 particles ml the reported nb concentrations in this manuscript was adjusted by subtracting background particles concentrations and their changes over time are plotted in figure s1 five captures were taken per a sample run and the average values of these five data points were presented in this report the standard deviation of nb size and concentration for each measurement was less than 10 the zeta potential was measured to characterize the nb stability using a brookhaven 90plus particle size analyzer the fundamental zeta potential ζ was determined from electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski model or equation that depends on the viscosity permittivity and mobility of a solution at absolute temperature takahashi 2005 a 1 6 ml of nb sample taken from a vial after the designated storage time was filled into the sample cell and the zeta potential was measured after measurement parameters e g ph water type viscosity temperature run time and cycle time were properly added for each sample 10 replications were measured for the accuracy and quality with less than 5 standard error before measuring each batch of nb samples a bi zr5 standard solution with the known specific zeta potential was tested to verify the performance of the analyzer 2 3 determination of hydroxyl radicals in nb solutions disodium terephthalate tp purchased from alfa aesar 99 is barely a fluorescent probe molecule but it yields highly fluorescent adducts upon reacting with oh ishibashi et al 2000 page et al 2010 hirano et al 2016 tp was chosen because it selectively reacts with oh over specific reaction phases tp a dianion in the aqueous solution resides in the hydrophilic area and captures only oh in the bulk solution song et al 2007 it has been known that the reaction between tp and oh produces 2 hydroxyterephthalate tpoh with a percent yield of 35 and other adducts fang et al 1996 žerjav et al 2020 tpoh purchased from sigma aldrich 97 calibration curves 1 1000 nm were obtained from fluorescence spectra to determine the concentrations of tpoh formed in nb solutions more details how to determine tp and tpoh are described in si to observe the formation of oh under selected storage conditions oxygen nb solutions were in 500 ml volumetric flasks with 50 µm tp spiked at room temperature 20 c i oxygen nb alone and ph 6 5 ii nb at ph 3 adjusted with hcl and iii nb in the presence of 3 mm ca2 at ph 6 5 each solution was transferred into eight 40 ml amber glass vials without headspace and left on the bench top vials were then opened after designated storage times i e 1 3 7 14 21 28 and 35 days to measure the concentration of oxygen nb tp and tpoh uv visible spectroscopic and spectrofluorometric measurements were conducted to determine tp and tpoh respectively the decay of tp in nb solutions was measured with the uv visible optical spectra measurements using a shimadzu 1800 spectrophotometer nb samples were exited at 315 nm and the formation of tpoh was determined from the fluorescence intensity emitted at 425 nm using a shimadzu rf5301pc spectrofluorometer to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to prove the formation of oh in ddi water containing oxygen nbs using tp 3 results and discussion 3 1 disappearance of oxygen nbs in ddi water and changes of do concentration the disappearance of oxygen nbs in ddi water at room temperature and ambient ph i e ph 6 5 was linear with respect to storage time fig 1 the average of nb concentrations in independent triplicates was plotted along with standard deviation error bars overall the results showed that the change in nb concentrations remained within 10 in the triplicates do concentrations in the stored nb vials quickly decreased from 42 9 mg l of the initial supersaturation level over time fig 1 although the vials were closed tightly with caps and there was no headspace oxygen was quickly released from the system since do was supersaturated in water almost half of do escaped within 24 h and do reached its saturated level of 9 mg l in about 21 days during the entire period of storage time the ph of nb solutions remained constant hamamoto et al 2018 reported no significant change of ph during the stored periods up to 18 days but do decreased from approximately 15 mg l to 8 mg l within 7 days and remained constant for the rest which is in agreement with our observations the excess do likely escaped through the caps 3 2 effect of ph until day 3 nbs remained relatively stable regardless of ph fig 2 a the supersaturated liquid condition or high bubble density may keep a small concentration gradient between bubble interface and liquid that can enhance the stability of nbs in solutions while reducing the gas transfer rate from nbs to liquid meegoda et al 2018 ushikubo et al 2010 however oxygen nb concentrations at ph 3 and 5 started to drastically decrease from day 7 while those at ph 6 5 and 9 decreased very slowly with increasing storage time these observations were attributed to the coalescence of the nbs and their rise in the containers with increasing bubble diameter the terminal rising velocity υ of a spherical bubble can be described by the following equation park et al 2017 υ g ρ l d e 2 12 μ l where g is the gravitational acceleration ρl is the density of the liquid medium de is the volume equivalent diameter of the bubble and µl is the viscosity of the liquid medium calculated rising velocity in the unit of cm day of bubbles with different diameters at three different temperature is plotted in fig 3 the terminal rising velocity of nbs with a diameter around 100 nm is only 0 08 cm day at 20 c however if nbs coalesce and form bigger bubbles with a diameter of 300 500 nm they will begin to rise at 0 7 2 0 cm day during the rise they will likely collide further with other bubbles and grow in size and eventually bubbles would reach to the top of the 9 5 cm long vials used in the experiments and escape the lower negative zeta potential values e g 8 mv and 12 mv for day 1 respectively compared to 22 mv at ph 6 5 and 35 mv at ph 9 at ph 3 and 5 would reduce inter bubble repulsions promoting successful collisions table 1 show the changes in zeta potential of oxygen nbs during the experiments however it appears that even at ph 3 and lower zeta potential values it takes 3 4 days for nbs to reach certain size levels to begin to rise in the vials as a result there was no significant difference in observed nb concentrations at different ph for the early period of storage many previous studies revealed that nbs are more stable at high ph jin et al 2007 meegoda et al 2018 hamamoto et al 2018 wang et al 2020 for instance jin et al 2007 investigated the ph influence on the formation of stable nbs in aqueous solutions of r cyclodextrin they revealed that for a given ionic strength the nbs were more stable in alkaline solution because the adsorption of more oh ions at the gas water interface enhanced the double layer repulsion resulting in a repulsive force to prevent bubble aggregation and coalescence in agreement nbs at ph 9 were more stable than those at ph 3 which was attributed to the greater negative charge on the bubble surface moreover an increasing oh concentration at ph 9 will increase hydrogen bonds around the bubbles which can eventually increase the stability of bubbles meegoda et al 2018 this was also supported by the zeta potential at different ph over time table 1 the magnitude of zeta potential at lower ph decreased considerably with increasing time while those at ph 9 were even higher than 24 mv of the initial value the half lives of oxygen nbs in ddi water at room temperature increased as ph increased e g 12 days at ph 3 and 80 days at ph 9 table 2 it is noted that the bubble concentrations were substantially reduced over time at ph 3 while the diameter of bubbles was not shifted to the range greater than 400 nm fig 4 a c once ph adjusted at 3 the mode of nb diameter slightly moved from 90 nm to 133 nm in day 3 an increase of nbs with 286 nm diameter which will have about 0 6 cm day of rise velocity fig 3 was captured however even in day 14 no large bubble with near µm level diameter was observed these measurements suggest that oxygen nbs in ddi water coalesce grow move up very slowly and finally escape before or as soon as the vials are opened to collect samples for analysis unlike both thermodynamic and kinetic arguments that indicate instability of bulk nbs where the survival time for nano sized bubbles is predicted to be less than 0 02 s chen et al 2020 oxygen nbs in the current study lasted for more than 5 weeks even at low ph meegoda et al 2018 also found that the absolute value of zeta potential of bubbles decreased while the bubble size increased even though bubble sizes are expected to decrease with time due to gas diffusion their experimental results indicated increased bubble sizes they conclude that this is because of decrease in the absolute value of zeta potential and bubble movement due to brownian motion which may cause bubble coalescence over time to form larger bubbles to sum up the effect of ph on the oxygen nb stability was insignificant for a short storage time 3 4 days probably due to the gradual bubble growth and rise while the difference of oxygen nb concentrations at different ph became more noticeable for longer storage time 3 3 effect of nom amphiphilic nom macromolecules may interact with nb surfaces through hydrophobic interactions or adhesion and affect the stability of nbs e g by imparting negative charge to nbs and thus increasing their overall surface potentials sugano et al 2017 after nom added to the nb samples the magnitude of zeta potential slightly increased from 24 mv to 27 mv and 25 mv with low and high suva254 nom respectively and then decreased with increasing storage time table 1 nom with low suva254 1 7 l mg m did not significantly affect the oxygen nb concentrations fig 2b while nom with high suva254 4 1 l mg m resulted in a decrease in nb levels indicating that more hydrophobic nom with higher aromaticity reduced the oxygen nb stability in ddi water the half lives for both nbs with and without low suva254 nom in ddi water were 46 days while the nb half life in the presence of high suva254 nom dropped to 17 days table 2 one possible explanation is that hydrophobic nom forms a complex with nbs in which nom can serve as a bridge this type of aggregation of a negatively charged colloid dispersion with an anionic polymer has been reported in a destabilization study of colloids black et al 1965 a linear regression was not well fitted to the disappearance of oxygen nbs in the presence of high suva254 nom showing two apparent decay curves i e fast initially and then slow fig 2b the disappearance rate constant and half life for nbs in the presence of high suva254 nom were determined using the initial fast decay it is also noteworthy that by day 21 approximately 60 of oxygen nbs disappeared from both ph adjusted at 5 and high suva254 nom added nb samples but their zeta potentials were very different from each other i e 5 mv and 22 mv respectively table 1 this indicates that different mechanisms have been involved in nb interactions in these systems as discussed above although the change of zeta potential is closely related to the stability of nbs a simple comparison of zeta potential values cannot predict how much nbs would disappear from a system over time which was also observed by hamamoto et al 2018 like the case of ph 3 the bubble concentrations in the presence of high suva254 4 1 l mg m nom at 5 mg doc l during the storage period were substantially reduced over time while the diameter of bubbles was not shifted to the larger range fig 4d f the mode of nb diameter did not change probably because zeta potential did not change significantly compared to the control with no nom added 3 4 effect of ionic strength hardness and charge of cation negatively charged surface potentials of nbs can be affected by positively charged neighbor ions nb stability decreased with increasing ionic strength fig 2c at 9 mm ionic strength in ddi water oxygen nb concentrations decreased immediately unlike the cases of low ph and high suva254 nom in which nbs were relatively stable for initial 3 days of storage this observation is likely due to difference in the cation concentration which would greatly affect the behavior of negatively charged nbs the concentration of cationic species h in ddi water at ph 3 was only 1 mm which is less than the concentrations of na or ca2 the higher ionic strength clearly led to the faster disappearance of oxygen nbs compared to the ddi control in terms of the effect of cationic charge on the nb stability ca2 a divalent cation destabilized oxygen nbs more than na a monovalent cation the magnitude of zeta potential of nbs was reduced more by ca2 than na table 1 indicating that charge density of cation affects the nb stability it has been known that the high valency cations have the potential to neutralize or completely reverse the bubble charge hewage et al 2021 these results show that nbs are more stable in soft waters than hard waters the zeta potential reduction by ca2 was much faster than that by na table 1 like the case of ph 3 the mode of nb diameter slightly moved from 90 nm to 140 nm upon adding ca2 and a spike around 510 nm was observed fig 4g probably because of an abrupt change in zeta potentials caused by ca2 we further investigated the bubble size distributions in the presence of ca2 every 10 min within a very short i e 60 min period of storage time the pure oxygen nb solution always showed the mode of the bubble diameter at around 90 nm but the concentration of this sized nb started decreasing immediately after adding ca2 the mode of bubble size shifted to the right about 10 nm larger in every 10 min and the concentrations of bubbles with diameter ranging 200 400 nm increased figure s2 indicating that ca2 promotes oxygen nbs coalescing these results also show that the main disappearance pathway of the oxygen nbs in ddi water is merging to be slightly larger bubbles rising and leaving the containers again a linear regression was not well fitted to the disappearance of oxygen nbs in the presence of cations fig 2c the disappearance rate constant and half life for nbs in the presence of na or ca2 were determined using the initial fast decay the calculated half lives of nbs in the presence of na and ca2 were 5 days and 3 days respectively table 2 the oxygen nbs in ddi water decreased below the detection limit after 35 42 days of storage 3 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the oxygen nb stability was insignificant for a short storage time fig 2d this is probably because of the effect of temperature in the range of 10 30 c on the rise velocity of small sized bubbles e g bubbles with 100 400 nm range diameter is relatively small fig 3 the temperature effect would be more significant as the bubble size becomes larger there was no significant difference among oxygen nb concentrations of the samples stored at three different temperature until day 14 while the oxygen nbs were more stable at lower temperature from day 21 the zeta potentials of nb solutions stored at 10 c and 20 c were almost constant for 60 days while the zeta potential gradually reduced at 30 c from 24 mv to 17 mv table 1 the half lives of oxygen nbs decreased from 77 days at 10 c to 30 days at 30 c table 2 at higher temperature nbs would have more chances to encounter neighbor bubbles collide or coalesce and become larger bubbles which may move up and eventually escape from the vials 3 6 effect of combined hardness and nom the change of nb concentrations was further investigated under a mixed water chemistry condition which represents a hard freshwater fig 2e in the presence of both high suva254 4 1 l mg m nom at 5 mg doc l and 3 mm ca2 as caco3 nbs in ddi water started to disappear rapidly at ph 6 5 and no nbs were observed after 7 days while the disappearance rates for both combined and ca2 alone conditions were very close for individual applications high suva254 nom showed less impacts on the oxygen nb stability than ca2 however when they were combined high suva254 nom made an additional contribution to a complete depletion of nbs in ddi water therefore the results show that oxygen nbs in water with higher hardness and hydrophobic nom will start to coalesce and escape rapidly from water to atmosphere 3 7 effect of chlorine to examine the impact of oxidant presence on the nb stability a set of nb samples was spiked with 2 mg l chlorine which prepared by diluting a 5 naocl solution and the concentration of nbs were monitored the oxygen nb stability was not affected by the presence of chlorine in ddi water fig 2f although there was unintendedly a low level i e 0 038 mm of cationic species na which may facilitate the disappearance of oxygen nbs the overall disappearance of oxygen nbs was almost identical with that of the control without chlorine this is probably because of increasing ph up to ph 7 8 by added chlorine which would cancel out the na effect on the nb stability when they are combined therefore no real effect can be observed 3 8 hydroxyl radical formation in oxygen nb solutions nbs have been shown to generate ros including oh superoxide anion radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 during nb collapse atkinson et al 2019 minamikawa et al 2015 liu et al 2016 showed using a sensitive fluorescent probe 3 p aminophenyl fluorescein that without any stimuli such as h2o2 metals etc nb water continually produced ros the collapse of nbs was used to explain the formation of free radicals characterized by electron spin resonance esr spectra minamikawa et al 2015 to examine the formation and presence of oh in oxygen nb solutions two extreme conditions i e ph 3 and 3 mm ca2 where nbs disappeared more rapidly than the other storage conditions were selected and compared to the ph 6 5 condition fang et al 1996 reported that the hydroxylation reaction in oxygen containing solutions has an efficiency of 35 during 35 days of the storage period approximately 20 and 50 of tp 50 µm of initial concentration in oxygen nb solutions was degraded at ph 6 5 and ph 3 respectively table s2 in the presence of ca2 about 40 of tp decayed after the same period however the formation of tpoh was not corresponding to the decay of tp only 1 9 nm of tpoh in oxygen nb solutions was observed at ph 6 5 and the formation of tpoh in the presence of ca2 was even lower fig 5 at ph 3 up to 28 nm of tpoh formed as a result of the hydroxylation reaction these major differences between degraded tp and formed tpoh concentrations indicate that collapsed oxygen nbs produce not only oh but also other ros which were not chased in this study in addition tpoh is not a single product from the hydroxylation of tp and tpoh can further react with ros such as oh o2 and 1o2 if radicals are still available in the vials a complete quantitative analysis of oh therefore was unable using just tp as a probe molecule because of various possible reaction pathways which were not monitored in this study nevertheless the formation of oh during the storage of oxygen nbs in ddi water was confirmed by the formation of tpoh unlike ph 3 condition ca2 is likely to create more complicated chemistry in oxygen nb solutions although the fastest disappearance of nbs occurred in the presence of ca2 among all storage conditions investigated the formation of tpoh was insignificant this is probably because nb collapse is greatly inhibited by a rapid reduction in the magnitude of zeta potentials in the presence of ca2 table 1 such a sudden change of zeta potential may not allow nb collapse to form oh tp may also form a coordination complex with ca2 byler et al 1989 if such complex reacts with oh its hydroxylation product cannot be detected as readily as tpoh another explanation is that oh can be scavenged immediately by cl 6 mm which co exists with ca2 in the nb solutions liao et al 2001 grebel et al 2010 4 conclusions the stability of oxygen nbs was investigated under various ph nom cation hardness and temperature conditions for 60 days calcium was the most influential parameter significantly decreasing nb levels among all parameters investigated in the presence of cations i e ca2 na and h the half lives of nbs in the solution were in the order of ca2 na h oxygen nbs were more stable in softr than hard water oxygen nbs were relatively stable for 3 days regardless of ph due to very slow rise velocity 1 cm day of coalesced bubbles with their diameter around 200 300 nm however nbs disappeared more rapidly at acidic than basic ph as storage time increased the formation of hydroxyl radical at ph 3 was also observed high suva254 nom destabilized nbs more than low suva254 nom indicating the impact of hydrophobicity on the nb stability the temperature effect on the nb stability was negligible for a short storage time while the effect of higher temperature 30 c has become more apparent for a longer storage time different mechanisms coalescence and collapse play role in the nb disappearance at the neutral ph in freshwaters the results obtained in this study suggest that coalescence growth of bubble size and rise is the most important mechanism while at ph 3 nb collapse also contribute to the disappearance of oxygen nbs from water when nbs are released in water bodies high calcium high suva254 nom and low ph would significantly reduce the availability of nbs and their residence time in freshwater since such parameters can promote nb coalescing therefore the location and depth of bubble release in the treatment systems can also influence nb concentrations and residence time in natural waters furthermore the results show the importance of conducting nb studies at the environmentally relevant water chemistry conditions as studies conducted in pure water matrix e g ddi water would not be able to predict the behavior of nbs in freshwaters because cations and nom which are commonly present in natural waters greatly affect the nb fate and reactions in

16558,the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process is an autotrophic nitrogen removal process with great potential as a cost effective and highly efficient technology in the wastewater treatment field the main challenges yet to be overcome in this new frontier technology are operating at lower temperatures and achieving a high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency in this study an up flow expanded bed reactor with hydroxyapatite hap anammox granules was operated for more than 200 days at 7 c the nitrogen loading rate nlr was improved from 1 0 g n l d to 3 6 g n l d together with a high level nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 92 which is the highest to date at extremely low temperatures in a continuous experiment candidatus kuenenia was revealed to be the only dominant anammox genus

advanced and been used in engineering applications in recent years lackner et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 the advantages of no demand for oxygen and organic carbon addition are among the anammox process which converts nitrite and ammonium to nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria strous et al 1999 however a strong temperature dependency 20 to 30 c a notoriously long doubling time 10 to 25 days and instability of operation have been hindering the implementation of the anammox process hendrickx et al 2014 jin et al 2012 laureni et al 2016 reino et al 2018 as the operating temperature is one of the most critical factors numerous studies have been mainly focusing on the selective impact of low temperatures on the anammox community and responses of anammox activity to the cold it has been firmly acknowledged that anammox activity decreases significantly when lowering the temperature hendrickx et al 2012 in one study it was reported that the anammox activity sharply dropped as the temperature was decreased from 15 c to 11 c and was barely detectable after being operated at 11 c for a month laureni et al 2016b even so there is evidence that anammox reaction does proceed under low temperatures differences in the system response to the temperature reduction were reported gilbert et al 2015 these discrepancies resulted from one or more of the following 1 the amount of the anammox biomass 2 the state of biomass with either suspended or attached sludge 3 the species of anammox bacteria and 4 operating modes such as the direct or stepwise decrease of temperatures a sufficient biomass retention time could compensate for the loss in anammox activity caused by low temperatures in a number of studies it has been shown that a lower temperature was not necessarily a problem for the anammox process as long as there was sufficient biomass hendrickx et al 2012 vlaeminck et al 2010 moreover in the pn a system operated at 12 5 c evolution from a suspended growth inoculum to a hybrid system with suspended flocs and wall attached biofilms strongly indicated the potential advantages of using biofilm based technology for applications of the anammox process laureni et al 2015 it has been further suggested that granulation is one of the best approaches to increase bacterial quantity and retention due to the aggregation tendency of anammox bacteria jin et al 2012 lin et al 2013 tang et al 2011 however the long term exposure at low temperatures such as 10 c li et al 2020 and 12 5 c laureni et al 2015 not only resulted in the considerable inhibition of sludge activity but also granular disintegration the causes for this phenomenon remain unclear and it is probably due to the integrated effects of low temperatures laureni et al 2019 wang et al 2019 it has been shown that granules with low strength are easily broken to pieces by shear force and are more likely to be washed out significantly decreasing the biomass concentration and deteriorating the performance lin et al 2013 ma et al 2020 therefore the strength of granular sludge is essential to maintain to mitigate or prevent disintegration especially at low temperatures instead of pure granular anammox sludge a new concept of hap anammox granules combining anammox and phosphorus recovery was proposed lin et al 2019 ma et al 2020 it has been demonstrated that hap anammox granules with high inorganic precipitants remarkably enhanced the mechanical properties of granules ma et al 2020 in our previous studies an average 83 7 tn removal efficiency at nlr of 20 g n l d was realized using hap anammox granules at 25 c ma et al 2020 the feasibility of operating the hap anammox granules at extremely low temperatures has yet to be demonstrated in addition in early studies the focus of attention was on the simultaneous nitrogen phosphorus removal performance and not the potential advantages of the architecture of hap anammox granules it has been reported that species specific responses to temperature do finally regulate the community consortia however with different dominant strains gilbert et al 2015 hendrickx et al 2014 meng et al 2019 osaka et al 2012 indeed other factors involving the quality of wastewater e g nitrogen concentration biodegradable matters and other inhibitors and distinctness of the inoculum are also responsible for the selection of the dominant genera resulting in the overlapping effects on the population shift laureni et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore selected cold adapted anammox bacteria might only be applicable to a certain wastewater and the corresponding analysis of anammox bacteria may not accurately reveal the natural cryophylactic property of anammox species based on the remaining challenges and the research gap discussed above in this study mature hap anammox granules were used and the temperature was set at 7 c no other study in the literature has considered the anammox process in continuous experiments at such a low temperature in continuous experiments the capacity of nitrogen removal performance was explored through long term observation the architectural evolution of the hap anammox granules was monitored the temperature dependency and the apparent activation energy were demonstrated for cold adapted anammox sludge since candidatus kuenenia was identified as the only anammox genre the results were considered a reliable indicator of the cryophylactic property of candidatus kuenenia 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation a lab scale up flow expanded bed reactor effective volume 5 l diameter 94 mm with a gas liquid solid separator was established for the hap anammox granular sludge culture fig 1 the cooling system consisted of a water jacket and a recirculation cooling system the water jacket was filled with continuous recycling of cold antifreeze liquid using a cooling circulator the recirculation tube was extended and merged in the cold antifreeze liquid bath with a cooler temperatures of the cooling circulator and antifreeze liquid bath were adjusted to keep the temperature in the reactor around 7 c the detailed configuration of the cooling system was presented in fig s1 the temperature of the reactor was monitored by a thermometer placed in the middle of the reactor and was recorded every two days the temperature record is provided in fig 2 based on the investigation of the minimum temperature distribution of wastewater treatment plants 2000 in japan the minimum temperature of 7 c is a critical point and the proportion of temperatures below 7 c is less than 2 therefore 7 c was selected as the testing temperature the temperature of the reactor was under 15 c for 200 days before decreased to 7 c the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater consisting of nh4 n and no2 n in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 the other components of the synthetic wastewater included the following g l nahco3 0 5 kh2po4 0 057 cacl2 0 57 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 feso4 7h2o 0 00714 and na2edta 0 00714 as well as the trace elements referred to by ma et al ma et al 2020 2 2 analysis of water quality the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the influent and effluent were measured using agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis ce system agilent technologies wilmington usa the ph was tested using a ph meter toa hm 30v 2 3 sludge characterization sludge samples were taken from the middle

coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent technologies wilmington usa 2 4 16s rrna gene sequencing the sludge samples including hap anammox granules and peeling biofilms were collected on day 230 and restored at 20 c before the sequencing procedure the analysis of 16s rrna was conducted at bioengineering lab co ltd two replicates were used to assure the accuracy of the analysis and relative abundance was the average value of the two replicates a library for miseq sequencing was prepared through a two step pcr using a primer set of 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r

according to a 97 similarity using an open reference otu picking against the 16s database silva 132 the sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi database prjna761484 the plateaus of the rarefaction curves indicated that the sequencing depth was qualified and dominant species in the community had been captured fig s2 2 5 specific anammox activity saa tests specific anammox activity at different

three replicates with standard deviation serum flasks with a total volume of 120 ml and liquid phase volume of 100 ml were used for batch assays details of the procedure of saa can be found in an earlier study ma et al 2019 the initial tn concentration was 200 mg n l and the composition of other elements was the same as the influent in this study rmax was simulated by the modified gompertz equation as eq 1 the saa is calculated by rmax divided by the inoculated biomass amount eq 2 1 p p 0 exp exp r max e p 0 λ t 1 2 saa r max vs s batch where p is the cumulative nitrogen production ml

reaction r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the thermodynamic temperature ma et al 2019 2 6 scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray micro computed tomography xmct for sem observation the biomass was immobilized in a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution dehydrated in graded water ethanol solutions then lyophilized and sputter coated with gold before observation guo and li 2020 an x ray scan of the dehydrated anammox biomass preserved in 100 ethanol was taken by micro computed tomography micro ct scanxmate d160tss105 11000 a voltage of 90 kv and the current of 120 μa were applied and scans were performed over 360 degrees with 1500 projections the tomographic images were reconstructed with conctexpress v 1 76 white rabbit co ltd 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of nitrogen removal 3 1 1 high capacity of nitrogen removal nrr representing the absolute capacity of nitrogen removal should be lowered to avoid overloading when the temperature is lower the effects of temperatures on saa were able to be predicted using the arrhenius equation hao et al 2002 ma et al 2019 reino et al 2018 in our previous study the maximum nlr of hap anammox granules at 15 c was around 10 0 g n l d and in the saa tests only about 50 and 30 of saa remained when the temperature was decreased to 10 c and 5 c respectively ma et al 2019 based on that result the predicted maximum nlr at 7 c was in the range of 3 0 5 0 g n l d therefore an initial nlr of around 1 0 g n l d was determined to avoid overloading and to accommodate the low temperature the long term performance of nitrogen removal is shown in fig 2 the operational parameters and performance of nitrogen removal are summarized in table 1 the operational period of 230 days could be divided into three phases in phase i the total nitrogen tn concentration of the influent was kept at 250 mg n l and nlr was progressively increased to 1 5 g n l d 2 1 g n l d 3 2 g n l d and 3 6 g n l d by shortening hrt from 4 h to 1 7 h at the beginning of the each increased nlr the nitrogen removal efficiency slightly decreased then a stable nitrogen removal efficiency of 83 9 91 9 was obtained in phase ii the tn concentration of the influent was doubled to 500 mg n l and hrt was prolonged from 1 7 h to 3 5 h to keep the same nlr in the reactor however the performance of the reactor continued to decline during the week and the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n exceeded 80 mg l because the recirculation rate was also adjusted to maintain the actual tn concentration the poor effluent quality might result from up regulated variables caused by the higher proportion of recirculated effluent in the actual feeding such as alkalinity to avoid further deterioration in the following phase iii the operation condition was reverted to the same as phase i and the performance was soon recovered unlike phase i the nlr was rapidly increased and no negative impact on anammox activity was observed indicating that the hap anammox granule sludge had effectively acclimated to the low temperature the adaptation performance of anammox biomass to low temperatures has been widely studied as summarized in table 2 to resist being detrimentally affected by low temperatures it was proposed that the prerequisite was a high concentration of biomass despite that the state of biomass aggregation also showed different resistance to low temperatures with the biofilm based biomass showing better resistance and resilience than the suspended biomass up flow expanded bed reactors inoculated with hap anammox granules have been operated at different temperatures 35 c 25 c and 15 c in our previous studies with outstanding nitrogen removal performance achieved specifically at 15 c the nlr was reached 10 g n l d with a tn removal efficiency over 88 ma et al 2021 here an nlr of 3 6 g n l d together with a high level nitrogen removal efficiency 84 92 was achieved at 7 c which is the highest demonstrated nitrogen removal capacity at the lowest temperature reported for continuous experiments 3 1 2 stoichiometric variation according to the most widely acknowledged anammox stoichiometric equation proposed the molecular ratio of nitrite consumed per ammonium rs is in the range of 1 14 1 52 laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 strous et al 1999 in this study the initial rs of the influent was 1 14 and during the first 60 days of phase i the ammonium of the effluent was undetectable while the residual of nitrite gradually increased from 5 4 mg n l to 26 8 mg n l thus the rs of the influent decreased to 1 10 to avoid the accumulation of nitrite in the reactor however in an analogous way the ammonium of the effluent increased from 2 2 mg n l to 24 8 mg n l in most reports strategies were taken to immediately increase the temperature or lower nlr to avoid further inhibition by the high concentration of substrate hu et al 2013 wang et al 2019 however in this experiment the quality of the effluent could be maintained by minute adjustments to the influent rs without reducing the nlr after a long acclimation period as shown in table 1 the rs in phases ii and iii ranged from 1 20 1 30 and the average rs of the whole operation period was 1 25 which was slightly higher than the 1 23 obtained at 15 c ma et al 2021 the average molecular ratio of the produced nitrate to consumed ammonium rp was 0 21 which is similar to that obtained at 15 c using hap anammox granules ma et al 2021 in all the extremely low temperature of 7 c did not have a clear effect on rs and rp and the values obtained in this study were in good agreement with those previously reported 3 2 characterization of hap anammox granules 3 2 1 microbial community and temperature dependency in the beginning when the temperature was decreased to 7 c the mature hap anammox sludge appeared to be granular regardless of the size of the particles however planar and flexible film like structures emerged mainly located on the top of the reactor after running for 100 days microbial communities of hap anammox granules and peeling biofilms were analyzed and the differences between them were inconspicuous fig 3 at the phylum level the bacterial populations with the highest abundance were planctomycetes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi accounting for 37 0 38 0 25 8 28 7 14 5 17 1 and 13 3 16 1 of all the bacteria respectively the sources of detached biofilms or flocs and bulk environments are determinant factors for re regulating microbial communities in biofilms chen et al 2019 lotti et al 2014 consistent with this finding it is reported that detached dispersal biofilms and mature biofilms on carriers shared the community structure in the stationary anammox process chen et al 2019 indeed given the emerging biofilms were proposed as originally peeling from the hap anammox granules and the retained thickness of the biofilms details in 3 2 3 and 3 3 the forms of the biomass may have little effect on the microbial community under the steady state therefore the community structure of the peeling biofilms was expected to remain similar to the hap anammox granules reducing temperature displayed a significant influence on the microorganisms leading to a distinct microbial community meng et al 2019 discrepant dynamic patterns of microbial communities were reported in the duration of the temperature reduction mostly related to considerable fluctuations of the anammox bacteria he et al 2018 wang et al 2019 interestingly the microbial community of hap anammox biomass was approximately similar to that of the reactor operated at 15 c fig s3 suggesting the robustness of the community structure to decreasing temperature it should be noted that during the long term performance no severe deterioration occurred thanks to the appropriate set of the nlrs based on the traditional niche based theory taxon traits were strongly related to environments generally manifesting concurrent community dynamics and nitrogen removal performances meng et al 2019 thus the stable community was in good accordance with the smooth enhancement of the anammox capacity during which the balance and interdependencies among the core taxa were able to maintain it is likely that the metabolism of the entire community may have been retarded by the low temperature while conserving vitality the exceptions were the strains of a4b and xanthomonadaceae belonging to anaerolineae and gammaproteobacteria which decreased from 15 08 to 10 05 and from 7 76 to 1 23 respectively both the filamentous a4b and xanthomonadaceae families were related to granule formation rodriguez sanchez et al 2019 the reduction of a4b and xanthomonadaceae may have caused the disintegration of the hap anammox granules under the low temperature candidatus kuenenia affiliated with planctomycetes was the dominant anammox bacteria accounting for a relative abundance of 35 3 37 5 this is in agreement with another report that candidatus kuenenia was the clearly dominant anammox bacteria throughout the whole operational period when the temperature was lowered from 35 c to 15 c cheng et al 2020 li et al 2020 interestingly the same phenomenon was also described in a pn a system operated at 10 c except the dominant population was candidatus brocadia gilbert et al 2014 the commonality among the above mentioned literature is that the sludge was all biofilm based granules or moving bed biofilms with a relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria indicating better biomass retention and potentially high specific anammox activity which is regarded as a necessity to realize high capacity under low temperatures hendrickx et al 2014 wang et al 2019 although different shifts of dominant anammox bacteria when lowering temperature have been found in numerous studies impacts of other environmental changes such as substrate affinity excessive eps and multiple variables in actual wastewater cannot be ruled out wang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 it may well be that physiological evolution rather than interspecies selection was the main reason for the high nitrogen removal capacity under low temperatures cheng et al 2020 a series of saa tests were performed at different temperatures after operating 230 days at 7 c and ea correlated with the intrinsic activity of reaction was calculated by the arrhenius equation as illustrated in fig 4 the optimal temperature for cold acclimated candidatus kuenenia was 35 c and only 7 5 and 4 2 saa remained when the temperature was reduced to 10 c and 7 c respectively four out of seven genera kuenenia stuttgartiensis brocadia anammoxoglobus and jettenia enriched from sludge from wastewater treatment plants were operated at a higher temperature of 10 to 35 c the optimum temperature of these genera has been found to range from 30 c to 40 c gilbert et al 2014 strous et al 1999 marine anammox species scalindua which has an environmental temperature of 4 6 c or as low as 1 7 c in sediments could grow at the temperatures of 15 c and 23 c with the same optimum temperature of 25 30 c van de vossenberg et al 2008 indicating that the reaction mechanisms of the anammox process may naturally determine the mesophilic property for all the species regardless of the environmental temperature the ea was calculated to be 78 37 kj mol with an r2 of 0 98 which was lower than the 89 kj mol reported for candidatus kuenenia cultured at 35 c park et al 2017 and slightly higher than the 75 67 kj mol reported for hap candidatus kuenenia obtained at 15 c ma et al 2021 this difference may be due to the protective character of aggregated cultures which was shown to be able to decrease ea cheng et al 2020 the ea of hap candidatus kuenenia cultured at 35 c was only 56 38 kj mol ma et al 2021 on the other hand ea values consist of various rate determining reactions and the reaction rate of each might be affected to different levels due to temperature changes and aggregated states park et al 2017 generally the ea of hap candidatus kuenenia tended to increase along with the decreasing temperature 3 2 2 composition and settling velocity of hap anammox sludge with different sizes the sludge was taken from the middle of the reactor after 200 days of operation and the distribution of the particle sizes after wet sieving was characterized fig 5 particles larger than 2 8 mm were the most abundant accounting for around 45 v v while particles in the range of 0 5 1 0 mm accounted for around 10 sludge with medium sized particles 1 2 mm and 2 2 8 mm accounted for around 45 compared to the nascent hap anammox granules reported in an earlier study zhang et al 2016 the average particle size was from 0 59 mm to 1 16 mm at 35 c while in this study more than 90 of the sludge was larger than 1 mm at 7 c the mature hap anammox granules have performed architectural evolution which did not diminish the particles sizes in other words even though the film like structure was detached from the core they remained the same size as the original granule in the case of common granular anammox sludge detachment behavior has been frequently observed when facing kinds of shocks leading to the decrease of the particle size accompanied by wash out of the sludge li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 particularly at low temperatures it is possible that the decrease of extracellular polymeric substances eps including α polysaccharides and proteins could fail the maintenance of structure and size of the anammox granules wang et al 2019 in some studies however it has been suggested that more eps is secreted to counteract the cold temperatures allowing a better chance of survival for the whole consortium reino et al 2016 shi et al 2017 it should be noted that with or without the excessive production of eps the granules tended to disintegrate into smaller fractions under low temperatures li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 indicating that the adhesiveness of eps might be weakened and the maintenance of the framework of the granules malfunctioned to some extent the structure and the size of the curved lobate biofilm were retained and biomass with different sizes and structures both were shown to have a high settling velocity which effectively mitigated or prevented the loss of sludge as shown in table 3 the settling velocity increased along with sizes in the case of both granules and peeling biofilms in the case of particles of the same size the settling velocity of the granules was higher than that of the peeling biofilms and was around 2 times faster when the diameter was over 1 mm in the literature the highest reported value of nrr was around 70 g n l d using anammox granules and the settling velocities of granules with the diameter of 2 4 2 5 mm were in the range of 73 88 m h tang et al 2011 the settling velocity of pure anammox granules was also reported to be around 62 9 84 6 m h when operating under 15 c cheng et al 2020 peeling biofilms sized between 0 5 1 mm provided the lowest value of 81 82 m h in this study suggesting an outstanding settling property not only was the biomass retention performance remarkable but the high vss of the sludge also contributed to the high volumetric nitrogen removal capacity of the reactor as shown in table 3 in the case of hap anammox granules a larger diameter of the sludge was associated with a higher proportion of inorganic components when the size was over 1 mm indicating that the larger size did not exhibit a higher anammox activity due to the limited access of substrate as was reported by zhu et al 2018 though the same pattern was also found for peeling biofilms the vss tss was higher than that of granules of the same size especially when the size was over 2 mm with the higher vss proportion and adequate settling velocity peeling biofilms were considered to be an important factor in achieving high nitrogen removal efficiency at extremely low temperatures the composition of hap anammox granules was reported in our previous study lin et al 2019 ma et al 2020 this is the first study to report the unique characteristic of peeling biofilms of hap anammox granules the inorganic composition of peeling biofilms was similar to the granules the main elements were calcium and phosphorus with a ratio of 2 0 2 2 wt which was identified as hap by xrd analysis fig s4 therefore it can be concluded that the occurrence of phosphate crystallization in the biofilm was the main reason for the high settling velocity of peeling biofilms washout of anammox biomass was barely witnessed during the whole operational period 3 2 3 morphological observations and dimensional architecture as a non destructive technique xmct was applied to visualize the internal dimensional structure of the granular hap anammox biomass as well as the peeling biofilms as the object is scanned like it was sliced thousands of images are taken from each angle xy xz yz to produce tomographic images as called virtual slices lin et al 2013 computerized tomographic images include surface visualization fig 6 xmct a and density visualization colored fig 6 xmct b fig 7 xmct a b via xmct mineralized and soft tissues have been examined and the density of minerals can be distinguished by their brightness lin et al 2013 the bright areas in images of xmct fig 6 and fig 7 represent the minerals and the blue areas are mainly the organic matrix the results of the xmct were a set of assembling images of screenshots of the recorded videos of the xmct scan the full recorded video was in supplementary data as shown in fig 6 xmct a and b the architecture of mature hap anammox granules seemed like an irregular hierarchical globularity the mature hap anammox granules could be divided into three layers a nuclear hap core accompanied with biomass surrounding the hap core termed as hybrid hap anammox biomass and anammox biofilm indicating hap precipitation occurred not only in the center of granules but also within the organic matrix and the density pattern of hap was diameter dependent for mature hap anammox granules intensive hap particles were distributed in the biofilms which were tightly surrounding the hap core while hap particles were rather sporadically scattered in the anammox biofilm in general the density and amount of hap particles were as followed hap core of granules hybrid hap anammox biomass anammox biofilm on contrary the density of cells was the highest at the rim of the granules and reduced with the depth this three layered architecture of hap anammox granules featuring the interweaved anammox biomass and hap was established by simultaneous hap precipitation and growth of anammox biomass which was distinguished from that of anammox biofilms growing on carriers therefore as aforementioned in cold temperatures the excellent settling abilities of the peeling biofilms can be attributed to the intensive existence of hap precipitation this close knit bond ensured that even if disintegration occurred at low temperatures anammox biomass would not be easily washed out fig 6 xmct c is a cross section image at the center of a hap anammox granule the gray part indicates hap precipitation and the black part is the biomass illustrating the layered structure of hap anammox granules in fig 6 sem a an image of the surface of a hap anammox granule where bacteria were embedded in a large amount of spherular hap precipitation is shown the spherical formation of hap precipitation with a rod like shape was also observed in a reaction medium with sufficient mixing castro et al 2012 a high up flow rate and hydraulic shear force may contribute to the spherular shape of hap precipitation a cross section consisting of void inside hap core with spherular hap precipitations on the edge is shown in fig 6 sem b and c moreover those spherular hap precipitations have exhibited different sizes it is likely that the compact hap core in nature was an aggregation of self enlarging spherular hap particles since the cells of candidatus kuenenia have an average diameter of 800 nm van niftrik et al 2008 some voids with a diameter of 1 µm observed on the surface of larger spherular hap precipitations fig 6 sem d e f and inside the hap core fig 6 sem c indicate the historic possession of cells which had decayed during the maturation of the granules ma et al 2018 one proposal for this cohesive attachment is that the precipitation of hap would be favored due to the increased ph from anammox reaction the micro and macro roles of the existence of hap can be reasoned from those pieces of evidence from the aspect of the bonding relationship between a cell and a nucleus of hap the haps were acting as carriers allowing anammox cells to attach and biofilms to grow from the perspective of a single granule the skeleton of hap provided architectural support for the formation of three layered hap anammox granules since the peeling behavior of anammox biofilms has been observed under 7 c the architectural significance of hap and this tight connection between hap and anammox biomass have been further verified the peeling behavior was referred to as the separation of three layers of mature hap anammox granules which frequently occurred between the hap core and hybrid hap anammox biomass hap anammox granules with different sizes have experienced this peeling behavior fig 5 the architectures of peeling biofilms of larger sizes fig 7 xmct a and small sizes fig 7 xmct b both consisted of hybrid hap anammox biomass and anammox biofilms for large peeling biofilms multiple small hap chunks were observed in the biofilms without a distinct pattern while in small peeling biofilms although the hap core did not exist a high density of hap particles was distributed in the nuclear area it is noted that when the hap anammox biofilms were attached to the hap cores the anammox biomass was unilaterally active due to the limited availability of substrate on the hap core side however access to substrates was gained for the peeling biofilms which were encompassed with anammox biomass in fact the architecture of those peeling biofilms circumferential biomass and aggregates of multi cores was similar to hap anammox granules and could be precursors of mature hap anammox granules under appropriate hydrodynamic shear force during the maturation the distribution of hap precipitations and anammox biomass in different sizes is influenced by the phosphorus nitrogen removal rate and mass transfer further studies are required to deeply understand the process of the simultaneous formation of hap and growth of the anammox biomass in fig 7 sem a b c the much more common spherular hap particles with a diameter of 1 µm were significantly smaller than the mature hap anammox granules based on the homogeneity with respect to morphology the precipitation of hap in anammox biomass can be considered as biologically controlled mineralization sinha et al 2014 the fiber like material was observed in quantity and a net was established to immobilize the single hap particles in aggregates this fabricated structure is in good agreement with the initiation of biomineralization which was achieved by some extracellular products acting as nucleation specifically organic matrix like eps as well as cell fragments was a heterogeneous mixture stereochemically arranging the crystals sinha et al 2014 in the case of low temperatures a common hypothesis is that cryoprotective eps promoted the aggregation of the newborn hap crystals reino et al 2016 as precipitation proceeds the architecture of hap skeleton in the anammox biofilm is established the disintegration behavior of pure anammox granules or large aggregates has been reported wang et al 2019 they become progressively looser and break down into smaller fragments with likely poorer settling properties the noticeable problems were degraded architectural stability and consequent biomass loss in this study even though the disintegration occurred under long term operation under extremely low temperatures the size and thickness of peeling biofilms with sufficient settling ability were be able to maintain this can very likely be attributed to the architectural support of hap skeleton in the biofilm the thickness of the biofilm was around 200 500 µm as reported in our previous study for hap anammox granules ma et al 2020 at 7 c the thickness was the same as when cultured at 25 c in biofilm systems it was reported that anammox activity was mainly detected in the upper part 1000 µm of the biofilm with 60 to 92 of total bacteria kindaichi et al 2007 indicating that the thinner biofilm facilitated the mass transfer contributing to efficient nitrogen removal performance however the system with thinner biofilms or suspended biomass was liable to result in poorer performance with poor effluent qualities when the temperature was decreased laureni et al 2015 for instance the system with the smallest aggregate size exhibited higher residual nitrite at an earlier time at 16 c while thicker biofilms showed a much less distinct nitrite accumulation and even a reduction while the temperature was reduced further gilbert et al 2015 similarly it was reported that thicker biofilms are needed or the ammonium surface load asl to the biofilm should be decreased to maintain full n removal at lower temperatures hao et al 2002 therefore in the present study the architectural evolution did not have negative effects such as decomposition and loss of biomass on the contrary mass transfer was strengthened by the spontaneous peeling of biofilms from the hap core and meanwhile the retentive thickness of peeling biofilms still had the distinct advantages of accommodation to low temperatures 3 3 the proposed life cycle of hap anammox granules as was demonstrated in our previous study ma et al 2020 under mesophilic conditions small hap anammox granules are expected to grow to large granules due to microbial reproduction accompanied by the precipitation of hap the outer layer of the anammox biofilm became new sites for hap precipitation leading to the formation of multi core granules new granules could be formed by budding from the older granules according to the long term observation of the reactor and morphology evidence a hypothesized mechanism for the replication of hap anammox granules at extremely low temperatures was proposed fig 8 under the long term operation of 7 c the detachment of the daughter of hap anammox biomass changed from budding to peeling one of the possible reasons is the malfunction of eps eps is a basic requirement for cell aggregation since it behaves like a glue immobilizing single cells in multicellular aggregates vlaeminck et al 2010 one suggestion is that the anammox system might no longer secrete excessive eps in order to maintain basic life activities and reduce unnecessary energy consumption as the temperature was reduced li et al 2020 another possible reason is that eps was no longer produced owing to internal decay which resulted from the limitation of mass transfer of substrates under low temperatures in mature hap anammox granules it is proposed that the eps keeps the connection between the core and biofilm stable ma et al 2020 and its reduction likely induces the granular disintegration causing the separation of the hap core and anammox biofilms another possibility is that biomass surrounding the hap core may decay which was attributed to the limited access to substrates under low temperatures in the longer term as depicted by xmct from the vertical angle of the curved peeling biofilm the inner part of the curved peeling biofilm was occupied by anammox biomass and could become mature hap anammox granules under hydraulic shear force the peeled hap cores were covered by attenuated biofilms while the peeling biofilms mainly consisted of anammox biomass the re maturation of peeled hap cores and peeling biofilms depends on the speeds of the growth of anammox biomass as well as hap precipitation sludge from the bottom of the reactor largely containing hap cores could be separated for the recovery of the hap or as inoculum for other reactors attention should be paid to the balance between hap formation and anammox growth in the re maturation process 4 conclusions the high capacity of nitrogen removal with robust removal efficiency using hap anammox granules under 7 c was realized the volumetric nitrogen loading rate reached 3 6 g n l d with a high level nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 92 candidatus kuenenia was revealed to be the dominant and only anammox genre with a relative abundance of 35 3 37 5 the optimal temperature of cold cultured candidatus kuenenia was around 35 c and the apparent activation energy ea was calculated at 78 37 kj mol the architecture evolution of hap anammox granules into hap cores and peeling biofilms were characterized and the life cycle of hap anammox granules was illustrated in the granulation process a new mechanism of peeling for the detachment behavior was proposed the hap skeleton in peeling biofilms contributed to the architecture support and outstanding settling property guaranteeing

16558,the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process is an autotrophic nitrogen removal process with great potential as a cost effective and highly efficient technology in the wastewater treatment field the main challenges yet to be overcome in this new frontier technology are operating at lower temperatures and achieving a high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency in this study an up flow

advanced and been used in engineering applications in recent years lackner et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 the advantages of no demand for oxygen and organic carbon addition are among the anammox process which converts nitrite and ammonium to nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria strous et al 1999 however a strong temperature dependency 20 to 30 c a notoriously long doubling time 10 to 25 days and instability of operation have been hindering the implementation of the anammox process hendrickx et al 2014 jin et al 2012 laureni et al 2016 reino et al 2018 as the operating temperature is one of the most critical factors numerous studies have been mainly focusing on the selective impact of low temperatures on the anammox community and responses of anammox activity to the cold it has been firmly acknowledged that anammox activity decreases significantly when lowering the temperature hendrickx et al 2012 in one study it was reported that the anammox activity sharply dropped as the temperature was decreased from 15 c to 11 c and was barely detectable after being operated at 11 c for a month laureni et al 2016b even so there is evidence that anammox reaction does proceed under low temperatures differences in the system response to the temperature reduction were reported gilbert et al 2015 these discrepancies resulted from one or more of the following 1 the amount of the anammox biomass 2 the state of biomass with either suspended or attached sludge 3 the species of anammox bacteria and 4 operating modes such as the direct or stepwise decrease of temperatures a sufficient biomass retention time could compensate for the loss in anammox activity caused by low temperatures in a number of studies it has been shown that a lower temperature was not necessarily a problem for the anammox process as long as there was sufficient biomass hendrickx et al 2012 vlaeminck et al 2010 moreover in the pn a system operated at 12 5 c evolution from a suspended growth inoculum to a hybrid system with suspended flocs and wall attached biofilms strongly indicated the potential advantages of using biofilm based technology for applications of the anammox process laureni et al 2015 it has been further suggested that granulation is one of the best approaches to increase bacterial quantity and retention due to the aggregation tendency of anammox bacteria jin et al 2012 lin et al 2013 tang et al 2011 however the long term exposure at low temperatures such as 10 c li et al 2020 and 12 5 c laureni et al 2015 not only resulted in the considerable inhibition of sludge activity but also granular disintegration the causes for this phenomenon remain unclear and it is probably due to the integrated effects of low temperatures laureni et al 2019 wang et al 2019 it has been shown that granules with low strength are easily broken to pieces by shear force and are more likely to be washed out significantly decreasing the biomass concentration and deteriorating the performance lin et al 2013 ma et al 2020 therefore the strength of granular sludge is essential to maintain to mitigate or prevent disintegration especially at low temperatures instead of pure granular anammox sludge a new concept of hap anammox granules combining anammox and phosphorus recovery was proposed lin et al 2019 ma et al 2020 it has been demonstrated that hap anammox granules with high inorganic precipitants remarkably enhanced the mechanical properties of granules ma et al 2020 in our previous studies an average 83 7 tn removal efficiency at nlr of 20 g n l d was realized using hap anammox granules at 25 c ma et al 2020 the feasibility of operating the hap anammox granules at extremely low temperatures has yet to be demonstrated in addition in early studies the focus of attention was on the simultaneous nitrogen phosphorus removal performance and not the potential advantages of the architecture of hap anammox granules it has been reported that species specific responses to temperature do finally regulate the community consortia however with different dominant strains gilbert et al 2015 hendrickx et al 2014 meng et al 2019 osaka et al 2012 indeed other factors involving the quality of wastewater e g nitrogen concentration biodegradable matters and other inhibitors and distinctness of the inoculum are also responsible for the selection of the dominant genera resulting in the overlapping effects on the population shift laureni et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore selected cold adapted anammox bacteria might only be applicable to a certain wastewater and the corresponding analysis of anammox bacteria may not accurately reveal the natural cryophylactic property of anammox species based on the remaining challenges and the research gap discussed above in this study mature hap anammox granules were used and the temperature was set at 7 c no other study in the literature has considered the anammox process in continuous experiments at such a low temperature in continuous experiments the capacity of nitrogen removal performance was explored through long term observation the architectural evolution of the hap anammox granules was monitored the temperature dependency and the apparent activation energy were demonstrated for cold adapted anammox sludge since candidatus kuenenia was identified as the only anammox genre the results were considered a reliable indicator of the cryophylactic property of candidatus kuenenia 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation a lab scale up flow expanded bed reactor effective volume 5 l diameter 94 mm with a gas liquid solid separator was established for the hap anammox granular sludge culture fig 1 the cooling system consisted of a water jacket and a recirculation cooling system the water jacket was filled with continuous recycling of cold antifreeze liquid using a cooling circulator the recirculation tube was extended and merged in the cold antifreeze liquid bath with a cooler temperatures of the cooling circulator and antifreeze liquid bath were adjusted to keep the temperature in the reactor around 7 c the detailed configuration of the cooling system was presented in fig s1 the temperature of the reactor was monitored by a thermometer placed in the middle of the reactor and was recorded every two days the temperature record is provided in fig 2 based on the investigation of the minimum temperature distribution of wastewater treatment plants 2000 in japan the minimum temperature of 7 c is a critical point and the proportion of temperatures below 7 c is less than 2 therefore 7 c was selected as the testing temperature the temperature of the reactor was under 15 c for 200 days before decreased to 7 c the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater consisting of nh4 n and no2 n in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 the other components of the synthetic wastewater included the following g l nahco3 0 5 kh2po4 0 057 cacl2 0 57 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 feso4 7h2o

three replicates with standard deviation serum flasks with a total volume of 120 ml and liquid phase volume of 100 ml were used for batch assays details of the procedure of saa can be found in an earlier study ma et al 2019 the initial tn concentration was 200 mg n l and the composition of other elements was the same as the influent in this study rmax was simulated by the modified gompertz

performance of nitrogen removal 3 1 1 high capacity of nitrogen removal nrr representing the absolute capacity of nitrogen removal should be lowered to avoid overloading when the temperature is lower the effects of temperatures on saa were able to be predicted using the arrhenius equation hao et al 2002 ma et al 2019 reino et al 2018 in our previous study the maximum nlr of hap anammox granules at 15 c was around 10 0 g n l d and in the saa tests only about 50 and 30 of saa remained when the temperature was decreased to 10 c and 5 c respectively ma et al 2019 based on that result the predicted maximum nlr at 7 c was in the range of 3 0 5 0 g n l d therefore an initial nlr of around 1 0 g n l d was determined to avoid overloading and to accommodate the low temperature the long term performance of nitrogen removal is shown in fig 2 the operational parameters and performance of nitrogen removal are summarized in table 1 the operational period of 230 days could be divided into three phases in phase i the total nitrogen tn concentration of the influent was kept at 250 mg n l and nlr was progressively increased to 1 5 g n l d 2 1 g n l d 3 2 g n l d and 3 6 g n l d by shortening hrt from 4 h to 1 7 h at the beginning of the each increased nlr the nitrogen removal efficiency slightly decreased then a stable nitrogen removal efficiency of 83 9 91 9 was obtained in phase ii the tn concentration of the influent was doubled to 500 mg n l and hrt was prolonged from 1 7 h to 3 5 h to keep the same nlr in the reactor however the performance of the reactor continued to decline during the week and the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n exceeded 80 mg l because the recirculation rate was also adjusted to maintain the actual tn concentration the poor effluent quality might result from up regulated variables caused by the higher proportion of recirculated effluent in the actual feeding such as alkalinity to avoid further deterioration in the following phase iii the operation condition was reverted to the same as phase i and the performance was soon recovered unlike phase i the nlr was rapidly increased and no negative impact on anammox activity was observed indicating that the hap anammox granule sludge had effectively acclimated to the low temperature the adaptation performance of anammox biomass to low temperatures has been widely studied as summarized in table 2 to resist being detrimentally affected by low temperatures it was proposed that the prerequisite was a high concentration of biomass despite that the state of biomass aggregation also showed different resistance to low temperatures with the biofilm based biomass showing better resistance and resilience than the suspended biomass up flow expanded bed reactors inoculated with hap anammox granules have been operated at different temperatures 35 c 25 c and 15 c in our previous studies with outstanding nitrogen removal performance achieved specifically at 15 c the nlr was reached 10 g n l d with a tn removal efficiency over 88 ma et al 2021 here an nlr of 3 6 g n l d together with a high level nitrogen removal efficiency 84 92 was achieved at 7 c which is the highest demonstrated nitrogen removal capacity at the lowest temperature reported for continuous experiments 3 1 2 stoichiometric variation according to the most widely acknowledged anammox stoichiometric equation proposed the molecular ratio of nitrite consumed per ammonium rs is in the range of 1 14 1 52 laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 strous et al 1999 in this study the initial rs of the influent was 1 14 and during the first 60 days of phase i the ammonium of the effluent was undetectable while the residual of nitrite gradually increased from 5 4 mg n l to 26 8 mg n l thus the rs of the influent decreased to 1 10 to avoid the accumulation of nitrite in the reactor however in an analogous way the ammonium of the effluent increased from 2 2 mg n l to 24 8 mg n l in most reports strategies were taken to immediately increase the temperature or lower nlr to avoid further inhibition by the high concentration of substrate hu et al 2013 wang et al 2019 however in this experiment the quality of the effluent could be maintained by minute adjustments to the influent rs without reducing the nlr after a long acclimation period as shown in table 1 the rs in phases ii and iii ranged from 1 20 1 30 and the average rs of the whole operation period was 1 25 which was slightly higher than the 1 23 obtained at 15 c ma et al 2021 the average molecular ratio of the produced nitrate to consumed ammonium rp was 0 21 which is similar to that obtained at 15 c using hap anammox granules ma et al 2021 in all the extremely low temperature of 7 c did not have a clear effect on rs and rp and the values obtained in this study were in good agreement with those previously reported 3 2 characterization of hap anammox granules 3 2 1 microbial community and temperature dependency in the beginning when the temperature was decreased to 7 c the mature hap anammox sludge appeared to be granular regardless of the size of the particles however planar and flexible film like structures emerged mainly located on the top of the reactor after running for 100 days microbial communities of hap anammox granules and peeling biofilms were analyzed and the differences between them were inconspicuous fig 3 at the phylum level the bacterial populations with the highest abundance were planctomycetes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi accounting for 37 0 38 0 25 8 28 7 14 5 17 1 and 13 3 16 1 of all the bacteria respectively the sources of detached biofilms or flocs and bulk environments are determinant factors for re regulating microbial communities in biofilms chen et al 2019 lotti et al 2014 consistent with this finding it is reported that detached dispersal biofilms and mature biofilms on carriers shared the community structure in the stationary anammox process chen et al 2019 indeed given the emerging biofilms were proposed as originally peeling from the hap anammox granules and the retained thickness of the biofilms details in 3 2 3 and 3 3 the forms of the biomass may have little effect on the microbial community under the steady state therefore the community structure of the peeling biofilms was expected to remain similar to the hap anammox granules reducing temperature displayed a significant influence on the microorganisms leading to a distinct microbial community meng et al 2019 discrepant dynamic patterns of microbial communities were reported in the duration of the temperature reduction mostly related to considerable fluctuations of the anammox bacteria he et al 2018 wang et al 2019 interestingly the microbial community of hap anammox biomass was approximately similar to that of the reactor operated at 15 c fig s3 suggesting the robustness of the community structure to decreasing temperature it should be noted that during the long term performance no severe deterioration occurred thanks to the appropriate set of the nlrs based on the traditional niche based theory taxon traits were strongly related to environments generally manifesting concurrent community dynamics and nitrogen removal performances meng et al 2019 thus the stable community was in good accordance with the smooth enhancement of the anammox capacity during which the balance and interdependencies among the core taxa were able to maintain it is likely that the metabolism of the entire community may have been retarded by the low temperature while conserving vitality the exceptions were the strains of a4b and xanthomonadaceae belonging to anaerolineae and gammaproteobacteria which decreased from 15 08 to 10 05 and from 7 76 to 1 23 respectively both the filamentous a4b and xanthomonadaceae families were related to granule formation rodriguez sanchez et al 2019 the reduction of a4b and xanthomonadaceae may have caused the disintegration of the hap anammox granules under the low temperature candidatus kuenenia affiliated with planctomycetes was the dominant anammox bacteria accounting for a relative abundance of 35 3 37 5 this is in agreement with another report that candidatus kuenenia was the clearly dominant anammox bacteria throughout the whole operational period when the temperature was lowered from 35 c to 15 c cheng et al 2020 li et al 2020 interestingly the same phenomenon was also described in a pn a system operated at 10 c except the dominant population was candidatus brocadia gilbert et al 2014 the commonality among the above mentioned literature is that the sludge was all biofilm based granules or moving bed biofilms with a relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria indicating better biomass retention and potentially high specific anammox activity which is regarded as a necessity to realize high capacity under low temperatures hendrickx et al 2014 wang et al 2019 although different shifts of dominant anammox bacteria when lowering temperature have been found in numerous studies impacts of other environmental changes such as substrate affinity excessive eps and multiple variables in actual wastewater cannot be ruled out wang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 it may well be that physiological evolution rather than interspecies selection was the main reason for the high nitrogen removal capacity under low temperatures cheng et al 2020 a series of saa tests were performed at different temperatures after operating 230 days at 7 c and ea correlated with the intrinsic activity of reaction was calculated by the arrhenius equation as illustrated in fig 4 the optimal temperature for cold acclimated candidatus kuenenia was 35 c and only 7 5 and 4 2 saa remained when the temperature was reduced to 10 c and 7 c respectively four out of seven genera kuenenia stuttgartiensis brocadia anammoxoglobus and jettenia enriched from sludge from wastewater treatment plants were operated at a higher temperature of 10 to 35 c the optimum temperature of these genera has been found to range from 30 c to 40 c gilbert et al 2014 strous et al 1999 marine anammox species scalindua which has an environmental temperature of 4 6 c or as low as 1 7 c in sediments could grow at the temperatures of 15 c and 23 c with the same optimum temperature of 25 30 c van de vossenberg et al 2008 indicating that the reaction mechanisms of the anammox process may naturally determine the mesophilic property for all the species regardless of the environmental temperature the ea was calculated to be 78 37 kj mol with an r2 of 0 98 which was lower than the 89 kj mol reported for candidatus kuenenia cultured at 35 c park et al 2017 and slightly higher than the 75 67 kj mol reported for hap candidatus kuenenia obtained at 15 c ma et al 2021 this difference may be due to the protective character of aggregated cultures which was shown to be able to decrease ea cheng et al 2020 the ea of hap candidatus kuenenia cultured at 35 c was only 56 38 kj mol ma et al 2021 on the other hand ea values consist of various rate determining reactions and the reaction rate of each might be affected to different levels due to temperature changes and aggregated states park et al 2017 generally the ea of hap candidatus kuenenia tended to increase along with the decreasing temperature 3 2 2 composition and settling velocity of hap anammox sludge with different sizes the sludge was taken from the middle of the reactor after 200 days of operation and the distribution of the particle sizes after wet sieving was characterized fig 5 particles larger than 2 8 mm were the most abundant accounting for around 45 v v while particles in the range of 0 5 1 0 mm accounted for around 10 sludge with medium sized particles 1 2 mm and 2 2 8 mm accounted for around 45 compared to the nascent hap anammox granules reported in an earlier study zhang et al 2016 the average particle size was from 0 59 mm to 1 16 mm at 35 c while in this study more than 90 of the sludge was larger than 1 mm at 7 c the mature hap anammox granules have performed architectural evolution which did not diminish the particles sizes in other words even though the film like structure was detached from the core they remained the same size as the original granule in the case of common granular anammox sludge detachment behavior has been frequently observed when facing kinds of shocks leading to the decrease of the particle size accompanied by wash out of the sludge li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 particularly at low temperatures it is possible that the decrease of extracellular polymeric substances eps including α polysaccharides and proteins could fail the maintenance of structure and size of the anammox granules wang et al 2019 in some studies however it has been suggested that more eps is secreted to counteract the cold temperatures allowing a better chance of survival for the whole consortium reino et al 2016 shi et al 2017 it should be noted that with or without the excessive production of eps the granules tended to disintegrate into smaller fractions under low temperatures li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 indicating that the adhesiveness of eps might be weakened and the maintenance of the framework of the granules malfunctioned to some extent the structure and the size of the curved lobate biofilm were retained and biomass with different sizes and structures both were shown to have a high settling velocity which effectively mitigated or prevented the loss of sludge as shown in table 3 the settling velocity increased along with sizes in the case of both granules and peeling biofilms in the case of particles of the same size the settling velocity of the granules was higher than that of the peeling biofilms and was around 2 times faster when the diameter was over 1 mm in the literature the highest reported value of nrr was around 70 g n l d using anammox granules and the settling velocities of granules with the diameter of 2 4 2 5 mm were in the range of 73 88 m h tang et al 2011 the settling velocity of pure anammox granules was also reported to be around 62 9 84 6 m h when operating under 15 c cheng et al 2020 peeling biofilms sized between 0 5 1 mm provided the lowest value of 81 82 m h in this study suggesting an outstanding settling property not only was the biomass retention performance remarkable but the high vss of the sludge also contributed to the high volumetric nitrogen removal capacity of the reactor as shown in table 3 in the case of hap anammox granules a larger diameter of the sludge was associated with a higher proportion of inorganic components when the size was over 1 mm indicating that the larger size did not exhibit a higher anammox activity due to the limited access of substrate as was reported by zhu et al 2018 though the same pattern was also found for peeling biofilms the vss tss was higher than that of granules of the same size especially when the size was over 2 mm with the higher vss proportion and adequate settling velocity peeling biofilms were considered to be an important factor in achieving high nitrogen removal efficiency at extremely low temperatures the composition of hap anammox granules was reported in our previous study lin et al 2019 ma et al 2020 this is the first study to report the unique characteristic of peeling biofilms of hap anammox granules the inorganic composition of peeling biofilms was similar to the granules the main elements were calcium and phosphorus with a ratio of 2 0 2 2 wt which was identified as hap by xrd analysis fig s4 therefore it can be concluded that the occurrence of phosphate crystallization in the biofilm was the main reason for the high settling velocity of peeling biofilms washout of anammox biomass was barely witnessed during the whole operational period 3 2 3 morphological observations and dimensional architecture as a non destructive technique xmct was applied to visualize the internal dimensional structure of the granular hap anammox biomass as well as the peeling biofilms as the object is scanned like it was sliced thousands of images are taken from each angle xy xz yz to produce tomographic images as called virtual slices lin et al 2013 computerized tomographic images include surface visualization fig 6 xmct a and density visualization colored fig 6 xmct b fig 7 xmct a b via xmct mineralized and soft tissues have been examined and the density of minerals can be distinguished by their brightness lin et al 2013 the bright areas in images of xmct fig 6 and fig 7 represent the minerals and the blue areas are mainly the organic matrix the results of the xmct were a set of assembling images of screenshots of the recorded videos of the xmct scan the full recorded video was in supplementary data as shown in fig 6 xmct a and b the architecture of mature hap anammox granules seemed like an irregular hierarchical globularity the mature hap anammox granules could be divided into three layers a nuclear hap core accompanied with biomass surrounding the hap core termed as hybrid hap anammox biomass and anammox biofilm indicating hap precipitation occurred not only in the center of granules but also within the organic matrix and the density pattern of hap was diameter dependent for mature hap anammox granules intensive hap particles were distributed in the biofilms which were tightly surrounding the hap core while hap particles were rather sporadically scattered in the anammox biofilm in general the density and amount of hap particles were as followed hap core of granules hybrid hap anammox biomass anammox biofilm on contrary the density of cells was the highest at the rim of the granules and reduced with the depth this three layered architecture of hap anammox granules featuring the interweaved anammox biomass and hap was established by simultaneous hap precipitation and growth of anammox biomass which was distinguished from that of anammox biofilms growing on carriers therefore as aforementioned in cold temperatures the excellent settling abilities of the peeling biofilms can be attributed to the intensive existence of hap precipitation this close knit bond ensured that even if disintegration occurred at low temperatures anammox biomass would not be easily washed out fig 6 xmct c is a cross section image at the center of a hap anammox granule the gray part indicates hap precipitation and the black part is the biomass illustrating the layered structure of hap anammox granules in fig 6 sem a an image of the surface of a hap anammox granule where bacteria were embedded in a large amount of spherular hap precipitation is shown the spherical formation of hap precipitation with a rod like shape was also observed in a reaction medium with sufficient mixing castro et al 2012 a high up flow rate and hydraulic shear force may contribute to the spherular shape of hap precipitation a cross section consisting of void inside hap core with spherular hap precipitations on the edge is shown in fig 6 sem b and c moreover those spherular hap precipitations have exhibited different sizes it is likely that the compact hap core in nature was an aggregation of self enlarging spherular hap particles since the cells of candidatus kuenenia have an average diameter of 800 nm van niftrik et al 2008 some voids with a diameter of 1 µm observed on the surface of larger spherular hap precipitations fig 6 sem d e f and inside the hap core fig 6 sem c indicate the historic possession of cells which had decayed during the maturation of the granules ma et al 2018 one proposal for this cohesive attachment is that the precipitation of hap would be favored due to the increased ph from anammox reaction the micro and macro roles of the existence of hap can be reasoned from those pieces of evidence from the aspect of the bonding relationship between a cell and a nucleus of hap the haps were acting as carriers allowing anammox cells to attach and biofilms to grow from the perspective of a single granule the skeleton of hap provided architectural support for the formation of three layered hap anammox granules since the peeling behavior of anammox biofilms has been observed under 7 c the architectural significance of hap and this tight connection between hap and anammox biomass have been further verified the peeling behavior was referred to as the separation of three layers of mature hap anammox granules which frequently occurred between the hap core and hybrid hap anammox biomass hap anammox granules with different sizes have experienced this peeling behavior fig 5 the architectures of peeling biofilms of larger sizes fig 7 xmct a and small sizes fig 7 xmct b both consisted of hybrid hap anammox biomass and anammox biofilms for large peeling biofilms multiple small hap chunks were observed in the biofilms without a distinct pattern while in small peeling biofilms although the hap core did not exist a high density of hap particles was distributed in the nuclear area it is noted that when the hap anammox biofilms were attached to the hap cores the anammox biomass was unilaterally active due to the limited availability of substrate on the hap core side however access to substrates was gained for the peeling biofilms which were encompassed with anammox biomass in fact the architecture of those peeling biofilms circumferential biomass and aggregates of multi cores was similar to hap anammox granules and could be precursors of mature hap anammox granules under appropriate hydrodynamic shear force during the maturation the distribution of hap precipitations and anammox biomass in different sizes is influenced by the phosphorus nitrogen removal rate and mass transfer further studies are required to deeply understand the process of the simultaneous formation of hap and growth of the anammox biomass in fig 7 sem a b c the much more common spherular hap particles with a diameter of 1 µm were significantly smaller than the mature hap anammox granules based on the homogeneity with respect to morphology the precipitation of hap in anammox biomass can be considered as biologically controlled mineralization sinha et al 2014 the fiber like material was observed in quantity and a net was established to immobilize the single hap particles in aggregates this fabricated structure is in good agreement with the initiation of biomineralization which was achieved by some extracellular products acting as nucleation specifically organic matrix like eps as well as cell fragments was a heterogeneous mixture stereochemically arranging the crystals sinha et al 2014 in the case of low temperatures a common hypothesis is that cryoprotective eps promoted the aggregation of the newborn hap crystals reino et al 2016 as precipitation proceeds the architecture of hap skeleton in the anammox biofilm is established the disintegration behavior of pure anammox granules or large aggregates has been reported wang et al 2019 they become progressively looser and break down into smaller fragments with likely poorer settling properties the noticeable problems were degraded architectural stability and consequent biomass loss in this study even though the disintegration occurred under long term operation under extremely low temperatures the size and thickness of peeling biofilms with sufficient settling ability were be able to maintain this can very likely be attributed to the architectural support of hap skeleton in the biofilm the thickness of the biofilm was around 200 500 µm as reported in our previous study for hap anammox granules ma et al 2020 at 7 c the thickness was the same as when cultured at 25 c in biofilm systems it was reported that anammox activity was mainly detected in the upper part 1000 µm of the biofilm with 60 to 92 of total bacteria kindaichi et al 2007 indicating that the thinner biofilm facilitated the mass transfer contributing to efficient nitrogen removal performance however the system with thinner biofilms or suspended biomass was liable to result in poorer performance with poor effluent qualities when the temperature was decreased laureni et al 2015 for instance the system with the smallest aggregate size exhibited higher residual nitrite at an earlier time at 16 c while thicker biofilms showed a much less distinct nitrite accumulation and even a reduction while the temperature was reduced further gilbert et al 2015 similarly it was reported that thicker biofilms are needed or the ammonium surface load asl to the biofilm should be decreased to maintain full n removal at lower temperatures hao et al 2002 therefore in the present study the architectural evolution did not have negative effects such as decomposition and loss of biomass on the contrary mass transfer was strengthened by the spontaneous peeling of biofilms from the hap core and meanwhile the retentive thickness of peeling biofilms still had the distinct advantages of accommodation to low temperatures 3 3 the proposed life cycle of hap anammox granules as was demonstrated in our previous study ma et al 2020 under mesophilic conditions small hap anammox granules are expected to grow to large granules due to microbial reproduction accompanied by the precipitation of hap the outer layer of the anammox biofilm became new sites for hap precipitation leading to the formation of multi core granules new granules could be formed by budding from the older granules according to the long term observation of the reactor and morphology evidence a hypothesized mechanism for the replication of hap anammox granules at extremely low temperatures was proposed fig 8 under the long term operation of 7 c the detachment of the daughter of hap anammox biomass changed from budding to peeling one of the possible reasons is the malfunction of eps eps is a basic requirement for cell aggregation since it behaves like a glue immobilizing single cells in multicellular aggregates vlaeminck et al 2010 one suggestion is that the anammox system might no longer secrete excessive eps in order to maintain basic life activities and reduce unnecessary energy consumption as the temperature was reduced li et al 2020 another possible reason is that eps was no longer produced owing to internal decay which resulted from the limitation of mass transfer of substrates under low temperatures in mature hap anammox granules it is proposed that the eps keeps the connection between the core and biofilm stable ma et al 2020 and its reduction likely induces the granular disintegration causing the separation of the hap core and anammox biofilms another possibility is that biomass surrounding the hap core may decay which was attributed to the limited access to substrates under low temperatures in the longer term as depicted by xmct from the vertical angle of the curved peeling biofilm the inner part of the curved peeling biofilm was occupied by anammox biomass and could become mature hap anammox granules under hydraulic shear force the peeled hap cores were covered by attenuated biofilms while the peeling biofilms mainly consisted of anammox biomass the re maturation of peeled hap cores and peeling biofilms depends on the speeds of the growth of anammox biomass as well as hap precipitation sludge from the bottom of the reactor largely containing hap cores could be separated for the recovery of the hap or as inoculum for other reactors attention should be paid to the balance between hap formation and anammox growth in the re maturation process 4 conclusions the high capacity of nitrogen removal with robust removal efficiency using hap anammox granules under 7 c was realized the volumetric nitrogen loading rate reached 3 6 g n l d with a high level nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 92 candidatus kuenenia was revealed to be the dominant and only anammox genre with a relative abundance of 35 3 37 5 the optimal temperature of cold cultured candidatus kuenenia was around 35 c and the apparent activation energy ea was calculated at 78 37 kj mol the architecture evolution of hap anammox granules into hap cores and peeling biofilms were characterized and the life cycle of hap anammox granules was illustrated in the granulation process a new mechanism of peeling for the detachment behavior was proposed the hap skeleton in peeling biofilms contributed to the architecture support and outstanding settling property guaranteeing

16559,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovered from livestock wastewater may impose a pharmacological threat to the environment due to the extensive existence of antibiotics in the wastewater in this study tetracyclines tcs were selected as the typical antibiotics and the individual processes of dissolved organic matters dom evolution and their effects on tcs migration in struvite recovery from swine wastewater were discriminated and quantified results revealed that tcs transport was contributed by the adsorption of pure struvite crystals struvite adsorbing dom tcs complex and dom aggregation which occupied 2 29 6 53 23 53 34 66 and 59 09 74 19 of the total tcs migration amounts respectively a tangential flow filtration system was employed to divide dom into five fractional parts on the basis of molecular weight cut offs experimental results indicated that under alkaline conditions of struvite crystallization doms with larger molecular weights hydrolyzed to doms with smaller molecular weights which consequently promoted tcs re distribution in doms from higher molecular weights to those with lower molecular weights furthermore a distribution model was developed to characterize tcs transport in struvite recovery by describing tcs distribution among various phases including struvite adsorption dom tcs complexing dom aggregation and free state in the solution respectively these outcomes provided new understanding on dom evolution and effects on antibiotics transport in phosphate recovery from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus recovery antibiotics dissolved organic matters quantification struvite 1 introduction rapid urban expansion and economic development contributed to the prosperity of the pig industry according to the china statistical yearbook 2020 there has been more than 544 million pigs produced annually in china nbsprc 2020 consequently the enormous risk to the environment caused by a large amount of phosphorus and ammonium discharged from swine wastewater has attracted widespread attention vanotti et al 2017 from another aspect swine wastewater enriched nitrogen and phosphorus are suitable for struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovery li et al 2021a muhmood et al 2021 as a superior slow release fertilizer struvite can be used directly on agricultural planting lu et al 2021 presently intensive pig farming widely uses veterinary antibiotics to promote animal growth and prevent animal diseases cheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 according to the literature the worldwide use of veterinary antibiotics will increase by 67 between 2010 and 2030 and among them tetracyclines tcs are one type of the leading veterinary antibiotics cheng et al 2020 van et al 2020 these antibiotics are hardly absorbed by animal guts and are discharged into the feces and urine wang et al 2019 consequently the persistent exposure of antibiotics in the environment leads to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environmental media which poses health risks to the human body and the ecological environment xu et al 2021 it should be noted from our previous studies that the application of struvite fertilizer recovered from swine wastewater increased the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the soil and thereby promoting the spread of antibiotic resistance in the food chain and threatening human health cai et al 2020 chen et al 2017a according to our previous works struvite crystallization in synthetic wastewater would trigger tcs transport from the liquid to the final solids and the maximum adsorption capacities of tcs were ranging from 1494 7g to 2160 0 μg kg ye et al 2017 as to real swine wastewater it contains a significant amount of dissolved organic matters dom such as humic acid fulvic acid and proteins zhou et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 these organic components have various function groups including acidic moieties polysaccharides fatty acids and long aliphatic side chains which have the capability of determining the migration behavior of tcs li et al 2021b safiur rahman et al 2013 wang et al 2020 we did find that the presence of dom can promote the transfer of tcs from the aqueous phase to struvite solid and the dom with higher molecular weight hmw plays an important role due to its higher aromaticity and more functional groups lou et al 2018 ye et al 2020 in addition since struvite crystallization was carried out under alkaline conditions hmw dom were hydrolyzed into ones with low molecular weights lmw xu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 this phenomenon might result in the redistribution of tcs among various dom components besides struvite precipitation would also trigger dom evolution with dom adsorption by struvite crystals and dom aggregation and consequently resulted with more tcs migrating from the aqueous phase to the recovered struvite products ye et al 2020 however few studies have been devoted to quantifying the specific effects of dom evolution on tcs transport this is very important since phosphorus recovery has been widely applied in wastewater treatment at full scales the outcomes of this study can provide the quantitative information of antibiotic transport in phosphorus recovery which will undoubtedly be helpful to develop the methods of antibiotic control in phosphorus recovery from wastewater in the present study the sub processes of dom evolution in struvite crystallization including hydrolysis adsorption and aggregation were clarified and quantified and their contributions to tcs transport were determined a tangential flow filtration system was employed to fractionate dom into several individual parts based on the molecular weight cut off and their interactions with tcs before and after hydrolysis under alkaline conditions were evaluated a series of subsequent experiments were conducted to determine the tcs transport driven by struvite adsorption dom hydrolysis dom aggregation and dom complexing with tcs respectively and a distribution model between struvite dom and tcs in the process of struvite crystallization were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and standards three individual tcs standards including tetracycline tc doxycycline dxc and oxytetracycline otc were obtained from the alladin ltd usa the properties of these tetracylines

used for sample pretreatment were bought from waters milford usa raw swine wastewater was obtained from the digested effluent of a treatment process in an intensive pig farming plant located in zhangzhou city china centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 15 min was firstly conducted to remove suspended organics ben et al 2013 after the centrifugation the parameters of the wastewater were analyzed as displayed in table s2 as to tcs their concentrations respectively were μg l otc 15 33 2 46 tc 17 16 2 13 dxc 14 23 0 99 other chemicals used for struvite crystallization including nh3 2hpo4 mgcl2 6h2o

described in the literature zhao et al 2021 dom with different molecular weights might display different effects on the environmental behavior of antibiotics therefore a tangential flow filtration tff system pall minimate pall life sciences co usa described in our previous study was adopted to fractionate dom into several fractional doms fdom with four different molecular weight cut offs fig s1 i e

measuring the quantity of dissolved organic carbon in the retentate and filtrate before and after each fractionation filtration kitis et al 2001 moody 2020 during the fractionation process the dom recovery values ranged from 82 37 to 101 07 2 3 experimental design and setup in order to quantify the effects of dom evolution on tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater blank control test and a series of subsequent experiments were conducted respectively 2 3 1 changes of tcs and dom in struvite precipitation blank control experiment was carried out to figure out the overall changes of tcs and dom during struvite recovery from real wastewater to amplify the effects of tcs migration a certain amount of tcs were dosed into the liquid to increase the initial tcs concentrations to 81 49 158 μg l then the wastewater was subjected to struvite precipitation where ph was kept at 9 0 and mg p molar ratio was set at 1 2 1 respectively after 60 min agitation the mixture was settled down for 60 min the solid precipitates were collected for further analyses and dom variation in the aqueous phase and tcs contents in the solids were measured 2 3 2 effects of dom evolution on tcs transport with regard to dom evolution during struvite crystallization it possessed several sub processes including hydrolysis under alkaline conditions adsorption by struvite crystals and aggregation respectively in order to screen out the specific functions of dom evolution on tcs transport a series experiments were designed to separate each step of dom evolution before the experiments the wastewater was firstly diluted 5 times so as to reduce phosphate concentrations and prevent the disturbance of struvite precipitation 1 dom hydrolysis and tcs re distributions under alkaline conditions for struvite recovery ph value should be kept at 9 0 10 5 which would induce dom hydrolysis ye et al 2017 in this study dom hydrolysis and its influence on tcs distribution were examined by setting a comparison between initial wastewater and the one with ph adjusting to 9 0 after 60 min agitation water samples were withdrawn for dom fractionation and parameter analyses including toc fluorescence and ultraviolet visible spectra antibiotics a tff system was also applied to investigate the variation of tcs concentration among various fdoms before and after hydrolysis 2 dom tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals after hydrolysis as described in the above section the wastewater was subjected to struvite crystals adsorption which focused on the aqueous tcs deficit contributing by dom tcs complexation in this section a series of synthetic wastewater containing certain amounts of tcs was firstly prepared with their concentrations referencing to those in the real wastewater struvite crystals were sufficiently produced by using deionized water and separated by centrifugation and then divided equally into two groups each group consisted of different struvite concentrations i e 3 6 9 12 15 mmol l respectively for the first group struvite crystals were dosed into the real wastewater for dom tcs adsorption while the other group struvite particles were added in synthetic wastewater containing certain tcs amounts for comparison all the vessels were shaken for 60 min following 120 min settling down and the solids were collected by centrifugation the supernatants were collected for the further subsequent processes which would focus on the effects of dom aggregation on tcs migration 3 effects of dom aggregation on tcs transport in this section calculated amounts of tcs were dosed into the supernatant so as to keep the initial tcs concentrations similar to those before dom tcs adsorption this was necessary since it could respectively quantify the contribution of dom aggregation on tcs transport in struvite crystallization after that desired amounts of po4 3 to reach 100 mg l were added into the liquid and mg p molar ratio was set at 1 2 1 to perform struvite precipitation the recovered solids and liquid samples were withdrawn for further analyses 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 regular methods regular parameters of the wastewater including ammonium nh4 n total nitrogen phosphate po4 3 p and total phosphorus were assayed by the standard methods apha doc was measured by using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan mg2 and ca2 were conducted by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy optima 7000dv perkinelmer usa anionic ions including sulfate and nitrate were measured by using chromatograph aquion ics thermo fisher usa 2 4 2 tetracyclines assay the determination of tcs was conducted by using the chromatography tandem mass spectrometry abi3200 qtrap usa combining with phenomennex kinetex symmetry c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm for identification and quantitation of tcs the mass spectrometry system was installed with electrospray ionization esi source and was operated with desolation temperature at 300 c and capillary voltage 5 5 kv before tcs determination solid samples were firstly mixed with 10 ml 10 v v hcl and sonicated for 20 min to dissolve struvite crystals after that for both solid and liquid samples were diluted to approximately 200 ml with phosphate buffered saline and acidified to ph 2 8 3 2 by adding 10 v v hcl oasis hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml waters milliford usa was then used to extract tcs from the samples where the extraction processes have been described in our previous works ye et al 2017 huang et al 2013 subsequently the oasis hlb cartridges were rinsed with by certain amounts of acetone methanol and milli q water the eluate was dried under a nitrogen stream at 35 c 20 v v methanol was used to bring the final purified extract volume up to 1 ml after 2 min of vortex oscillation the final extract was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and stored at 20 c for further analysis recovery rate detection limits and the quantification for the instrument were determined by using calibration curves which has been reported in our previous works ye et al 2017 the recovery rates detected in the present study were displayed in table s3 2 4 3 spectrum analyses three dimensional excitation ex and emission em matrix fluorescence 3deem spectroscopy which was applied to investigate the difference of dom before and after struvite reaction was detected by using a fluorescence spectrofluorometer f 4600 hitachi co japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp as the light source 3deem analysis scan rate was controlled at 1200 nm min with sampling interval at 5 nm on both ex and em in addition ex and em slit bandwidths were set at 5 nm and the scanning field was set at from 200 to 550 nm on excitation and emission spectra fluorescence regional integration fri of the 3deem was further adopted to evaluate the variation of dom components in the processes chen and yu 2020 generally 3deem was defined into five excitation emission regions depending on the fluorescence of model compounds table s4 in order to remove the background and raman scatter fluorescence of milli q water was subtracted from samples spectra chen et al 2017c the collected data were addressed by origin 2021 origin lab inc usa a spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa was adopted to measure the uv vis absorbance between 200 and 400 nm suva254 as a parameter of representing the relative contents of aromatic structures in dom was described by the following equation suv a 254 u v 254 doc 100 herein uv254 cm 1 is absorbance at λ 254 nm and doc mg l is dissolved organic carbon 2 5 distribution coefficient it should be pointed out that during struvite precipitation tcs were distributed among four phases including molecules sorbed to struvite crystals k map molecules complexing with dom doms tcs k doms adsorbed onto struvite crystals molecules complexing with dom aggregated doma tcs k doms and molecules freely dissolved in the solution therefore the effects of dom on tcs transport could be understood by examining tcs examining mass distribution among these phases which could provide useful information for understanding tcs migration during phosphate recovery from wastewater the following equations were used to determine tcs distribution coefficients which were derived based on mass balance f 1 k map c map k map c map k doms c doms k doma c doma 1 f 2 k doms c

struvite precipitation as displayed in fig 1 tcs contents in the solids recovered from real wastewater 14 67 47 86 μg g were obviously higher than those recovered from synthetic wastewater 0 26 0 37 μg g to investigate the discrepancies of dom components in struvite recovery process the method of fluorescence regional integration fri was employed as shown in fig 2 the loss of doc was about 4 60 of the total doc in the liquid in addition fig 3 demonstrated the discrepancies of dom fluorescence spectra before and after struvite crystallization and shifts of different peak locations and intensity changes were observed peak intensity of peak i was increased while those of peak ii iii were decreased these phenomena implied that dom evolution could highly improve the migration of tcs from liquid phase to solid phase as described in our previous works lou et al 2018 this study focused on quantifying the functions of dom evolution on tcs transport in struvite recovery 3 2 screening out the functions of dom evolution on tcs transport 3 2 1 dom hydrolysis and tcs re distributions under alkaline conditions according to literature alkaline conditions can lead to obvious hydrolysis of dom by ionizing the function group such as carboxylic and phenolic acid groups and dispersing the molecules due to electrostatic repulsion ma et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in the present study the changes of dom components under alkaline conditions were assayed by 3deem the results indicated that the concentrations of aromatic protein i and aromatic protein ii decreased while the levels of fulvic acid like and humic acid like materials increased fig 4 in addition the discrepancies of fluorescence spectra as displayed in figs s2 and s3 also supported dom hydrolysis under alkaline conditions where changes of peak shifts and intensity were detected in order to investigate the alternation of tcs distribution among various dom components a tff system based on molecular cut off was applied to fractionate dom before and after hydrolysis into five fractional doms fdoms of different molecular weights fig 5 demonstrated the variation of fdoms under alkaline conditions except for fdom1 reduction the concentrations of fdom3 fdom4 fdom5 increased 13 21 and 50 after hydrolysis respectively these suggested that fdoms with lower molecular weights lmw were compensated by the hydrolysis of fdoms with larger molecular weights the suva254 values of various fdoms were calculated which represented the relative contents of aromatic structures in dom and could be used to evaluate the chelation is a parameter which represented the relative contents of aromatic structures in dom and could be used to evaluate the chelation potential with tcs as summarized in table 1 suva254 values of fdom1 fdom2 fdom4 fdom5 were found to be significantly decreased which indicated that the amounts of unsaturated carbon bonds and aromaticity was reduced after hydrolysis yuan et al 2020 fig 6 illustrated the variation of tcs distribution among various fdoms during hydrolysis it has been reported that fdoms with higher molecular weights hmw had higher aromaticity with more acidic groups fatty acids long aliphatic side chains and polysaccharides and could chelate with tcs more easily ma et al 2013 this was also confirmed in the present study where tcs displayed stronger chelation capacities with hmw fdoms before hydrolysis fig 6 the sequence of chelating capacities of individual fdoms with tcs was fdom1 fdom2 fdom3 fdom4 fdom5 which largely matched with the sequence of suva254 values table 1 it was observed that after hydrolysis the concentrations of tcs chelating with fdom1 and fdom2 significantly decreased while the amounts of tcs complexing with fdom3 fdom4 and fdom5 increased 1 73 33 94 μg l 9 18 20 48 μg l 1 00 4 88 μg l fig 6 respectively these results demonstrated that under the alkaline conditions of struvite precipitation dom hydrolysis promoted tcs re distributing from hmw fdoms to lmw fdoms further examination on the components of individual fdom was conducted fig 5 and results displayed that the concentrations of aromatic proteins i and ii fulvic acid like materials in lmw fdoms were raised coupling with tcs increase in relevant smaller fdoms previous research has revealed that higher ph would not only be in favor of hmw fdoms to lmw fdoms while was effective at releasing protein like polysaccharide like and fulvic acid like materials from hmw fdoms to lmw fdoms chen et al 2017b li et al 2016 also as displayed in fig 5 under such circumstances the tricarbonyl group and phenolic diketone moiety of tcs were neutral or negative and the dimethylamino group demonstrated a localized positive charge ding et al 2013 ye et al 2017 consequently tcs were prone to chelate with protein like polysaccharide like and fulvic acid like materials fig 5 since they had higher affinity capabilities with these dom components bai et al 2017 therefore the augment of tcs distribution in fdom3 fdom4 and fdom5 was observed as shown in fig 6 3 2 2 dom tcs adsorption by struvite crystals the capacities of struvite crystals adsorbing tcs under synthetic and real wastewater were compared as shown in fig 7 tcs levels in the struvite solids obtained from real wastewater were dramatically higher than those from synthetic wastewater the results indicated that dom tcs complex could promote the adsorption of tcs onto struvite crystals due to the co adsorption guillossou et al 2020 besides in case the dosage of struvite crystals increased the tcs adsorption capacities were declined since struvite crystals could provide more functional sites for tcs and dom sorption wang et al 2020 it should be pointed that tcs adsorbed by pure struvite in synthetic wastewater occupied 8 87 20 40 of the total tcs adsorption amount in real wastewater further investigation was conducted on evaluating the relation between tcs and dom simultaneously adsorbing onto struvite crystals as illustrated in table 2 a linear relationship was detected with the r 2 values ranging from 0 749 to 0 970 similar results of tcs levels coupling with the enhancement of toc contents in the struvite products were reported by previous research lou et al 2018 ye et al 2018 the fluorescence regional integration fri method was employed to evaluate the variation of various fdom components before and after struvite adsorption it was obvious that the dosage of struvite crystals resulted in the loss of aqueous doc fig 8 with regard to specific fdom components the reduction of aromatic protein ii region i fulvic acid like region iii and humic acid like region v materials in the liquid were observed after struvite adsorption 3 2 3 effects of dom aggregation on tcs transport according to previous studies struvite crystallization could ignite dom aggregation and therefore trigger tcs migration ye et al 2020 to clarify the functions of dom aggregation on tcs transport the supernatants obtained in section 3 2 2 were directly subjected to struvite crystallization desired amount of tcs and phosphate were added into the liquid to keep initial tcs and phosphate concentrations respectively at the same levels in this section the functions of dom hydrolysis and adsorption on tcs migration should not be in consideration since the supernatants have undergone two stages sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 i e dom hydrolysis tcs re distribution and struvite crystals sorbing dom dom tcs adsorbing by struvite crystals respectively the amounts of tcs residues in the recovered solids ascribed to dom aggregation table 3 were measured which displayed 3 27 6 10 times higher than those contributed by struvite adsorbing dom tcs fig 7 as described by literature significant changes of ion strength or salinity could trigger dom aggregation baalousha et al 2006 which therefore could enhance the complex interactions of dom with organic contaminates due to the increase of zeta potential and the formation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains gu et al 2007 pan et al 2008 according to our previous research struvite precipitation would promote the compression on the electrical layer of dom molecules and the precipitated dom fractions exhibited direct effects on tcs residue in the recovered products lou et al 2018 in this section a decrement of aqueous toc from 53 24 to 50 84 mg l was detected among the experimental runs a strong linear relationship between binding constants of tcs k doma and aggregated doma was illustrated in fig 9 with the correlation coefficient at 0 90 0 92 table s5 for tcs complexation the values of k doma located at 1 18 2 10 which indicated that fdom aggregation contributed more for tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater such assertion was also supported by the comparison of the data in table s6 3 3 quantification of the sub processes of dom evolution for tcs transport as described in above sections dom evolution in struvite crystallization included three respective sub processes i e hydrolysis struvite adsorption and aggregation which resulted in 4 23 5 95 aqueous dom lost in the adsorption stage and 10 41 16 84 aqueous dom lost in the aggregation stage fig 10 such dom evolution combining with the adsorption of struvite crystals would ignite tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the recovered struvite products as displayed in table 4 the adsorption of pure struvite crystal struvite adsorbing dom tcs complex and dom aggregation approximately accounted for 2 29 6 53 23 53 34 66 and 59 09 74 19 of total tcs migration respectively these results demonstrated the significance of the sub processes of dom evolution driven by struvite crystallization contributing to tcs transport during phosphate recovery from wastewater undoubtedly such data were useful for evaluating the potential eco risks of antibiotics during struvite recovery from livestock wastewater a model concerning tcs mass distributing among different phases i e tcs molecules sorbed to struvite crystals k map molecules complexing with dom doms tcs k doms adsorbed onto struvite crystals molecules complexing with dom aggregated doma tcs k doma and molecules freely dissolved in the solution were therefore developed the coefficients of k map k doms and k doma were calculated by regressing tcs adsorption quantity and tcs carrier amounts fig 11 with the detailed deviation listed in table s7 and s8 accordingly the tcs distribution coefficients among various phases i e f 1 f 2 f 3and f 4 were therefore determined as shown in table 5 to our knowledge few studies have reported on the characterization of antibiotic distribution in struvite crystallization such outcomes were practical for understanding the behavior of antibiotic migration phosphorus recovery from wastewater which was also good for developing control technology in the near future 4 conclusion this study was conducted to screen out the individual dom evolution sub processes on tcs transport and quantified the effects during struvite recovery from swine wastewater a tangential flow filtration system was employed to divide dom into five fractional parts on the basis of molecular weight cut offs the results suggested that hmw fdoms such as fdom1 and fdom2 had hydrolyzed to lmw fdoms including fdom3 fdom4 and fdom5 under alkaline conditions and tcs were redistributed due to the binding power of tcs with hmw dom becomes weaker in addition we speculated that struvite crystal adsorption dom tcs complex and dom aggregation contributed to tcs migration which approximately accounted for 2 29 6 53 23 53 34 66 and 59 09 74 19 respectively finally a distribution model was developed to characterize tcs transport by describing tcs distribution among various phases including struvite adsorption dom tcs complexing dom aggregation and free state in the solution respectively the outcomes of this study were practical since it can provide the quantitative information of antibiotic migration during phosphorus recovery besides it will undoubtedly be helpful to develop the methods of antibiotic control in

16559,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovered from livestock wastewater may impose a pharmacological threat to the environment due to the extensive existence of antibiotics in the wastewater in this study tetracyclines tcs were selected as the typical antibiotics and the individual processes of dissolved organic matters dom evolution and their effects on tcs migration in struvite recovery from swine wastewater were discriminated and quantified results revealed that tcs transport was contributed by the adsorption of pure struvite crystals struvite adsorbing dom tcs complex and dom aggregation which occupied 2 29 6 53 23 53 34 66 and 59 09 74 19 of the total tcs migration amounts respectively a tangential flow filtration system was employed to divide dom into five fractional parts on the basis of molecular weight cut offs experimental results indicated that under alkaline conditions of struvite crystallization doms with larger molecular weights hydrolyzed to doms with smaller molecular weights which consequently promoted tcs re distribution in doms from higher molecular weights to those with lower molecular weights furthermore a distribution model was developed to characterize tcs transport in struvite recovery by describing tcs distribution among various phases including struvite adsorption dom tcs complexing dom aggregation and free state in the solution respectively these outcomes provided new understanding on dom evolution and effects on antibiotics transport in phosphate recovery from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus recovery antibiotics dissolved organic matters quantification struvite 1 introduction rapid urban expansion and economic development contributed to the prosperity of the pig industry according to the china statistical yearbook 2020 there has been more than 544 million pigs produced annually in china nbsprc 2020 consequently the enormous risk to the environment caused by a large amount of phosphorus and ammonium discharged from swine wastewater has attracted widespread attention vanotti et al 2017 from another aspect swine wastewater enriched nitrogen and phosphorus are suitable for struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovery li et al 2021a muhmood et al 2021 as a superior slow release fertilizer struvite can be used directly on agricultural planting lu et al 2021 presently intensive pig farming widely uses veterinary antibiotics to promote animal growth and prevent animal diseases cheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 according to the literature the worldwide use of veterinary antibiotics will increase by 67 between 2010 and 2030 and among them tetracyclines tcs are one type of the leading veterinary antibiotics cheng et al 2020 van et al 2020 these antibiotics are hardly absorbed by animal guts and are discharged into the feces and urine wang et al 2019 consequently the persistent exposure of antibiotics in the environment leads to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environmental media which poses health risks to the human body and the ecological environment xu et al 2021 it should be noted from our previous studies that the application of struvite fertilizer recovered from swine wastewater increased the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the soil and thereby promoting the spread of antibiotic resistance in the food chain and threatening human health cai et al 2020 chen et al 2017a according to our previous works struvite crystallization in synthetic wastewater would trigger tcs transport from the liquid to the final solids and the maximum adsorption capacities of tcs were ranging from 1494 7g to 2160 0 μg kg ye et al 2017 as to real swine wastewater it contains a significant amount of dissolved organic matters dom such as humic acid fulvic acid and proteins zhou et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 these organic components have various function groups including acidic moieties polysaccharides fatty acids and long aliphatic side chains which have the capability of determining the migration behavior of tcs li et al 2021b safiur rahman et al 2013 wang et al 2020 we did find that the presence of dom can promote the transfer of tcs from the aqueous phase to struvite solid and the dom with higher molecular weight hmw plays an important role due to its higher aromaticity and more functional groups lou et al 2018 ye et al 2020 in addition since struvite crystallization was carried out under alkaline conditions hmw dom were hydrolyzed into ones with low molecular weights lmw xu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 this phenomenon might result in the redistribution of tcs among various dom components besides struvite precipitation would also trigger dom evolution with dom adsorption by struvite crystals and dom aggregation and consequently resulted with more tcs migrating from the aqueous phase to the recovered struvite products ye et al 2020 however few studies have been devoted to quantifying the specific effects of dom evolution on tcs transport this is very important since phosphorus recovery has been widely applied in wastewater treatment at full scales the outcomes of this study can provide the quantitative information of antibiotic transport in phosphorus recovery which will undoubtedly be helpful to develop the methods of antibiotic control in phosphorus recovery from wastewater in the present study the sub processes of dom evolution in struvite crystallization including hydrolysis adsorption and aggregation were clarified and quantified and their contributions to tcs transport were determined a tangential flow filtration system was employed to fractionate dom into several individual parts based on the molecular weight cut off and their interactions with tcs before and after hydrolysis under alkaline conditions were evaluated a series of subsequent experiments were conducted to determine the tcs transport driven by struvite adsorption dom hydrolysis dom aggregation and dom complexing with tcs respectively and a distribution model between struvite dom and tcs in the process of struvite crystallization were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and standards three individual tcs standards including tetracycline tc doxycycline dxc and oxytetracycline otc were obtained from the alladin ltd usa the properties of these tetracylines were listed in table s1 tetracycline d6 80 purity was purchased from toronto research chemicals inc north york canada used as an internal standard oasishlb cartridges size of 200 mg 6 ml which were used for sample pretreatment were bought from waters milford usa raw swine wastewater was obtained from the digested effluent of a treatment process in an intensive pig farming plant located in zhangzhou city china centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 15 min was firstly conducted to remove suspended organics ben et al 2013 after the centrifugation the parameters of the wastewater were analyzed as displayed in table s2 as to tcs their concentrations respectively were μg l otc 15 33 2 46 tc 17 16 2 13 dxc 14 23 0 99 other chemicals used for struvite crystallization including nh3 2hpo4 mgcl2 6h2o and naoh were all chemical pure and supplied by xi long co china ultrapure water was generated by a milli q water purification system 18 2 ωm cm from millipore boston usa 2 2 dom fractionation as described in the literature zhao et al 2021 dom with different molecular weights might display different effects on the environmental behavior of antibiotics therefore a tangential flow filtration tff system pall minimate pall life sciences co usa described in our previous study was adopted to fractionate dom into several fractional doms fdom with four different molecular weight cut offs fig s1 i e 100 kda 0 45 μm fdom1 30 100 kda fdom2 5 30 kda fdom3 1 5 kda fdom4 and 1 kda fdom5 respectively lou et al 2018 after every fractionation sub process the dom recovery as doc was calculated by measuring the quantity of dissolved organic carbon in the retentate and filtrate before and after each fractionation filtration kitis et al 2001 moody 2020 during the fractionation process the dom recovery values ranged from 82 37 to 101 07 2 3 experimental design and setup in order to quantify the effects of dom evolution on tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater blank control test and a series of subsequent experiments were conducted respectively 2 3 1 changes of tcs and dom in struvite precipitation blank control experiment was carried out to figure out the overall changes of tcs and dom during struvite recovery from real wastewater to amplify the effects of tcs migration a certain amount of tcs were dosed into the liquid to increase the initial tcs concentrations to 81 49 158 μg l then the wastewater was subjected to struvite precipitation where ph was kept at 9 0 and mg p molar ratio was set at 1 2 1 respectively after 60 min agitation the mixture was settled down for 60 min the solid precipitates were collected for further analyses and dom variation in the aqueous phase and tcs contents in the solids were measured 2 3 2 effects of dom evolution on tcs transport with regard to dom evolution during struvite crystallization it possessed several sub processes including hydrolysis under alkaline conditions adsorption by struvite crystals and aggregation respectively in order to screen out the specific functions of dom evolution on tcs transport a series experiments were designed to separate each step of dom evolution before the experiments the wastewater was firstly diluted 5 times so as to reduce phosphate concentrations and prevent the disturbance of struvite precipitation 1 dom hydrolysis and tcs re distributions under alkaline conditions for struvite recovery ph value should be kept at 9 0 10 5 which would induce dom hydrolysis ye et al 2017 in this study dom hydrolysis and its influence on tcs distribution were examined by setting a comparison between initial wastewater and the one with ph adjusting to 9 0 after 60 min agitation water samples were withdrawn for dom fractionation and parameter analyses including toc fluorescence and ultraviolet visible spectra antibiotics a tff system was also applied to investigate the variation of tcs concentration among various fdoms before and after hydrolysis 2 dom tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals after hydrolysis as described in the above section the wastewater was subjected to struvite crystals adsorption which focused on the aqueous tcs deficit contributing by dom tcs complexation in this section a series of synthetic wastewater containing certain amounts of tcs was firstly prepared with their concentrations referencing to those in the real wastewater struvite crystals were sufficiently produced by using deionized water and separated by centrifugation and then divided equally into two groups each group consisted of different struvite concentrations i e 3 6 9 12 15 mmol l respectively for the first group struvite crystals were dosed into the real wastewater for dom tcs adsorption while the other group struvite particles were added in synthetic wastewater containing certain tcs amounts for comparison all the vessels were shaken for 60 min following 120 min settling down and the solids were collected by centrifugation the supernatants were collected for the further subsequent processes which would focus on the effects of dom aggregation on tcs migration 3 effects of dom aggregation on tcs transport in this section calculated amounts of tcs were dosed into the supernatant so as to keep the initial tcs concentrations similar to those before dom tcs adsorption this was necessary since it could respectively quantify the contribution of dom aggregation on tcs transport in struvite crystallization after that desired amounts of po4 3 to reach 100 mg l were added into the liquid and mg p molar ratio was set at 1 2 1 to perform struvite precipitation the recovered solids and liquid samples were withdrawn for further analyses 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 regular methods regular parameters of the wastewater including ammonium nh4 n total nitrogen phosphate po4 3 p and total phosphorus were assayed by the standard methods apha doc was measured by using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan mg2 and ca2 were conducted by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy optima 7000dv perkinelmer usa anionic ions including sulfate and nitrate were measured by using chromatograph aquion ics thermo fisher usa 2 4 2 tetracyclines assay the determination of tcs was conducted by using the chromatography tandem mass spectrometry abi3200 qtrap usa combining with phenomennex kinetex symmetry c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm for identification and quantitation of tcs the mass spectrometry system was installed with electrospray ionization esi source and was operated with desolation temperature at 300 c and capillary voltage 5 5 kv before tcs determination solid samples were firstly mixed with 10 ml 10 v v hcl and sonicated for 20 min to dissolve struvite crystals after that for both solid and liquid samples were diluted to approximately 200 ml with phosphate buffered saline and acidified to ph 2 8 3 2 by adding 10 v v hcl oasis hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml waters milliford usa was then used to extract tcs from the samples where the extraction processes have been described in our previous works ye et al 2017 huang et al 2013 subsequently the oasis hlb cartridges were rinsed with by certain amounts of acetone methanol and milli q water the eluate was dried under a nitrogen stream at 35 c 20 v v methanol was used to bring the final purified extract volume up to 1 ml after 2 min of vortex oscillation the final extract was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and stored at 20 c for further analysis recovery rate detection limits and the quantification for the instrument were determined by using calibration curves which has been reported in our previous works ye et al 2017 the recovery rates detected in the present study were displayed in table s3 2 4 3 spectrum analyses three dimensional excitation ex and emission em matrix fluorescence 3deem spectroscopy which was applied to investigate the difference of dom before and after struvite reaction was detected by using a fluorescence spectrofluorometer f 4600 hitachi co japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp as the light source 3deem analysis scan rate was controlled at 1200 nm min with sampling interval at 5 nm on both ex and em in addition ex and em slit bandwidths were set at 5 nm and the scanning field was set at from 200 to 550 nm on excitation and emission spectra fluorescence regional integration fri of the 3deem was further adopted to evaluate the variation of dom components in the processes chen and yu 2020 generally 3deem was defined into five excitation emission regions depending on the fluorescence of model compounds table s4 in order to remove the background and raman scatter fluorescence of milli q water was subtracted from samples spectra chen et al 2017c the collected data were addressed by origin 2021 origin lab inc usa a spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa was adopted to measure the uv vis absorbance between 200 and 400 nm suva254 as a parameter of representing the relative contents of aromatic structures in dom was described by the following equation suv a 254 u v 254 doc 100 herein uv254 cm 1 is absorbance at λ 254 nm and doc mg l is dissolved organic carbon 2 5 distribution coefficient it should be pointed out that during struvite precipitation tcs were distributed among four phases including molecules sorbed to struvite crystals k map molecules complexing with dom doms tcs k doms adsorbed onto struvite crystals molecules complexing with dom aggregated doma tcs k doms and molecules freely dissolved in the solution therefore the effects of dom on tcs transport could be understood by examining tcs examining mass distribution among these phases which could provide useful information for understanding tcs migration during phosphate recovery from wastewater the following equations were used to determine tcs distribution coefficients which were derived based on mass balance f 1 k map c map k map c map k doms c doms k doma c doma 1 f 2 k doms c

aggregation c map c doms and c doma was struvite crystal amounts doms adsorption quantity and doma aggregation quantity 3 result and discussion 3 1 changes of tcs and dom components in the process of struvite precipitation as displayed in fig 1 tcs contents in the solids recovered from real wastewater 14 67 47 86 μg g were obviously higher than those recovered from synthetic wastewater 0 26 0 37 μg g to investigate the discrepancies of dom components in struvite recovery process the method of fluorescence regional integration fri was employed as shown in fig 2 the loss of doc was about 4 60 of the total doc in the liquid in addition fig 3 demonstrated the discrepancies of dom fluorescence spectra before and after struvite crystallization and shifts of different peak locations and intensity changes were observed peak intensity of peak i was increased while those of peak ii iii were decreased these phenomena implied that dom evolution could highly improve the migration of tcs from liquid phase to solid phase as described in our previous works lou et al 2018 this study focused on quantifying the functions of dom evolution on tcs transport in struvite recovery 3 2 screening out the functions of dom evolution on tcs transport 3 2 1 dom hydrolysis and tcs re distributions under alkaline conditions according to literature alkaline conditions can lead to obvious hydrolysis of dom by ionizing the function group such as carboxylic and phenolic acid groups and dispersing the molecules due to electrostatic repulsion ma et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in the present study the changes of dom components under alkaline conditions were assayed by 3deem the results indicated that the concentrations of aromatic protein i and aromatic protein ii decreased while the levels of fulvic acid like and humic acid like materials increased fig 4 in addition the discrepancies of fluorescence spectra as displayed in figs s2 and s3 also supported dom hydrolysis under alkaline conditions where changes of peak shifts and intensity were detected in order to investigate the alternation of tcs distribution among various dom components a tff system based on molecular cut off was applied to fractionate dom before and after hydrolysis into five fractional doms fdoms of different molecular weights fig 5 demonstrated the variation of fdoms under alkaline conditions except for fdom1 reduction the concentrations of fdom3 fdom4 fdom5 increased 13 21 and 50 after hydrolysis respectively these suggested that fdoms with lower molecular weights lmw were compensated by the hydrolysis of fdoms with larger molecular weights the suva254 values of various fdoms were calculated which represented the relative contents of aromatic structures in dom and could be used to evaluate the chelation is a parameter which represented the relative contents of aromatic structures in dom and could be used to evaluate the chelation potential with tcs as summarized in table 1 suva254 values of fdom1 fdom2 fdom4 fdom5 were found to be significantly decreased which indicated that the amounts of unsaturated carbon bonds and aromaticity was reduced after hydrolysis yuan et al 2020 fig 6 illustrated the variation of tcs distribution among various fdoms during hydrolysis it has been reported that fdoms with higher molecular weights hmw had higher aromaticity with more acidic groups fatty acids long aliphatic side chains and polysaccharides and could chelate with tcs more easily ma et al 2013 this was also confirmed in the present study where tcs displayed stronger chelation capacities with hmw fdoms before hydrolysis fig 6 the sequence of chelating capacities of individual fdoms with tcs was fdom1 fdom2 fdom3 fdom4 fdom5 which largely matched with the sequence of suva254 values table 1 it was observed that after hydrolysis the concentrations of tcs chelating with fdom1 and fdom2 significantly decreased while the amounts of tcs complexing with fdom3 fdom4 and fdom5 increased 1 73 33 94 μg l 9 18 20 48 μg l 1 00 4 88 μg l fig 6 respectively these results demonstrated that under the alkaline conditions of struvite precipitation dom hydrolysis promoted tcs re distributing from hmw fdoms to lmw fdoms further examination on the components of individual fdom was conducted fig 5 and results displayed that the concentrations of aromatic proteins i and ii fulvic acid like materials in lmw fdoms were raised coupling with tcs increase in relevant smaller fdoms previous research has revealed that higher ph would not only be in favor of hmw fdoms to lmw fdoms while was effective at releasing protein like polysaccharide like and fulvic acid like materials from hmw fdoms to lmw fdoms chen et al 2017b li et al 2016 also as displayed in fig 5 under such circumstances the tricarbonyl group and phenolic diketone moiety of tcs were neutral or negative and the dimethylamino group demonstrated a localized positive charge ding et al 2013 ye et al 2017 consequently tcs were prone to chelate with protein like polysaccharide like and fulvic acid like materials fig 5 since they had higher affinity capabilities with these dom components bai et al 2017 therefore the augment of tcs distribution in fdom3 fdom4 and fdom5 was observed as shown in fig 6 3 2 2 dom tcs adsorption by struvite crystals the capacities of struvite crystals adsorbing tcs under synthetic and real wastewater were compared as shown in fig 7 tcs levels in the struvite solids obtained from real wastewater were dramatically higher than those from synthetic wastewater the results indicated that dom tcs complex could promote the adsorption of tcs onto struvite crystals due to the co adsorption guillossou et al 2020 besides in case the dosage of struvite crystals increased the tcs adsorption capacities were declined since struvite crystals could provide more functional sites for tcs and dom sorption wang et al 2020 it should be pointed that tcs adsorbed by pure struvite in synthetic wastewater occupied 8 87 20 40 of the total tcs adsorption amount in real wastewater further investigation was conducted on evaluating the relation between tcs and dom simultaneously adsorbing onto struvite crystals as illustrated in table 2 a linear relationship was detected with the r 2 values ranging from 0 749 to 0 970 similar results of tcs levels coupling with the enhancement of toc contents in the struvite products were reported by previous research lou et al 2018 ye et al 2018 the fluorescence regional integration fri method was employed to evaluate the variation of various fdom components before and after struvite adsorption it was obvious that the dosage of struvite crystals resulted in the loss of aqueous doc fig 8 with regard to specific fdom components the reduction of aromatic protein ii region i fulvic acid like region iii and humic acid like region v materials in the liquid were observed after struvite adsorption 3 2 3 effects of dom aggregation on tcs transport according to previous studies struvite crystallization could ignite dom aggregation and therefore trigger tcs migration ye et al 2020 to clarify the functions of dom aggregation on tcs transport the supernatants obtained in section 3 2 2 were directly subjected to struvite crystallization desired amount of tcs and phosphate were added into the liquid to keep initial tcs and phosphate concentrations respectively at the same levels in this section the functions of dom hydrolysis and adsorption on tcs migration should not be in consideration since the supernatants have undergone two stages sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 i e dom hydrolysis tcs re distribution and struvite crystals sorbing dom dom tcs adsorbing by struvite crystals respectively the amounts of tcs residues in the recovered solids ascribed to dom aggregation table 3 were measured which displayed 3 27 6 10 times higher than those contributed by struvite adsorbing dom tcs fig 7 as described by literature significant changes of ion strength or salinity could trigger dom aggregation baalousha et al 2006 which therefore could enhance the complex interactions of dom with organic contaminates due to the increase of zeta potential and the formation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains gu et al 2007 pan et al 2008 according to our previous research struvite precipitation would promote the compression on the electrical layer of dom molecules and the precipitated dom fractions exhibited direct effects on tcs residue in the recovered products lou et al 2018 in this section a decrement of aqueous toc from 53 24 to 50 84 mg l was detected among the experimental runs a strong linear relationship between binding constants of tcs k doma and aggregated doma was illustrated in fig 9 with the correlation coefficient at 0 90 0 92 table s5 for tcs complexation the values of k doma located at 1 18 2 10 which indicated that fdom aggregation contributed more for tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater such assertion was also supported by the comparison of the data in table s6 3 3 quantification of the sub processes of dom evolution for tcs transport as described in above sections dom evolution in struvite crystallization included three respective sub processes i e hydrolysis struvite adsorption and aggregation which resulted in 4 23 5 95 aqueous dom lost in the adsorption stage and 10 41 16 84 aqueous dom lost in the aggregation stage fig 10 such dom evolution combining with the adsorption of struvite crystals would ignite tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the recovered struvite products as displayed in table 4 the adsorption of pure struvite crystal struvite adsorbing dom tcs complex and dom aggregation approximately accounted for 2 29 6 53 23 53 34 66 and 59 09 74 19 of total tcs migration respectively these results demonstrated the significance of the sub processes of dom evolution driven by struvite crystallization contributing to tcs transport during phosphate recovery from wastewater undoubtedly such data were useful for evaluating the potential eco risks of antibiotics during struvite recovery from livestock wastewater a model concerning tcs mass distributing among different phases i e tcs molecules sorbed to struvite crystals k map molecules complexing with dom doms tcs k doms adsorbed onto struvite crystals molecules complexing with dom aggregated doma tcs k doma and molecules freely dissolved in the solution were therefore developed the coefficients of k map k doms and k doma were calculated by regressing tcs adsorption quantity and tcs carrier amounts fig 11 with the detailed deviation listed in table s7 and s8 accordingly the tcs distribution coefficients among various phases i e f 1 f 2 f 3and f 4 were therefore determined as shown in table 5 to our knowledge few studies have reported on the characterization of antibiotic distribution in struvite crystallization such outcomes were practical for understanding the behavior of antibiotic migration phosphorus recovery from wastewater which was also good for developing control technology in the near future 4 conclusion this study was conducted to screen out the individual dom evolution sub processes on tcs transport and quantified the effects during struvite recovery from swine wastewater a tangential flow filtration system was employed to divide dom into five fractional parts on the basis of molecular weight cut offs the results suggested that hmw fdoms such as fdom1 and fdom2 had hydrolyzed to lmw fdoms including fdom3 fdom4 and fdom5 under alkaline conditions and tcs were redistributed due to the binding power of tcs with hmw dom becomes weaker in addition we speculated that struvite crystal adsorption dom tcs complex and dom aggregation contributed to tcs migration which approximately accounted for 2 29 6 53 23 53 34 66 and 59 09 74 19 respectively finally a distribution model was developed to characterize tcs transport by describing tcs distribution among various phases including struvite adsorption dom tcs complexing dom aggregation and free state in the solution respectively the outcomes of this study were practical since it can provide the quantitative information of antibiotic migration during phosphorus recovery besides it will undoubtedly be helpful to develop the methods of antibiotic control in
