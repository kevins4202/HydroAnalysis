16170,anammox based process provides an alternative for the sustainable treatment of incineration leachate that has high load ammonium and high residual heat but the high concentrations of organics in such leachates brought challenges for the process control for the first time a two stage partial nitrification pn anammox process coupled with a pre enhanced anaerobic digestion ad was established to achieve efficient nitrogen removal from incineration leachate satisfactory nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiencies were achieved with the average values of 90 and 78 respectively despite fluctuating influent properties 1100 2000 mg total nitrogen tn l and 3800 15800 mg cod l a versatile control strategy was developed to create an optimum autotrophic environment for nitrifier and anammox bacteria i enhanced ad set before the pn anammox process captured nearly 50 of the influent cod ii in the pn unit ammonia oxidizing bacteria were well adapted to cod concentrations of 1420 2400 mg l and dissolved oxygen 0 2 0 4 mg l controlling combined with a high free nitrous acid concentration 0 08 mg l ensured a nitrite accumulation rate of 95 and iii in the anammox unit a suitable influent no2 n nh4 n ratio the average value of 1 27 was achieved by mixing ad effluent with pn effluent 1 1 78 v v contributing to a high tn removal of 78 2 4 nevertheless 980 1560 mg l of cod remained in the influent of the anammox unit biorefractory humic acids in this 245 6 3 mg l might be the main component that caused the observed 66 2 decrease in anammox activity the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria induced by the organic compounds may have led to the observed decline in the abundance of the anammox bacterium candidatus kuenenia the proposed strategy guaranteed the robust operation of the pn anammox process and provides a promising approach for the sustainable treatment of incineration leachate graphical abstract image graphical abstract

effective method for reducing municipal solid waste msw volume and harvesting energy ji et al 2016 makarichi et al 2018 from a life cycle perspective the combination of recycling and incineration is deemed optimal for msw management and has been accepted in many countries including in europe japan and china bruno et al 2021 cui et al 2020 tabata and tsai 2016 the proportion of total msw treatment by incineration rapidly increased worldwide in the past decade including from 15 to 50 in china from 2009 to 2018 ding et al 2021 in general to improve the corresponding heat value before incineration the msws are accumulated and fermented in a pit for days to allow moisture to drain from the refuse resulting in the production of a considerable amount of incineration leachate lei et al 2019 incineration leachate is highly variable and complex wastewater that contains high concentrations of organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod 10 000 80 000 mg l and ammonium 1000 3000 mg l as well as harmful components such as metals ions e g pb ni zn ca and refractory organic compounds e g humic and fulvic like substances mitrano et al 2017 shi et al 2022 generally the biological oxygen demand bod cod and refractory organic compound concentration in incineration leachate are several times higher than those in landfill leachate ghosh and thakur 2014 pastore et al 2018 for example humic substances in incineration leachate are approximately 2 10 folds higher than that of landfill leachate leading to poor biodegradability of the effluent renou et al 2008 it is a big challenge to treat incineration leachate efficiently and stably not only because it contains numerous complex organic compounds but also because these organic compounds markedly disturb the biological nitrogen removal treatment performance nitrification process at present the combined two stage anoxic oxic a o membrane bioreactor mbr membrane driven process is widely applied for leachate treatment to meet strict nitrogen discharge standards of leachate for example the effluent total nitrogen tn must be 40 mg l in china national standard gb18485 2014 peng et al 2008 shao et al 2021 the two stage anoxic oxic a o process as a key biological treatment unit relies on autotrophic nitrifiers for conversion of ammonium to nitrate and heterotrophic denitrifiers for conversion of nitrate to gaseous dinitrogen chu et al 2021 to make this process robust and achieve a low effluent tn concentration high aeration addition of organic carbon and a high recycling rate even 2000 recycling of the nitrification supernatant to the predenitrification unit are required which leads to a high cost for treatment of incineration leachate liu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 therefore more efficient and economic techniques are urgently required for the treatment of incineration leachate aiming toward carbon neutrality in the process anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has revolutionized nitrogen removal from wastewater because of its economic and environmentally friendly advantages kartal et al 2010 kuenen 2008 anammox bacteria can directly convert nh4 to n2 in anoxic conditions with no2 as the electron acceptor kuenen 2008 the application of the anammox process can save 60 oxygen and 100 carbon compared with conventional biological nitrogen removal technology ma et al 2016 indeed landfill leachate treatment via the deammonification process could save 83 5 of the cost compared with the conventional nitrification and denitrification process mohammad pajooh et al 2017 thus far 200 partial nitrification anammox pn anammox facilities have been built to treat ammonium rich wastewaters such as landfill leachate and reject water most of which are characterized by a low cod n ratio e g 0 5 mccarty 2018 wang et al 2020a however for incineration leachate the influent cod n ratio is generally within the range 3 9 nie et al 2020 ye et al 2014 which is a double edged sword effect for the application of an anammox based process the biodegradable organic carbon in incineration leachate can first be captured by using an anaerobic digestion ad unit for methane resource recovery then the methane can be combusted to produce heat which together with the residual heat from the incineration plant keep the pn anammox units at 30 c helping to maintain high activities of both pn and anammox however a faction of the organic compounds inevitably flows into the subsequent pn anammox process destroying the autotrophic environment and finally disrupting the anammox performance peng et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge the application of the pn anammox process for incineration leachate treatment is still limited li et al 2018 wang et al 2020a ye et al 2020 but it requires urgent development in this study a two stage pn anammox system combined with a pre enhanced carbon capture ad unit was established and operated for 230 days treating incineration leachate the objectives of the study were as follows i to examine the feasibility of applying the pn anammox process in efficient treatment of incineration leachate and ii to determine the optimal parameters for the pn and anammox operation focused on inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and reducing disturbance of the anammox bacteria by organic compounds the microbial community sludge morphology and extracellular polymeric substances eps composition were examined for pn and anammox sludges to correlate them with the treatment performance significantly the organic carbon flow analysis in the treatment process was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the effect of organic compounds on the microbial communities and activities of functional bacteria on the basis of this study we hope to accelerate the application of the anammox based process in treating high organic and ammonium containing wastewater to progress toward carbon neutrality in the msw incineration industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operational strategies the semi continuous tests were carried out in three reactors an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor for ad ad uasb and sequencing batch reactors for pn and anammox pn sbr anammox sbr fig 1 a with effective volumes of 6 l 2 l and 2 5 l and

this study was obtained from an msw incineration plant in shanghai china and had been treated by anaerobic digestion the characteristics of the incineration leachate fluctuate in the ranges cod 3850

wastewater fig s1 before being fed with incineration leachate d 1 113 the compositions of the synthetic wastewaters are detailed in the supplementary materials text s2 the pn anammox system was operated for 237 days which was divided into four phase table 1 in phases ii and iii the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of the anammox sbr was regulated by bypass flow of the ad uasb effluent and the pn

fluorescence spectrophotometer fluoromax 4 horiba japan to discriminate the fluorescent compounds present in influent effluent the operational conditions were excitation wavelength 240 500 nm and emission wavelength 300 600 nm 2 2 3 eps extraction and composition analysis the eps of pn and anammox sludges were extracted separately using a modified heat method as described by wang et al 2020b the contents of proteins and humic acids were analyzed by a modified lowry method using bovine serum albumin and humic acids as standards respectively the content of polysaccharides was measured by the anthrone method using glucose as a standard 2 2 4 gc ms analysis the organic compounds in leachate were identified by gc ms according to the procedure reported by wang et al 2020a the organic compounds in wastewater were firstly extracted using dichloromethane as described by kunacheva et al 2017 gc ms analysis was performed using an hp7890gc 5795ms apparatus equipped with an hp 5 column the carrier gas he flow rate was 1 0 ml min the initial column temperature was set to 50 c held for 8 min then it was raised to 200 c at 8 c min then increased to 220 c at 4 c min and finally increased to 260 c at 5 c min the injector and transfer line temperature were 230 c the injection volume was 1 μl and the split ratio was 1 10 the ms conditions were voltage 1 05 kv ei 50 ev scan field 35 500 m z and ion source temperature 230 c 2 2 5 activity assays the activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob were characterized by the specific ammonia oxidation rate saor as described by surmacz gorska et al 1996 specific anammox activity saa represented by the rate of substrate consumed per biomass per day was determined in situ in the anammox sbr according to wang et al 2020a the initial nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were both controlled at 50 mg n l the determination methods of saor and saa are detailed in the supplementary materials text s3 2 2 6 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing microbial community characteristics of pn and anammox sludge were compared between the synthetic wastewater operation phase and the leachate operation phase the illumina miseq platform was employed to sequence bacterial 16s rrna genes using 338f and 806r as primers v3 v4 region trimmed sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units using a 97 identity threshold to determine the classified bacterial taxa with significant abundance differences during the whole operation we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 3 results although the influent concentrations of tn bod and cod greatly fluctuated in the ranges 1100 2000 mg n l 1700 9400 mg l and 3800 15 800 mg l respectively the combined ad pn anammox process achieved a relatively stable and effective performance in which the effluent nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations were low at 30 70 30 60 and 20 40 mg n l respectively and the bod and cod were 150 370 and 750 1370 mg l respectively table s1 during the stable operational period treating 100 leachate the ad pn anammox process removed approximately 90 of the tn 88 of the bod and 76 of the cod 3 1 nitrogen removal performance the pn anammox process was successfully initialized using synthetic wastewater start up phase d 1 113 fig s1 a nitrite accumulation rate nae of 97 2 and a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 86 1 were achieved in the pn sbr and anammox sbr respectively after fed by incineration leachate the pn sbr maintained a stable and satisfactory performance with an nae of 96 1 fig 2 a and stable tn removal efficiency was achieved for each phase in the anammox sbr with mean nre 77 fig 2b 3 1 1 control strategy and long term performance of the pn anammox system to successfully manipulate the pn anammox process two measures are essential maintaining no2 accumulation suppressing no3 formation in the pn effluent and maintaining a suitable effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio i e around 1 32 in the anammox influent lackner et al 2014 in this study suppressing no3 production was achieved via a low do controlling combined with a high fna concentration and the desired influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of the anammox sbr was achieved by regulating the alkalinity or bypass flow regulation specifically in phase i d 114 164 the pn anammox system was fed with 50 diluted ad treated leachate to selectively suppress nob the do concentration in the pn sbr was decreased to 0 2 0 4 mg l additionally because the minimum no2 n concentration and the maximum ph of the pn sbr were 200 mg n l and 7 2 7 5 respectively the fna concentration was consistently 0 08 mg l during long term operation according to eq 2 although the composition of the influent incineration leachate nh4 n cod and ph fluctuated during the operational period the effluent no3 was stable at 25 mg n l and the average nae was maintained at 96 2 fig 2a simultaneously hydrochloric acid 3 mol l was added into the pn sbr to consume surplus alkalinity thus promptly blocking full nitrification and decreasing the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio from 2 31 to 2 90 to around 1 32 however with this control strategy the effluent ph of the pn sbr dropped to 6 0 6 5 resulting in the effluent nh4 and no2 concentrations of the anammox sbr increasing sharply to 64 mg n l and 87 mg n l respectively d 137 150 fig 2a therefore bypass flow regulation was adopted in the subsequent phases ii and iii to obtain the desired no2 n nh4 n ratio in phase ii d 165 187 the pn unit was fed with 50 diluted ad treated leachate and the ad uasb effluent and the pn sbr effluent were mixed as the influent of the anammox sbr on controlling the ad uasb and pn sbr effluent mixture at a flow ratio of 1 3 5 0 3 the influent ph value of the anammox sbr returned to the optimum range of 7 2 7 5 and the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio was successfully stabilized at 1 27 0 1 fig 2b consequently a gradual increase in the nitrogen removal was achieved with an average nre of 79 5 fig 2b in phase iii d 188 237 the pn anammox system was fed with 100 ad effluent and the hydraulic retention times hrts of the pn and anammox reactor was extended to 48 h and 60 h respectively furthermore the anammox sbr effluent was recycled to the pn sbr to remove the no3 produced by the anammox reaction notably the alkalinity of the incinerate leachate increased significantly in this phase resulting in the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio of the pn sbr increasing to 7 28 0 89 thus the mix flow ratio of the ad effluent and pn effluent was regulated at 1 1 78 0 2 v v to maintain the ratio of the influent no2 n to nh4 n at 1 28 0 14 for the anammox sbr ultimately the nae of the pn process was successfully maintained at 97 1 0 7 fig 2a during the stable operational period d 188 237 the ph values of the pn and anammox unit were basically stable at 7 2 7 5 and 7 8 8 5 respectively because of disturbance of anammox caused by the organic compounds supplied in the bypass ad treated leachate the average nre of the anammox sbr decreased to 78 2 fig 2b while the ratiosδno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n in the anammox sbr were maintained at 1 34 0 13 a theoretical value of 1 32 and 0 15 0 02 a theoretical value of 0 26 respectively 3 1 2 variation of aob and anammox bacterial activities during the long term operation the pn anammox process exhibited efficient nitrogen removal performance but the incineration leachate had an adverse effect on the microbial activity in the bioreactors as shown in fig 3 a the activity of anammox bacteria was more significantly inhibited than aob by incineration leachate a similar result was also reported that long term exposure to mature landfill leachate would suppress the growth of anammox bacteria rather than aob wang et al 2019 the ammonia oxidation rate aor of the pn sbr was stable in the range 0 49 0 56 kg n m3 d after fed with 100 incineration leachate although the corresponding saor sharply decreased from 0 32 0 03 to 0 13 0 02 g n g vss d indicating relatively good resistance of aob to the incineration leachate however the saa of the anammox sbr sludge rapidly decreased from 0 53 0 03 g n g vss d to 0 18 0 02 g n g vss d after fed with 100 incineration leachate with the nitrogen removal rate nrr decreasing from 0 75 0 02 to 0 18 0 02 kg n m3 d fig 3b these results confirmed that the capacity of the anammox sludge adapted to organic rich wastewater is very limited such as landfill leachate and reject water wang et al 2020a 3 2 organic carbon flow analysis in the combined ad pn anammox process 3 2 1 long term carbon removal performance the organic compounds were mainly removed from incineration leachate in the ad and the pn unit as shown in fig 2 and table s1 the ad uasb pn sbr and anammox sbr contributed 58 5 32 4 and 10 4 of the bod removal respectively and 55 4 36 3 and 8 3 of the cod removal respectively the enhanced ad unit was continuously operated for 202 days in this study d 25 237 and the average removal efficiencies of bod cod and doc were 58 6 46 5 and 51 9 respectively fig 2c and fig s2a b the bod and cod concentrations of the ad effluent were 850 1280 mg l and 2090 3200 mg l respectively during the stable operational period phase iii and the doc concentration of the ad effluent varied in the range 638 1376 mg l it fluctuated from 684 to 3500 mg l in the influent indicating the complete digestion of anaerobically degradable organic compounds the cod nh4 n ratio of the ad treated incineration leachate decreased to 2 2 0 2 alleviating competition between aob and anammox bacteria with heterotrophic organisms during the stableal operation period d 188 237 the pn sbr exhibited a good bod and cod removal efficiency with values of 73 4 and 54 2 respectively fig 2d and fig s2c whereas for the anammox sbr the organic compound removal was relatively limited with bod and cod removal efficiencies of 28 13 and 12 4 respectively fig 3a and b 3 2 2 gc ms analysis of volatile organic compounds gc ms analysis was performed for volatile organic compound evolution during the whole operation as shown in fig 3c the organic compounds in the incineration leachate could be classified as short chain organic acids alcohols aromatic compounds long chain alkanes and fatty acids the biodegradable organic compounds in the influent such as small molecule acids and carboxylic acids were sufficiently removed in the ad and the pn units but only a few biodegradable organic compounds e g glycerol and azelaic acid were removed in the anammox unit after treatment by the ad pn anammox process the residual organic compounds in the effluent were mainly composed of biorefractory compounds e g alkanes and long chain fatty acids specifically compared with the ad influent the small molecule acids e g cyclohexanol 2 butanoacetic acid and carboxylic acids completely disappeared from the ad effluent and the intensities of glycerol azelaic acid and benzoic acid decreased by 50 the concentrations of biorefractory compounds such as n eicosane were almost unchanged the concentrations of long chain fatty acids e g palmitic acid stearic acid greatly increased which was possibly due to lipid hydrolysis during the ad process fig 3c in the subsequent pn sbr the remaining biodegradable organic compounds such as glycerin and azelaic acid continued to be effectively eliminated but the long chain fatty acids were hardly removed fig 3c in the anammox sbr only a small number of biodegradable organic compounds such as glycerol and azelaic acid were removed fig 3c notably aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and 2 4 di tert butylphenol were detected in the influent of the anammox sbr which have a negative effect on bacteria fortunately the concentrations of these compounds were much lower than the inhibitory concentrations both approximately 10 mg l to anammox bacteria reported previously jin et al 2012 ye et al 2020 3 2 3 analysis of protein like and humic acid like organic compounds using three dimensional eem scans three dimensional eem spectra provided information about the fulvic acid like peak a ex em 250 450 nm tryptophan like peak b ex em 280 345 nm marine humic acid like peak c ex em 330 415 nm and humic acid like peak d ex em 350 460 nm substances in the incineration leachate fig 4 the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan like substances decreased dramatically after treatment by the ad uasb and the pn sbr and humic acid like substances were mainly decreased in the pn and anammox units specifically the tryptophan like substances represented as peak b were completely removed by the ad uasb and pn sbr fig 4a and b compared with the ad influent the intensities of the fluorescent peaks of the humic acid like substances represented as peaks a c and d were enhanced in the ad uasb effluent which might be caused by humification and microbial death in the ad uasb fig 4a after flowing through the pn anammox process the fluorescence intensity of the humic acid like substances represented as peaks a c and d in the incineration leachate significantly decreased fig 4b and c 3 2 4 quantitative analysis of humic acid like substances as high concentration humic acids can negatively affect anammox activity kraiem et al 2019 the humic acid like substances in the influent and effluent of each reactor were analyzed quantitatively at the end of the stable operational period d 234 the concentration of the humic acids in the incineration leachate was 662 6 12 2 mg l and approximately 131 and 158 mg l of the humic acids were removed by the ad uasb and the pn sbr respectively fig s4 although approximately 46 of the humic acids were removed in the ad and pn units the residual humic acids in the anammox influent reached 245 6 3 mg l the value in the effluent of the anammox sbr was 216 7 5 2 mg l these data suggest a limited removal capacity of humic acids by the biological units it is speculated that in the present study the humic acids in the leachate were mainly adsorbed by the sludges in the different bioreactors see section 3 3 1 3 3 pn anammox sludge properties and microbial structure variation after fed with incineration leachate 3 3 1 variation in the eps properties of sludge after fed with incineration leachate the amount of eps of the pn sbr sludge decreased significantly fig 5 b while it remained almost unchanged for the anammox sbr sludge fig 5c this result indicates that microorganisms in the anammox system were stimulated to synthesize and secrete eps for microbial cell protection when exposed to the incineration leachate sem pictures also showed that the amount of eps decreased on the surface of pn sludge fig 5a moreover the protein concentration of the anammox granule eps increased from 24 3 1 1 to 36 6 0 2 mg l fig 5b which might be linked to the secretion of extracellular enzymes by heterotrophic bacteria in the anammox sbr to degrade organic compounds three dimensional eem spectra of the sludge eps in the pn sbr and anammox sbr were analyzed in the different operational phases fig s5 as shown in fig s4 several fluorescent peaks appeared at ex em 350 430 nm and ex em 265 450 nm in both the pn and anammox sludge eps after treating incineration leachate which was considered to be humic acid like substances chen et al 2003 furthermore the fluorescence spectra of both the pn and anammox sludge eps were very similar to that of the incineration leachate fig 4a and fig s2 confirming the adsorption of humic acids by the sludge eps 3 3 2 succession of the microbial community in the pn anammox process the 16s rrna gene sequencing results show at the phylum level that the bacterial community of the pn sbr was dominated by proteobacteria and bacteroidota accounting for 80 of the total bacteria in each sludge sample bacteroidota chloroflexi planctomycetes and proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in the anammox sbr fig s6 after long term operation treating incineration leachate the abundance of functional autotrophic microorganisms aob e g nitrosomonas and anammox bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia declined while the abundance of denitrifying bacteria increased fig 6 for the pn sbr sludge the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied from the initial 43 synthetic wastewater to 44 5 phase i and 42 8 phase ii when 50 leachate was fed but significantly decreased to 19 0 when 100 incineration leachate phase iii was fed fig s6 conversely the relative abundance of bacteroidota increased from 49 3 synthetic wastewater to 67 4 phase iii after 234 days of operation fig s6 within the proteobacteria the relative abundance of the aob related genus nitrosomonas was maintained at 9 0 after fed with incineration leachate in contrast the denitrifying bacteria ottowia and thauera increased from 0 3 to 16 3 and from 0 1 to 1 2 respectively fig 6a among bacteroidota the genus norank f ns9 marine group which was found in high salinity seawater wu 2019 increased from 9 5 to 30 after fed with incineration leachate fig 6a it is speculated that the high salinity of incineration leachate conductivity 2 2 4 6 s m promoted the proliferation of norank f ns9 marine group in the pn sbr candidatus kuenenia was the main anammox bacterium in the anammox sbr herein after fed with incineration leachate for 234 days the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased from 14 3 to 0 5 fig 6b which was consistent with the decline in saa from 0 53 0 03 g n g vss d to 0 18 0 02 g n g vss d fig 3b similar to the pn sbr a variety of denitrifying bacterial genera were also found in the anammox sbr including denitratisoma thermomonas comamonas thauera lautropia dokdonella and steroidobacter with the relative abundance increased above 1 this phenomenon may be related to the residual cod flowing into the anammox unit lefse analysis further illustrated the main differences in species during the whole operation in the pn sbr and the anammox sbr after fed with 100 incineration leachate aside from denitrifying bacteria that were highly enriched in both the pn and the anammox unit taxa related to sulfate reduction were also identified as biomarker microbes in the anammox unit lda 4 p 0 05 fig s7 specifically after the pn sbr was fed with incineration leachate comamonadaceae and sparospiraceae families capable of decomposing complex organic compounds were enriched in phase i khan et al 2002 mcilroy and nielsen 2014 in phase ii ottowia a typical genus of the comamonadaceae was enriched then in phase iii taxa capable of hydrolyzing cellulose e g members of the order chitinophagales were markedly enriched costa et al 2018 in the anammox sbr denitrifiers occurred as biomarker microbes after fed with leachate fig s4b the different microbes included members of the families comamonadaceae chitinophageceae and burkholderiaceae in phase i and the genus truepera in phase ii after 100 incineration leachate was fed taxa involved in sulfate reduction appeared in the anammox sbr as biomarker microbes that is members of the class desulfuromonadia phase iii the results clearly identified microbes that played an indispensable role in resistance to the organic compounds of incineration leachate in the pn sbr and the anammox sbr 4 discussion in this study when fed with fluctuating influent tn of 890 1420 mg n l and cod of 3580 5670 mg l robust performance of the ad pn anammox process was achieved with nre up to 90 it is believed that the proposed versatile control strategy ensured the stable pn performance and high activities of both nitrifier and anammox bacteria in the studied process including i the good cod capture capacity of the enhanced ad process provided a favorable autotrophic environment for the subsequent pn anammox process ii the low do 0 2 0 4 mg l controlling combined with a high fna concentration 0 08 mg l during the pn process ensured a stable pn performance nae 95 iii using a bypass flow regulation strategy that combined the effluents of the ad uasb and the pn sbr as the influent of the anammox sbr and adjusting the mixing flow ratio accurately according to the leachate quality the robustness of the anammox process was realized in treating incineration leachate 4 1 essentiality of the enhanced ad process for treating incineration leachate in this study an ad unit set before the pn anammox process successfully captured 55 of the influent biodegradable bod nearly 50 of the cod for power generation by burning the methane that was produced which contributed to achieving carbon neutral operation during the wastewater treatment process anaerobic digestion is an economical way to transform organic materials into biogas leading to almost complete methane and co2 recovery jain et al 2015 in conventional incineration leachate treatment since an amount of biodegradable carbon is desired to be residual to the subsequent heterotrophic denitrification unit the pre anaerobic digestion is not so complete comparatively when one hopes to substitute the anammox based nitrogen removal processes for the conventional nitrification denitrification processes complete ad should be adopted which has two advantages i it favors the creation of an autotrophic environment for the subsequent pn anammox process thus ensuring the stability of the pn anammox process by suppressing the over proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and ii it allows for an increase in the carbon recovery while also meeting the stringent nitrogen discharge requirements 4 2 strategy for controlling the pn process with high stability and reliability in the pn anammox process stable pn is key to ensuring the subsequent effective anammox process notably a high fa concentration in the incineration leachate fa 19 mg n l according to eq 1 ph 8 0 8 6 and the residual heat supply from msw incineration plants and the ad unit provided suitable substrate and temperature conditions for achieving stable pn the successful operation of the pn process depends on the effective suppression of nob and the enrichment of aob in the system laureni et al 2019 one study has reported that a low do concentration favors the growth of aob over nob gu et al 2021 however because nob taxa like nitrospira also have a competitive advantage in low do conditions it is a challenge to inhibit their growth by only controlling the do concentration wu et al 2021 fna can penetrate cell membranes and act on nucleic acids causing oxidative damage to microbial cells duan et al 2019 because nob are more sensitive to fna than aob by approximately one order of magnitude zhou et al 2011 the activity of nob could be suppressed by high fna in this study benefiting from the high concentration of fna 0 08 mg l during the pn process combined with the low do controlled at 0 2 0 4 mg l the abundance of nob was constantly suppressed to 0 01 fig 6a contributing to a high nae of 95 in the pn process during the whole operation fig 2a from the microbial ecological perspective although incineration leachate dramatically alters the bacterial community structure in the pn process fig 6 and fig s7 the aob taxa e g nitrosomonas exhibited a good ability to coexist with heterotrophs ensuring the stability and reliability of the pn process notably although the enhanced ad process removed approximately 46 4 5 3 of the cod the influent cod concentration of the pn sbr was still high at 1420 2400 mg l fortunately this high cod concentration did not ruin the pn sbr the relative abundance of the functional aob nitrosomonas was still maintained at 9 fig 6 and the nae and aor of the pn sbr were successfully kept at 97 1 0 7 fig 2 and 0 53 0 3 fig 3a respectively there are two reasons for the satisfactory performance of the pn sbr when fed with incineration leachate i biomarker microbes e g ottowia and thauera were associated with the degradation of different organic compounds which consumed cod and reduced the inhibitory effect of cod on aob taxa in the pn sbr fig s7a and ii the aob taxa e g nitrosomonas are adaptable to diverse organic compounds and are viable in a high organic matter environment such as the incineration leachate stein et al 2007 taken together the low do and high fa fna characteristics of the incineration leachate which are inherent properties and good prior carbon capture by the ad unit endowed the pn process with high stability and reliability 4 3 relative susceptibility of the anammox process to incineration leachate in the present study although the anammox sbr exhibited a steady nitrogen removal performance average nre 77 under an innovative control strategy the abundance and activity of the anammox bacteria were proved to be susceptible to the incineration leachate there are two challenges for the robustness of the anammox process in treating incineration leachate i optimization of the influent substrate to no2 n nh4 n 1 32 and ii mitigation of the adverse effects of organic compounds on anammox bacteria to achieve a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio for the anammox influent we adopted two regulation strategies alkalinity regulation and bypass flow regulation bypass flow regulation was found to be more feasible when treating incineration leachate that greatly fluctuates in the influent composition e g seasonally using a strategy that combined the effluents of the ad uasb and the pn sbr as the influent of the anammox sbr and adjusting the mixing flow ratio accurately according to the leachate quality from 3 5 0 3 to 1 78 0 2 the no2 n nh4 n ratio of the influent of anammox sbr was maintained close to the optimum value i e at 1 27 1 28 optimum 1 32 comparatively setting the pn effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio by manually regulating the ratio of alkalinity to ammonium concentration had several disadvantages for example the surplus alkalinity of the incineration leachate for the partial nitrification must be consumed by the addition of acid e g 3 mol l hcl in phase ii to achieve a suitable ph i e 6 0 6 5 of the anammox influent which greatly increases the operational cost for incineration leachate treatment it is obvious that the flow control strategy proposed in this study can avoid the complex regulation in the ratio no2 n nh4 n of the pn effluent and can be readily applied in wastewater treatment plants without a complicated real time control system the second challenge is that the bypass flow of the ad treated leachate inevitably brought the amount of cod flowing into the anammox unit which had an adverse influence on the abundance and activity of the anammox bacteria the organic compounds contained in incineration leachate triggered proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria e g denitratisoma thermomonas and comamonas after fed the anammox sbr with 100 incineration leachate the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia significantly decreased from 14 3 to 0 5 lefse analysis further indicated that taxa involved in sulfate reduction appeared as biomarker microbes after application of 100 incineration leachate such as desulfuromonadia fig s7b we speculate that the proliferation of these denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria may be responsible for the decline in the abundance of anammox bacteria in the anammox sbr because they could compete with anammox bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia for nitrite the organic compounds in incineration leachate also had an inhibitory effect on the anammox bacterial activity resulting in a 66 2 decrease of saa fig 3b on the basis of the organic carbon flow analysis results it is clear that the remaining cod in the influent of the anammox sbr was mainly composed of biorefractory organic components such as humic acids fig 3c and 4 humic acids are generally considered as recalcitrant organics which do not impact the performance of biological processes e g nitritation luo et al 2019 however studies have recently reported that humic acids can inhibit both hydrolytic and methanogenic processes by lowering enzyme activities for example by forming complexes with hydrolytic enzymes preventing them from binding with cellulose yap et al 2018 and they can form chelates with metals in incineration leachate which furthers inhibit the growth of microorganisms li et al 2021 furthermore humic acids were found to have a remarkable inhibitory effect on anammox bacteria liu et al 2021 and the anammox activity could be decreased by 57 at a humic acid concentration of 200 mg l kraiem et al 2019 as section 3 2 mentioned the concentration of humic acids reached 245 6 3 mg l in the anammox unit here fig s5 which exceeded the reported inhibitory concentration toward anammox bacteria 200 mg l moreover three dimensional eem spectra of anammox sludge revealed that anammox granule eps adsorbed some humic acid like substances fig s5 possibly providing a micro environment with a high concentration of humic acids for the anammox bacteria we speculate that humic acids might be the main component of incineration leachate that has an inhibitory effect on anammox activity therefore to maintain the abundance and activity of anammox bacteria the pretreatment of organic compounds especially the removal of biorefractory organics i e humic acids is a key issue that needs to be considered in the anammox based process treatment of incineration leachate 4 4 application advantages and perspectives our results show that there are remarkable advantages of using anammox based process treatment of incineration leachate first incineration leachate has sufficient heating value to serve as a natural heater for the pn anammox system and to maintain high activities of aob and anammox bacteria second incineration leachate is inherently characterized by a high concentration of fa providing a key guarantee for the highly efficient and robust operation of the pn anammox process third the pn anammox process was predicted to use only 60 of the electricity of an equivalent nitrification denitrification system on a per kilogram n basis de graaff et al 2011 vineyard et al 2020 and offers benefits in alleviating membrane fouling during the subsequent membrane driven processes fig s8 further decreasing the cost of full scale treatment of incineration leachate finally desirable nitrogen removal performance can be achieved using a versatile control strategy based on our results therefore the anammox based process has good application potential for the sustainable treatment of incineration leachate despite the prominent advantages possessed by the pn anammox process in treatment of incineration leachate further improvements are anticipated in the future a critical issue is that biorefractory organic compounds e g humic acids had an adverse impact on the anammox bacteria which greatly decreased the anammox activity therefore pretreatment of the influent of the anammox unit is vital to ensure robust operation of the anammox based system techniques such as using advanced oxidation processes yin et al 2020 and adopting adsorption technologies using activated carbon biochar or nanoparticles jung et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 can be considered to remove these biorefractory organic compounds simultaneously improving the resistance capacity of the anammox based system to the adverse factors including optimization of reactor configuration and operation mode e g mainstream sidestream wastewater switch zekker et al 2021 the formation of anammox granules and the enhancement of sludge resistance with carriers will also be important for efficient operation finally the susceptibility of the anammox process to incineration leachate results in high personnel requirements for incineration leachate treatment plants thus improved management of and training on anammox technology for employees is important these improvements deserve attention in future research and will aid with the application of anammox based technology in the treatment of incineration leachate and other refractory wastewaters conclusions incineration leachate possesses characteristics including a high fa concentration and heating value inherently suitable properties for highly efficient and robust operation of the pn anammox process however the high concentrations of organic compounds in incineration leachate pose challenges here for the first time a pn anammox system has been established coupled with enhanced ad for incineration leachate treatment and a versatile control strategy is proposed the main conclusions of this study are as follows the pn anammox process is effective in treatment of incineration leachate with mean tn and cod removal efficiencies of 90 and 78 respectively even with great fluctuation of the influent composition by using enhanced ad nearly 50 of the cod was captured due to the well coexist ability with heterotrophs and diverse organic compounds adaptability of aob taxa e g nitrosomonas the pn unit was adapted to residual cod 1420 2400 mg l the long term suppression of nob 0 1 was achieved by controlling a low do 0 2 0 4 mg l combined with the high fna concentration 0 08 mg l and temperature 30 c providing an effective pn performance with nae 95 the anammox process was more sensitive than the pn process to organic compounds from the incineration leachate the residual humic acids in the anammox sbr 245 6 3 mg l might be the main components that inhibit anammox activity the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria induced by the organic compounds may be responsible for a decline in the abundance of anammox bacteria i e candidatus kuenenia declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16170,anammox based process provides an alternative for the sustainable treatment of incineration leachate that has high load ammonium and high residual heat but the high concentrations of organics in such leachates brought challenges for the process control for the first time a two stage partial nitrification pn anammox process coupled with a pre enhanced anaerobic digestion ad was established to achieve efficient nitrogen removal from incineration leachate satisfactory nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiencies were achieved with the average values of 90 and 78 respectively despite fluctuating influent properties 1100 2000 mg total nitrogen tn l and 3800 15800 mg cod l a versatile control strategy was developed to create an optimum autotrophic environment for nitrifier and anammox bacteria i enhanced ad set before the pn anammox process captured nearly 50 of the influent cod ii in the pn unit ammonia oxidizing bacteria were well adapted to cod concentrations of 1420 2400 mg l and dissolved oxygen 0 2 0 4 mg l controlling combined with a high free nitrous acid concentration 0 08 mg l ensured a nitrite accumulation rate of 95 and iii in the anammox unit a suitable influent no2 n nh4 n ratio the average value of 1 27 was achieved by mixing ad effluent with pn effluent 1 1 78 v v contributing to a high tn removal of 78 2 4 nevertheless 980 1560 mg l of cod remained in the influent of the anammox unit biorefractory humic acids in this 245 6 3 mg l might be the main component that caused the observed 66 2 decrease in anammox activity the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria induced by the organic compounds may have led to the observed decline in the abundance of the anammox bacterium candidatus kuenenia the proposed strategy guaranteed the robust operation of the pn anammox process and provides a promising approach for the sustainable treatment of incineration leachate graphical abstract image graphical abstract

effective method for reducing municipal solid waste msw volume and harvesting energy ji et al 2016 makarichi et al 2018 from a life cycle perspective the combination of recycling and incineration is deemed optimal for msw management and has been accepted in many countries including in europe japan and china bruno et al 2021 cui et al 2020 tabata and tsai 2016 the proportion of total msw treatment by incineration rapidly increased worldwide in the past decade including from 15 to 50 in china from 2009 to 2018 ding et al 2021 in general to improve the corresponding heat value before incineration the msws are accumulated and fermented in a pit for days to allow moisture to drain from the refuse resulting in the production of a considerable amount of incineration leachate lei et al 2019 incineration leachate is highly variable and complex wastewater that contains high concentrations of organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod 10 000 80 000 mg l and ammonium 1000 3000 mg l as well as harmful components such as metals ions e g pb ni zn ca and refractory organic compounds e g humic and fulvic like substances mitrano et al 2017 shi et al 2022 generally the biological oxygen demand bod cod and refractory organic compound concentration in incineration leachate are several times higher than those in landfill leachate ghosh and thakur 2014 pastore et al 2018 for example humic substances in incineration leachate are approximately 2 10 folds higher than that of landfill leachate leading to poor biodegradability of the effluent renou et al 2008 it is a big challenge to treat incineration leachate efficiently and stably not only because it contains numerous complex organic compounds but also because these organic compounds markedly disturb the biological nitrogen removal treatment performance nitrification process at present the combined two stage anoxic oxic a o membrane bioreactor mbr membrane driven process is widely applied for leachate treatment to meet strict nitrogen discharge standards of leachate for example the effluent total nitrogen tn must be 40 mg l in china national standard gb18485 2014 peng et al 2008 shao et al 2021 the two stage anoxic oxic a o process as a key biological treatment unit relies on autotrophic nitrifiers for conversion of ammonium to nitrate and heterotrophic denitrifiers for conversion of nitrate to gaseous dinitrogen chu et al 2021 to make this process robust and achieve a low effluent tn concentration high aeration addition of organic carbon and a high recycling rate even 2000 recycling of the nitrification supernatant to the predenitrification unit are required which leads to a high cost for treatment of incineration leachate liu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 therefore more efficient and economic techniques are urgently required for the treatment of incineration leachate aiming toward carbon neutrality in the process anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has revolutionized nitrogen removal from wastewater because of its economic and environmentally friendly advantages kartal et al 2010 kuenen 2008 anammox bacteria can directly convert nh4 to n2 in anoxic conditions with no2 as the electron acceptor kuenen 2008 the application of the anammox process can save 60 oxygen and 100 carbon compared with conventional biological nitrogen removal technology ma et al 2016 indeed landfill leachate treatment via the deammonification process could save 83 5 of the cost compared with the conventional nitrification and denitrification process mohammad pajooh et al 2017 thus far 200 partial nitrification anammox pn anammox facilities have been built to treat ammonium rich wastewaters such as landfill leachate and reject water most of which are characterized by a low cod n ratio e g 0 5 mccarty 2018 wang et al 2020a however for incineration leachate the influent cod n ratio is generally within the range 3 9 nie et al 2020 ye et al 2014 which is a double edged sword effect for the application of an anammox based process the biodegradable organic carbon in incineration leachate can first be captured by using an anaerobic digestion ad unit for methane resource recovery then the methane can be combusted to produce heat which together with the residual heat from the incineration plant keep the pn anammox units at 30 c helping to maintain high activities of both pn and anammox however a faction of the organic compounds inevitably flows into the subsequent pn anammox process destroying the autotrophic environment and finally disrupting the anammox performance peng et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge the application of the pn anammox process for incineration leachate treatment is still limited li et al 2018 wang et al 2020a ye et al 2020 but it requires urgent development in this study a two stage pn anammox system combined with a pre enhanced carbon capture ad unit was established and operated for 230 days treating incineration leachate the objectives of the study were as follows i to examine the feasibility of applying the pn anammox process in efficient treatment of incineration leachate and ii to determine the optimal parameters for the pn and anammox operation focused on inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and reducing disturbance of the anammox bacteria by organic compounds the microbial community sludge morphology and extracellular polymeric substances eps composition were examined for pn and anammox sludges to correlate them with the treatment performance significantly the organic carbon flow analysis in the treatment process was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the effect of organic compounds on the microbial communities and activities of functional bacteria on the basis of this study we hope to accelerate the application of the anammox based process in treating high organic and ammonium containing wastewater to progress toward carbon neutrality in the msw incineration industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operational strategies the semi continuous tests were carried out in three reactors an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor for ad ad uasb and sequencing batch reactors for pn and anammox pn sbr anammox sbr fig 1 a with effective volumes of 6 l 2 l and 2 5 l and

operated for 237 days which was divided into four phase table 1 in phases ii and iii the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of the anammox sbr was regulated by bypass flow of the ad uasb effluent and the pn

the contents of proteins and humic acids were analyzed by a modified lowry method using bovine serum albumin and humic acids as standards respectively the content of polysaccharides was measured by the anthrone method using glucose as a standard 2 2 4 gc ms analysis the organic compounds in leachate were identified by gc ms according to the procedure reported by wang et al 2020a the organic compounds in wastewater were firstly extracted using dichloromethane as described by kunacheva et al 2017 gc ms analysis was performed using an hp7890gc 5795ms apparatus equipped with an hp 5 column the carrier gas he flow rate was 1 0 ml min the initial column temperature was set to 50 c held for 8 min then it was raised to 200 c at 8 c min then increased to 220 c at 4 c min and finally increased to 260 c at 5 c min the injector and transfer line temperature were 230 c the injection volume was 1 μl and the split ratio was 1 10 the ms conditions were voltage 1 05 kv ei 50 ev scan

surmacz gorska et al 1996 specific anammox activity saa represented by the rate of substrate consumed per biomass per day was determined in situ in the anammox sbr according to wang et al 2020a the initial nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were both controlled at 50 mg n l the determination methods of saor and saa are detailed in the supplementary materials text s3 2 2 6 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing microbial community characteristics of pn and anammox sludge were compared between the synthetic wastewater operation phase and the leachate operation phase the illumina miseq platform was employed to sequence bacterial 16s rrna genes using 338f and 806r as primers v3 v4 region trimmed sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units using a 97 identity threshold to determine the classified bacterial taxa with significant abundance differences during the whole operation we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 3 results although the influent concentrations of tn bod and cod greatly fluctuated in the ranges 1100 2000 mg n l 1700 9400 mg l and 3800 15 800 mg l respectively the combined ad pn anammox process achieved a relatively stable and effective performance in which the effluent nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations were low at 30 70 30 60 and 20 40 mg n l respectively and the bod and cod were 150 370 and 750 1370 mg l respectively table s1 during the stable operational period treating 100 leachate the ad pn anammox process removed approximately 90 of the tn 88 of the bod and 76 of the cod 3 1 nitrogen removal performance the pn anammox process was successfully initialized using synthetic wastewater start up phase d 1 113 fig s1 a nitrite accumulation rate nae of 97 2 and a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 86 1 were achieved in the pn sbr and anammox sbr respectively after fed by incineration leachate the pn sbr maintained a stable and satisfactory performance with an nae of 96 1 fig 2 a and stable tn removal efficiency was achieved for each phase in the anammox sbr with mean nre 77 fig 2b 3 1 1 control strategy and long term performance of the pn anammox system to successfully manipulate the pn anammox process two measures are essential maintaining no2 accumulation suppressing no3 formation in the pn effluent and maintaining a suitable effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio i e around 1 32 in the anammox influent lackner et al 2014 in this study suppressing no3 production was achieved via a low do controlling combined with a high fna concentration and the desired influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of the anammox sbr was achieved by regulating the alkalinity or bypass flow regulation specifically in phase i d 114 164 the pn anammox system was fed with 50 diluted ad treated leachate to selectively suppress nob the do concentration in the pn sbr was decreased to 0 2 0 4 mg l additionally because the minimum no2 n concentration and the maximum ph of the pn sbr were 200 mg n l and 7 2 7 5 respectively the fna concentration was consistently 0 08 mg l during long term operation according to eq 2 although the composition of the influent incineration leachate nh4 n cod and ph fluctuated during the operational period the effluent no3 was stable at 25 mg n l and the average nae was maintained at 96 2 fig 2a simultaneously hydrochloric acid 3 mol l was added into the pn sbr to consume surplus alkalinity thus promptly blocking full nitrification and decreasing the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio from 2 31 to 2 90 to around 1 32 however with this control strategy the effluent ph of the pn sbr dropped to 6 0 6 5 resulting in the effluent nh4 and no2 concentrations of the anammox sbr increasing sharply to 64 mg n l and 87 mg n l respectively d 137 150 fig 2a therefore bypass flow regulation was adopted in the subsequent phases ii and iii to obtain the desired no2 n nh4 n ratio in phase ii d 165 187 the pn unit was fed with 50 diluted ad treated leachate and the ad uasb effluent and the pn sbr effluent were mixed as the influent of the anammox sbr on controlling the ad uasb and pn sbr effluent mixture at a flow ratio of 1 3 5 0 3 the influent ph value of the anammox sbr returned to the optimum range of 7 2 7 5 and the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio was successfully stabilized at 1 27 0 1 fig 2b consequently a gradual increase in the nitrogen removal was achieved with an average nre of 79 5 fig 2b in phase iii d 188 237 the pn anammox system was fed with 100 ad effluent and the hydraulic retention times hrts of the pn and anammox reactor was extended to 48 h and 60 h respectively furthermore the anammox sbr effluent was recycled to the pn sbr to remove the no3 produced by the anammox reaction notably the alkalinity of the incinerate leachate increased significantly in this phase resulting in the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio of the pn sbr increasing to 7 28 0 89 thus the mix flow ratio of the ad effluent and pn effluent was regulated at 1 1 78 0 2 v v to maintain the ratio of the influent no2 n to nh4 n at 1 28 0 14 for the anammox sbr ultimately the nae of the pn process was successfully maintained at 97 1 0 7 fig 2a during the stable operational period d 188 237 the ph values of the pn and anammox unit were basically stable at 7 2 7 5 and 7 8 8 5 respectively because of disturbance of anammox caused by the organic compounds supplied in the bypass ad treated leachate the average nre of the anammox sbr decreased to 78 2 fig 2b while the ratiosδno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n in the anammox sbr were maintained at 1 34 0 13 a theoretical value of 1 32 and 0 15 0 02 a theoretical value of 0 26 respectively 3 1 2 variation of aob and anammox bacterial activities during the long term operation the pn anammox process exhibited efficient nitrogen removal performance but the incineration leachate had an adverse effect on the microbial activity in the bioreactors as shown in fig 3 a the activity of anammox bacteria was more significantly inhibited than aob by incineration leachate a similar result was also reported that long term exposure to mature landfill leachate would suppress the growth of anammox bacteria rather than aob wang et al 2019 the ammonia oxidation rate aor of the pn sbr was stable in the range 0 49 0 56 kg n m3 d after fed with 100 incineration leachate although the corresponding saor sharply decreased from 0 32 0 03 to 0 13 0 02 g n g vss d indicating relatively good resistance of aob to the incineration leachate however the saa of the anammox sbr sludge rapidly decreased from 0 53 0 03 g n g vss d to 0 18 0 02 g n g vss d after fed with 100 incineration leachate with the nitrogen removal rate nrr decreasing from 0 75 0 02 to 0 18 0 02 kg n m3 d fig 3b these results confirmed that the capacity of the anammox sludge adapted to organic rich wastewater is very limited such as landfill leachate and reject water wang et al 2020a 3 2 organic carbon flow analysis in the combined ad pn anammox process 3 2 1 long term carbon removal performance the organic compounds were mainly removed from incineration leachate in the ad and the pn unit as shown in fig 2 and table s1 the ad uasb pn sbr and anammox sbr contributed 58 5 32 4 and 10 4 of the bod removal respectively and 55 4 36 3 and 8 3 of the cod removal respectively the enhanced ad unit was continuously operated for 202 days in this study d 25 237 and the average removal efficiencies of bod cod and doc were 58 6 46 5 and 51 9 respectively fig 2c and fig s2a b the bod and cod concentrations of the ad effluent were 850 1280 mg l and 2090 3200 mg l respectively during the stable operational period phase iii and the doc concentration of the ad effluent varied in the range 638 1376 mg l it fluctuated from 684 to 3500 mg l in the influent indicating the complete digestion of anaerobically degradable organic compounds the cod nh4 n ratio of the ad treated incineration leachate decreased to 2 2 0 2 alleviating competition between aob and anammox bacteria with heterotrophic organisms during the stableal operation period d 188 237 the pn sbr exhibited a good bod and cod removal efficiency with values of 73 4 and 54 2 respectively fig 2d and fig s2c whereas for the anammox sbr the organic compound removal was relatively limited with bod and cod removal efficiencies of 28 13 and 12 4 respectively fig 3a and b 3 2 2 gc ms analysis of volatile organic compounds gc ms analysis was performed for volatile organic compound evolution during the whole operation as shown in fig 3c the organic compounds in the incineration leachate could be classified as short chain organic acids alcohols aromatic compounds long chain alkanes and fatty acids the biodegradable organic compounds in the influent such as small molecule acids and carboxylic acids were sufficiently removed in the ad and the pn units but only a few biodegradable organic compounds e g glycerol and azelaic acid were removed in the anammox unit after treatment by the ad pn anammox process the residual organic compounds in the effluent were mainly composed of biorefractory compounds e g alkanes and long chain fatty acids specifically compared with the ad influent the small molecule acids e g cyclohexanol 2 butanoacetic acid and carboxylic acids completely disappeared from the ad effluent and the intensities of glycerol azelaic acid and benzoic acid decreased by 50 the concentrations of biorefractory compounds such as n eicosane were almost unchanged the concentrations of long chain fatty acids e g palmitic acid stearic acid greatly increased which was possibly due to lipid hydrolysis during the ad process fig 3c in the subsequent pn sbr the remaining biodegradable organic compounds such as glycerin and azelaic acid continued to be effectively eliminated but the long chain fatty acids were hardly removed fig 3c in the anammox sbr only a small number of biodegradable organic compounds such as glycerol and azelaic acid were removed fig 3c notably aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and 2 4 di tert butylphenol were detected in the influent of the anammox sbr which have a negative effect on bacteria fortunately the concentrations of these compounds were much lower than the inhibitory concentrations both approximately 10 mg l to anammox bacteria reported previously jin et al 2012 ye et al 2020 3 2 3 analysis of protein like and humic acid like organic compounds using three dimensional eem scans three dimensional eem spectra provided information about the fulvic acid like peak a ex em 250 450 nm tryptophan like peak b ex em 280 345 nm marine humic acid like peak c ex em 330 415 nm and humic acid like peak d ex em 350 460 nm substances in the incineration leachate fig 4 the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan like substances decreased dramatically after treatment by the ad uasb and the pn sbr and humic acid like substances were mainly decreased in the pn and anammox units specifically the tryptophan like substances represented as peak b were completely removed by the ad uasb and pn sbr fig 4a and b compared with the ad influent the intensities of the fluorescent peaks of the humic acid like substances represented as peaks a c and d were enhanced in the ad uasb effluent which might be caused by humification and microbial death in the ad uasb fig 4a after flowing through the pn anammox process the fluorescence intensity of the humic acid like substances represented as peaks a c and d in the incineration leachate significantly decreased fig 4b and c 3 2 4 quantitative analysis of humic acid like substances as high concentration humic acids can negatively affect anammox activity kraiem et al 2019 the humic acid like substances in the influent and effluent of each reactor were analyzed quantitatively at the end of the stable operational period d 234 the concentration of the humic acids in the incineration leachate was 662 6 12 2 mg l and approximately 131 and 158 mg l of the humic acids were removed by the ad uasb and the pn sbr respectively fig s4 although approximately 46 of the humic acids were removed in the ad and pn units the residual humic acids in the anammox influent reached 245 6 3 mg l the value in the effluent of the anammox sbr was 216 7 5 2 mg l these data suggest a limited removal capacity of humic acids by the biological units it is speculated that in the present study the humic acids in the leachate were mainly adsorbed by the sludges in the different bioreactors see section 3 3 1 3 3 pn anammox sludge properties and microbial structure variation after fed with incineration leachate 3 3 1 variation in the eps properties of sludge after fed with incineration leachate the amount of eps of the pn sbr sludge decreased significantly fig 5 b while it remained almost unchanged for the anammox sbr sludge fig 5c this result indicates that microorganisms in the anammox system were stimulated to synthesize and secrete eps for microbial cell protection when exposed to the incineration leachate sem pictures also showed that the amount of eps decreased on the surface of pn sludge fig 5a moreover the protein concentration of the anammox granule eps increased from 24 3 1 1 to 36 6 0 2 mg l fig 5b which might be linked to the secretion of extracellular enzymes by heterotrophic bacteria in the anammox sbr to degrade organic compounds three dimensional eem spectra of the sludge eps in the pn sbr and anammox sbr were analyzed in the different operational phases fig s5 as shown in fig s4 several fluorescent peaks appeared at ex em 350 430 nm and ex em 265 450 nm in both the pn and anammox sludge eps after treating incineration leachate which was considered to be humic acid like substances chen et al 2003 furthermore the fluorescence spectra of both the pn and anammox sludge eps were very similar to that of the incineration leachate fig 4a and fig s2 confirming the adsorption of humic acids by the sludge eps 3 3 2 succession of the microbial community in the pn anammox process the 16s rrna gene sequencing results show at the phylum level that the bacterial community of the pn sbr was dominated by proteobacteria and bacteroidota accounting for 80 of the total bacteria in each sludge sample bacteroidota chloroflexi planctomycetes and proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in the anammox sbr fig s6 after long term operation treating incineration leachate the abundance of functional autotrophic microorganisms aob e g nitrosomonas and anammox bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia declined while the abundance of denitrifying bacteria increased fig 6 for the pn sbr sludge the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied from the initial 43 synthetic wastewater to 44 5 phase i and 42 8 phase ii when 50 leachate was fed but significantly decreased to 19 0 when 100 incineration leachate phase iii was fed fig s6 conversely the relative abundance of bacteroidota increased from 49 3 synthetic wastewater to 67 4 phase iii after 234 days of operation fig s6 within the proteobacteria the relative abundance of the aob related genus nitrosomonas was maintained at 9 0 after fed with incineration leachate in contrast the denitrifying bacteria ottowia and thauera increased from 0 3 to 16 3 and from 0 1 to 1 2 respectively fig 6a among bacteroidota the genus norank f ns9 marine group which was found in high salinity seawater wu 2019 increased from 9 5 to 30 after fed with incineration leachate fig 6a it is speculated that the high salinity of incineration leachate conductivity 2 2 4 6 s m promoted the proliferation of norank f ns9 marine group in the pn sbr candidatus kuenenia was the main anammox bacterium in the anammox sbr herein after fed with incineration leachate for 234 days the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased from 14 3 to 0 5 fig 6b which was consistent with the decline in saa from 0 53 0 03 g n g vss d to 0 18 0 02 g n g vss d fig 3b similar to the pn sbr a variety of denitrifying bacterial genera were also found in the anammox sbr including denitratisoma thermomonas comamonas thauera lautropia dokdonella and steroidobacter with the relative abundance increased above 1 this phenomenon may be related to the residual cod flowing into the anammox unit lefse analysis further illustrated the main differences in species during the whole operation in the pn sbr and the anammox sbr after fed with 100 incineration leachate aside from denitrifying bacteria that were highly enriched in both the pn and the anammox unit taxa related to sulfate reduction were also identified as biomarker microbes in the anammox unit lda 4 p 0 05 fig s7 specifically after the pn sbr was fed with incineration leachate comamonadaceae and sparospiraceae families capable of decomposing complex organic compounds were enriched in phase i khan et al 2002 mcilroy and nielsen 2014 in phase ii ottowia a typical genus of the comamonadaceae was enriched then in phase iii taxa capable of hydrolyzing cellulose e g members of the order chitinophagales were markedly enriched costa et al 2018 in the anammox sbr denitrifiers occurred as biomarker microbes after fed with leachate fig s4b the different microbes included members of the families comamonadaceae chitinophageceae and burkholderiaceae in phase i and the genus truepera in phase ii after 100 incineration leachate was fed taxa involved in sulfate reduction appeared in the anammox sbr as biomarker microbes that is members of the class desulfuromonadia phase iii the results clearly identified microbes that played an indispensable role in resistance to the organic compounds of incineration leachate in the pn sbr and the anammox sbr 4 discussion in this study when fed with fluctuating influent tn of 890 1420 mg n l and cod of 3580 5670 mg l robust performance of the ad pn anammox process was achieved with nre up to 90 it is believed that the proposed versatile control strategy ensured the stable pn performance and high activities of both nitrifier and anammox bacteria in the studied process including i the good cod capture capacity of the enhanced ad process provided a favorable autotrophic environment for the subsequent pn anammox process ii the low do 0 2 0 4 mg l controlling combined with a high fna concentration 0 08 mg l during the pn process ensured a stable pn performance nae 95 iii using a bypass flow regulation strategy that combined the effluents of the ad uasb and the pn sbr as the influent of the anammox sbr and adjusting the mixing flow ratio accurately according to the leachate quality the robustness of the anammox process was realized in treating incineration leachate 4 1 essentiality of the enhanced ad process for treating incineration leachate in this study an ad unit set before the pn anammox process successfully captured 55 of the influent biodegradable bod nearly 50 of the cod for power generation by burning the methane that was produced which contributed to achieving carbon neutral operation during the wastewater treatment process anaerobic digestion is an economical way to transform organic materials into biogas leading to almost complete methane and co2 recovery jain et al 2015 in conventional incineration leachate treatment since an amount of biodegradable carbon is desired to be residual to the subsequent heterotrophic denitrification unit the pre anaerobic digestion is not so complete comparatively when one hopes to substitute the anammox based nitrogen removal processes for the conventional nitrification denitrification processes complete ad should be adopted which has two advantages i it favors the creation of an autotrophic environment for the subsequent pn anammox process thus ensuring the stability of the pn anammox process by suppressing the over proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and ii it allows for an increase in the carbon recovery while also meeting the stringent nitrogen discharge requirements 4 2 strategy for controlling the pn process with high stability and reliability in the pn anammox process stable pn is key to ensuring the subsequent effective anammox process notably a high fa concentration in the incineration leachate fa 19 mg n l according to eq 1 ph 8 0 8 6 and the residual heat supply from msw incineration plants and the ad unit provided suitable substrate and temperature conditions for achieving stable pn the successful operation of the pn process depends on the effective suppression of nob and the enrichment of aob in the system laureni et al 2019 one study has reported that a low do concentration favors the growth of aob over nob gu et al 2021 however because nob taxa like nitrospira also have a competitive advantage in low do conditions it is a challenge to inhibit their growth by only controlling the do concentration wu et al 2021 fna can penetrate cell membranes and act on nucleic acids causing oxidative damage to microbial cells duan et al 2019 because nob are more sensitive to fna than aob by approximately one order of magnitude zhou et al 2011 the activity of nob could be suppressed by high fna in this study benefiting from the high concentration of fna 0 08 mg l during the pn process combined with the low do controlled at 0 2 0 4 mg l the abundance of nob was constantly suppressed to 0 01 fig 6a contributing to a high nae of 95 in the pn process during the whole operation fig 2a from the microbial ecological perspective although incineration leachate dramatically alters the bacterial community structure in the pn process fig 6 and fig s7 the aob taxa e g nitrosomonas exhibited a good ability to coexist with heterotrophs ensuring the stability and reliability of the pn process notably although the enhanced ad process removed approximately 46 4 5 3 of the cod the influent cod concentration of the pn sbr was still high at 1420 2400 mg l fortunately this high cod concentration did not ruin the pn sbr the relative abundance of the functional aob nitrosomonas was still maintained at 9 fig 6 and the nae and aor of the pn sbr were successfully kept at 97 1 0 7 fig 2 and 0 53 0 3 fig 3a respectively there are two reasons for the satisfactory performance of the pn sbr when fed with incineration leachate i biomarker microbes e g ottowia and thauera were associated with the degradation of different organic compounds which consumed cod and reduced the inhibitory effect of cod on aob taxa in the pn sbr fig s7a and ii the aob taxa e g nitrosomonas are adaptable to diverse organic compounds and are viable in a high organic matter environment such as the incineration leachate stein et al 2007 taken together the low do and high fa fna characteristics of the incineration leachate which are inherent properties and good prior carbon capture by the ad unit endowed the pn process with high stability and reliability 4 3 relative susceptibility of the anammox process to incineration leachate in the present study although the anammox sbr exhibited a steady nitrogen removal performance average nre 77 under an innovative control strategy the abundance and activity of the anammox bacteria were proved to be susceptible to the incineration leachate there are two challenges for the robustness of the anammox process in treating incineration leachate i optimization of the influent substrate to no2 n nh4 n 1 32 and ii mitigation of the adverse effects of organic compounds on anammox bacteria to achieve a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio for the anammox influent we adopted two regulation strategies alkalinity regulation and bypass flow regulation bypass flow regulation was found to be more feasible when treating incineration leachate that greatly fluctuates in the influent composition e g seasonally using a strategy that combined the effluents of the ad uasb and the pn sbr as the influent of the anammox sbr and adjusting the mixing flow ratio accurately according to the leachate quality from 3 5 0 3 to 1 78 0 2 the no2 n nh4 n ratio of the influent of anammox sbr was maintained close to the optimum value i e at 1 27 1 28 optimum 1 32 comparatively setting the pn effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio by manually regulating the ratio of alkalinity to ammonium concentration had several disadvantages for example the surplus alkalinity of the incineration leachate for the partial nitrification must be consumed by the addition of acid e g 3 mol l hcl in phase ii to achieve a suitable ph i e 6 0 6 5 of the anammox influent which greatly increases the operational cost for incineration leachate treatment it is obvious that the flow control strategy proposed in this study can avoid the complex regulation in the ratio no2 n nh4 n of the pn effluent and can be readily applied in wastewater treatment plants without a complicated real time control system the second challenge is that the bypass flow of the ad treated leachate inevitably brought the amount of cod flowing into the anammox unit which had an adverse influence on the abundance and activity of the anammox bacteria the organic compounds contained in incineration leachate triggered proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria e g denitratisoma thermomonas and comamonas after fed the anammox sbr with 100 incineration leachate the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia significantly decreased from 14 3 to 0 5 lefse analysis further indicated that taxa involved in sulfate reduction appeared as biomarker microbes after application of 100 incineration leachate such as desulfuromonadia fig s7b we speculate that the proliferation of these denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria may be responsible for the decline in the abundance of anammox bacteria in the anammox sbr because they could compete with anammox bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia for nitrite the organic compounds in incineration leachate also had an inhibitory effect on the anammox bacterial activity resulting in a 66 2 decrease of saa fig 3b on the basis of the organic carbon flow analysis results it is clear that the remaining cod in the influent of the anammox sbr was mainly composed of biorefractory organic components such as humic acids fig 3c and 4 humic acids are generally considered as recalcitrant organics which do not impact the performance of biological processes e g nitritation luo et al 2019 however studies have recently reported that humic acids can inhibit both hydrolytic and methanogenic processes by lowering enzyme activities for example by forming complexes with hydrolytic enzymes preventing them from binding with cellulose yap et al 2018 and they can form chelates with metals in incineration leachate which furthers inhibit the growth of microorganisms li et al 2021 furthermore humic acids were found to have a remarkable inhibitory effect on anammox bacteria liu et al 2021 and the anammox activity could be decreased by 57 at a humic acid concentration of 200 mg l kraiem et al 2019 as section 3 2 mentioned the concentration of humic acids reached 245 6 3 mg l in the anammox unit here fig s5 which exceeded the reported inhibitory concentration toward anammox bacteria 200 mg l moreover three dimensional eem spectra of anammox sludge revealed that anammox granule eps adsorbed some humic acid like substances fig s5 possibly providing a micro environment with a high concentration of humic acids for the anammox bacteria we speculate that humic acids might be the main component of incineration leachate that has an inhibitory effect on anammox activity therefore to maintain the abundance and activity of anammox bacteria the pretreatment of organic compounds especially the removal of biorefractory organics i e humic acids is a key issue that needs to be considered in the anammox based process treatment of incineration leachate 4 4 application advantages and perspectives our results show that there are remarkable advantages of using anammox based process treatment of incineration leachate first incineration leachate has sufficient heating value to serve as a natural heater for the pn anammox system and to maintain high activities of aob and anammox bacteria second incineration leachate is inherently characterized by a high concentration of fa providing a key guarantee for the highly efficient and robust operation of the pn anammox process third the pn anammox process was predicted to use only 60 of the electricity of an equivalent nitrification denitrification system on a per kilogram n basis de graaff et al 2011 vineyard et al 2020 and offers benefits in alleviating membrane fouling during the subsequent membrane driven processes fig s8 further decreasing the cost of full scale treatment of incineration leachate finally desirable nitrogen removal performance can be achieved using a versatile control strategy based on our results therefore the anammox based process has good application potential for the sustainable treatment of incineration leachate despite the prominent advantages possessed by the pn anammox process in treatment of incineration leachate further improvements are anticipated in the future a critical issue is that biorefractory organic compounds e g humic acids had an adverse impact on the anammox bacteria which greatly decreased the anammox activity therefore pretreatment of the influent of the anammox unit is vital to ensure robust operation of the anammox based system techniques such as using advanced oxidation processes yin et al 2020 and adopting adsorption technologies using activated carbon biochar or nanoparticles jung et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 can be considered to remove these biorefractory organic compounds simultaneously improving the resistance capacity of the anammox based system to the adverse factors including optimization of reactor configuration and operation mode e g mainstream sidestream wastewater switch zekker et al 2021 the formation of anammox granules and the enhancement of sludge resistance with carriers will also be important for efficient operation finally the susceptibility of the anammox process to incineration leachate results in high personnel requirements for incineration leachate treatment plants thus improved management of and training on anammox technology for employees is important these improvements deserve attention in future research and will aid with the application of anammox based technology in the treatment of incineration leachate and other refractory wastewaters conclusions incineration leachate possesses characteristics including a high fa concentration and heating value inherently suitable properties for highly efficient and robust operation of the pn anammox process however the high concentrations of organic compounds in incineration leachate pose challenges here for the first time a pn anammox system has been established coupled with enhanced ad for incineration leachate treatment and a versatile control strategy is proposed the main conclusions of this study are as follows the pn anammox process is effective in treatment of incineration leachate with mean tn and cod removal efficiencies of 90 and 78 respectively even with great fluctuation of the influent composition by using enhanced ad nearly 50 of the cod was captured due to the well coexist ability with heterotrophs and diverse organic compounds adaptability of aob taxa e g nitrosomonas the pn unit was adapted to residual cod 1420 2400 mg l the long term suppression of nob 0 1 was achieved by controlling a low do 0 2 0 4 mg l combined with the high fna concentration 0 08 mg l and temperature 30 c providing an effective pn performance with nae 95 the anammox process was more sensitive than the pn process to organic compounds from the incineration leachate the residual humic acids in the anammox sbr 245 6 3 mg l might be the main components that inhibit anammox activity the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria induced by the organic compounds may be responsible for a decline in the abundance of anammox bacteria i e candidatus kuenenia declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

techniques and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to assess dom composition of surface sediment porewater and bottom overlying water across the yangtze river estuary yre results suggested that dom exchange in the sediment water interface mainly followed from sediment porewater to bottom water driven by a significant dissolved organic carbon concentration gradient and hydrodynamic force we also characterized two porewater dom sources including microbial production and byproducts of processed sediments high microbial activities resulted in the enrichment of protein like fluorescent components and n bearing compounds in porewater potentially decreasing the oxygen concentration of bottom water due to the high lability and the deamination of n bearing compounds in the sediment water interface could likely serve as a n bearing nutrient source to bottom water moreover due to sediment specific features in different areas driven by hydrologic sorting and local phytoplankton supply porewater

introduction dissolved organic matter dom of estuaries plays an important role in global elemental cycling and oceanic ecosystem functioning due to high primary productivity and terrestrial runoff bianchi 2006 canuel and hardison 2016 the sediment water interface of estuaries is an important site where gradients in biogeochemical processes are greatest santschi et al 1990 selective adsorption

boreal lakes valle et al 2020 within estuarine coastal regions hydrological sorting and phytoplankton deposition generate noticeable gradient changes of sediment composition from the mouth of estuaries to offshore areas seidel et al 2015 the sediment type combined with physiochemistry of the water column could modulate the fate of porewater dom by bringing out spatial variations in porewater dom composition and reactivity trimmer et al 2003 lever et al 2015 as such it is necessary to obtain comprehensive insights into the dynamic processing of dom between sediment porewater and overlying water along the estuarine coastal region due to the complexity of estuarine dom various types of analytical tools have been developed to characterize dom weston et al 2006 schmidt et al 2009

sediment porewater or bottom water than those from different compartments within identical stations fig 5a the difference of ft icr ms spectra between bottom water and porewater spe dom was also statistically calculated as shown in fig 5b to depict the intrinsic characteristics of both compartments molecular formulas more abundant in porewater showed a bimodal distribution of mass peaks with lower molecular mass 200 to 400 da in comparison molecular formulas with higher relative abundance in bottom water have a regular skewed distribution of mass peaks with higher molecular mass 300 to

fig 6a sediment porewater samples among three regions have unique dom characteristics on the pc1 and pc2 axes fig 6a sma and oe samples are assigned to different sides of pc2 and have different pc1

discussion 4 1 factors shaping dom composition of sediment porewater in the yre microbial processing of sediments contributes to porewater dom controlled by sediment quality and redox conditions schmidat et al 2017 mcdonough et al 2020 in the yre surface sediments are of high microbial activities feng et al 2009 moreover sediment porewater dom of yre displayed high content of protein like components c1 c3 c5 n bearing compounds and non aromatic compounds ua sugar sat polyp especially in the area with high organic carbon content ma and oe fig 2 and tablse s3 underlining high microbial production burdige and zheng 1998 derrien et al 2019 although protein like dom and non aromatic compounds are vulnerable to microbial degradation chen and jaffé 2016 the sedimentary environment and microbial community also shape dom composition anoxic conditions and high microbial activities could likely be responsible for the preservation of protein like compounds in porewater of yre which is consistent with a previous study in the black sea schmidt et al 2017 besides low oxidation state nosc fig 2l and the enrichment of s bearing compounds chos fig 2r could indicate anoxic sulfate reduced processing of organic matter within sediments of yre hebting et al 2006 diverse anammox and sulfate reducing bacteria were also identified in surface sediments of yre ye et al 2016 fu et al 2019 regional differences in the optical and molecular composition of sediment porewater dom were also observed among investigated stations of yre fig 2 and fig 6a which may be ascribed to the geochemical properties of sediments sediment type is the primary control on their potential degradation by microorganisms which also modulates the composition of degradation products schaffner et al 2001 hydrological sorting and primary productivity supply induced the seaward decrease in the relative content of terrestrial sediments characterized by increased δ13c and decreased c n values from the mouth of yre to offshore areas figs 2b and 2c zhang et al 2007 significant relationships between the relative abundance of aromatic substances c2 and c4 pcas polyp and sediment compositions c n and δ13c were also observed in the yre fig 6a to support the potential contribution of processed terrestrial sediments by microorganisms to sediment porewater dom moreover the seaward decrease of relative abundance of aromatic substances c2 and c4 pcas polyp and hix in sediment porewater dom could result from the decreased relative contribution of processed terrestrial organic matter li et al 2020 also found the enrichment of humic like components in porewater from biogeochemical processing of terrestrial sediments the muddy area of yre serves as the critical carbon sink orgc fig 2a and is enriched by high content of terrestrial organic matter yao et al 2015 which could explain high abundance of aromatic compounds in ma suva254 fig 2d wang et al 2013 also found high intensity of humic like components in the muddy area of yre the modulation of terrestrial organic matter content on porewater dom composition was also characterized by the positive relationship between organic carbon content of sediments orgc and suva254 of sediment porewater dom especially for ma samples fig 6a 4 2 dynamic dom processing between sediment porewater and bottom water although porewater and overlying water dom are modulated by multiple factors and showed regional differences a common and consistent feature of molecular similarities and differences characterized by ft icr ms imprinted dynamic biogeochemical processes of dom between sediment porewater and bottom water fig 5 and fig s4 firstly the difference of ft icr ms spectra between these two water sample groups displayed unique mechanisms of dom processing in different compartments fig 5 although dom composition in bottom water and sediment porewater has regional differences figs 1 3 5 a general feature was that low mass peaks were more abundant in sediment porewater than bottom water across the entire section of yre fig 5b and table s2 moreover molecules present in sediment porewater were of low o c figs 5c 5l and table s2 previous studies pointed out that residual dom of water column after photo mineralization of oxygen rich aromatic compounds contribute to porewater molecules pool with low oxygen amaral et al 2013 wolf et al 2018 although a high quantity of molecules was shared by porewater and bottom water figs 5m 5q molecules with a short carbon chain and fewer oxygen atoms are scarce in the common dom pool fig s5 and fig s6d for porewater dom all present molecules showed the distribution pattern of molecular mass different from that of the common molecule pool between bottom water and porewater fig s8 moreover kellerman et al 2015 and valle et al 2018 found that the selective preservation of bottom water dom would increase molecular mass of sediment porewater dom these findings suggest few accumulations of bottom water dom in sediment porewater of yre which was also supported by the low relative abundance of common molecules in porewater dom fig s4 significantly negative correlations between aromatic compounds and salinity fig 3 in bottom water samples displayed the main contribution of fluvial organic matter to the dom pool of estuarine water and part of them originate from the transformation of eroded soils wang et al 2019 biogeochemical processing of fluvial soils within estuaries also served as an important source to porewater dom fig 2 reader et al 2019 and recurrent transformations of som by microorganisms could explain the low averaged molecular mass of porewater dom in the yre previous studies also found that high amounts of compounds with 200 300 da result from the intense bioactivity in sediments fig 5b seidel et al 2014 secondly the large doc concentration gradient between porewater and bottom water samples table s2 would serve as an engine pushing dom transport from porewater to bottom water although a high proportion of common molecules in the bottom water fig s4 supports dom exchange between surface sediments and water column a large number of molecules still only exist in sediment porewater figs 5h 5l which raises the question about the fate of these molecules unique to porewater compared with bottom water dom some molecules unique to porewater have high bio lability indicated by a high h c ratio of 1 5 fig 5 sleighter and hatcher 2007 d andrilli et al 2015 which were vulnerable to microbial degradation however some other unique molecules of porewater dom were characterized as oxygen deficient aromatic compounds o c 0 5 h c 1 5 fig 5 hertkorn et al 2006 which have relatively high resistance to biodegradation photodegradation is one way to remove aromatic compounds stubbins et al 2010 shen et al 2015 he et al 2020 however high turbidity of nearshore stations and high depth of offshore stations in yre table s1 could protect these aromatic molecules from photochemical degradation by attenuating the intensity of uv irradiation in the bottom water ge et al 2020 gan et al 2020 found that microbial processing of sediment porewater dom would induce the depletion of oxygen poor compounds and the accumulation of oxygen rich compounds under sulfate reducing conditions high sulfate concentration driven by the input of seawater in yre would allow the enrichment of oxygen rich compounds from microbial processing of porewater dom in this study we also identified the loss of n bearing aromatic molecules from porewater to bottom water especially molecules with two or three n atoms fig 5 schmidt et al 2017 found that microbial degradation involving deamination and decarboxylation prefers to transform n bearing molecules when transported along the flow path of porewater and discharged to the overlying water environment these n bearing molecules would be vulnerable to microbial deamination which were also partially supported by their high h c values higher bio lability figs 5i 5j furthermore the oxidative environment of the water column table s1 would drive the transformation of amino groups to carbonyl groups stams and hansen 1984 ranjith et al 2007 generating some molecules with high o c and low h c this could be imprinted in a high quantity of oxygen rich and hydrogen deficient mononitrogen and cho molecules in bottom water and the common dom pool figs 5 6 and fig s6 some of which were cram with high o c and long time biodegradation culture of coastal sediment porewater dom performed by cai et al 2019 found that with the transformation of dom pool from oxygen deficient and hydrogen rich molecules to oxygen rich and hydrogen deficient molecules some recalcitrant organic formulas still persisted thus the diagenetic shift of molecular formulas unique to porewater could cover part of the molecular signatures of porewater dom in the bottom water and increase the quantity of cram in the water column 4 3 implications for the biogeochemistry of water columns in estuaries dom exchange and processing in the sediment water interface is one crucial factor modulating the biogeochemistry of water columns within estuaries mayer 1993 in the yre molecular differences of two compartments porewater and bottom water dom fig 5 and doc mixing curve of bottom water fig 4a both pointed out the vital contribution of sediment porewater to the water column dom pool which is different from the selective preservation of water column dom of temperate lakes in sediment porewater valle et al 2020 high microbial production was abundant in sediment porewater of yre fig 2 for bottom water dom the input of yangtze river freshwater dilutes the relative abundance of protein like c5 fig 4j and non aromatic compounds ua sugar sat pep fig 4s mainly from primary productivity which were also partially removed from bottom water identified by the nonconservative mixing curve although sediment porewater of yre has high relative abundance of protein like c5 and non aromatic compounds through microbial degradation of som figs 2k and 2s they could be quickly transformed due to their high bioavailability although oxygen of bottom water in the yre was not of hypoxia 2 mg l 1 the decrease of oxygen concentration from surface water to bottom water also supported the oxidative degradation of organic matter in the sediment water interface table s1 moreover high oxygen consumption of the bottom water occurred in the ma and oe of yre owing to high sedimentary carbon content fig 2a and table s1 besides the release of porewater would influence the fate of estuarine dom by altering their compositions fig 5 some protein like components c1 c3 figs 4f and 4h and n bearing compounds chon1 chon2 and chon3 figs 4o 4q associated with microbial activities showed the additional mixing or insignificant correlations with salinity in the bottom water which could ascribe to the input of porewater dom processed by microorganisms fig 2 the contribution of porewater to bottom water dom was also characterized by positive relationships between pc2 and these parameters c1 chon1 chon2 and chon3 fig 6 although part of these additional compounds in bottom water was of high bio lability molecular compositions showed that some additional compounds could be transformed into cram resistant to microbial degradation during the interface migration fig 5 hertkorn et al 2006 cai et al 2019 and positive relationships between pc2 and aromatic indexes suva254 ai fig 6b also displayed the supply of aromatic compounds from sediment porewater to bottom water which was also supported by the nonconservative addition behavior of aromatic parameters suva254 ai pcas polyp fig 4 thus the transport across the sediment water interface also increased the content and molecular diversity of the refractory dom pool in the bottom water of yre estuarine sediments serve as the critical location of organic carbon burial on earth due to high land runoff and sedimentation rate hedges and keil 1995 zhao et al 2021 found that som burial efficiency of yre and adjacent areas was about 16 and terrestrial and marine som were both degraded porewater dom served as the intermediates of processed som by microorganisms and characterizations of porewater and bottom water dom in this study found that processed sediments would be introduced into the water column as a form of dom or co2 figs 1 4 6 prolonged oxygen consumption due to degradation of porewater dom especially in the area with low terrestrial input could bring out oxygen depletion of bottom water to change the community structure of marine ecosystems and biodiversity nilsson and rosenberg 1994 besides featured deamination of n bearing compounds in the sediment water interface of yre fig 5 would contribute a large amount of inorganic nitrogen to bottom water schmidt et al 2011 recent studies by zhou et al 2021 and chi et al 2021 suggested that sedimentary oxygen respiration is one important factor that contributes 31 to 76 to the background apparent oxygen utilization of the near bottom waters of yre here our molecular evidence further revealed that oxidative deamination degradation of sediment porewater dom could be a critical factor lowering the background oxygen level of the bottom water oxygen consumption and nutrient release associated with sediment degradation were also observed in other seas which was also strengthened by biological and physical disturbance arzayus et al 2005 guo et al 2020 moreover nonconservative behaviors of typical indexes suva254 protein like c1 and n bearing compounds fig 4 and fig 5 in the bottom water and low burial rate of som sun et al 2020 in the yre displayed that processed sediments would also significantly influence the dom pool of water columns applying average values of these typical dom parameters in different end members including freshwater seawater and porewater we estimated that the contribution rate of porewater is about 15 in the muddy area of yre using isosouce fig 7 this semi quantitative method neglected changed molecules from porewater dom and therefore porewater likely has a higher contribution to bottom water dom 15 considering the low lability of some compounds from porewater som mineralization may play a less characterized but noticeable biogeochemical role in the carbon transport flux across estuaries low sediment burial rate and strong hydrodynamic gradients occurred in numerous estuaries worldwide allison et al 2007 yang et al 2011 hutchings et al 2020 and high co2 emission and release flux of dom from sediments were also characterized burdige et al 1999 call et al 2019 thus further studies are encouraged to quantify the contribution and composition of dom with different characters from processed sediments 5 conclusion this study explored biogeochemical processes of dom in the sediment water interface of yre by characterizing dom composition of sediment porewater and overlying bottom water results displayed few accumulations of bottom water dom in sediment porewater and evident molecular imprints in the bottom water from subsequent diffusion transformation of porewater dom microbial processing of sediments brought out high enrichment content of protein like components and n bearing compounds in porewater which would decrease the oxygen concentration of bottom water due to high bio lability meanwhile the deamination of n bearing compounds could serve as an important n bearing nutrient source to bottom water moreover due to sediment specific features in different areas driven by hydrologic sorting and local phytoplankton supply porewater dom of the muddy area accumulated a large number of aromatic substances from the degradation of terrestrial sediments the release and oxic transformation of oxygen deficient aromatic compounds could contribute to the refractory carbon pool of estuarine water impacting the carbon transport from the land to the ocean considering the low sediment burial rate and strong hydrodynamic force that occurred in other estuaries worldwide

16171,dissolved organic matter dom exchange in the sediment water interface of estuaries is essential for the global elemental cycle to clarify the interface dom processing this study applies optical techniques and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to assess dom composition of surface sediment porewater and bottom overlying water across the yangtze river estuary yre results suggested that dom exchange in the sediment water interface mainly followed from sediment porewater to bottom water driven by a significant dissolved organic carbon concentration gradient and hydrodynamic force we also characterized two porewater dom sources including microbial production and byproducts of processed sediments high microbial activities resulted in the enrichment of protein like fluorescent components and n bearing compounds in porewater potentially decreasing the oxygen concentration of bottom water due to the high lability and the deamination of n bearing compounds in the sediment water interface could likely serve as a n bearing nutrient source to bottom water moreover due to sediment specific features in different areas driven by hydrologic sorting and local phytoplankton supply porewater dom of muddy areas accumulated more aromatic substances from the degradation of terrestrial organic matter the release and oxic transformation of oxygen deficient aromatic compounds could contribute to the refractory carbon pool of estuarine water carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram modulating the quality of organic carbon mobilized from the land to the coastal ocean considering strong

introduction dissolved organic matter dom of estuaries plays an important role in global elemental cycling and oceanic ecosystem functioning due to high primary productivity and terrestrial runoff bianchi 2006 canuel and hardison 2016 the sediment water interface of estuaries is an important site where gradients in biogeochemical processes are greatest santschi et al 1990 selective adsorption and flocculation of dom in the sediment water interface would increase the carbon sink of estuaries e g zhou et al 2021 being driven by microbial processing of sediments and dissolution of redox

al 2019 a series of studies have observed microbial processing and terrestrial signals of porewater dom schmidt et al 2011 wang et al 2013 lu et al 2020 however few investigations correlate overlying dom to porewater hindering the identification of biogeochemical processes between sediments and overlying waters in estuaries the chemical properties of dom and environmental conditions influence the transformation pathway and transport of aquatic dom kellerman et al 2014 2015 aromatic compounds for example have been identified to be less bio labile but prone to photodegradation or flocculation

affected by microbial processing of sediments middelburg et al 1993 schaffner et al 2001 gan et al 2020 mcdonough et al 2020 found highly aromatic dom with high o c but low h c ratios abundant in porewater dom of coastal peatlands due to the enrichment of aged sedimentary organic matter som however a high proportion of oxygen rich dom with high h c ratios was presented in sediment porewater of boreal lakes valle et al 2020 within estuarine coastal regions hydrological sorting and phytoplankton deposition generate noticeable gradient changes of sediment composition from the mouth of estuaries to offshore areas seidel et al 2015 the sediment type combined with physiochemistry of the water column could modulate the fate of porewater dom by bringing out spatial variations in porewater dom composition and reactivity trimmer et al 2003 lever et al 2015 as such it is necessary to obtain comprehensive insights into the dynamic processing of dom between sediment porewater and overlying water along the estuarine coastal region due to the complexity of estuarine dom various types of analytical tools have been developed to characterize dom weston et al 2006 schmidt et al 2009

porewater samples although the sampling procedure ignored the potential vertical variation of porewater dom composition gan et al 2020 this method is still meaningful to investigate biogeochemical

water and sediment porewater spe dom at the molecular level was observed in nine typical stations of yre fig 5 a molecular compositions of spe dom are more similar among samples from each compartment sediment porewater or bottom water than those from different compartments within identical stations fig 5a the difference of ft icr ms spectra between bottom water and porewater spe dom was also statistically calculated as shown in fig 5b to depict the intrinsic characteristics of both compartments molecular formulas more abundant in porewater showed a bimodal distribution of mass peaks with lower molecular mass 200 to 400 da in comparison molecular formulas with higher relative abundance in bottom water have a regular skewed distribution of mass peaks with higher molecular mass 300 to

fig 6a sediment porewater samples among three regions have unique dom characteristics on the pc1 and pc2 axes fig 6a sma and oe samples are assigned to different sides of pc2 and have different pc1

discussion 4 1 factors shaping dom composition of sediment porewater in the yre microbial processing of sediments contributes to porewater dom controlled by sediment quality and redox conditions schmidat et al 2017 mcdonough et al 2020 in the yre surface sediments are of high microbial activities feng et al 2009 moreover sediment porewater dom of yre displayed high content of protein like components c1 c3 c5 n bearing compounds and non aromatic compounds ua sugar sat polyp especially in the area with high organic carbon content ma and oe fig 2 and tablse s3 underlining high microbial production burdige and zheng 1998 derrien et al 2019 although protein like dom and non aromatic compounds are vulnerable to microbial degradation chen and jaffé 2016 the sedimentary environment and microbial community also shape dom composition anoxic conditions and high microbial activities could likely be responsible for the preservation of protein like compounds in porewater of yre which is consistent with a previous study in the black sea schmidt et al 2017 besides low oxidation state nosc fig 2l and the enrichment of s bearing compounds chos fig 2r could indicate anoxic sulfate reduced processing of organic matter within sediments of yre hebting et al 2006 diverse anammox and sulfate reducing bacteria were also identified in surface sediments of yre ye et al 2016 fu et al 2019 regional differences in the optical and molecular composition of sediment porewater dom were also observed among investigated stations of yre fig 2 and fig 6a which may be ascribed to the geochemical properties of sediments sediment type is the primary control on their potential degradation by microorganisms which also modulates the composition of degradation products schaffner et al 2001 hydrological sorting and primary productivity supply induced the seaward decrease in the relative content of terrestrial sediments characterized by increased δ13c and decreased c n values from the mouth of yre to offshore areas figs 2b and 2c zhang et al 2007 significant relationships between the relative abundance of aromatic substances c2 and c4 pcas polyp and sediment compositions c n and δ13c were also observed in the yre fig 6a to support the potential contribution of processed terrestrial sediments by microorganisms to sediment porewater dom moreover the seaward decrease of relative abundance of aromatic substances c2 and c4 pcas polyp and hix in sediment porewater dom could result from the decreased relative contribution of processed terrestrial organic matter li et al 2020 also found the enrichment of humic like components in porewater from biogeochemical processing of terrestrial sediments the muddy area of yre serves as the critical carbon sink orgc fig 2a and is enriched by high content of terrestrial organic matter yao et al 2015 which could explain high abundance of aromatic compounds in ma suva254 fig 2d wang et al 2013 also found high intensity of humic like components in the muddy area of yre the modulation of terrestrial organic matter content on porewater dom composition was also characterized by the positive relationship between organic carbon content of sediments orgc and suva254 of sediment porewater dom especially for ma samples fig 6a 4 2 dynamic dom processing between sediment porewater and bottom water although porewater and overlying water dom are modulated by multiple factors and showed regional differences a common and consistent feature of molecular similarities and differences characterized by ft icr ms imprinted dynamic biogeochemical processes of dom between sediment porewater and bottom water fig 5 and fig s4 firstly the difference of ft icr ms spectra between these two water sample groups displayed unique mechanisms of dom processing in different compartments fig 5 although dom composition in bottom water and sediment porewater has regional differences figs 1 3 5 a general feature was that low mass peaks were more abundant in sediment porewater than bottom water across the entire section of yre fig 5b and table s2 moreover molecules present in sediment porewater were of low o c figs 5c 5l and table s2 previous studies pointed out that residual dom of water column after photo mineralization of oxygen rich aromatic compounds contribute to porewater molecules pool with low oxygen amaral et al 2013 wolf et al 2018 although a high quantity of molecules was shared by porewater and bottom water figs 5m 5q molecules with a short carbon chain and fewer oxygen atoms are scarce in the common dom pool fig s5 and fig s6d for porewater dom all present molecules showed the distribution pattern of molecular mass different from that of the common molecule pool between bottom water and porewater fig s8 moreover kellerman et al 2015 and valle et al 2018 found that the selective preservation of bottom water dom would increase molecular mass of sediment porewater dom these findings suggest few accumulations of bottom water dom in sediment porewater of yre which was also supported by the low relative abundance of common molecules in porewater dom fig s4 significantly negative correlations between aromatic compounds and salinity fig 3 in bottom water samples displayed the main contribution of fluvial organic matter to the dom pool of estuarine water and part of them originate from the transformation of eroded soils wang et al 2019 biogeochemical processing of fluvial soils within estuaries also served as an important source to porewater dom fig 2 reader et al 2019 and recurrent transformations of som by microorganisms could explain the low averaged molecular mass of porewater dom in the yre previous studies also found that high amounts of compounds with 200 300 da result from the intense bioactivity in sediments fig 5b seidel et al 2014 secondly the large doc concentration gradient between porewater and bottom water samples table s2 would serve as an engine pushing dom transport from porewater to bottom water although a high proportion of common molecules in the bottom water fig s4 supports dom exchange between surface sediments and water column a large number of molecules still only exist in sediment porewater figs 5h 5l which raises the question about the fate of these molecules unique to porewater compared with bottom water dom some molecules unique to porewater have high bio lability indicated by a high h c ratio of 1 5 fig 5 sleighter and hatcher 2007 d andrilli et al 2015 which were vulnerable to microbial degradation however some other unique molecules of porewater dom were characterized as oxygen deficient aromatic compounds o c 0 5 h c 1 5 fig 5 hertkorn et al 2006 which have relatively high resistance to biodegradation photodegradation is one way to remove aromatic compounds stubbins et al 2010 shen et al 2015 he et al 2020 however high turbidity of nearshore stations and high depth of offshore stations in yre table s1 could protect these aromatic molecules from photochemical degradation by attenuating the intensity of uv irradiation in the bottom water ge et al 2020 gan et al 2020 found that microbial processing of sediment porewater dom would induce the depletion of oxygen poor compounds and the accumulation of oxygen rich compounds under sulfate reducing conditions high sulfate concentration driven by the input of seawater in yre would allow the enrichment of oxygen rich compounds from microbial processing of porewater dom in this study we also identified the loss of n bearing aromatic molecules from porewater to bottom water especially molecules with two or three n atoms fig 5 schmidt et al 2017 found that microbial degradation involving deamination and decarboxylation prefers to transform n bearing molecules when transported along the flow path of porewater and discharged to the overlying water environment these n bearing molecules would be vulnerable to microbial deamination which were also partially supported by their high h c values higher bio lability figs 5i 5j furthermore the oxidative environment of the water column table s1 would drive the transformation of amino groups to carbonyl groups stams and hansen 1984 ranjith et al 2007 generating some molecules with high o c and low h c this could be imprinted in a high quantity of oxygen rich and hydrogen deficient mononitrogen and cho molecules in bottom water and the common dom pool figs 5 6 and fig s6 some of which were cram with high o c and long time biodegradation culture of coastal sediment porewater dom performed by cai et al 2019 found that with the transformation of dom pool from oxygen deficient and hydrogen rich molecules to oxygen rich and hydrogen deficient molecules some recalcitrant organic formulas still persisted thus the diagenetic shift of molecular formulas unique to porewater could cover part of the molecular signatures of porewater dom in the bottom water and increase the quantity of cram in the water column 4 3 implications for the biogeochemistry of water columns in estuaries dom exchange and processing in the sediment water interface is one crucial factor modulating the biogeochemistry of water columns within estuaries mayer 1993 in the yre molecular differences of two compartments porewater and bottom water dom fig 5 and doc mixing curve of bottom water fig 4a both pointed out the vital contribution of sediment porewater to the water column dom pool which is different from the selective preservation of water column dom of temperate lakes in sediment porewater valle et al 2020 high microbial production was abundant in sediment porewater of yre fig 2 for bottom water dom the input of yangtze river freshwater dilutes the relative abundance of protein like c5 fig 4j and non aromatic compounds ua sugar sat pep fig 4s mainly from primary productivity which were also partially removed from bottom water identified by the nonconservative mixing curve although sediment porewater of yre has high relative abundance of protein like c5 and non aromatic compounds through microbial degradation of som figs 2k and 2s they could be quickly transformed due to their high bioavailability although oxygen of bottom water in the yre was not of hypoxia 2 mg l 1 the decrease of oxygen concentration from surface water to bottom water also supported the oxidative degradation of organic matter in the sediment water interface table s1 moreover high oxygen consumption of the bottom water occurred in the ma and oe of yre owing to high sedimentary carbon content fig 2a and table s1 besides the release of porewater would influence the fate of estuarine dom by altering their compositions fig 5 some protein like components c1 c3 figs 4f and 4h and n bearing compounds chon1 chon2 and chon3 figs 4o 4q associated with microbial activities showed the additional mixing or insignificant correlations with salinity in the bottom water which could ascribe to the input of porewater dom processed by microorganisms fig 2 the contribution of porewater to bottom water dom was also characterized by positive relationships between pc2 and these parameters c1 chon1 chon2 and chon3 fig 6 although part of these additional compounds in bottom water was of high bio lability molecular compositions showed that some additional compounds could be transformed into cram resistant to microbial degradation during the interface migration fig 5 hertkorn et al 2006 cai et al 2019 and positive relationships between pc2 and aromatic indexes suva254 ai fig 6b also displayed the supply of aromatic compounds from sediment porewater to bottom water which was also supported by the nonconservative addition behavior of aromatic parameters suva254 ai pcas polyp fig 4 thus the transport across the sediment water interface also increased the content and molecular diversity of the refractory dom pool in the bottom water of yre estuarine sediments serve as the critical location of organic carbon burial on earth due to high land runoff and sedimentation rate hedges and keil 1995 zhao et al 2021 found that som burial efficiency of yre and adjacent areas was about 16 and terrestrial and marine som were both degraded porewater dom served as the intermediates of processed som by microorganisms and characterizations of porewater and bottom water dom in this study found that processed sediments would be introduced into the water column as a form of dom or co2 figs 1 4 6 prolonged oxygen consumption due to degradation of porewater dom especially in the area with low terrestrial input could bring out oxygen depletion of bottom water to change the community structure of marine ecosystems and biodiversity nilsson and rosenberg 1994 besides featured deamination of n bearing compounds in the sediment water interface of yre fig 5 would contribute a large amount of inorganic nitrogen to bottom water schmidt et al 2011 recent studies by zhou et al 2021 and chi et al 2021 suggested that sedimentary oxygen respiration is one important factor that contributes 31 to 76 to the background apparent oxygen utilization of the near bottom waters of yre here our molecular evidence further revealed that oxidative deamination degradation of sediment porewater dom could be a critical factor lowering the background oxygen level of the bottom water oxygen consumption and nutrient release associated with sediment degradation were also observed in other seas which was also strengthened by biological and physical disturbance arzayus et al 2005 guo et al 2020 moreover nonconservative behaviors of typical indexes suva254 protein like c1 and n bearing compounds fig 4 and fig 5 in the bottom water and low burial rate of som sun et al 2020 in the yre displayed that processed sediments would also significantly influence the dom pool of water columns applying average values of these typical dom parameters in different end members including freshwater seawater and porewater we estimated that the contribution rate of porewater is about 15 in the muddy area of yre using isosouce fig 7 this semi quantitative method neglected changed molecules from porewater dom and therefore porewater likely has a higher contribution to bottom water dom 15 considering the low lability of some compounds from porewater som mineralization may play a less characterized but noticeable biogeochemical role in the carbon transport flux across estuaries low sediment burial rate and strong hydrodynamic gradients occurred in numerous estuaries worldwide allison et al 2007 yang et al 2011 hutchings et al 2020 and high co2 emission and release flux of dom from sediments were also characterized burdige et al 1999 call et al 2019 thus further studies are encouraged to quantify the contribution and composition of dom with different characters from processed sediments 5 conclusion this study explored biogeochemical processes of dom in the sediment water interface of yre by characterizing dom composition of sediment porewater and overlying bottom water results displayed few accumulations of bottom water dom in sediment porewater and evident molecular imprints in the bottom water from subsequent diffusion transformation of porewater dom microbial processing of sediments brought out high enrichment content of protein like components and n bearing compounds in porewater which would decrease the oxygen concentration of bottom water due to high bio lability meanwhile the deamination of n bearing compounds could serve as an important n bearing nutrient source to bottom water moreover due to sediment specific features in different areas driven by hydrologic sorting and local phytoplankton supply porewater dom of the muddy area accumulated a large number of aromatic substances from the degradation of terrestrial sediments the release and oxic transformation of oxygen deficient aromatic compounds could contribute to the refractory carbon pool of estuarine water impacting the carbon transport from the land to the ocean considering the low sediment burial rate and strong hydrodynamic force that occurred in other estuaries worldwide

16172,polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl chemicals pfcs widely used in lubricants surfactant textiles paper coatings cosmetics and fire fighting foams can release a large deal of organics contaminants into wastewater and pose great risks to the health of humans and eco environments although advanced oxidation processes can effectively deconstruct various organic contaminants via reactive radicals the stable structure of pfcs makes it difficult to be degraded here we confirm that electrochemical oxidation process coupled with peroxymonosulfate pms reaction can efficiently destroy stable structure of pfcs via electron transfer and meanwhile completely degrade pfcs via generated active radicals we further studies via capturing and scavenging radicals and dft calculations find that electron hydroxyl radials play a dominant role in degrading pfcs based on the calculations of adsorption energy and molecular orbital energy we further demonstrate that many active sites on the surface of ti4o7 1 0 4 plane can rapidly take part in electrochemical reaction for generating radials and removing organic contaminants these results give a promising insight towards high effective and deep degradation of pfcs via electrochemical reaction coupled with advanced oxidation processes as well as providing guidance and technical support for the remove of multiple organic contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical oxidation advanced oxidation process titanium suboxide electron transfer theoretical calculations 1 introduction polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl chemicals pfcs are a class of diverse organic compounds and extensively used in various fields wang et al 2021a zheng et al 2019 particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are typical pfcs are applied as lubricants surfactant textiles paper coatings cosmetics and fire fighting foams due to these advantages of thermal resistance large surface activity strong physiochemical properties stable resistance to high photolysis temperature and biological degradation fenner 2020 umeh et al 2021 wang et al 2021c recently pfcs with high mobility have been determined globally in ground waters surface waters sediments at concentrations from nanograms per liter to several milligrams per liter at sites crone et al 2019 and they are even accumulated in animal and human muscles liver blood and heart leading to poisoning zheng et al 2021 zhuang et al 2020 these long chain pfcs possess severe toxicity such as immunotoxicity hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity due to high accumulation potential li et al 2021 tang et al 2021 pfos and pfoa as persistent organic pollutants have been listed in the stockholm conversion as annex b substance by the us epa and the maximum limited value in drinking water is 70 ng l 1 yang et al 2021 the refractory pfcs with stable physiochemical properties can be attributed to i high redox potential of fluorine e0 3 6v ii high energy c f bonds 530 kj mol and iii the formation of shield by perfect overlap of fluorine and carbon orbitals to inhibit the nucleophillic attack wang et al 2019 the previous studies have found that pfcs is slightly removed via traditional wastewater treatment plants and thus the estimated human daily intake of pfcs may be 1 5 via drinking water wang et al 2020a 2021a consequently it is urgent to explore some effective techniques to remove these pfcs to eliminate their adverse health effects the presence of multiple and stable c f bonds in the structure of pfcs makes them difficult to degradation from water environment and which cannot be removed by ozonation filtration and microbial degradation chen et al 2021 in addition advanced oxidation processes aops with the generation of sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh cannot also effectively destruct the structure of carbon chains with full fluorine due to strong tolerance of pfcs zhang et al 2021a certain novel technologies have been developed to degrade pfcs including thermolysis photo oxidation photo reduction plasma oxidation ultrasonic irradiation zerovalent iron reduction and other technologies chen et al 2021 he et al 2020 qian et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 nevertheless these technologies often suffer various limitations including the addition of high dosage chemicals consumption of high energy harsh treatment conditions and difficulty in scaling up shi et al 2019 wang et al 2020c in comparison with the above methods electrooxidation have been confirmed to an efficient and potential methods for pfcs degradation due to strong oxidation capacity robustness mild condition high efficiency and environmental compatibility wang et al 2020c the anode electrode material plays a key role in the eo process carbon based materials graphite rod plate dimensionally stable anode pbo2 sno2 ruo2 iro2 and zno boron doped diamond bdd and noble metal have been explored as an anode electrode for removing organic pollutants liu et al 2019a shin et al 2019 wang et al 2021b among these electrodes the bdd electrode can high effectively degrade pfcs due to the long lifetime stable physiochemical and electrochemical properties and high oxygen evolution potential but the expensive price limited its large scale application shin et al 2019 some sb bi ce and f elements doped ti sno2 electrodes exhibit also outstanding removal efficiency for pfcs but the short lifetime and potential toxic released by metal elements greatly limited the implementation of these technologies wang et al 2020b recently magnéli phase titanium oxides with a generic formula of tixo2x 1 10 x 4 have been applied in water treatment field wang et al 2018b among these compounds ti4o7 a magnéli phase titanium sub oxides has been developed as potential candidates for electrochemical oxidation due to excellent electric conductivity 1500 s cm 1 high redox potential 2 5 v vs ag agcl and low cost of production li et al 2022c recent studies have confirmed that ti4o7 is an ideal electrode for effectively electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants including chloroform phenol amoxicillin tetracycline dyes as well as disinfecting viruses ganiyu et al 2016 li et al 2022c wang et al 2018b in addition ti4o7 is mainly obtained from titanium oxides which is a low cost abundant ingredient in the earth ibrahim et al 2018 accordingly these advantages make ti4o7 more cost effective and environmentally friendly than those of bdd and sno2 electrodes ganiyu et al 2016 lin et al 2021 the previous report has confirmed that ti4o7 used as anode electrode for electrochemical oxidation of pfos and pfoa can achieve promising results lin et al 2021 it should be noted that ti4o7 behaved as a potential anode can generate reactive oxygen species ros involving direct electron transfer reactions via water oxidation during electrochemical oxidation li et al 2022c but the amounts of ros are not enough to remove organic pollutants in general naclo4 is used as the electrolyte for removing pfcs via electrochemical oxidation and achieved good performance shin et al 2019 yao et al 2021 however naclo4 is a water soluble and persistent contaminant from both natural sources and anthropogenic which can competitively inhibit iodides importer and reduce the available iodides dou et al 2019 in addition naclo4 is also a strong oxide which can bring combustion and explosion via rub or impact with organics zheng et al 2020 the use of naclo4 will bring secondary pollution and potential risks to environmental safety consequently the use of naclo4 during electrochemical oxidation with ti4o7 electrode for removing pfcs is not an ideal and safety choose few studies have explored pfcs removal via electrochemical oxidation eo process coupled with pms based aops due to the invalidity of the free radicals to degrade pfcs in our study the eo process with ti4o7 electrode is coupled with pms reaction eo ti4o7 pms to remove pfcs the absence of naclo4 will reduce the risk of secondary pollution and the use of pms will significantly promote the degradation efficiency of pfos why the use of ti4o7 can obviously remove pfos what is the key active site what is the intrinsic relationship between the active site and metal facets how do electrons are transferred during electrochemical oxidation in these previous studies the key sites in the ti4o7 have not been clarified and the study of the electron transfer mechanism is also weak to replace the use of naclo4 pms is introduced into the electrolyte and pms can release reactive oxygen species ros oh and so4 under the action of eo firstly the electron is rapidly generated with the input of current due to the excellent conductivity of ti4o7 and then the generated electron will break some chemical bonds of pfcs molecule to produce relatively unstable intermediates of pfcs meanwhile the generated ros from pms reaction during electrochemical reaction will further attack the intermediates of pfcs to produce short chain products even co2 h2o and f ion in our previous study we have confirmed that the eo process coupled with pms process can significantly destroy organic contaminants here the use of pms in eo process with ti4o7 electrode can achieve potential degradation performance for various organic contaminants to address the above vital points we evaluate the performance of eo process with active ti4o7 electrode coupled with pms reaction and various pollutants such as methyl orange mo 4 chlorphenol 4 cp tetracycline tc and pfcs are removed via this technique to evaluate its universality we aim to 1 quantifying the contribution of different ros to organic pollutants 2 figuring out the key active sties in surface of ti4o7 structure 3 exploring the stability of the electrode after many cycle operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents pfcs and mass labelled pfcs injection

construction and operation the electrochemical reactor with an effective volume of 500 ml contained anode and cathode electrodes the ti plate and ti4o7 electrode were used as cathode and anode electrode 40 40 mm respectively and these electrodes were connected to negative and positive poles of dc power supply the gap between anode and cathode electrode was controlled in 2 cm a magnetic stirring installation with the rate of 800 rpm min was employed in the reactor to keep uniform mass transfer here the ti4o7 electrode was synthesized by gel cast method as shown in text s2 during electrochemical operation the reactor electrolyte contained organics of 5 mg l 1 nacl of 10 mm and amounts of pms solution the desired solution ph was adjusted by naoh and hcl solution the samples were extracted for each interval via 0 20 μm glass filter membrane in determining the concentration of organics all degradation experiments were repeated triple the radicals and non radicals quenching experiments were run via introducing the quenching reagents with different concentrations into the solution 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of pfcs contained pfoa and pfos were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms ms coupled with an api 4000 q trap spectrometer in addition concentrations of 4 cp tc and mo were detected by hplc agilent 1200

solution typically pms 10 mm solution was introduced to 50 ml the prepared pfos solution 10 mg l 1 with a magnetic stirring process and the current density was controlled at 20 ma cm 1 subsequently 200 ul dmpo or 50 mg temp were mixed with the above solution finally samples were extracted for testing at 20 and 40 min 2 4 computational calculation dft calculations for adsorption energy and charge difference density were conducted based on the vienna ab inito simulation package vasp kresse and furthmüller 1996a 1996b the electron ion interactions were described by the projected augmented wave paw potentials while the exchange correlation interactions were calculated by employing the perdew burke enzerhof pbe pseudopotentials of generalized gradient approximation gga blöchl 1994 the vdw d3 method developed by grimme was employed to describe the van der waals interaction grimme et al 2010 the spin polarized set was taken into account the plane wave energy cutoff was set as 520 ev the convergence threshold was set as 1 0 10 6 ev in energy and 0 02 ev per angstrom in force two slab models were constructed on the optimized ti4o7 bulk at 104 and 1 20 facets a vacuum layer of 15 å was adopted to avoid the periodic interactions the brillouin zone was modeled by gamma centered monkhorst pack scheme in which a 1 4 1 and 4 2 1 grid was adopted for ti4o7 104 and ti4o7 1 20 respectively accordingly the interaction energy is defined as following 1 e a d s e t o t a l e s u r f a c e e p m s where eads is adsorption energy of pms on surface e total is the energy of pms and ti4o7 composite e surface is the energy of surface and e pms is the energy of pms respectively dmol3 program in materials studio was utilized to optimize molecular structure and calculate molecular orbital

2012 and results were consistent with the results from ms calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation properties of organics the performance of the electrode for organics degradation was assessed by using pfos as a representative pollutants as shown in fig 1 a pfos can be completely removed on the electrode with pms and nacl as the electrolyte and a high kinetic rate 0 093 min 1 of pfos can be harvested within 60 min fig s1a it is obvious that the removal performance of control groups e g ti4o7 2 65 pms 1 11 e ti4o7 13 44 and ti4o7 pms 6 3 showed a limited pfos removal with a maximum kinetic rate and removal efficiency 0 005 min 1 and 15 respectively the findings suggested that the presence of pms played an important role in degrading pfos under electrochemical process in addition we also explored the electrochemical oxidation of multiple organic pollutants such as mo 4 cp tc and pfoa as shown in fig 1b the degradation efficiency significantly changed depending on different kinds of organics obviously these organics can be effectively removed within 30 min via ti4o7 electrode and mo can achieve the best degradation performance and kinetic rate of 0 159 min 1 fig s1b which indicated the ti4o7 electrode can not only degradation persistent polyfluoroalkyl compounds but also can effectively degrade diazide dyes antibiotics and monocyclic benzene series and the above studies proved the excellent and potential properties of ti4o7 electrode for removing of multiple organic pollutants as shown in fig 1c different ph values of electrolyte from 2 5 to 11 6 did not significantly influence the degradation kinetic rate of pfos this suggested that the ti4o7 electrode coupled with pms activation undergoes less interference from general background ph solution current density was an important factor during electrochemical oxidation because it can affect the electron transfer between the electrode and contaminants as shown in fig 1a pfos cannot be effectively removed without current input the degradation performance of pfos was obviously promoted with the increase of current density fig 1d and the kinetic rate was also significantly increased from 0 02 to 0 109 min 1 with the current density was increased from 1 to 30 ma cm 2 fig s1c removal efficiency of pfos within 40 min was 53 2 83 7 94 2 99 9 and 99 9 for current density of 1 5 10 20 and 30 ma cm 2 respectively although the kinetic rate of pfos at 30 ma cm 2 was much higher than that of 20 ma cm 2 the removal efficiency of pfos was similar the finding was mainly due to excess generation of reactive oxygen species on the electrolyte was oxidized to oxygen under high current density wang et al 2020b meanwhile the effect of current density on the change of toc removal during electrochemical oxidation was also detected as shown in fig 1e toc removal was obviously improved at higher current density and toc removal efficiency was 81 5 at 30 ma cm 2 it should be noted that the higher current density can bring a decrease of current efficiency and an increase of electric energy consumption martinez huitle et al 2015 the electric energy consumption in this study can be calculated based on the eq 1 and the corresponding results were shown in table s1 dramatically the ee o value was increased with a decrease of current density meaning the high current density is more suitable for removing organics however some studies reported that a current oversupply would waste energy and damage electrode wang et al 2018a the degradation performance of pfos and corresponding electric energy consumption at 20 ma cm 2 was similar with those at 30 ma cm 2 consequently it was optimal to choose the current density of 20 ma cm 2 for the following pfos degradation operations in this study 2 ee o 1000 p t 60 v lg c 0 c t 38 375 p v k as exhibited in figs 1f and s1d pfos removal efficiencies were 76 62 94 33 97 2 99 99 and 87 68 within 40 min when the initial pms concentration is 1 2 5 10 and 20 mm respectively accordingly the kpfos value was increased from 0 036 to 0 093 min 1 the kpfos value at initial pms of 1 mm was low due to the generation of insufficient oxidative species especially oh and so4 however a continued increase of pms concentration 30 mm brought low removal efficiency and kpfos value of pfos which was mainly ascribed to the scavenging reaction between pms and so4 oh so4 hso5 so5 so4 h oh hso5 so5 h2o li et al 2019 the above results suggested pfos can be effectively mineralized by pms activation at ti4o7 electrode and the initial pms concentration of 5 mm was optimal and selected in this study as shown in table s2 e ti4o7 pms process in the current study achieved higher kinetic rate for pfos degradation than those of these reported studies which further confirmed the great potential of e ti4o7 pms process for degradation of organic contaminants 3 2 identification of reaction oxygen species radical quenching experiments were utilized to explore the active radical species contribution for pfos degradation in ti4o7 electrode as shown in fig 2 a the scavengers of cat sod ki nan3 bq ffa and lh had slightly effect on the degradation rate of pfos implying the minor generation of 1o2 and o2 active species li et al 2022a zhang et al 2021b meanwhile the degradation rate was significantly declined with the addition of tba etoh or meoh suggesting that these radicals of oh and so4 were mainly response for pfos degradation meoh etoh and tba due to high reactivity of oh and so4 was selected to scavenge both oh and so4 wang and wang 2020 as shown in figs 2b 2c and s2a pfos degradation was obviously inhibited with an increase of initial concentration of scavengers the pfos degradation performance was greatly limited with the introduction of meoh or etoh of 50 mm in comparison with meoh the addition of tba of 50 mm brought also obviously inhibition phenomenon meanwhile the degradation ratio of pfos was rapidly decreased with the increase of initial scavengers concentration based on figs 2d s2b c and d it should be noted that the inhibiting effect on tba was much weaker than those of meoh and etoh suggesting oh exhibited much bigger contributions than that of so4 to further distinguish the active species for the pfos degradation via ti4o7 electrode dmpo and temp were conducted to capture the oh so4 1o2 and o2 respectively li et al 2022b zhu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2e no obvious epr characteristic signals of dmpo o2 were detected during electrochemical oxidation indicating that no o2 was produced in this electrochemical process in addition no also corresponding signal peak was found with the addition of pms alone in the reaction system relatively an obvious four line spectrum with an intensity of 1 2 2 1 for the dmpo oh spin adduct with an ah 14 9 g was found from fig 2e further confirming the generation of oh during electrochemical oxidation with ti4o7 electrode liu et al 2021 in addition the signal density of dmpo oh continued to increase with the reaction time which suggested that pms activation during electrochemical process could boost oh generation the change of peak intensity for dmpo so4 was also observed based on the typical hyperfine splitting constant with an 13 2g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g ah 0 78 g confirming the continuous generation of so4 during electrochemical oxidation wang et al 2018c the signal intensity of dmpo oh was significantly higher than that of dmpo so4 meaning a higher concentration of oh generation moreover a representative triplet spectrum 1 1 1 with an 7 2 g and ah 4 1 g was observed by using temp as the spin agent demonstrating the generation of active 1o2 during reaction system shao et al 2018 the intensity increased minorly in the 40 min suggesting the continuous release of 1o2 besides we quantitatively determined the concentration of these ros in these reaction system we can find from fig 2f that the concentration of these ros was increased with the reaction time and the concentration of oh and so4 radical was greatly higher that of 1o2 meanwhile the concentration of oh radical was also higher than that of so4 radical as shown in fig s8 much quicker decomposition of pms than pfos degradation in the e ti4o7 process was observed suggesting that the ros can be rapidly generated in this electrochemical activation process alone pms cannot be decomposed which was consistent with minor degradation of pfos in fig 1a thus pms played an important role in degrading pfos it can be seen from fig s3 that the degradation rate of pfos kept stable state with the addition of different atmosphere o2 air or ar indicating that the o for oh and so4 was not derived from dissolving oxygen in the electrolyte the quantization experiments of ros and the corresponding epr measurements suggested that the generated 1o2 eq 6 played a negligible effect on pfos degradation and the generated oh and so4 radical eqs 3 7 was responsible for pfos removal the oh radical exhibited a dominant role in degrading pfos during electrochemical oxidation 3 hso5 energy input so4 oh 4 h2o e h oh 5 so4 h2o hso4 oh 6 hso5 so5 2 so4 2 hso4 1o2 7 so4 2 e so4 3 3 electron transfer pathway to achieve insight into the surface electron conduction and transformation mechanisms the optimized configuration and the corresponding density of states for the ti4o7 slabs with different planes were analyzed to clarify the changes in the electronic structure as shown in fig 3 a ti4o7 with regular structure was obtained from materials project database belongs to the p1 2 space group with a lattice constant of 5 638 å 6 957 å 7 184 å in comparison with the flat surface plane significant fluctuation can be observed on the ti4o7 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 plane and the geometry structures of these atoms shifted obviously fig 3a c e these structures of the 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes studied in this work were shown in fig 3c and e the computed density of states revealed band gap of 0 238 0 001 and 0 005 ev for the pristine ti4o7 the 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes of ti4o7 fig 3d f compared with the pristine ti4o7 the lower band gap for 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes meaning electron can be rapidly transferred in these planes guo et al 2021 meanwhile significantly higher pdos intensity for 1 0 4 than 1 2 0 indicating stronger conductivity in 1 0 4 plane and thus we can conclude that 1 0 4 plane of ti4o7 played an important role in transferring electron and taking part in electrochemical reaction the charge density distribution between pms and surface ti4o7 was further explored by the dft calculations the adsorption of pms on different surface of ti4o7 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes most probably followed the electron acceptor complex mechanism relating to ti as the electron donor and oh on pms as the electron acceptor which can be confirmed by dft calculations li et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a d the optimized configurations for pms adsorption on ti4o7 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes among which the adsorption of pms on 1 0 4 plane with the shorter ti to o distance 1 968 å than 1 2 0 plane 2 072 å was much stronger than 1 2 0 in addition oh and so4 was formed and adsorbed on the surface of ti4o7 to take part in activating reaction due to the break of o o in pms molecule during adsorption reaction process based on electrochemical effect the findings also demonstrated ti4o7 with strong conductivity and activating surface structure was beneficial to pms activation during the electrochemical process as shown in fig 4e the adsorption energy between pms and ti4o7 1 0 4 plane was 5 50 ev more negative than that of 1 2 0 plane 4 31 ev indicating the electron can be easily transferred from ti4o7 to pms in 1 0 4 plane and pms was more likely to adsorb onto ti4o7 1 0 4 plane accordingly ti4o7 1 0 4 exhibited the best activity for adsorbing pms during electrochemical process which was in accordance with the results in fig 3 radical and nonradical pathways during pms reaction played an important role for pfos degradation and the electron transfer pathway was explored by dft calculations figs s5 and 4f exhibited the optimized geometrical configurations of oh pfos ti4o7 and pms and the corresponding mo energy levels lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and highest occupied molecular orbital homo in nonradical pathway the electron was released from the electrode during electrochemical reaction process to break the stable structure of pfos meanwhile pms in the ti4o7 surface was decomposed to oh so4 and 1o2 via a series of reactions eqs 3 7 here ti4o7 with the narrow energy gap could serve as the conductive bridge to promote the electron transformation from the electron donor pfos to the electron acceptor pms the electron located at the homo 0 698 ev of pfos can be easily transferred to the lumo 8 054 ev of pms via the ti4o7 driven via an energy difference and thus bringing pms breakdown under electrochemical effect pms can abstract an electron from pfos to generate so4 and oh to attack pfos and its intermediates it should be noted from fig s7 that higher oxygen evolution potential oep from 1 60 v vs ag agcl only electrolyte to 1 68 v vs ag agcl pms activation with the addition of 10 mm pms the increase of oep and the decrease of current response indicated that the introduction of pms could inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction decrease the energy consumption and enhance the electrochemical selectivity to the organic pollutants during degradation process song et al 2018 wang et al 2020b according to the above explorations a possible reaction mechanism was proposed that takes place on the surface of ti4o7 and pms as shown in fig 4g initially pms was adsorbed on the activating surface of ti4o7 1 0 4 due to the negative adsorption energy further generating so4 and oh radicals from pms activation reaction under electrochemical conditions meanwhile these radicals into electrolyte can attack pfos and bring the break of some chemical bonds further bringing the change of pfos from large molecule to small molecule intermediates even co2 and h2o thus electrochemical process coupled with pms reaction can efficiently remove pfos via fast electron transfer to further confirm the possible electron transfer pathway the other four organic pollutants mo tc pfoa and 4 cp was also studied and the corresponding degradation performance had been explored in fig 1b various molecular structure of these organic pollutants was obtained by dft calculations fig 5 a and 4 cp exhibited a highest homo lumo energy levels and potential differences emod 3 415 ev in addition a linear relationship between kobs constants of different organic pollutants and emod was obtained by linear fitting with a high r2 0 96 interestingly the relationship between kobs constant and emod was a positive correlation fig 5b suggesting the degradation performance of different pollutants was highly dependent on the emod the above findings not only clarified the electron transfer mechanism in the ti4o7 surface but also brought a valuable reference for the degradation of various organic pollutants the mineralization mechanism of pfos via electrochemical advanced oxidation process was proposed based on the fig 6 the rate limiting step for pfos degradation was the formation of a perfluoroalkyl radical c8f17so3 by direct electron transfer and then c8f16o will be formed due to the attack of high activity oh radical subsequently ascribing to the effects of water molecule and electron the c8f16o and formed c7f15co2 will lose hf and co2 respectively to produce c7f15 meanwhile c7f15oh will be formed due to the action of oh radical finally pfos can be further mineralized from large pfos molecule to small intermediates even co2 and h2o via repeating the hf and co2 unzipping cycle steps 3 4 performance in different water matrices and stability it is well known that anions no3 hco3 and cl and nom with high levels were ubiquitous in natural water body and their presence will obviously affect the electrochemical reaction we further explored degradation experiments under various conditions to assess the degradation performance of pfos in e ti4o7 pms process as shown in fig 7 a c the degradation efficiency of pfos was slightly decreased when low concentration ions 1 mm were introduced into the electrolyte nevertheless the degradation efficiency was significantly decreased with the increases of ions concentration from 1 to 10 mm meanwhile the degradation kinetic rate of pfos was also declined from 0 093 to 0 056 0 055 and 0 031 min 1 with the addition of no3 hco3 and cl respectively fig s4a c further confirming the inhibiting effect of the presence of anions wang and wang 2021 the effect of these anions on the degradation pfos followed the incremental order cl hco3 no3 the changes from the addition of no3 hco3 and co3 were mainly attributed to the side reactions between hco3 or co3 and free radicals and the competing reactions between hco3 or co3 and pms at the electrode surface liu et al 2019b the weak degradation performance of pfos in the presence of cl was primarily due to the rapid oxidation reaction between cl and oh or so4 to form a series of chlorine radicals e g cloh and cl and the competition of cl with pfos to react with oh or so4 was obvious eqs 8 and 9 wang et al 2020b in addition the degradation kinetics of these chlorine species reacted with the others other pollutants were higher than those of oh or so4 but with relatively low standard potentials e cloh cl 1 3 vnhe e cl cl 2 4 vnhe and thus inhibiting the degradation efficiency dou et al 2022 pang et al 2020 as can be seen from fig 7 d increasing ha concentration from 5 to 100 mg l 1 brought a continuous decrease in the degradation performance of pfos and the degradation rate of pfos was also declined from 0 093 to 0 018 min 1 fig s4d excessive humic acid will not only compete adsorption site for direct electron transfer with pfos but also consume the formed radicals and thus inhibiting the formation of surface reactive species and reducing degradation efficiency of pfos luo et al 2019 peng et al 2021 besides the electrochemical system was operated with the contaminated water derived from various types of sources including deionized water tap water and peal river water from guangdong province as shown in fig 7 e high pfos removal rate can be achieved in tap water and peal river water with the removal rate of 97 5 and 94 3 and the corresponding toc removal rate fig 7 f were 77 8 and 69 6 respectively although these results were slightly lower than those of deionized water the desired pfos removal rate can be harvested via minorly enhanced the input of current density it should be noted that the concentration of these anions in natural water was relatively low and thus the electrochemical oxidation with ti4o7 electrode exhibited excellent practical prospects on pfos degradation 8 cl oh cloh oh 9 cl so 4 so 4 cl the stability of ti4o7 electrode for electrochemical oxidation was investigated by multiple continuous pfos degradation experiments vacuum drying was examined to recover the activity of the electrode for the next experiment as shown in fig 8 a after consecutive 5 10 and 20 cycles of degradation experiments the removal rate of pfos remained 98 5 98 1 and 96 4 which were slightly lower than the first cycle meanwhile the corresponding degradation kinetic rate of pfos was also obtained from fig 8b and the rate were only minorly decreased from 0 093 to 0 089 0 087 and 0 079 min 1 respectively obviously the activity of electrode after vacuum drying was worse than the original performance and the residual pfos in solution still posed a potential threat to the environment accordingly we supposed that the active sites on the surface of electrode were covered by some intermediate products after multiple use further leading to the weak electrochemical reaction we used ultrasonic treatment method in 0 1 m h2so4 solution to clean the used electrode for restoring the active sites after each 20 cycles as exhibited in fig 8c the degradation efficiency of pfos was recovered to the original level and the corresponding degradation kinetic rate had slight change fig s6 it can be seen from fig 8d that the degradation kinetic rate of pfos was consecutively decreased without the ultrasonic treatment after ultrasonic treatment in each 20 cycles the kinetic rate can keep a high level and pfos can be effectively removed which were mainly ascribed to the decomposition of some uncomplete mineralized products on the electrode surface in addition the leaching of ti ion has been detected by icp aes and the concentration of ti ion during the electrooxidation reaction is less than 0 2 µg l 1 suggesting very limiting leaching of ti ion from the ti4o7 electrode the above findings indicated ti4o7 electrode with superior durability and stability exhibited great potential for electrochemical oxidation of pfcs 4 conclusions recently the aops has been widely considered as a potential technology for treating wastewater compared with the traditional wastewater methods due to their high effective and rapid characters for removing high load of organic wastewater however these technologies have been greatly limited for treating pfcs wastewater because of extreme chemical stability and resistance of pfcs in the current work we use electrochemical oxidation technology coupled with advanced oxidation processes to study the electron transfer and degradation behaviors of multiple organic contaminants especially pfos degradation properties first the comprehensive studies have confirmed that only pms or electrochemical oxidation cannot effectively remove pfos and the coupling use between electrochemical oxidation with pms reaction can completely remove pfos within 40 min with current density of 20 ma cm 1 and initial pms concentration of 10 mm and achieve a high kinetic rate up to 0 093 min 1 in addition the technology is still effective for degrading multiple organics contaminants mo 4 cp tc pfoa and pfos second use of various scavengers confirms that singlet oxygen hydroxyl and sulfate radicals can be generated from electrochemical pms reaction we further use epr analysis to verify that hydroxyl radical as well as the action of the electrons is the dominant radicals for degradation of pfos the high level of performance is ascribed to the intrinsic activity of the electrode the pms action and their coupling use we continue to explore the active sites on the surface of ti4o7 via dft calculations and we find ti4o7 1 0 4 plane with strong conductivity and negative adsorption energy can rapidly take part in some chemical reactions in addition ti4o7 with the narrow energy gap could serve as the conductive bridge to promote the electron transformation from the electron donor pfos to the electron acceptor pms the electron located at the homo of pfos can be easily transferred to the lumo of pms via the ti4o7 drove by an energy difference and thus bringing pms breakdown under electrochemical conditions third we explore the relationship between kinetic constants and emod and we observe the degradation performance of different pollutants is highly dependent on the emod besides we also explore the effects of different ions and these ions can limit the degradation efficiency of pfos to some extent however the concentration of these anions in natural water was relatively low and thus these ions will bring a slight effect on pfos degradation finally the ultrasonic treatment can significantly active the ti4o7 electrode so that the kinetic rate of pfos degradation can keep a high level and pfos can be effectively removed after regular ultrasonic treatment these results pave a new pathway to further treat multiple organic contaminants and provide a basis for further electron transfer and

16172,polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl chemicals pfcs widely used in lubricants surfactant textiles paper coatings cosmetics and fire fighting foams can release a large deal of organics contaminants into wastewater and pose great risks to the health of humans and eco environments although advanced oxidation processes can effectively deconstruct various organic contaminants via reactive radicals the stable structure of pfcs makes it difficult to be degraded here we confirm that electrochemical oxidation process coupled with peroxymonosulfate pms reaction can efficiently destroy stable structure of pfcs via electron transfer and meanwhile completely degrade pfcs via generated active radicals we further studies via capturing and scavenging radicals and dft calculations find that electron hydroxyl radials play a dominant role in degrading pfcs based on the calculations of adsorption energy and molecular orbital energy we further demonstrate that many active sites on the surface of ti4o7 1 0 4 plane can rapidly take part in electrochemical reaction for generating radials and removing organic contaminants these results give a promising insight towards high effective and deep degradation of pfcs via electrochemical reaction coupled with advanced oxidation processes as well as providing guidance and technical support for the remove of multiple organic contaminants

and perfluoroalkyl chemicals pfcs are a class of diverse organic compounds and extensively used in various fields wang et al 2021a zheng et al 2019 particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are typical pfcs are applied as lubricants surfactant textiles paper coatings cosmetics and fire fighting foams due to these advantages of thermal resistance large surface activity strong physiochemical properties stable resistance to high photolysis temperature and biological degradation fenner 2020 umeh et al 2021 wang et al 2021c recently pfcs with high mobility have been determined globally in ground waters surface waters sediments at concentrations from nanograms per liter to several milligrams per liter at sites crone et al 2019 and they are even accumulated in animal and human muscles liver blood and heart leading to poisoning zheng et al 2021 zhuang et al 2020 these long chain pfcs possess severe toxicity such as immunotoxicity hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity due to high accumulation potential li et al 2021 tang et al 2021 pfos and pfoa as persistent organic pollutants have been listed in the stockholm conversion as annex b substance by the us epa and the maximum limited value in drinking water is 70 ng l 1 yang et al 2021 the refractory pfcs with stable physiochemical properties can be attributed to i high redox potential of fluorine e0 3 6v ii high energy c f bonds 530 kj mol and iii the formation of shield by perfect overlap of fluorine and carbon orbitals to inhibit the nucleophillic attack wang et al 2019 the previous studies have found that pfcs is slightly removed via traditional wastewater treatment plants and thus the estimated human daily intake of pfcs may be 1 5 via drinking water wang et al 2020a 2021a consequently it is urgent to explore some effective techniques to remove these pfcs to eliminate their adverse health effects the presence of multiple and stable c f bonds in the structure of pfcs makes them difficult to degradation from water environment and which cannot be removed by ozonation filtration and microbial degradation chen et al 2021 in addition advanced oxidation processes aops with the generation of sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh cannot also effectively destruct the structure of carbon chains with full fluorine due to strong tolerance of pfcs zhang et al 2021a certain novel technologies have been developed to degrade pfcs including thermolysis photo oxidation photo reduction plasma oxidation ultrasonic irradiation zerovalent iron reduction and other technologies chen et al 2021 he et al 2020 qian et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 nevertheless these technologies often suffer various limitations including the addition of high dosage chemicals consumption of high energy harsh treatment conditions and difficulty in scaling up shi et al 2019 wang et al 2020c in comparison with the above methods electrooxidation have been confirmed to an efficient and potential methods for pfcs degradation due to strong oxidation capacity robustness mild condition high efficiency and environmental compatibility wang et al 2020c the anode electrode material plays a key role in the eo process carbon based materials graphite rod plate dimensionally stable anode pbo2 sno2 ruo2 iro2 and zno boron doped diamond bdd and noble metal have been explored as an anode electrode for removing organic pollutants liu et al 2019a shin et al 2019 wang et al 2021b among these electrodes the bdd electrode can high effectively degrade pfcs due to the long lifetime stable physiochemical and electrochemical properties and high oxygen evolution potential but the expensive price limited its large scale application shin et al 2019 some sb bi ce and f elements doped ti sno2 electrodes exhibit also outstanding removal efficiency for pfcs but the short lifetime and potential toxic released by metal elements greatly limited the implementation of these technologies wang et al 2020b recently magnéli phase titanium oxides with a generic formula of tixo2x 1 10 x 4 have been applied in water treatment field wang et al 2018b among these compounds ti4o7 a magnéli phase titanium sub oxides has been developed as potential candidates for electrochemical oxidation due to excellent electric conductivity 1500 s cm 1 high redox potential 2 5 v vs ag agcl and low cost of production li et al 2022c recent studies have confirmed that ti4o7 is an ideal electrode for effectively electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants including chloroform phenol amoxicillin tetracycline dyes as well as disinfecting viruses ganiyu et al 2016 li et al 2022c wang et al 2018b in addition ti4o7 is mainly obtained from titanium oxides which is a low cost abundant ingredient in the earth ibrahim et al 2018 accordingly these advantages make ti4o7 more cost effective and environmentally friendly than those of bdd and sno2 electrodes ganiyu et al 2016 lin et al 2021 the previous report has confirmed that ti4o7 used as anode electrode for electrochemical oxidation of pfos and pfoa can achieve promising results lin et al 2021 it should be noted that ti4o7 behaved as a potential anode can generate reactive oxygen species ros involving direct electron transfer reactions via water oxidation during electrochemical oxidation li et al 2022c but the amounts of ros are not enough to remove organic pollutants in general naclo4 is used as the electrolyte for removing pfcs via electrochemical oxidation and achieved good performance shin et al 2019 yao et al 2021 however naclo4 is a water soluble and persistent contaminant from both natural sources and anthropogenic which can competitively inhibit iodides importer and reduce the available iodides dou et al 2019 in addition naclo4 is also a strong oxide which can bring combustion and explosion via rub or impact with organics zheng et al 2020 the use of naclo4 will bring secondary pollution and potential risks to environmental safety consequently the use of naclo4 during electrochemical oxidation with ti4o7 electrode for removing pfcs is not an ideal and safety choose few studies have explored pfcs removal via electrochemical oxidation eo process coupled with pms based aops due to the invalidity of the free radicals to degrade pfcs in our study the eo process with ti4o7 electrode is coupled with pms reaction eo ti4o7 pms to remove pfcs the absence of naclo4 will reduce the risk of secondary pollution and the use of pms will significantly promote the degradation efficiency of pfos why the use of ti4o7 can obviously remove pfos what is the key active site what is the intrinsic relationship between the active site and metal facets how do electrons are transferred during electrochemical oxidation in these previous studies the key sites in the ti4o7 have not been clarified and the study of the electron transfer mechanism is also weak to replace the use of naclo4 pms is introduced into the electrolyte and pms can release reactive oxygen species ros oh and so4 under the action of eo firstly the electron is rapidly generated with the input of current due to the excellent conductivity of ti4o7 and then the generated electron will break some chemical bonds of pfcs molecule to produce relatively unstable intermediates of pfcs meanwhile the generated ros from pms reaction during electrochemical reaction will further attack the intermediates of pfcs to produce short chain products even co2 h2o and f ion in our previous study we have confirmed that the eo process coupled with pms process can significantly destroy organic contaminants here the use of pms in eo process with ti4o7 electrode can achieve potential degradation performance for various organic contaminants to address the above vital points we evaluate the performance of eo process with active ti4o7 electrode coupled with pms reaction and various pollutants such as methyl orange mo 4 chlorphenol 4 cp tetracycline tc and pfcs are removed via this technique to evaluate its universality we aim to 1 quantifying the contribution of different ros to organic pollutants 2 figuring out the key active sties in surface of ti4o7 structure 3 exploring the stability of the electrode after many cycle operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents pfcs and mass labelled pfcs injection

construction and operation the electrochemical reactor with an effective volume of 500 ml contained anode and cathode electrodes the ti plate and ti4o7 electrode were used as cathode and anode electrode 40 40 mm respectively and these electrodes were connected to negative and positive poles of dc power supply the gap between anode and cathode electrode was controlled in 2 cm a magnetic stirring installation with the rate of 800 rpm min was employed in the reactor to keep uniform mass transfer here the ti4o7 electrode was synthesized by gel cast method as shown in text s2 during electrochemical operation the reactor electrolyte contained organics of 5 mg l 1 nacl of 10 mm and amounts of pms solution the desired solution ph was adjusted by naoh and hcl solution the samples were extracted for each interval via 0 20 μm glass filter membrane in determining the concentration of organics all degradation experiments were repeated triple the radicals and non radicals quenching experiments were run via introducing the quenching reagents with different concentrations into the solution 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of pfcs contained pfoa and pfos were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms ms coupled with an api 4000 q trap spectrometer in addition concentrations of 4 cp tc and mo were detected by hplc agilent 1200 the reactive oxygen species were detected by electron paramagnetic response epr bruker usa center field 3500 g sweep width 1000 g spectrum with temp and dmpo as the spin trapping reagents in the solution typically pms 10 mm solution was introduced to 50 ml the prepared pfos solution 10 mg l 1 with a magnetic stirring process and the current density was controlled at 20 ma cm 1 subsequently 200 ul dmpo or 50 mg temp were mixed with the above solution finally samples were extracted for testing at 20 and 40 min 2 4 computational calculation dft calculations for adsorption energy and charge difference density were conducted based on the vienna ab inito simulation package vasp kresse and furthmüller 1996a 1996b the electron ion interactions were described by the projected augmented wave paw potentials while the exchange correlation interactions were calculated by employing the perdew burke enzerhof pbe pseudopotentials of generalized gradient approximation gga blöchl 1994 the vdw d3 method developed by grimme was employed to describe the van der waals interaction grimme et al 2010 the spin polarized set was taken into account the plane wave energy cutoff was set as 520 ev the convergence threshold was set as 1 0 10 6 ev in energy and 0 02 ev per angstrom in force two slab models were constructed on the optimized ti4o7 bulk at 104 and 1 20 facets a vacuum layer of 15 å was adopted to avoid the periodic interactions the brillouin zone was modeled by gamma centered monkhorst pack scheme in which a 1 4 1 and 4 2 1 grid was adopted for ti4o7 104 and ti4o7 1 20 respectively accordingly the interaction energy is defined as following 1 e a d s e t o t a l e s u r f a c e e p m s where eads is adsorption energy of pms on surface e total is the energy of pms and ti4o7 composite e surface is the energy of surface and e pms is the energy of pms respectively dmol3 program in materials studio was utilized to optimize molecular structure and calculate molecular orbital mo based on the generalized gradient approximation gga in the form of the perdew burke ernerhof function aihara 1999 ricca et al 2018 an all electron double numerical atomic orbital augmented by double numerical plus polarization dnp is used as the basis set and dft semicore pseudopotentials dspps were used for the interactions between the ion core and the valence electrons the convergence criteria in total energy maximum force and maximum displacement were set at 10 5 hartree 0 002 hartree å and 0 005 å respectively the electronic self consistent field scf tolerance was set at 10 6 hartree in addition gaussian 09 and gaussview 05 were used to optimize molecular structure and calculation mo basis set b3lyp 6 311 g d p dang et al 2020 frisch et al 2009 ji et al 2020 lu and chen 2012 and results were consistent with the results from ms calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation properties of organics the performance of the electrode for organics degradation was assessed by using pfos as a representative pollutants as shown in fig 1 a pfos can be completely removed on the electrode with pms and nacl as the electrolyte and a high kinetic rate 0 093 min 1 of pfos can be harvested within 60 min fig s1a it is obvious that the removal performance of control groups e g ti4o7 2 65 pms 1 11 e ti4o7 13 44 and ti4o7 pms 6 3 showed a limited pfos removal with a maximum kinetic rate and removal efficiency 0 005 min 1 and 15 respectively the findings suggested that the presence of pms played an important role in degrading pfos under electrochemical process in addition we also explored the electrochemical oxidation of multiple organic pollutants such as mo 4 cp tc and pfoa as shown in fig 1b the degradation efficiency significantly changed depending on different kinds of organics obviously these organics can be effectively removed within 30 min via ti4o7 electrode and mo can achieve the best degradation performance and kinetic rate of 0 159 min 1 fig s1b which indicated the ti4o7 electrode can not only degradation persistent polyfluoroalkyl compounds but also can effectively degrade diazide dyes antibiotics and monocyclic benzene series and the above studies proved the excellent and potential properties of ti4o7 electrode for removing of multiple organic pollutants as shown in fig 1c different ph values of electrolyte from 2 5 to 11 6 did not significantly influence the degradation kinetic rate of pfos this suggested that the ti4o7 electrode coupled with pms activation undergoes less interference from general background ph solution current density was an important factor during electrochemical oxidation because it can affect the electron transfer between the electrode and contaminants as shown in fig 1a pfos cannot be effectively removed without current input the degradation performance of pfos was obviously promoted with the increase of current density fig 1d and the kinetic rate was also significantly increased from 0 02 to 0 109 min 1 with the current density was increased from 1 to 30 ma cm 2 fig s1c removal efficiency of pfos within 40 min was 53 2 83 7 94 2 99 9 and 99 9 for current density of 1 5 10 20 and 30 ma cm 2 respectively although the kinetic rate of pfos at 30 ma cm 2 was much higher than that of 20 ma cm 2 the removal efficiency of pfos was similar the finding was mainly due to excess generation of reactive oxygen species on the electrolyte was oxidized to oxygen under high current density wang et al 2020b meanwhile the effect of current density on the change of toc removal during electrochemical oxidation was also detected as shown in fig 1e toc removal was obviously improved at higher current density and toc removal efficiency was 81 5 at 30 ma cm 2 it should be noted that the higher current density can bring a decrease of current efficiency and an increase of electric energy consumption martinez huitle et al 2015 the electric energy consumption in this study can be calculated based on the eq 1 and the corresponding results were shown in table s1 dramatically the ee o value was increased with a decrease of current density meaning the high current density is more suitable for removing organics however some studies reported that a current oversupply would waste energy and damage electrode wang et al 2018a the degradation performance of pfos and corresponding electric energy consumption at 20 ma cm 2 was similar with those at 30 ma cm 2 consequently it was optimal to choose the current density of 20 ma cm 2 for the following pfos degradation operations in this study 2 ee o 1000 p t 60 v lg c 0 c t 38 375 p v k as exhibited in figs 1f and s1d pfos removal efficiencies were 76 62 94 33 97 2 99 99 and 87 68 within 40 min when the initial pms concentration is 1 2 5 10 and 20 mm respectively accordingly the kpfos value was increased from 0 036 to 0 093 min 1 the kpfos value at initial pms of 1 mm was low due to the generation of insufficient oxidative species especially oh and so4 however a continued increase of pms concentration 30 mm brought low removal efficiency and kpfos value of pfos which was mainly ascribed to the scavenging reaction between pms and so4 oh so4 hso5 so5 so4 h oh hso5 so5 h2o li et al 2019 the above results suggested pfos can be effectively mineralized by pms activation at ti4o7 electrode and the initial pms concentration of 5 mm was optimal and selected in this study as shown in table s2 e ti4o7 pms process in the current study achieved higher kinetic rate for pfos degradation than those of these reported studies which further confirmed the great potential of e ti4o7 pms process for degradation of organic contaminants 3 2 identification of reaction oxygen species radical quenching experiments were utilized to explore the active radical species contribution for pfos degradation in ti4o7 electrode as shown in fig 2 a the scavengers of cat sod ki nan3 bq ffa and lh had slightly effect on the degradation rate of pfos implying the minor generation of 1o2 and o2 active species li et al 2022a zhang et al 2021b meanwhile the degradation rate was significantly declined with the addition of tba etoh or meoh suggesting that these radicals of oh and so4 were mainly response for pfos degradation meoh etoh and tba due to high reactivity of oh and so4 was selected to scavenge both oh and so4 wang and wang 2020 as shown in figs 2b 2c and s2a pfos degradation was obviously inhibited with an increase of initial concentration of scavengers the pfos degradation performance was greatly limited with the introduction of meoh or etoh of 50 mm in comparison with meoh the addition of tba of 50 mm brought also obviously inhibition phenomenon meanwhile the degradation ratio of pfos was rapidly decreased with the increase of initial scavengers concentration based on figs 2d s2b c and d it should be noted that the inhibiting effect on tba was much weaker than those of meoh and etoh suggesting oh exhibited much bigger contributions than that of so4 to further distinguish the active species for the pfos degradation via ti4o7 electrode dmpo and temp were conducted to capture the oh so4 1o2 and o2 respectively li et al 2022b zhu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2e no obvious epr characteristic signals of dmpo o2 were detected during electrochemical oxidation indicating that no o2 was produced in this electrochemical process in addition no also corresponding signal peak was found with the addition of pms alone in the reaction system relatively an obvious four line spectrum with an intensity of 1 2 2 1 for the dmpo oh spin adduct with an ah 14 9 g was found from fig 2e further confirming the generation of oh during electrochemical oxidation with ti4o7 electrode liu et al 2021 in addition the signal density of dmpo oh continued to increase with the reaction time which suggested that pms activation during electrochemical process could boost oh generation the change of peak intensity for dmpo so4 was also observed based on the typical hyperfine splitting constant with an 13 2g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g ah 0 78 g confirming the continuous generation of so4 during electrochemical oxidation wang et al 2018c the signal intensity of dmpo oh was significantly higher than that of dmpo so4 meaning a higher concentration of oh generation moreover a representative triplet spectrum 1 1 1 with an 7 2 g and ah 4 1 g was observed by using temp as the spin agent demonstrating the generation of active 1o2 during reaction system shao et al 2018 the intensity increased minorly in the 40 min suggesting the continuous release of 1o2 besides we quantitatively determined the concentration of these ros in these reaction system we can find from fig 2f that the concentration of these ros was increased with the reaction time and the concentration of oh and so4 radical was greatly higher that of 1o2 meanwhile the concentration of oh radical was also higher than that of so4 radical as shown in fig s8 much quicker decomposition of pms than pfos degradation in the e ti4o7 process was observed suggesting that the ros can be rapidly generated in this electrochemical activation process alone pms cannot be decomposed which was consistent with minor degradation of pfos in fig 1a thus pms played an important role in degrading pfos it can be seen from fig s3 that the degradation rate of pfos kept stable state with the addition of different atmosphere o2 air or ar indicating that the o for oh and so4 was not derived from dissolving oxygen in the electrolyte the quantization experiments of ros and the corresponding epr measurements suggested that the generated 1o2 eq 6 played a negligible effect on pfos degradation and the generated oh and so4 radical eqs 3 7 was responsible for pfos removal the oh radical exhibited a dominant role in degrading pfos during electrochemical oxidation 3 hso5 energy input so4 oh 4 h2o e h oh 5 so4 h2o hso4 oh 6 hso5 so5 2 so4 2 hso4 1o2 7 so4 2 e so4 3 3 electron transfer pathway to achieve insight into the surface electron conduction and transformation mechanisms the optimized configuration and the corresponding density of states for the ti4o7 slabs with different planes were analyzed to clarify the changes in the electronic structure as shown in fig 3 a ti4o7 with regular structure was obtained from materials project database belongs to the p1 2 space group with a lattice constant of 5 638 å 6 957 å 7 184 å in comparison with the flat surface plane significant fluctuation can be observed on the ti4o7 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 plane and the geometry structures of these atoms shifted obviously fig 3a c e these structures of the 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes studied in this work were shown in fig 3c and e the computed density of states revealed band gap of 0 238 0 001 and 0 005 ev for the pristine ti4o7 the 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes of ti4o7 fig 3d f compared with the pristine ti4o7 the lower band gap for 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes meaning electron can be rapidly transferred in these planes guo et al 2021 meanwhile significantly higher pdos intensity for 1 0 4 than 1 2 0 indicating stronger conductivity in 1 0 4 plane and thus we can conclude that 1 0 4 plane of ti4o7 played an important role in transferring electron and taking part in electrochemical reaction the charge density distribution between pms and surface ti4o7 was further explored by the dft calculations the adsorption of pms on different surface of ti4o7 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes most probably followed the electron acceptor complex mechanism relating to ti as the electron donor and oh on pms as the electron acceptor which can be confirmed by dft calculations li et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a d the optimized configurations for pms adsorption on ti4o7 1 2 0 and 1 0 4 planes among which the adsorption of pms on 1 0 4 plane with the shorter ti to o distance 1 968 å than 1 2 0 plane 2 072 å was much stronger than 1 2 0 in addition oh and so4 was formed and adsorbed on the surface of ti4o7 to take part in activating reaction due to the break of o o in pms molecule during adsorption reaction process based on electrochemical effect the findings also demonstrated ti4o7 with strong conductivity and activating surface structure was beneficial to pms activation during the electrochemical process as shown in fig 4e the adsorption energy between pms and ti4o7 1 0 4 plane was 5 50 ev more negative than that of 1 2 0 plane 4 31 ev indicating the electron can be easily transferred from ti4o7 to pms in 1 0 4 plane and pms was more likely to adsorb onto ti4o7 1 0 4 plane accordingly ti4o7 1 0 4 exhibited the best activity for adsorbing pms during electrochemical process which was in accordance with the results in fig 3 radical and nonradical pathways during pms reaction played an important role for pfos degradation and the electron transfer pathway was explored by dft calculations figs s5 and 4f exhibited the optimized geometrical configurations of oh pfos ti4o7 and pms and the corresponding mo energy levels lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and highest occupied molecular orbital homo in nonradical pathway the electron was released from the electrode during electrochemical reaction process to break the stable structure of pfos meanwhile pms in the ti4o7 surface was decomposed to oh so4 and 1o2 via a series of reactions eqs 3 7 here ti4o7 with the narrow energy gap could serve as the conductive bridge to promote the electron transformation from the electron donor pfos to the electron acceptor pms the electron located at the homo 0 698 ev of pfos can be easily transferred to the lumo 8 054 ev of pms via the ti4o7 driven via an energy difference and thus bringing pms breakdown under electrochemical effect pms can abstract an electron from pfos to generate so4 and oh to attack pfos and its intermediates it should be noted from fig s7 that higher oxygen evolution potential oep from 1 60 v vs ag agcl only electrolyte to 1 68 v vs ag agcl pms activation with the addition of 10 mm pms the increase of oep and the decrease of current response indicated that the introduction of pms could inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction decrease the energy consumption and enhance the electrochemical selectivity to the organic pollutants during degradation process song et al 2018 wang et al 2020b according to the above explorations a possible reaction mechanism was proposed that takes place on the surface of ti4o7 and pms as shown in fig 4g initially pms was adsorbed on the activating surface of ti4o7 1 0 4 due to the negative adsorption energy further generating so4 and oh radicals from pms activation reaction under electrochemical conditions meanwhile these radicals into electrolyte can attack pfos and bring the break of some chemical bonds further bringing the change of pfos from large molecule to small molecule intermediates even co2 and h2o thus electrochemical process coupled with pms reaction can efficiently remove pfos via fast electron transfer to further confirm the possible electron transfer pathway the other four organic pollutants mo tc pfoa and 4 cp was also studied and the corresponding degradation performance had been explored in fig 1b various molecular structure of these organic pollutants was obtained by dft calculations fig 5 a and 4 cp exhibited a highest homo lumo energy levels and potential differences emod 3 415 ev in addition a linear relationship between kobs constants of different organic pollutants and emod was obtained by linear fitting with a high r2 0 96 interestingly the relationship between kobs constant and emod was a positive correlation fig 5b suggesting the degradation performance of different pollutants was highly dependent on the emod the above findings not only clarified the electron transfer mechanism in the ti4o7 surface but also brought a valuable reference for the degradation of various organic pollutants the mineralization mechanism of pfos via electrochemical advanced oxidation process was proposed based on the fig 6 the rate limiting step for pfos degradation was the formation of a perfluoroalkyl radical c8f17so3 by direct electron transfer and then c8f16o will be formed due to the attack of high activity oh radical subsequently ascribing to the effects of water molecule and electron the c8f16o and formed c7f15co2 will lose hf and co2 respectively to produce c7f15 meanwhile c7f15oh will be formed due to the action of oh radical finally pfos can be further mineralized from large pfos molecule to small intermediates even co2 and h2o via repeating the hf and co2 unzipping cycle steps 3 4 performance in different water matrices and stability it is well known that anions no3 hco3 and cl and nom with high levels were ubiquitous in natural water body and their presence will obviously affect the electrochemical reaction we further explored degradation experiments under various conditions to assess the degradation performance of pfos in e ti4o7 pms process as shown in fig 7 a c the degradation efficiency of pfos was slightly decreased when low concentration ions 1 mm were introduced into the electrolyte nevertheless the degradation efficiency was significantly decreased with the increases of ions concentration from 1 to 10 mm meanwhile the degradation kinetic rate of pfos was also declined from 0 093 to 0 056 0 055 and 0 031 min 1 with the addition of no3 hco3 and cl respectively fig s4a c further confirming the inhibiting effect of the presence of anions wang and wang 2021 the effect of these anions on the degradation pfos followed the incremental order cl hco3 no3 the changes from the addition of no3 hco3 and co3 were mainly attributed to the side reactions between hco3 or co3 and free radicals and the competing reactions between hco3 or co3 and pms at the electrode surface liu et al 2019b the weak degradation performance of pfos in the presence of cl was primarily due to the rapid oxidation reaction between cl and oh or so4 to form a series of chlorine radicals e g cloh and cl and the competition of cl with pfos to react with oh or so4 was obvious eqs 8 and 9 wang et al 2020b in addition the degradation kinetics of these chlorine species reacted with the others other pollutants were higher than those of oh or so4 but with relatively low standard potentials e cloh cl 1 3 vnhe e cl cl 2 4 vnhe and thus inhibiting the degradation efficiency dou et al 2022 pang et al 2020 as can be seen from fig 7 d increasing ha concentration from 5 to 100 mg l 1 brought a continuous decrease in the degradation performance of pfos and the degradation rate of pfos was also declined from 0 093 to 0 018 min 1 fig s4d excessive humic acid will not only compete adsorption site for direct electron transfer with pfos but also consume the formed radicals and thus inhibiting the formation of surface reactive species and reducing degradation efficiency of pfos luo et al 2019 peng et al 2021 besides the electrochemical system was operated with the contaminated water derived from various types of sources including deionized water tap water and peal river water from guangdong province as shown in fig 7 e high pfos removal rate can be achieved in tap water and peal river water with the removal rate of 97 5 and 94 3 and the corresponding toc removal rate fig 7 f were 77 8 and 69 6 respectively although these results were slightly lower than those of deionized water the desired pfos removal rate can be harvested via minorly enhanced the input of current density it should be noted that the concentration of these anions in natural water was relatively low and thus the electrochemical oxidation with ti4o7 electrode exhibited excellent practical prospects on pfos degradation 8 cl oh cloh oh 9 cl so 4 so 4 cl the stability of ti4o7 electrode for electrochemical oxidation was investigated by multiple continuous pfos degradation experiments vacuum drying was examined to recover the activity of the electrode for the next experiment as shown in fig 8 a after consecutive 5 10 and 20 cycles of degradation experiments the removal rate of pfos remained 98 5 98 1 and 96 4 which were slightly lower than the first cycle meanwhile the corresponding degradation kinetic rate of pfos was also obtained from fig 8b and the rate were only minorly decreased from 0 093 to 0 089 0 087 and 0 079 min 1 respectively obviously the activity of electrode after vacuum drying was worse than the original performance and the residual pfos in solution still posed a potential threat to the environment accordingly we supposed that the active sites on the surface of electrode were covered by some intermediate products after multiple use further leading to the weak electrochemical reaction we used ultrasonic treatment method in 0 1 m h2so4 solution to clean the used electrode for restoring the active sites after each 20 cycles as exhibited in fig 8c the degradation efficiency of pfos was recovered to the original level and the corresponding degradation kinetic rate had slight change fig s6 it can be seen from fig 8d that the degradation kinetic rate of pfos was consecutively decreased without the ultrasonic treatment after ultrasonic treatment in each 20 cycles the kinetic rate can keep a high level and pfos can be effectively removed which were mainly ascribed to the decomposition of some uncomplete mineralized products on the electrode surface in addition the leaching of ti ion has been detected by icp aes and the concentration of ti ion during the electrooxidation reaction is less than 0 2 µg l 1 suggesting very limiting leaching of ti ion from the ti4o7 electrode the above findings indicated ti4o7 electrode with superior durability and stability exhibited great potential for electrochemical oxidation of pfcs 4 conclusions recently the aops has been widely considered as a potential technology for treating wastewater compared with the traditional wastewater methods due to their high effective and rapid characters for removing high load of organic wastewater however these technologies have been greatly limited for treating pfcs wastewater because of extreme chemical stability and resistance of pfcs in the current work we use electrochemical oxidation technology coupled with advanced oxidation processes to study the electron transfer and degradation behaviors of multiple organic contaminants especially pfos degradation properties first the comprehensive studies have confirmed that only pms or electrochemical oxidation cannot effectively remove pfos and the coupling use between electrochemical oxidation with pms reaction can completely remove pfos within 40 min with current density of 20 ma cm 1 and initial pms concentration of 10 mm and achieve a high kinetic rate up to 0 093 min 1 in addition the technology is still effective for degrading multiple organics contaminants mo 4 cp tc pfoa and pfos second use of various scavengers confirms that singlet oxygen hydroxyl and sulfate radicals can be generated from electrochemical pms reaction we further use epr analysis to verify that hydroxyl radical as well as the action of the electrons is the dominant radicals for degradation of pfos the high level of performance is ascribed to the intrinsic activity of the electrode the pms action and their coupling use we continue to explore the active sites on the surface of ti4o7 via dft calculations and we find ti4o7 1 0 4 plane with strong conductivity and negative adsorption energy can rapidly take part in some chemical reactions in addition ti4o7 with the narrow energy gap could serve as the conductive bridge to promote the electron transformation from the electron donor pfos to the electron acceptor pms the electron located at the homo of pfos can be easily transferred to the lumo of pms via the ti4o7 drove by an energy difference and thus bringing pms breakdown under electrochemical conditions third we explore the relationship between kinetic constants and emod and we observe the degradation performance of different pollutants is highly dependent on the emod besides we also explore the effects of different ions and these ions can limit the degradation efficiency of pfos to some extent however the concentration of these anions in natural water was relatively low and thus these ions will bring a slight effect on pfos degradation finally the ultrasonic treatment can significantly active the ti4o7 electrode so that the kinetic rate of pfos degradation can keep a high level and pfos can be effectively removed after regular ultrasonic treatment these results pave a new pathway to further treat multiple organic contaminants and provide a basis for further electron transfer and

this issue we firstly need to select the above mentioned nom distinguished from biopolymers therefore in this study we creatively used uf membranes prior to nf to filter out nom differ to large

put on the role of medium molecular weight organic matter in the membrane filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples the water samples were collected from the olympic park lake op beijing china the jingmi river jm beijing china and our laboratory s tap tap beijing china tap water was collected after it was run for 5 min the principal water quality parameters were listed in the si table

supporting information si table s2 in order to remove impurities in the membranes before use uf100k membranes were soaked in ethanol for several hours then they were transferred into pure water for the same reason uf20k membranes and all nf membranes were soaked in pure water for at least 24 h before filtration experiments membranes soaked in pure water were further selected only membranes having close pure water flux was used in the filtration experiments 2 3 the filtration experiments dead end flow filtration experiments were performed in a 400 ml cell amicon 8400 millipore with uf and nf membranes of 76 mm diameter a constant pressure provided by nitrogen gas for uf and nf was 1 bar and 4 bars respectively the operation process for nf membranes involved two parts namely filtration and backwash three cycles were carried out on the nf membranes with 50 ml of the corresponding feed water in each cycle backwash was performed through firstly carefully inverting the membrane during the interval between the cycles then the nf membrane was backwashed with 10 ml deionized water di under a constant pressure of 1 bar to clean reversible fouling and simultaneously evaluate irreversible membrane fouling lee et al 2021 su et al 2021a 2021b eventually the investigated and discussed samples involved the effluents from mf 0 45 µm pvdf membrane uf uf100k and uf20k mf

volume of the filtrate were monitored during the test the normalized flux j j0 was used to evaluate membrane fouling where j is the membrane flux over time and j0 is the membrane initial flux 2 4 2 dbps dbpfp measurement chlorination was used to form dbps for the tests of dbpfp from the op and the jm the extraction of trihalomethanes thms followed the united states environmental protection agency usepa method 551 1 munch and hautman 1995 and the extraction of haloacetic acids haas followed usepa method 552 3 usepa 2003 these extracted samples of dbps were analyzed through gas

injection volume was 1 μl high purity nitrogen 99 99 was used as carrier gas the flow rate was 1 ml min with a split ratio of 10 1 the heating program for measuring thms was as follows the temperature started from 40 c for 5 min increased to 80 c at a rate of 20 c min and then increased from 80 c to 160 c at a rate of 40 c min and was kept for 4 min at 160 c regarding the method for determining haas the gc was held at an initial temperature of 35 c for 9 min then the temperature increased at a rate of 2 5 c min to 60 c and continued to climb to 85 c at a rate of 10 c min after holding of 5 min at 85 c the temperature further increased to 205 c at a rate of 20 c min and was kept at 205 c for 5 min 2 4 3 other measurements the excitation and emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra of the water samples were analyzed through a eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan the apparent molecular weight mw distribution of the ultraviolet uv sensitive substances in water samples was determined by size exclusion chromatography sec using the waters hplc system 1525 binary pump model 1500 column heater 2998 photodiode array detector 2707 auto sampler waters united states with sec column phenomenex biosep μm s3000 290 å and security guard column phenomenex kj0 4282 10 mm sodium acetate solution was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min when sec was performed the

mf uf100k and uf20k respectively as the pore size decreases from mf fig 1 a to uf100k fig 1 b and then to uf20k fig 1 c the removal of chromophoric substances increased this trend i e the first trend was expected fig 1 d f compares chromophoric substances in op water after it was filtered by three filtration processes that included at least nf the chromphoric removal performance followed a descending order uf100k followed by nf270 uf100k nf270 fig 1 e mf followed by nf270 mf nf270 fig 1 d uf20k followed by nf270 uf20k nf270 fig 1 f this trend i e the second trend was very interesting because the combination of uf20k nf270 had the smallest pore size but the worst performance the two trends above were consistent with the sec data for the chromophoric sustances in fig 1 g and h they were also consistent with the toc and uv254 removal data in fig 2 the uv absorbance at 254 nm typically represents the activation degree of the aromatic group korshin et al 2009 the trends could be explained by the flux variation data in fig 1 i the largest flux decline at the third cycle occurred in the scenario of uf20k nf270 indicating that most fouling occurred to uf20k nf270 the medium molecular weight nom defined as nom that passed uf100k but did not pass uf20k played a positive role by protecting nf270 from fouling su et al 2017a 2021a it should be noted that as shown in fig 1 g the differences in the filtrates were mainly between 8 kda 20 kda which is the interval designated as nom of medium molecular weight and should be responsible for the results of fig 1 h to conclude one of its positive effects was its protective effect on membrane from fouling by participating in forming a layer blocked the transfer of molecules the other one was that the layer could simultaneously benefit to the rejection of contaminant 3 2 dbpfp removal the studied dbps types included thms haas and n dbps nitrogen containing disinfection by products tables s3 s5 the sum dbpfp removal efficiency of op and jm by various filtration processes are shown in fig 3 the removal performance of the membrane filtration processes for the three water samples followed the same descending order uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 uf100k uf20k the following results are of particular interest uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 and uf100k uf20k the trend of dbpfp removal was the same as the trend for nom removal discussed in section 3 1 and may be explained by the same reason figs 4 and 5 further show the removal of specific species of dbpfp figs 4 a d and 5 a show the concentrations of various thms various haas and the sum concentrations of thms and haas respectively for the op after filtration by various membrane processes thms included tcm trichloromethane bdcm bromodichloromethane and dbcm dibromochloromethane generated from op via different membrane filtration processes haas included bdcaa bromodichloroacetic acid cdbaa chlorodibromoacetic acid dcaa dichloroacetic acid tbaa tribromoacetic acid and tcaa trichloroacetic acid figure s2 a d and fig 5 d show the corresponding removal efficiency of membranes on corresponding components of thms haas and the sum of thms and haas respectively in addition the concentration fractions of the various classes of thms haas and the sum thms and haas of dbps are provided in fig s3 a fig 4 demonstrates that the removal of most specific thms haas and the sum of thms and haas after membrane filtration followed the same sequence of that uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 uf100k mf uf20k this trend is consistent with the abovementioned overall dbps removal trend again one interesting and unexpected trend was observed uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 this may be explained as follows the medium molecular weight nom defined as nom that passed uf100k but did not pass uf20k played a positive role in reducing dpbs the small molecular weight nom tended to generate more dbps than the medium molecular weight nom when the medium molecular weight nom was present in the scenario of mf nf270 they formed a protecting layer on the membrane surface of nf270 blocking the transfer of small molecular weight nom through nf270 to the filtrate and thereby reducing the generation of dbps when the medium molecular weight nom was absent in the scenario of uf20k nf270 more dbps were generated another interesting observation is that negative removal efficiency appeared for some dbps by uf20k uf100k and uf20k nf270 this may be explained by the same reason above the results for jm are shown in figs 4 b e 5 b e s2 b e and s4 the trend for jm was the same as that for op nevertheless difference could be observed from the results of two surface waters that the results of uf100k nf270 mf nf270 and uf20k nf270 of op was approaching but more discrepancy among them of jm was shown which was probably ascribed to their different characteristics of the filtered medium organic matter in addition it could be deduced from the results of uf100k nf270 mf nf270 that organic matter with the size that could be rejected by uf100k but not mf resulted in the higher dbpfp of mf nf270 that is organic matter of small molecules in this range are not conducive to controlling dbpfp moreover the highest dbpfp of uf20k nf270 as compared to uf100k nf270 and mf nf270 further supported this conclusion that the smaller molecular weight organic matter which were the dominating organic matter in the filtrate of uf20k facilitated the dbpfp while the existence of organic matter of the medium molecular weight contained in the filtrates of uf100k and mf advantaged in reducing dbpfp 3 3 dbps removal the sum dbps removal efficiency of tap by various filtration processes is shown in fig 3c the dbps results for tap are shown in figs 4 c f 5 c f s1 s2 c f and s5 the trend for tap was the same as that for op and jm regarding thms and n dbps but different from them regarding haas in general the haas removal increased when the pore size decreased mf uf100k uf20k uf100k nf270 uf20k nf270 mf nf270 which was probably ascribed to the difference of membrane on rejecting haas precursor and haas although dbps toxicity can be reduced by controlling their concentration dbps toxicity is also influenced by their species therefore the cytotoxicity was calculated based on the method listed in text s1 muellner et al 2007 zeng et al 2016 and is shown in fig 6 their cytotoxicity indexes cti followed similar order as that of their dbps removal performance in addition due to the higher toxicity of the brominated dbps the bromine substitution factors bsf of the filtrates of the three waters treated by various membrane filtration processes were calculated based on methods in previous studies hua and reckhow 2012 zeng et al 2016 which reflected the percentage of brominated dbps and thereby presented the performance of corresponding membrane filtration process on controlling bsf text s2 and fig s6 furthermore the correlation coefficients of membrane filtration process with dbps fig s7 a and with the bsf and cti was built to provide more detailed information fig s7 b for example as shown in fig s7 a the correlation coefficients of membrane filtration process with dbps of op suggested that several dbps tcm cdbaa bdcm tbaa dbcm tcaa bcdaa dcaa was predominately related to the membrane filtration processes of uf20k followed was uf100k and uf20k nf270 this is consistent with the dbps removal performance of uf20k uf100k uf100k nf270 the correlations between the membrane filtration process and dbps of jm had similar tendency as that of op different from that of the two surface waters the correlation coefficients of membrane filtration processes with dbps of tap mainly illustrated the high correlation coefficients of dcaa dcan bcan tcnm and dban with the membrane filtration process 4 conclusions for the first time the role of medium molecular weight natural organic matter nom in membrane filtration process and dbps control were systematically investigated in this study via combine membrane filtration process of uf and nf that performed on two surface waters and a water from a point of use i e a tap water the medium molecular weight nom was defined as nom that passed uf100k but did not pass uf20k here main conclusions have been drawn from a series experimental result and are as follows in addition to the expected conclusions on the one hand the medium molecular weight nom protected nf from fouling on the other hand it also reduced the production of dbps by forming a layer on the nf membrane surface blocking the transfer of small molecular weight nom into the nf filtrate and thereby reducing the formation of dbps later to conclude this study is expected to provide information about the role of nom of specific molecular weight in terms of the control of membrane fouling and dbps credit authorship contribution statement qingyun song methodology writing original

biopolymers present before uf su et al 2017b specifically we investigated membrane filtration processes of uf with membranes of two different pore sizes nf with membranes of nf270 and uf followed by nf by using two kinds of uf membranes and one nf membrane for reducing dbpfp dbps the feed to these processes included two surface waters and a water from a point of use i e a tap water emphasis was put on the role of medium molecular weight organic matter in the membrane filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples the water samples were collected from the olympic park lake op beijing china the jingmi river jm beijing china and our laboratory s tap tap beijing china tap water was collected after it was run for 5 min the principal water quality parameters were listed in the si table

yangsheng membrane technology beijing co ltd polyamide pa nf membranes nf270 mw cut off 400 da were purchased from zhongke ruiyang membrane technology beijing co ltd details can be found in the supporting information si table s2 in order to remove impurities in the membranes before use uf100k membranes were soaked in ethanol for several hours then they were transferred into pure water for the same reason uf20k membranes and all nf membranes were soaked in pure water for at least 24 h before filtration experiments membranes soaked in pure water were further selected only membranes having close pure water flux was used in the filtration experiments 2 3 the filtration experiments dead end flow filtration experiments were performed in a 400 ml cell amicon 8400 millipore with uf and nf membranes of 76 mm diameter a constant pressure provided by nitrogen gas for uf and nf was 1 bar and 4 bars respectively the operation process for nf membranes involved two parts namely filtration and backwash three cycles were carried out on the nf membranes with 50 ml of the corresponding feed water in each cycle backwash was performed through firstly carefully inverting the membrane during the interval between the cycles then the nf membrane was backwashed with 10 ml deionized water di under a constant pressure of 1 bar to clean reversible fouling and simultaneously evaluate irreversible membrane fouling lee et al 2021 su et al 2021a 2021b eventually the investigated and discussed samples involved the effluents from mf 0 45 µm pvdf membrane uf uf100k and uf20k mf nf mf nf270 and uf nf uf100k nf270 and uf20k nf270 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 flux measurement the flux variation was obtained from software through a computer all variables including weight and volume of the filtrate were monitored during the test the normalized flux j j0 was used to evaluate membrane fouling where j is the membrane flux over time and j0 is the membrane initial flux 2 4 2 dbps dbpfp measurement chlorination was used to form dbps for the tests of dbpfp from the op and the jm the extraction of trihalomethanes thms followed the united states environmental protection agency usepa method 551 1 munch and hautman 1995 and the extraction of haloacetic acids haas followed usepa method 552 3 usepa 2003 these extracted samples of dbps were analyzed through gas

haas the gc was held at an initial temperature of 35 c for 9 min then the temperature increased at a rate of 2 5 c min to 60 c and continued to climb to 85 c at a rate of 10 c min after holding of 5 min at 85 c the temperature further increased to 205 c at a rate of 20 c min and was kept at 205 c for 5 min 2 4 3 other measurements the excitation and emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra of the water samples were analyzed through a eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan the apparent molecular weight mw distribution of the ultraviolet uv sensitive substances in water samples was

mf uf100k and uf20k respectively as the pore size decreases from mf fig 1 a to uf100k fig 1 b and then to uf20k fig 1 c the removal of chromophoric substances increased this trend i e the first trend was expected fig 1 d f compares chromophoric substances in op water after it was filtered by three filtration processes that included at least nf the chromphoric removal performance followed a descending order uf100k followed by nf270 uf100k nf270 fig 1 e mf followed by nf270 mf nf270 fig 1 d uf20k followed by nf270 uf20k nf270 fig 1 f this trend i e the second trend was very interesting because the combination of uf20k nf270 had the smallest pore size but the worst performance the two trends above were consistent with the sec data for the chromophoric sustances in fig 1 g and h they were also consistent with the toc and uv254 removal data in fig 2 the uv absorbance at 254 nm typically represents the activation degree of the aromatic group korshin et al 2009 the trends could be explained by the flux variation data in fig 1 i the largest flux decline at the third cycle occurred in the scenario of uf20k nf270 indicating that most fouling occurred to uf20k nf270 the medium molecular weight nom defined as nom that passed uf100k but did not pass uf20k played a positive role by protecting nf270 from fouling su et al 2017a 2021a it should be noted that as shown in fig 1 g the differences in the filtrates were mainly between 8 kda 20 kda which is the interval designated as nom of medium molecular weight and should be responsible for the results of fig 1 h to conclude one of its positive effects was its protective effect on membrane from fouling by participating in forming a layer blocked the transfer of molecules the other one was that the layer could simultaneously benefit to the rejection of contaminant 3 2 dbpfp removal the studied dbps types included thms haas and n dbps nitrogen containing disinfection by products tables s3 s5 the sum dbpfp removal efficiency of op and jm by various filtration processes are shown in fig 3 the removal performance of the membrane filtration processes for the three water samples followed the same descending order uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 uf100k uf20k the following results are of particular interest uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 and uf100k uf20k the trend of dbpfp removal was the same as the trend for nom removal discussed in section 3 1 and may be explained by the same reason figs 4 and 5 further show the removal of specific species of dbpfp figs 4 a d and 5 a show the concentrations of various thms various haas and the sum concentrations of thms and haas respectively for the op after filtration by various membrane processes thms included tcm trichloromethane bdcm bromodichloromethane and dbcm dibromochloromethane generated from op via different membrane filtration processes haas included bdcaa bromodichloroacetic acid cdbaa chlorodibromoacetic acid dcaa dichloroacetic acid tbaa tribromoacetic acid and tcaa trichloroacetic acid figure s2 a d and fig 5 d show the corresponding removal efficiency of membranes on corresponding components of thms haas and the sum of thms and haas respectively in addition the concentration fractions of the various classes of thms haas and the sum thms and haas of dbps are provided in fig s3 a fig 4 demonstrates that the removal of most specific thms haas and the sum of thms and haas after membrane filtration followed the same sequence of that uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 uf100k mf uf20k this trend is consistent with the abovementioned overall dbps removal trend again one interesting and unexpected trend was observed uf100k nf270 mf nf270 uf20k nf270 this may be explained as follows the medium molecular weight nom defined as nom that passed uf100k but did not pass uf20k played a positive role in reducing dpbs the small molecular weight nom tended to generate more dbps than the medium molecular weight nom when the medium molecular weight nom was present in the scenario of mf nf270 they formed a protecting layer on the membrane surface of nf270 blocking the transfer of small molecular weight nom through nf270 to the filtrate and thereby reducing the generation of dbps when the medium molecular weight nom was absent in the scenario of uf20k nf270 more dbps were generated another interesting observation is that negative removal efficiency appeared for some dbps by uf20k uf100k and uf20k nf270 this may be explained by the same reason above the results for jm are shown in figs 4 b e 5 b e s2 b e and s4 the trend for jm was the same as that for op nevertheless difference could be observed from the results of two surface waters that the results of uf100k nf270 mf nf270 and uf20k nf270 of op was approaching but more discrepancy among them of jm was shown which was probably ascribed to their different characteristics of the filtered medium organic matter in addition it could be deduced from the results of uf100k nf270 mf nf270 that organic matter with the size that could be rejected by uf100k but not mf resulted in the higher dbpfp of mf nf270 that is organic matter of small molecules in this range are not conducive to controlling dbpfp moreover the highest dbpfp of uf20k nf270 as compared to uf100k nf270 and mf nf270 further supported this conclusion that the smaller molecular weight organic matter which were the dominating organic matter in the filtrate of uf20k facilitated the dbpfp while the existence of organic matter of the medium molecular weight contained in the filtrates of uf100k and mf advantaged in reducing dbpfp 3 3 dbps removal the sum dbps removal efficiency of tap by various filtration processes is shown in fig 3c the dbps results for tap are shown in figs 4 c f 5 c f s1 s2 c f and s5 the trend for tap was the same as that for op and jm regarding thms and n dbps but different from them regarding haas in general the haas removal increased when the pore size decreased mf uf100k uf20k uf100k nf270 uf20k nf270 mf nf270 which was probably ascribed to the difference of membrane on rejecting haas precursor and haas although dbps toxicity can be reduced by controlling their concentration dbps toxicity is also influenced by their species therefore the cytotoxicity was calculated based on the method listed in text s1 muellner et al 2007 zeng et al 2016 and is shown in fig 6 their cytotoxicity indexes cti followed similar order as that of their dbps removal performance in addition due to the higher toxicity of the brominated dbps the bromine substitution factors bsf of the filtrates of the three waters treated by various membrane filtration processes were calculated based on methods in previous studies hua and reckhow 2012 zeng et al 2016 which reflected the percentage of brominated dbps and thereby presented the performance of corresponding membrane filtration process on controlling bsf text s2 and fig s6 furthermore the correlation coefficients of membrane filtration process with dbps fig s7 a and with the bsf and cti was built to provide more detailed information fig s7 b for example as shown in fig s7 a the correlation coefficients of membrane filtration process with dbps of op suggested that several dbps tcm cdbaa bdcm tbaa dbcm tcaa bcdaa dcaa was predominately related to the membrane filtration processes of uf20k followed was uf100k and uf20k nf270 this is consistent with the dbps removal performance of uf20k uf100k uf100k nf270 the correlations between the membrane filtration process and dbps of jm had similar tendency as that of op different from that of the two surface waters the correlation coefficients of membrane filtration processes with dbps of tap mainly illustrated the high correlation coefficients of dcaa dcan bcan tcnm and dban with the membrane filtration process 4 conclusions for the first time the role of medium molecular weight natural organic matter nom in membrane filtration process and dbps control were systematically investigated in this study via combine membrane filtration process of uf and nf that performed on two surface waters and a water from a point of use i e a tap water the medium molecular weight nom was defined as nom that passed uf100k but did not pass uf20k here main conclusions have been drawn from a series experimental result and are as follows in addition to the expected conclusions on the one hand the medium molecular weight nom protected nf from fouling on the other hand it also reduced the production of dbps by forming a layer on the nf membrane surface blocking the transfer of small molecular weight nom into the nf filtrate and thereby reducing the formation of dbps later to conclude this study is expected to provide information about the role of nom of specific molecular weight in terms of the control of membrane fouling and dbps credit authorship contribution statement qingyun song methodology writing original

16174,disentangling the drivers and mechanisms that shape microbial communities in a river influenced coastal upwelling system requires considering a hydrologic dimension that can drive both deterministic and stochastic community assembly by generating hydrological heterogeneity and dispersal events additionally ubiquitous and complex microbial interactions can play a significant role in community structuring however how the hydrology biotic and abiotic factors collectively shape microbial distribution in the hydrologically complicated river plume upwelling coupling system remains unknown through underway sampling and daily observations we employed 16s and 18s ribosomal rna sequencing to disentangle drivers and mechanisms shaping the protist bacteria microbiota in a river influenced coastal upwelling system our findings indicate that the composition of microbial communities was water mass specific collectively water mass local water chemistry mostly temperature and biotic interaction mostly cross domain biotic interaction shaped the protistan bacterial communities in comparison to protists bacteria were more influenced by abiotic factors such as temperature than by cross domain biotic factors implying a stronger coupling of geochemical cycles both deterministic and stochastic processes had an effect on the distribution of microbial communities but deterministic processes were more important for bacteria and were especially pronounced for upwelling communities the co occurrence network revealed strong associations between the protistan assemblages orchrophyta and ciliophora and the bacterial assemblages alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes which may reflect predation and mutualism interactions overall this study emphasizes the importance of taking water masses temperature and domains of life into account when seeking to understand the drivers and assemblies of protist bacteria microbiome dynamics in coastal upwelling systems which is especially true given the complex and dynamic nature of the coastal ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protist bacteria water mass microbial interaction environmental filtering upwelling regime 1 introduction continental shelf ecosystems are the transitional zones between the continent and the open ocean that receive a large amount of anthropogenic runoff from rivers and are strongly influenced by physical processes such as oceanic currents agardi et al 2005 complicating the relationships between biological communities and environmental factors coastal upwelling is one such forcing that has been demonstrated to alter the associated regional ecology by altering the structure of the microbial communities that form the foundation of the marine food web wang et al 2015 bacterial communities in upwelled oceanic waters were found to be more diverse possess greater metabolic potential and exhibit a distinct community structure when compared to those in non upwelling waters bacterioplankton diversity was estimated to be greater in waters influenced by upwelling than in waters influenced by anthropogenic activity in brazil s coastal region cury et al 2011 bacterial production and growth rates increased in upwelling influenced waters off india s southwest coast due to increased primary production and dissolved organic carbon anas et al 2018 meta transcriptomic and meta proteomic analyses of upwelling communities revealed an enrichment of transporters with substrates for amino acids taurine polyamines and glutamine sowell et al 2011 indicating an increased capacity for nutrient transformation known particle degraders such as assemblages of alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes had a greater relative abundance in bacterial communities in the mauritania upwelling bachmann et al 2018 several factors including temperature bachmann et al 2018 salinity zäncker et al 2018 availability of nutrients raes et al 2018 and dissolved oxygen aldunate et al 2018 have been implicated in the regulation of bacterial communities in upwelling ecosystems previous studies expand our knowledge of bacterial communities and their abiotic shaping factors in upwelling waters cury et al 2011 sowell et al 2011 bachmann et al 2018 however in hydrologically complex river plume upwelling coupling systems the influence of physical processes can be particularly significant because the movement of water masses often results in strong dispersal limitation in microbial communities between water masses djurhuus et al 2017 additionally the river plume transports relatively warm and less saline water in the system whereas the upwelling regime transports relatively colder and more saline water gan et al 2009 the contrast in the water mass compositions between the river plume and upwelling regimes often generates temporally dynamic fronts that exert a strong influence on microbial communities by inducing accumulation and exchange of nutrients and microorganisms inhabiting water masses gan et al 2009 however how hydrological and environmental conditions interact to shape the microbial patterns observed in the river plume upwelling coupling system remains unknown in comparison to bacteria protists which comprise an enormous diversity of microbial eukaryotes and perform a wide variety of ecological roles as primary producers predators symbionts or parasites caron 2017 have received significantly less attention for their roles and responses to upwelling furthermore the majority of these limited efforts have been directed toward specific assemblages such as phototrophic protists tseng et al 2014 phagotrophic protists neuer and cowles 1994 or pico and nano sized protists hernandez ruiz et al 2018 due to their rapid and sustained cell division diatoms generally dominated the phytoplankton community in coastal upwelling systems by employing a complex mix of adaptive strategies such as decreasing silica content to avoid growth limitation mcnair et al 2018 phagotrophic protists such as ciliates thecate and gymnodinoid dinoflagellates and nonpigmented nanoflagellates were abundant and grazed rapidly during the upwelling season s algal bloom neuer and cowles 1994 nano sized mixotrophic flagellates supplied approximately 75 of the total carbon requirement for this plankton group in the nw iberian upwelling figueiras et al 2020 due to the sparse information on the full range of protists in coastal upwelling systems it is difficult to assess their ecological significance and influence on food web dynamics in the ecosystem to date the majority of research into the drivers of marine microbial communities has focused on environmental selection examining the role of abiotic factors temperature logares et al 2020 salinity logares et al 2018 and nutrients kirkham et al 2013 have all been demonstrated to play a significant role in environmental filtering which shapes protist and bacteria distributions on both local and global scales however it is well established that biotic factors also play a significant role in shaping microbial communities lima mendez et al 2015 indeed protist bacteria interactions are common in the ocean where they are involved in a variety of complex relationships including predator prey fuhrman and hagstrom 2008 and symbiont parasite host carpenter and foster 2002 and important substance exchanges such as the exchange of nutrients and vitamins carini et al 2014 thus their ubiquitous associations undoubtedly play a critical role in determining the microbial composition of protists and bacteria fuhrman and hagstrom 2008 as a result we anticipate that interactions between protists and bacteria via the multiple complex relationships mentioned above will result in a complex network of co occurrences however few studies have examined both groups concurrently as a biotic factor i e biotic selection logares et al 2020 and to our knowledge the role of protist bacteria associations in community assembly in a river influenced coastal upwelling system remains unknown as a result significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the collective effects of water masses biotic particularly cross domain biotic interaction and abiotic factors on protistan and bacterial communities in a river influenced coastal upwelling system with these considerations in mind we conducted underway sampling along shore transects to generate a spatial dataset that spans a large area with multiple depths and encompasses both the upwelling and river plume regimes then to further elucidate temporal variability we conducted daily observations of hydrography and biogeochemical variable profiles along the transect containing the front of river plume upwelling this systematic sampling design enabled us to gain a better understanding of how water masses biotic particularly cross domain biotic interaction factors and local environmental conditions collectively affect protistan and bacterial communities in this hydrologically complex system we investigate the protistan and bacterial communities and their drivers and assemblies in the yuedong upwelling system in the northern south china sea using high throughput sequencing on the v3 and v4 regions of small ribosomal rna gene transcripts fig 1 the yuedong upwelling system was influenced by the pearl river plume during the southwesterly monsoon and the interaction of the water masses resulted in complex hydrodynamics with strong dispersal limitation between water masses we tracked the biotic and abiotic changes in different water masses and investigated the possible roles of biotic particularly cross domain biotic interaction and abiotic factors in shaping microbial communities we anticipate greater selection on upwelled water communities than on the entire river influenced coastal upwelling system as the intrusion of the pearl river plume may have more stochastic effects on both microbial communities in the system as a whole additionally given the system s strong environmental gradients and the widespread association of protists and bacteria in water we hypothesize that both abiotic and cross domain biotic factors play a critical role in microbial communities additionally we anticipate that abiotic factors will play a greater role in bacterial communities than in protistan communities owing to bacterial communities stronger physiochemical coupling 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and station characteristics a total of 76 samples were taken at three water depths surface dcm and bottom at 18 sites spanning a spatial range of 114 72 e 117 01 e and 21 66 n 22 91 n between august 17th and 29th 2019 during the south china sea s southwesterly monsoon season first an underway survey was conducted using seabird sbe21 underway ctd sea bird scientific usa sbe 917 plus ctd sea bird scientific usa and towed acoustic doppler current profilers adcp whm 300k to characterize the upwelling and plume zones namely the yuedong upwelling and the pearl river plume prp the upper water column particularly at the majority of southwestern sampling locations was generally occupied by warm less saline water originating from the pearl river plume indicating prp intrusion into the coastal zone fig 1 the presence of colder more saline water in the dcm and on the bottom indicated coastal upwellings with the guidance of underway data the transect e5 was selected as the transect to investigate the daily fluctuation of the upwelling given the possibility of daily and depth changes in the microbial communities we collected samples daily from three water depths the surface 5 m the deep chlorophyll maximum dcm and the bottom of the transect s euphotic zone table s1 take note that we met typhoon bailu 201911 prior to conducting the transect e5 sampling five liters of seawater were prefiltered using a 200 μm nylon mesh sefar nitex to remove mesozooplankton and then progressively filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size polycarbonate filter millipore usa the filters were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until laboratory processing to determine bacterial and virus abundance 1 8 ml of a 20 μm pre filtered sample was fixed for 15 min in the dark with ice cold glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 1 and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80 c the abundance of bacteria and viruses was determined using a flow cytometer beckman coulter epics altra ii to remove bigger plankton samples for nanoflagellate enumeration were pre filtered via a 20 μm nylon mesh millipore united states approximately 50 ml of seawater was preserved with glutaraldehyde final concentration 0 5 at 4 c for 15 min and then filtered onto black 0 8 μm polycarbonate filters with approximately 1 ml of liquid remaining stained with dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole sigma usa for 10 min and filtered out all liquids the filters were paraffin embedded onto microscope slides and kept at a temperature of 20 c fluorescence microscope olympus bx51 japan was used to count nanoflagellates 2 2 rna extraction and miseq sequencing rna was isolated from polycarbonate filters using the rneasy mini kit qiagen usa following the manufacturer s instructions to eliminate any residual dna from the rna extracts the rnase free dnase kit qiagen germany was utilized as indicated in the kit procedure rna was promptly reverse transcribed to cdna

excised and purified using the wizard sv gel and pcr clean up system kit promega usa the meiji bioinformatics technology co ltd sequenced all purified pcr products using the illumina miseq platform shanghai china sequencing data for amplicons is accessible on the ncbi sra under the project code prjna785237 2 3 data analyses paired end sequences were merged and quality checked using flash magoč and salzberg 2011 and trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 according to the previously specified criteria sun et al 2021 the uchime algorithm implemented in usearch v10 was used to find and remove chimeras edgar 2013 to avoid the possibility of sequencing problems the singletons were removed using usearch v10 sequences were then grouped into otus with a 97 similarity level otu assignment was performed using the method blast against the pr2 4 7 2 guillou et al 2013 database for protists bacterial otus were assigned to taxonomic lineages using the silva v132 quast et al 2013 database prior to analysis non protist and non bacteria sequences such as metazoan fungi archaea plastid and unassigned sequences were removed to normalize the sampling effort the otu reads for each sample were rarefied to 16 103 reads for the protistan community and 20 981 reads for the bacterial community respectively alpha diversity richness and faith s phylogenetic diversity pd was calculated in r using the vegan package oksanen et al 2013 the dissimilarity between communities was calculated using the bray curtis distance and visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa with the vegan package the significant differences between groups of samples were subsequently examined with the analysis of similarity anosim phylogenetic trees were constructed for both groups i e protist and bacteria according to logares et al 2020 to summarize sample otu sequences were aligned using mothur against a silva aligned template schloss et al 2009 trimal was then used to exclude sequences nucleotides that were not well aligned capella gutierrez et al 2009 phylogenetic trees were constructed using fasttree implemented in qiime caporaso et al 2010 to evaluate whether phylogenetic turnover can be utilized to infer ecological processes the phylogenetic signal was initially investigated across phylogenetic distances following stegen et al 2012 the software vegan was used to generate mantel correlograms with 999 randomizations for significance tests then in accordance with stegen et al 2013 phylogenetic null model analysis was used to quantify ecological processes by decomposing them into the fundamental driving factors of dispersion limitation selection and drift first we estimated the weighted β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd to measure phylogenetic turnover this distance quantified the abundance weighted mean phylogenetic distance between the closest relatives appearing in the two group communities the expectation of the null model was derived using 1 000 randomizations the β nearest taxon index βnti which is the standard deviation of the observed βmntd from the mean of the null distribution was then calculated to evaluate if community composition was structured by selection or dispersal drift βnti values greater than 2 suggest community assembly is deterministic but βnti values less than 2 indicate community assembly is stochastic to determine the water mass mixing proportion we used an optimum multiparameter omp analysis karstensen and tomczak 1998 our observational data was used to determine the physicochemical characteristics of various source water types omp calculated the contribution of each water mass to each sample using salinity potential temperature dissolved oxygen nitrate and phosphate the matlab script used was publicly available at http omp geomar ed the bray curtis distance of the microbial community composition at each sample was compared to the proportion of water mass mixing spatial factors longitude latitude depth biotic cross domain biotic factors pcoa 1 and 2 abundances of hnf pnf bacteria and virus and abiotic temperature salinity turbidity dissolved oxygen nox srp and dsi factors using mantel and partial mantels we used distance based multivariate analysis for a linear model distlm implemented in primer 7 to determine the relative contribution of biotic pcoa 1 and 2 of protists and bacteria abundances of hnf pnf bacteria and virus and abiotic temperature salinity do turbidity nox srp dsi factors to community variation after performing forward selection the variance explained by biotic and abiotic components was calculated using the adjusted r2 selection criterion 999 permutations canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to investigate the relationships between biotic and abiotic variables and community variation a co occurrence network was constructed to determine the relationships between protists and bacteria to reduce noise and complexity in the network analysis otus having a relative abundance of less than 0 01 and detected in fewer than 30 of samples were eliminated from the study the hmisc package was used to calculate the spearman s rank coefficient r between the remaining otus the network analysis took into account correlations that were both robust r 0 6 and statistically significant false discovery rate corrected p values 0 01 to visualize networks and perform modular analysis we used the interactive gephi v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 connectors connecting distinct modules were identified using within module connectivity zi and between module connectivity pi guimerà and amaral 2005 these connectors were considered possible network keystone species deng et al 2012 by preserving otus present in each sample we generated sub networks for each water sample from the meta community network using the subgraph functions in the igraph package csardi and nepusz 2006 the package calculates network level topological features for each sub network we were then able to determine the effect of cross domain biotic associations on microbial co occurrence patterns by evaluating the relationship between alpha diversity a proxy for cross domain biotic factors and network topology we used random forest analysis to determine the role and relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in driving microbial co occurrence patterns including alpha diversity abundances of hnf pnf bacteria and virus and physiochemical factors the various biotic and abiotic variables were used to predict network topology i e network size network connectivity average degree network density average clustering coefficient and network modularity as response variables the investigation was carried out using the randomforest package rcolorbrewer and liaw 2018 random forest models containing 1000 trees were trained using 100 repeats of 10 fold cross validation and the amount of variables sampled at each node was optimized the rfpermute package archer 2019 was used to determine the importance of each predictor in this case biotic and abiotic variables for the response variables the least square linear regression was performed to confirm the relationship between biotic associations environmental factors predictable variables and network topological parameters response variables using a method developed by lima mendez et al 2015 we also tested one by one whether a network edge link was related to abiotic factors i e environmental filtering if a link between two taxa is caused by their covariation with environmental conditions strong correlations should exist between each taxon and representative environmental variables following yuan et al 2021 we tested all of the network s links against the seven environmental variables in order to identify taxon taxon environmental links 3 results 3 1 the environment of the sampling region the water column structure at the stations investigated revealed a distinct river influenced coastal upwelling system with high density upwelled water typically occupying the dcm and bottom layers with low density plume water overlying them fig 1 the proportions of each water mass source i e plume and upwelling at each depth layer showed the same spatial distributions fig s1 the samples can be classified into three water groups based on temperature and salinity upwelling t 19 5 24 9 c s 34 2 34 6 plume t 27 0 30 1 c s 31 8 32 9 and a mixture of those t 25 2 27 9 c s 33 1 34 3 fig 1 the upwelled water had a high salinity and nutrient content nox srp sio3 but a low temperature and dissolved oxygen content whereas the plume influenced water had the opposite trend fig s2 the abundances of heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellates bacteria and viruses were significantly greater in plume waters than in upwelled waters fig s2 additionally the mixed water demonstrated a balance of plume and upwelled water fig s2 3 2 protist bacteria microbiota in a river influenced upwelling system we examined the protistan and bacterial communities separately in 76 samples collected from three layers of the yuedong upwelling system off the coast of guangdong province surface dcm and bottom fig 1 table s1 for the protistan community a total of 5 265 287 high quality sequences range 16 103 110 991 median 70 982 mean sd 69 280 24 959 and 4 548 otus were obtained profiling of the bacterial community resulted in 5 233 277 high quality sequences range 20 981 114 394 median 67 934 mean sd 68 859 16 045 which correspond to 4 956 bacterial otus upwelled waters contained a greater diversity of otus than plume or mixed waters a finding that was consistent across both protistan and bacterial communities fig 2 a c additionally analyses of phylogenetic diversity pd revealed the same result fig 2b d however the richness and pd of microbial communities in plume and mixed water were generally not significantly different we used principal coordinate analysis pcoa to visualize the differences between microbial communities based on bray curtis dissimilarities fig 2e f the compositions of microbial communities from upwelling plume and mixed waters demonstrated a distinct separation anosim results further confirmed that the three water masses had a significant difference in microbial community composition fig 2e f to summarize upwelling and non upwelling microbiota differed markedly in alpha diversity and community composition 3 3 ecological processes shaping microbial community assembly to explore the ecological processes underlying the assembly of microbial communities a phylogenetic null model analysis was performed the phylogenetic signal was examined first and it was found that significant phylogenetic signals p 0 01 were observed across relatively short phylogenetic distances 5 2 to 19 2 of the maximum phylogenetic distance within the phylogenies of protists and bacteria allowing for the subsequent analysis stochastic processes accounted for the majority of compositional variation between communities in the river influenced coastal upwelling system accounting for 89 7 and 61 8 of total variation in the protistan and bacterial communities respectively fig 3 under stochastic processes dispersal limitation was the primary cause of community turnover accounting for approximately 54 3 and 31 1 of community turnover for protists and bacteria respectively fig 3 implying that dispersal limitation had a significant effect on microorganisms in such a hydrologically complex system homogeneous dispersal was virtually non existent in protistan and bacterial assembly and accounted for less than 1 of community turnover fig 3 ecological drift made a significant contribution accounting for 35 1 and 30 3 of variation in protistan and bacterial communities respectively fig 3 homogeneous selection accounted for 7 6 and 37 8 of community turnover respectively in protists and bacteria whereas heterogeneous selection played a minor role in both protistan and bacterial assemblies accounting for less than 3 of community variation under deterministic processes fig 3 interestingly deterministic processes were more important in both protistan 12 1 and bacterial 51 6 community assemblies in upwelled waters fig 3 3 4 drivers of protistan and bacterial distribution due to the fact that upwelling and non upwelling microbiota exhibit distinct alpha diversity and community composition we investigated the extrinsic and intrinsic factors governing protistan and bacterial distributions including water mass spatial biotic and abiotic factors the partial mantel tests showed that protists and bacteria were highly correlated to the water mass mixing proportion table 1 spatial factors also predicted microbial distribution after controlling for water mass biotic and abiotic factors with protists having a greater influence than bacteria table 1 changes in biotic and abiotic factors were also significantly correlated with microbial community variations when water mass spatial and biotic abiotic factors were controlled table 1 to further determine the physicochemical properties of water and biotic factors that influence microbial communities we used multivariate multiple regression analysis distlm to determine which predictor variables contributed significantly to the observed community pattern and how much variation was explained by each predictor temperature was the most significant explanatory factor examined accounting for 22 4 of the variation in bacterial communities table 2 the cross domain biotic factor using pcoa 1 and pcoa2 as proxies contributed approximately 6 7 to the variation in the bacterial community table 2 other variables such as salinity turbidity do abundance of virus and pnf and nutrients were significant but had a minor effect for protistan communities the cross domain biotic factor was the most significant explanatory variable accounting for 28 2 of community variation temperature and other variables such as turbidity nutrients and the abundance of bacteria and hnf all play a minor role in explaining the variation in protistan communities the significance of these observations was confirmed when it was discovered that bacteria community dissimilarity had a significant positive relationship with temperature difference r 0 413 p 0 001 and protistan community dissimilarity r 0 378 p 0 001 fig s2 cca confirmed these findings indicating that temperature and cross domain biotic factors were the primary predictors for both microbial communities fig s3 interestingly in upwelled communities the main explanatory variable for both protistan and bacterial communities was cross domain biotic factors rather than temperature accounting for 25 0 27 4 of the variation in upwelled microbial community composition table 2 this is consistent with the finding that in upwelled waters bacterial community dissimilarity was strongly correlated with protistan community dissimilarity r 0 637 p 0 001 except for protists in plumes the most important predictors of microbial communities in plume and mixed water were cross domain biotic factors table s2 taken together water mass temperature and cross domain biotic factors were critical variables for community variation with temperature having a greater influence on bacterial communities and cross domain biotic factors having a greater influence on protistan communities 3 5 co occurrence of protist bacteria microbiome given the significance of cross domain biotic factors in microbial community variation we constructed a co occurrence network to further investigate the possible role of biotic factors in microbial assembly the co occurrence network consisted of 967 nodes connected by 17 358 positive and 5013 negative edges fig 4 a protists and bacteria both contributed a similar number of nodes to the network 509 for protists and 458 for bacteria among the connections protist bacteria have 7242 edges protist protist have 4504 edges and bacteria bacteria have 10625 edges the observed network properties such as average path lengths and average clustering coefficients were significantly greater than those of random networks table s3 indicating that the observed networks have small world characteristics additionally the observed network exhibited a power law distribution of nodal degrees table s3 indicating a scale free and non random distribution the co occurrence network exhibited a high degree of modularity with the network clearly segmented into three major modules accounting for 84 5 of the total network ternary analysis revealed that the three major modules were unique to the particular water masses fig 4b d in modules i and iii taxa that prefer upwelled waters dominated microbial communities whereas taxa that prefer plume waters dominated in module ii additionally we discovered that microbial assemblages such as deltaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and orchrophyta contributed significantly more to modules i and iii which represent upwelled waters fig 4e g bacteroidetes had the highest degree of centrality in module ii which corresponded to plume waters fig 4e g this indicates that deltaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and orchrophyta were critical in sustaining coexistence in upwelled waters whereas bacteroidetes were more critical in sustaining coexistence in plume waters as nodes with a higher degree of centrality are more important in sustaining taxa coexistence in networks besides the microbial assemblages that played crucial roles within modules we also explored assemblages that are important in maintaining microbial coexistence among modules fig s4 on the basis of nodes within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi 236 connectors nodes offering links among modules were detected fig s4 many of the connectors 149 of 236 taxonomically belonged to bacterial assemblages such as gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes deltaproteobacteria and protistan assemblages such as ochrophyta rhizaria and ciliophora this indicated the crucial role of these assemblages in maintaining the coexistence of the network to elucidate the effect of biotic interaction and niche sharing on microbial co occurrence we combined a random forest model with a method for deciphering taxon taxon environment covariates one by one from the network we use random forest to determine the contribution of alpha diversity a proxy for cross domain biotic interaction and environmental factors to a number of network topological parameters including network size connectivity average degree network density average clustering coefficient and network modularity alpha diversity was the most powerful predictor of network topological changes among biotic and abiotic factors fig 4h m additionally a positive correlation between alpha diversity and network topology parameters was discovered using linear regression analysis table s4 temperature has an effect on network topology though it is less significant than alpha diversity additionally by testing each network edge individually for abiotic factors we identified 871 taxon taxon environmental associations accounting for approximately 3 8 of the total implying that abiotic factors account for a minority of associations taken together the results indicate that biotic factors may be a significant driver of the microbial co occurrence network and cross domain biotic factors and temperature were significantly associated with the network structure 4 discussion 4 1 assemblies and drivers of protist bacteria microbiota in the present study a marked distribution pattern of both protistan and bacterial communities driven by water masses was observed we then explored the processes that drive the distribution using a combination of statistical and modeling approaches in the complex river influenced coastal upwelling system protistan and bacterial communities were shaped by stochastic mostly due to dispersal limitation and ecological drift and deterministic processes mainly from homogeneous selection fig 3 we anticipated that dispersal limitation would play a critical role in community assembly in this hydrologically complicated system unlike soil microbes oceanic microorganisms are passively dispersed via the movement of water masses müller et al 2014 water mass movement can result in strong dispersal limitation between water masses djurhuus et al 2017 additionally we observed that protists had a higher ratio of dispersal limitation to homogeneous dispersal than bacteria 54 39 0 18 302 for protists vs 31 12 0 39 79 for bacteria fig 3 indicating that protists were more dispersal limited supporting the size dispersal hypothesis that dispersal scales are negatively correlated with the ocean plankton cell size fraction villarino et al 2018 the role of ecological drift in protists and bacteria could be attributed to the typhoon event typhoon bailu encountered during sampling and the river runoff caused by the typhoon s heavy rain which could result in an increasingly stochastic community structure if the communities in the system are affected by allochthonous protists and bacteria from the surrounding waters and landscapes in comparison to stochastic processes deterministic processes contributed less to the assembly of both microbial communities which were predominantly composed of homogeneous selection fig 3 this suggested that protists and bacteria have a distribution pattern that is partially determined by local biotic and abiotic factors in comparison to bacteria protists had a lower contribution from deterministic processes which is consistent with previous research on protists and bacteria in global surface waters logares et al 2020 this could be because protists have a considerably larger average niche breadth than bacteria p 0 001 table s5 and generalists with larger niche breadths may be less impacted by their environment however our results contradict findings in the east china sea s euphotic zone that protists are more structured by selection relative to dispersal limitation than bacteria wu et al 2018 the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes relies on spatiotemporal scales habitat types and species traits chase and myers 2011 as a result microbial community assembly processes may not be conserved across marine ecosystems river influenced coastal upwelling system in the present study vs marginal sea system in the latter study furthermore niche breadth is a critical characteristic that affects the relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in community assembly sexton et al 2017 wu et al 2018 discovered that bacteria have broader niche breadths than protists which explains why protistan communities are more strongly shaped by environmental selection than bacterial communities however our study discovered a reversal of this trend table s5 thus the inconsistency may be ascribed to a shift in the balance of deterministic and stochastic processes in protistan communities as a result of the different ecological responses of different protistan taxa to environmental changes under a particular scenario using the statistical approaches we found temperature and cross domain biotic factors as the primary drivers of microbial community composition this finding is consistent with recent research on protists liu et al 2021 and bacteria bachmann et al 2018 in a variety of coastal upwelling systems temperature has a variety of direct and indirect effects on protists and bacteria temperature for example has been shown to affect the metabolism of microbes sarmento et al 2010 specifically it stimulates the metabolism of protists and bacteria hence increasing their growth rates boscolo galazzo et al 2018 however in other situations the direct metabolic response may be more complex than a simple increase in abundance caused by an increase in temperature it may also be owing to taxa s thermal optimum and temporal thermal niches realized trombetta et al 2021 temperature can also influence protists and bacteria indirectly via interactions of prey predator delaney 2003 and or parasite symbiont host arandia gorostidi et al 2017 peacock et al 2014 the present study discovered that the cross domain biotic factor was a significant predictor of microbial communities particularly for protists and upwelled waters underlining the critical significance of biotic interactions in community variation between upwelling and non upwelling waters this conclusion is consistent with a previous study bock et al 2020 of protists and bacteria in european lakes and ponds cross domain biotic relationships in oceanic water such as predation competition parasitism and mutualism influence community structure by selecting and maintaining distinct taxa lopez garcia et al 2017 in comparison to temperature biotic associations had a greater influence on protistan community variation than bacterial community variation the increased connections between bacteria and physicochemical parameters such as temperature turbidity srp dsi and do may be a result of their strong geochemical coupling while protists at least heterotrophic and mixotrophic protists contribute more indirectly to nutrient cycling than bacteria do by feeding on bacteria and to a lesser extent through utilizing abiotic resources 4 2 co occurrence network of protist bacteria microbiota the co occurrence network identified three network modules that corresponded to the different types of water masses demonstrating that the protist bacteria microbiota s network modular structure was very sensitive to the different types of water masses the water masses studied in this study namely the river plume and coastal upwelling contain a number of different biotic and abiotic factors figs 2 s2 the network modules could be the result of microbe microbe interactions or covariation in response to a shared niche in a river influenced upwelling system the random forest linear regression and identification of taxon taxon environment covariates analyses all indicated that potential interactions were more important than niche sharing in protist bacteria co occurrence the modules of the network may serve as indicators of significant ecological processes layeghifard et al 2017 e g biotic interaction associated with different water masses for example distinct cross domain associations were observed in module i which represents upwelled waters and is dominated by ochrophyta mostly bacillariophyceae ciliophora mostly scuticociliates deltaproteobacteria mostly bdellovibrionales and alphaproteobacteria mostly rhodospirillales and module ii which represents plume waters and is dominated by mast mostly mast 3 ochrophyta mostly chrysophyceae bacteroidetes mostly flavobacteriales and alphaproteobacteria mostly rhodobacterales that is the majority of co occurrence relationships are highly variable between water masses resulting in vastly different modules of interacting taxa within each water mass whereas relatively few relationships exist between pairs of microorganisms as a reflection of environmental response we discovered that protistan assemblages ochrophyta and ciliophora as well as bacterial assemblages alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes are both critical for the maintenance of biotic connections between and within each domain for the major three modules fig 4e g the cross domain biotic interactions could be categorized into two types i e mutualism and predation several studies have established a strong link between phytoplankton and bacteria cirri and pohnert 2019 phytoplankton exudates have been shown to be an essential source of carbon for bacterial development neuenschwander et al 2018 and to play a significant role in nitrogen and phosphate mineralization pernthaler 2017 bacteria provided growth promoters amin et al 2015 vitamins or precursors of vitamins croft et al 2005 and other nutrients such as mythylamine suleiman et al 2016 to phytoplankton in exchange for example the ochrophyta primarily the diatom assemblage bacillariophytina frequently coexists with members of the alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes within and between modules in the current network thus the high frequency of cross domain biotic links between ochrophyta and bacterial otus is indicative of these relationships apart from the probable mutualistic interaction heterotrophic protists ciliophora revealed high correlations with bacterial otus which is likely due to ciliates well known grazing impact on bacteria sherr and sherr 1987 for example scuticociliates well known bacterivores were the most significant assemblage associated with bacterial assemblages within and between modules other assemblages including bacterivores and non bacterivores such as chrysophytes and mast were similarly connected with bacterial otus but to a lesser extent fig 4e g as previously observed predator prey relationships between protists and bacteria have a significant effect on both communities including growth rates christaki et al 1999 community composition jurgens and matz 2002 and size spectrum gonzalez et al 1990 as a result the present study s observations of heterotrophic e g ciliophora and mixotrophic e g chrysophyceae protists interacting with bacteria may provide evidence for typical predator prey relationships due to the unmeasured environmental variables and the fact that correlation does not always imply causation interaction in correlation based networks these co occurrence links in the network should be interpreted as putative biotic interactions 5 conclusions the present study advances our understanding of the assembly and drivers of protistan and bacterial communities and demonstrates the critical role of stochastic processes in the assembly of protist bacteria in a complex river influenced coastal upwelling system water mass biotic primarily cross domain biotic factors and abiotic primarily temperature collectively shaped the spatial patterns of microbial community composition in the river influenced coastal upwelling system additionally we discovered a difference in the contribution of temperature and cross domain biotic factors between protists and bacteria the increased correlation of bacteria with temperature and other physiochemical parameters shows that bacteria are more physiochemically coupled the greater effect of cross domain biotic factors on protists may reflect a high reliance on biotic interactions both directly and indirectly but to a lesser extent on abiotic resource consumption the findings emphasize the importance of integrating water masses as well as their associated temperature and biotic variables into the study of drivers and assemblies of upwelling microbiota and advances our understanding of

16174,disentangling the drivers and mechanisms that shape microbial communities in a river influenced coastal upwelling system requires considering a hydrologic dimension that can drive both deterministic and stochastic community assembly by generating hydrological heterogeneity and dispersal events additionally ubiquitous and complex microbial interactions can play a significant role in community structuring however how the hydrology biotic and abiotic factors collectively shape microbial distribution in the hydrologically complicated river plume upwelling coupling system remains unknown through underway sampling and daily observations we employed 16s and 18s ribosomal rna sequencing to disentangle drivers and mechanisms shaping the protist bacteria microbiota in a river influenced coastal upwelling system our findings indicate that the composition of microbial communities was water mass specific collectively water mass local water chemistry mostly temperature and biotic interaction mostly cross domain biotic interaction shaped the protistan bacterial communities in comparison to protists bacteria were more influenced by abiotic factors such as temperature than by cross domain biotic factors implying a stronger coupling of geochemical cycles both deterministic and stochastic processes had an effect on the distribution of microbial communities but deterministic processes were more important for bacteria and were especially pronounced for upwelling communities the co occurrence network revealed strong associations between the protistan assemblages orchrophyta and ciliophora and the bacterial assemblages alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes which may reflect predation and mutualism interactions overall this study emphasizes the importance of taking water masses temperature and domains of life into account when seeking to understand the drivers and assemblies of protist bacteria microbiome dynamics in coastal upwelling systems which is especially true given the complex and dynamic nature of the coastal ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protist bacteria water mass microbial interaction environmental filtering upwelling regime 1 introduction continental shelf ecosystems are the transitional zones between the continent and the open ocean that receive a large amount of anthropogenic runoff from rivers and are strongly influenced by physical processes such as oceanic currents agardi et al 2005 complicating the relationships between biological communities and environmental factors coastal upwelling is one such forcing that has been demonstrated to alter the associated regional ecology by altering the structure of the microbial communities that form the foundation of the marine food web wang et al 2015 bacterial communities in upwelled oceanic waters were found to be more diverse possess greater metabolic potential and exhibit a distinct community structure when compared to those in non upwelling waters bacterioplankton diversity was estimated to be greater in waters influenced by upwelling than in waters influenced by anthropogenic activity in brazil s coastal region cury et al 2011 bacterial production and growth rates increased in upwelling influenced waters off india s southwest coast due to increased primary production and dissolved organic carbon anas et al 2018 meta transcriptomic and meta proteomic analyses of upwelling communities revealed an enrichment of transporters with substrates for amino acids taurine polyamines and glutamine sowell et al 2011 indicating an increased capacity for nutrient transformation known particle degraders such as assemblages of alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes had a greater relative abundance in bacterial communities in the mauritania upwelling bachmann et al 2018 several factors including temperature bachmann et al 2018 salinity zäncker et al 2018 availability of nutrients raes et al 2018 and dissolved oxygen aldunate et al 2018 have been implicated in the regulation of bacterial communities in upwelling ecosystems previous studies expand our knowledge of bacterial communities and their abiotic shaping factors in upwelling waters cury et al 2011 sowell et al 2011 bachmann et al 2018 however in hydrologically complex river plume upwelling coupling systems the influence of physical processes can be particularly significant because the movement of water masses often results in strong dispersal limitation in microbial communities between water masses djurhuus et al 2017 additionally the river plume transports relatively warm and less saline water in the system whereas the upwelling regime transports relatively colder and more saline water gan et al 2009 the contrast in the water mass compositions between the river plume and upwelling regimes often generates temporally dynamic fronts that exert a strong influence on microbial communities by inducing accumulation and exchange of nutrients and microorganisms inhabiting water masses gan et al 2009 however how hydrological and environmental conditions interact to shape the microbial patterns observed in the river plume upwelling coupling system remains unknown in comparison to bacteria protists which comprise an enormous diversity of microbial eukaryotes and perform a wide variety of ecological roles as primary producers predators symbionts or parasites caron 2017 have received significantly less attention for their roles and responses to upwelling furthermore the majority of these limited efforts have been directed toward specific assemblages such as phototrophic protists tseng et al 2014 phagotrophic protists neuer and cowles 1994 or pico and nano sized protists hernandez ruiz et al 2018 due to their rapid and sustained cell division diatoms generally dominated the phytoplankton community in coastal upwelling systems by employing a complex mix of adaptive strategies such as decreasing silica content to avoid growth limitation mcnair et al 2018 phagotrophic protists such as ciliates thecate and gymnodinoid dinoflagellates and nonpigmented nanoflagellates were abundant and grazed rapidly during the upwelling season s algal bloom neuer and cowles 1994 nano sized mixotrophic flagellates supplied approximately 75 of the total carbon requirement for this plankton group in the nw iberian upwelling figueiras et al 2020 due to the sparse information on the full range of protists in coastal upwelling systems it is difficult to assess their ecological significance and influence on food web dynamics in the ecosystem to date the majority of research into the drivers of marine microbial communities has focused on environmental selection examining the role of abiotic factors temperature logares et al 2020 salinity logares et al 2018 and nutrients kirkham et al 2013 have all been demonstrated to play a significant role in environmental filtering which shapes protist and bacteria distributions on both local and global scales however it is well established that biotic factors also play a significant role in shaping microbial communities lima mendez et al 2015 indeed protist bacteria interactions are common in the ocean where they are involved in a variety of complex relationships including predator prey fuhrman and hagstrom 2008 and symbiont parasite host carpenter and foster 2002 and important substance exchanges such as the exchange of nutrients and vitamins carini et al 2014 thus their ubiquitous associations undoubtedly play a critical role in determining the microbial composition of protists and bacteria fuhrman and hagstrom 2008 as a result we anticipate that interactions between protists and bacteria via the multiple complex relationships mentioned above will result in a complex network of co occurrences however few studies have examined both groups concurrently as a biotic factor i e biotic selection logares et al 2020 and to our knowledge the role of protist bacteria associations in community assembly in a river influenced coastal upwelling system remains unknown as a result significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the collective effects of water masses biotic particularly cross domain biotic interaction and abiotic factors on protistan and bacterial communities in a river influenced coastal upwelling system with these considerations in mind we conducted underway sampling along shore transects to generate a spatial dataset that spans a large area with multiple depths and encompasses both the upwelling and river plume regimes then to further elucidate temporal variability we conducted daily observations of hydrography and biogeochemical variable profiles along the transect containing the front of river plume upwelling this systematic sampling design enabled us to gain a better understanding of how water masses biotic particularly cross domain biotic interaction factors and local environmental conditions collectively affect protistan and bacterial communities in this hydrologically complex system we investigate the protistan and bacterial communities and their drivers and assemblies in the yuedong upwelling system in the northern south china sea using high throughput sequencing on the v3 and v4 regions of small ribosomal rna gene transcripts fig 1 the yuedong upwelling system was influenced by the pearl river plume during the southwesterly monsoon and the interaction of the water masses resulted in complex hydrodynamics with strong dispersal limitation between water masses we tracked the biotic and abiotic changes in different water masses and investigated the possible roles of biotic particularly cross domain biotic interaction and abiotic factors in shaping microbial communities we anticipate greater selection on upwelled water communities than on the entire river influenced coastal upwelling system as the intrusion of the pearl river plume may have more stochastic effects on both microbial communities in the system as a whole additionally given the system s strong environmental gradients and the widespread association of protists and bacteria in water we hypothesize that both abiotic and cross domain biotic factors play a critical role in microbial communities additionally we anticipate that abiotic factors will play a greater role in bacterial communities than in protistan communities owing to bacterial communities stronger physiochemical coupling 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and station characteristics a total of 76 samples were taken at three water depths surface dcm and bottom at 18 sites spanning a spatial range of 114 72 e 117 01 e and 21 66 n 22 91 n between august 17th

investigate the daily fluctuation of the upwelling given the possibility of daily and depth changes in the microbial communities we collected samples daily from three water depths the surface 5 m the

edgar 2013 to avoid the possibility of sequencing problems the singletons were removed using usearch v10 sequences were then grouped into otus with a 97 similarity level otu assignment was performed using the method blast against the pr2 4 7 2 guillou et al 2013 database for protists bacterial otus were assigned to taxonomic lineages using the silva v132 quast et al 2013 database prior to analysis non protist and non bacteria sequences such as metazoan fungi archaea plastid and unassigned sequences were removed to normalize the sampling effort the otu reads for each sample were rarefied to 16 103 reads for the protistan community and 20 981 reads for the bacterial community respectively alpha diversity richness and faith s phylogenetic diversity pd was calculated in r using the vegan package oksanen et al 2013 the dissimilarity between communities was calculated using the bray curtis distance and visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa with the vegan package the significant differences between groups of samples were subsequently examined with the analysis of similarity anosim phylogenetic trees were constructed for both groups i e protist and bacteria

that were not well aligned capella gutierrez et al 2009 phylogenetic trees were constructed using fasttree implemented in qiime caporaso et al 2010 to evaluate whether phylogenetic turnover can be utilized to infer ecological processes the phylogenetic signal was initially investigated across phylogenetic distances following stegen et al 2012 the software vegan was used to generate mantel correlograms with 999 randomizations for significance tests then in accordance with stegen et al 2013 phylogenetic null model analysis was used to quantify ecological processes by decomposing them into the fundamental driving factors of dispersion limitation selection and drift first we estimated the weighted β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd to measure phylogenetic turnover this distance quantified the abundance weighted mean phylogenetic distance between the closest relatives appearing in the two group communities the expectation of the null model was derived using 1 000 randomizations the β nearest taxon index βnti which is the standard deviation of the observed βmntd from the mean of the null distribution was then calculated to evaluate if community composition was structured by selection or dispersal drift βnti values greater than 2 suggest community assembly is deterministic but βnti values less than 2 indicate community assembly is stochastic to determine the water mass mixing proportion we used an optimum multiparameter omp analysis karstensen and tomczak 1998 our observational data was used to determine the physicochemical characteristics of various source water types omp calculated the contribution of each water mass to each sample using salinity potential temperature dissolved oxygen nitrate and phosphate the matlab script used was publicly available at http omp geomar ed the bray curtis distance of the microbial community composition at each sample was compared to the proportion of water mass mixing spatial factors longitude latitude depth biotic cross domain biotic factors pcoa 1 and 2 abundances of hnf pnf bacteria and virus and abiotic temperature salinity turbidity dissolved oxygen nox srp and dsi factors using mantel and partial mantels we used distance based multivariate analysis for a linear model distlm implemented in primer 7 to determine the relative contribution of biotic pcoa 1 and 2 of protists and bacteria abundances of hnf pnf bacteria and virus and abiotic temperature salinity do turbidity nox srp dsi factors to community variation after performing forward selection the variance explained by biotic and abiotic components was calculated using the adjusted r2 selection criterion 999 permutations canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to investigate the relationships between biotic and abiotic variables and community variation a co occurrence network was constructed to determine the relationships between protists and bacteria to reduce noise and complexity in the network analysis otus having a relative abundance of less than 0 01 and detected in fewer than 30 of samples were eliminated from the study the hmisc package was used to calculate the spearman s rank coefficient r between the remaining otus the network analysis took into account correlations that were both robust r 0 6 and statistically significant false discovery rate corrected p values 0 01 to visualize networks and perform modular analysis we used the interactive gephi v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 connectors connecting distinct modules were identified using within module connectivity zi and between module connectivity pi guimerà and amaral 2005 these connectors were considered possible network keystone species deng et al 2012 by preserving otus present in each sample we generated sub networks for each water sample from the meta community network using the subgraph functions in the igraph package csardi and nepusz 2006 the package calculates network level topological features for each sub network we were then able to determine the effect of cross domain biotic associations on microbial co occurrence patterns by evaluating the relationship between alpha diversity a proxy for cross domain biotic factors and network topology we used random forest analysis to determine the role and relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in driving microbial co occurrence patterns including alpha diversity abundances of hnf pnf bacteria and virus and physiochemical factors the various biotic and abiotic variables were used to predict network topology i e network size network connectivity average degree network density average clustering coefficient and network modularity as response variables the investigation was carried out using the randomforest package rcolorbrewer and liaw 2018 random forest models containing 1000 trees were trained using 100 repeats of 10 fold cross validation and the amount of variables sampled at each node was optimized the rfpermute package archer 2019 was used to determine the importance of each predictor in this case biotic and abiotic variables for the response variables the least square linear regression was performed to confirm the relationship between biotic associations environmental factors predictable variables and network topological parameters response variables using a method developed by lima mendez et al 2015 we also tested one by one whether a network edge link was related to abiotic factors i e environmental filtering if a link between two taxa is caused by their covariation with environmental conditions strong correlations should exist between each taxon and representative environmental variables following yuan et al 2021 we tested all of the network s links against the seven environmental variables in order to identify taxon taxon environmental links 3 results 3 1 the environment of the sampling region the water column structure at the stations investigated revealed a distinct river influenced coastal upwelling system with high density upwelled water typically occupying the dcm and bottom layers with low density plume water overlying them fig 1 the proportions of each water mass source i e plume and upwelling at each depth layer showed the same spatial distributions fig s1 the samples can be classified into three water groups based on temperature and salinity upwelling t 19 5 24 9 c s 34 2 34 6 plume t 27 0 30 1 c s 31 8 32 9 and a mixture of those t 25 2 27 9 c s 33 1 34 3 fig 1 the upwelled water had a high salinity and nutrient content nox srp sio3 but a low temperature and dissolved oxygen content whereas the plume influenced water had the opposite trend fig s2 the abundances of heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellates bacteria and viruses were significantly greater in plume waters than in upwelled waters fig s2 additionally the mixed water demonstrated a balance of plume and upwelled water fig s2 3 2 protist bacteria microbiota in a river influenced upwelling system we examined the protistan and bacterial communities separately in 76 samples collected from three layers of the yuedong upwelling system off the coast of guangdong province surface dcm and bottom fig 1 table s1 for the protistan community a total of 5 265 287 high quality sequences range 16 103 110 991 median 70 982 mean sd 69 280 24 959 and 4 548 otus were obtained profiling of the bacterial community resulted in 5 233 277 high quality sequences range 20 981 114 394 median 67 934 mean sd 68 859 16 045 which correspond to 4 956 bacterial otus upwelled waters contained a greater diversity of otus than plume or mixed waters a finding that was consistent across both protistan and bacterial communities fig 2 a c additionally analyses of phylogenetic diversity pd revealed the same result fig 2b d however the richness and pd of microbial communities in plume and mixed water were generally not significantly different we used principal coordinate analysis pcoa to visualize the differences between microbial communities based on bray curtis dissimilarities fig 2e f the compositions of microbial communities from upwelling plume and mixed waters demonstrated a distinct separation anosim results further confirmed that the three water masses had a significant difference in microbial community composition fig 2e f to summarize upwelling and non upwelling microbiota differed markedly in alpha diversity and community composition 3 3 ecological processes shaping microbial community assembly to explore the ecological processes underlying the assembly of microbial communities a phylogenetic null model analysis was performed the phylogenetic signal was examined first and it was found that significant phylogenetic signals p 0 01 were observed across relatively short phylogenetic distances 5 2 to 19 2 of the maximum phylogenetic distance within the phylogenies of protists and bacteria allowing for the subsequent analysis stochastic processes accounted for the majority of compositional variation between communities in the river influenced coastal upwelling system accounting for 89 7 and 61 8 of total variation in the protistan and bacterial communities respectively fig 3 under stochastic processes dispersal limitation was the primary cause of community turnover accounting for approximately 54 3 and 31 1 of community turnover for protists and bacteria respectively fig 3 implying that dispersal limitation had a significant effect on microorganisms in such a hydrologically complex system homogeneous dispersal was virtually non existent in protistan and bacterial assembly and accounted for less than 1 of community turnover fig 3 ecological drift made a significant contribution accounting for 35 1 and 30 3 of variation in protistan and bacterial communities respectively fig 3 homogeneous selection accounted for 7 6 and 37 8 of community turnover respectively in protists and bacteria whereas heterogeneous selection played a minor role in both protistan and bacterial assemblies accounting for less than 3 of community variation under deterministic processes fig 3 interestingly deterministic processes were more important in both protistan 12 1 and bacterial 51 6 community assemblies in upwelled waters fig 3 3 4 drivers of protistan and bacterial distribution due to the fact that upwelling and non upwelling microbiota exhibit distinct alpha diversity and community composition we investigated the extrinsic and intrinsic factors governing protistan and bacterial distributions including water mass spatial biotic and abiotic factors the partial mantel tests showed that protists and bacteria were highly correlated to the water mass mixing proportion table 1 spatial factors also predicted microbial distribution after controlling for water mass biotic and abiotic factors with protists having a greater influence than bacteria table 1 changes in biotic and abiotic factors were also significantly correlated with microbial community variations when water mass spatial and biotic abiotic factors were controlled table 1 to further determine the physicochemical properties of water and biotic factors that influence microbial communities we used multivariate multiple regression analysis distlm to determine which predictor variables contributed significantly to the observed community pattern and how much variation was explained by each predictor temperature was the most significant explanatory factor examined accounting for 22 4 of the variation in bacterial communities table 2 the cross domain biotic factor using pcoa 1 and pcoa2 as proxies contributed approximately 6 7 to the variation in the bacterial community table 2 other variables such as salinity turbidity do abundance of virus and pnf and nutrients were significant but had a minor effect for protistan communities the cross domain biotic factor was the most significant explanatory variable accounting for 28 2 of community variation temperature and other variables such as turbidity nutrients and the abundance of bacteria and hnf all play a minor role in explaining the variation in protistan communities the significance of these observations was confirmed when it was discovered that bacteria community dissimilarity had a significant positive relationship with temperature difference r 0 413 p 0 001 and protistan community dissimilarity r 0 378 p 0 001 fig s2 cca confirmed these findings indicating that temperature and cross domain biotic factors were the primary predictors for both microbial communities fig s3 interestingly in upwelled communities the main explanatory variable for both protistan and bacterial communities was cross domain biotic factors rather than temperature accounting for 25 0 27 4 of the variation in upwelled microbial community composition table 2 this is consistent with the finding that in upwelled waters bacterial community dissimilarity was strongly correlated with protistan community dissimilarity r 0 637 p 0 001 except for protists in plumes the most important predictors of microbial communities in plume and mixed water were cross domain biotic factors table s2 taken together water mass temperature and cross domain biotic factors were critical variables for community variation with temperature having a greater influence on bacterial communities and cross domain biotic factors having a greater influence on protistan communities 3 5 co occurrence of protist bacteria microbiome given the significance of cross domain biotic factors in microbial community variation we constructed a co occurrence network to further investigate the possible role of biotic factors in microbial assembly the co occurrence network consisted of 967 nodes connected by 17 358 positive and 5013 negative edges fig 4 a protists and bacteria both contributed a similar number of nodes to the network 509 for protists and 458 for bacteria among the connections protist bacteria have 7242 edges protist protist have 4504 edges and bacteria bacteria have 10625 edges the observed network properties such as average path lengths and average clustering coefficients were significantly greater than those of random networks table s3 indicating that the observed networks have small world characteristics additionally the observed network exhibited a power law distribution of nodal degrees table s3 indicating a scale free and non random distribution the co occurrence network exhibited a high degree of modularity with the network clearly segmented into three major modules accounting for 84 5 of the total network ternary analysis revealed that the three major modules were unique to the particular water masses fig 4b d in modules i and iii taxa that prefer upwelled waters dominated microbial communities whereas taxa that prefer plume waters dominated in module ii additionally we discovered that microbial assemblages such as deltaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and orchrophyta contributed significantly more to modules i and iii which represent upwelled waters fig 4e g bacteroidetes had the highest degree of centrality in module ii which corresponded to plume waters fig 4e g this indicates that deltaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and orchrophyta were critical in sustaining coexistence in upwelled waters whereas bacteroidetes were more critical in sustaining coexistence in plume waters as nodes with a higher degree of centrality are more important in sustaining taxa coexistence in networks besides the microbial assemblages that played crucial roles within modules we also explored assemblages that are important in maintaining microbial coexistence among modules fig s4 on the basis of nodes within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi 236 connectors nodes offering links among modules were detected fig s4 many of the connectors 149 of 236 taxonomically belonged to bacterial assemblages such as gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes deltaproteobacteria and protistan assemblages such as ochrophyta rhizaria and ciliophora this indicated the crucial role of these assemblages in maintaining the coexistence of the network to elucidate the effect of biotic interaction and niche sharing on microbial co occurrence we combined a random forest model with a method for deciphering taxon taxon environment covariates one by one from the network we use random forest to determine the contribution of alpha diversity a proxy for cross domain biotic interaction and environmental factors to a number of network topological parameters including network size connectivity average degree network density average clustering coefficient and network modularity alpha diversity was the most powerful predictor of network topological changes among biotic and abiotic factors fig 4h m additionally a positive correlation between alpha diversity and network topology parameters was discovered using linear regression analysis table s4 temperature has an effect on network topology though it is less significant than alpha diversity additionally by testing each network edge individually for abiotic factors we identified 871 taxon taxon environmental associations accounting for approximately 3 8 of the total implying that abiotic factors account for a minority of associations taken together the results indicate that biotic factors may be a significant driver of the microbial co occurrence network and cross domain biotic factors and temperature were significantly associated with the network structure 4 discussion 4 1 assemblies and drivers of protist bacteria microbiota in the present study a marked distribution pattern of both protistan and bacterial communities driven by water masses was observed we then explored the processes that drive the distribution using a combination of statistical and modeling approaches in the complex river influenced coastal upwelling system protistan and bacterial communities were shaped by stochastic mostly due to dispersal limitation and ecological drift and deterministic processes mainly from homogeneous selection fig 3 we anticipated that dispersal limitation would play a critical role in community assembly in this hydrologically complicated system unlike soil microbes oceanic microorganisms are passively dispersed via the movement of water masses müller et al 2014 water mass movement can result in strong dispersal limitation between water masses djurhuus et al 2017 additionally we observed that protists had a higher ratio of dispersal limitation to homogeneous dispersal than bacteria 54 39 0 18 302 for protists vs 31 12 0 39 79 for bacteria fig 3 indicating that protists were more dispersal limited supporting the size dispersal hypothesis that dispersal scales are negatively correlated with the ocean plankton cell size fraction villarino et al 2018 the role of ecological drift in protists and bacteria could be attributed to the typhoon event typhoon bailu encountered during sampling and the river runoff caused by the typhoon s heavy rain which could result in an increasingly stochastic community structure if the communities in the system are affected by allochthonous protists and bacteria from the surrounding waters and landscapes in comparison to stochastic processes deterministic processes contributed less to the assembly of both microbial communities which were predominantly composed of homogeneous selection fig 3 this suggested that protists and bacteria have a distribution pattern that is partially determined by local biotic and abiotic factors in comparison to bacteria protists had a lower contribution from deterministic processes which is consistent with previous research on protists and bacteria in global surface waters logares et al 2020 this could be because protists have a considerably larger average niche breadth than bacteria p 0 001 table s5 and generalists with larger niche breadths may be less impacted by their environment however our results contradict findings in the east china sea s euphotic zone that protists are more structured by selection relative to dispersal limitation than bacteria wu et al 2018 the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes relies on spatiotemporal scales habitat types and species traits chase and myers 2011 as a result microbial community assembly processes may not be conserved across marine ecosystems river influenced coastal upwelling system in the present study vs marginal sea system in the latter study furthermore niche breadth is a critical characteristic that affects the relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in community assembly sexton et al 2017 wu et al 2018 discovered that bacteria have broader niche breadths than protists which explains why protistan communities are more strongly shaped by environmental selection than bacterial communities however our study discovered a reversal of this trend table s5 thus the inconsistency may be ascribed to a shift in the balance of deterministic and stochastic processes in protistan communities as a result of the different ecological responses of different protistan taxa to environmental changes under a particular scenario using the statistical approaches we found temperature and cross domain biotic factors as the primary drivers of microbial community composition this finding is consistent with recent research on protists liu et al 2021 and bacteria bachmann et al 2018 in a variety of coastal upwelling systems temperature has a variety of direct and indirect effects on protists and bacteria temperature for example has been shown to affect the metabolism of microbes sarmento et al 2010 specifically it stimulates the metabolism of protists and bacteria hence increasing their growth rates boscolo galazzo et al 2018 however in other situations the direct metabolic response may be more complex than a simple increase in abundance caused by an increase in temperature it may also be owing to taxa s thermal optimum and temporal thermal niches realized trombetta et al 2021 temperature can also influence protists and bacteria indirectly via interactions of prey predator delaney 2003 and or parasite symbiont host arandia gorostidi et al 2017 peacock et al 2014 the present study discovered that the cross domain biotic factor was a significant predictor of microbial communities particularly for protists and upwelled waters underlining the critical significance of biotic interactions in community variation between upwelling and non upwelling waters this conclusion is consistent with a previous study bock et al 2020 of protists and bacteria in european lakes and ponds cross domain biotic relationships in oceanic water such as predation competition parasitism and mutualism influence community structure by selecting and maintaining distinct taxa lopez garcia et al 2017 in comparison to temperature biotic associations had a greater influence on protistan community variation than bacterial community variation the increased connections between bacteria and physicochemical parameters such as temperature turbidity srp dsi and do may be a result of their strong geochemical coupling while protists at least heterotrophic and mixotrophic protists contribute more indirectly to nutrient cycling than bacteria do by feeding on bacteria and to a lesser extent through utilizing abiotic resources 4 2 co occurrence network of protist bacteria microbiota the co occurrence network identified three network modules that corresponded to the different types of water masses demonstrating that the protist bacteria microbiota s network modular structure was very sensitive to the different types of water masses the water masses studied in this study namely the river plume and coastal upwelling contain a number of different biotic and abiotic factors figs 2 s2 the network modules could be the result of microbe microbe interactions or covariation in response to a shared niche in a river influenced upwelling system the random forest linear regression and identification of taxon taxon environment covariates analyses all indicated that potential interactions were more important than niche sharing in protist bacteria co occurrence the modules of the network may serve as indicators of significant ecological processes layeghifard et al 2017 e g biotic interaction associated with different water masses for example distinct cross domain associations were observed in module i which represents upwelled waters and is dominated by ochrophyta mostly bacillariophyceae ciliophora mostly scuticociliates deltaproteobacteria mostly bdellovibrionales and alphaproteobacteria mostly rhodospirillales and module ii which represents plume waters and is dominated by mast mostly mast 3 ochrophyta mostly chrysophyceae bacteroidetes mostly flavobacteriales and alphaproteobacteria mostly rhodobacterales that is the majority of co occurrence relationships are highly variable between water masses resulting in vastly different modules of interacting taxa within each water mass whereas relatively few relationships exist between pairs of microorganisms as a reflection of environmental response we discovered that protistan assemblages ochrophyta and ciliophora as well as bacterial assemblages alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes are both critical for the maintenance of biotic connections between and within each domain for the major three modules fig 4e g the cross domain biotic interactions could be categorized into two types i e mutualism and predation several studies have established a strong link between phytoplankton and bacteria cirri and pohnert 2019 phytoplankton exudates have been shown to be an essential source of carbon for bacterial development neuenschwander et al 2018 and to play a significant role in nitrogen and phosphate mineralization pernthaler 2017 bacteria provided growth promoters amin et al 2015 vitamins or precursors of vitamins croft et al 2005 and other nutrients such as mythylamine suleiman et al 2016 to phytoplankton in exchange for example the ochrophyta primarily the diatom assemblage bacillariophytina frequently coexists with members of the alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes within and between modules in the current network thus the high frequency of cross domain biotic links between ochrophyta and bacterial otus is indicative of these relationships apart from the probable mutualistic interaction heterotrophic protists ciliophora revealed high correlations with bacterial otus which is likely due to ciliates well known grazing impact on bacteria sherr and sherr 1987 for example scuticociliates well known bacterivores were the most significant assemblage associated with bacterial assemblages within and between modules other assemblages including bacterivores and non bacterivores such as chrysophytes and mast were similarly connected with bacterial otus but to a lesser extent fig 4e g as previously observed predator prey relationships between protists and bacteria have a significant effect on both communities including growth rates christaki et al 1999 community composition jurgens and matz 2002 and size spectrum gonzalez et al 1990 as a result the present study s observations of heterotrophic e g ciliophora and mixotrophic e g chrysophyceae protists interacting with bacteria may provide evidence for typical predator prey relationships due to the unmeasured environmental variables and the fact that correlation does not always imply causation interaction in correlation based networks these co occurrence links in the network should be interpreted as putative biotic interactions 5 conclusions the present study advances our understanding of the assembly and drivers of protistan and bacterial communities and demonstrates the critical role of stochastic processes in the assembly of protist bacteria in a complex river influenced coastal upwelling system water mass biotic primarily cross domain biotic factors and abiotic primarily temperature collectively shaped the spatial patterns of microbial community composition in the river influenced coastal upwelling system additionally we discovered a difference in the contribution of temperature and cross domain biotic factors between protists and bacteria the increased correlation of bacteria with temperature and other physiochemical parameters shows that bacteria are more physiochemically coupled the greater effect of cross domain biotic factors on protists may reflect a high reliance on biotic interactions both directly and indirectly but to a lesser extent on abiotic resource consumption the findings emphasize the importance of integrating water masses as well as their associated temperature and biotic variables into the study of drivers and assemblies of upwelling microbiota and advances our understanding of
