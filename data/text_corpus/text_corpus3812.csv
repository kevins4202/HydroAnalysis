19060,a mechanistic model for assessing the fate and removal efficiency of hydrophobic organic contaminants in horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands was developed and evaluated using empirical concentration data from singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland this treatment wetland consists of a series of horizontal subsurface flow reed beds the model calibrated for the lorong halus treatment wetland provided an adequate description of the concentrations of nine neutral organic substances in water rhizomes and emergent vegetation in the wetland the model was applied to investigate the sensitivity of the contaminant removal efficiency to environmental conditions and physicochemical properties of contaminants that enter the wetland the water budget of the wetland was found to exhibit an important influence on both the mass removal efficiency and reduction of contaminant concentrations that can be achieved through wetland treatment the model illustrated that removal pathways of organic contaminants in the wetland varied as a function of the properties of the contaminants the mass removal efficiency of the treatment wetland was greatest for chemicals with a log kow between 3 0 and 5 0 and log kaw 1 0 removal of contaminants through volatilization was found to be greatest for substances with a log kow between 3 and 5 and log kaw 0 transpiration flux in vegetation was found to be most important for substances with a log kow between 4 5 and 5 5 and a log kaw between 5 0 and 0 0 biotransformation rates of the contaminants in the wetland media play a crucial role in the removal of contaminants from wastewater the model provides a tool for assessing the removal capacity of treatment wetlands for neutral organic contaminants and evaluating trade offs in the design and operation of a horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetland graphical abstract image 1 keywords treatment wetlands horizontal subsurface flow contaminant fate modelling removal efficiency 1 introduction treatment wetlands are constructed artificial ecosystems designed to harness the natural biogeochemistry of wetlands for reclamation and remediation services these systems have emerged as a viable solution to various wastewater challenges including municipal and domestic wastewater e g toscano et al 2009 minewater e g batty and younger 2004 agricultural runoff e g page et al 2010 industrial wastewater e g lin et al 2005 and leachate e g sim et al 2013 in these applications treatment wetland systems have demonstrated their ability to reclaim and remediate soil groundwater and surface water with their complex symbiosis between microorganisms vegetation and rooting media u s epa 2000 reddy and delaune 2008 kadlec and wallace 2009 models have also been developed and applied to entire constructed wetland systems to assess specific criteria such as hydraulic characteristics throughout the system chazarenc et al 2003 garcia et al 2004 changes to biochemical oxygen demand or chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater chen et al 1999 wynn and liehr 2001 and nutrient cycling mayo and bigambo 2005 many of these models incorporate reactive transport dynamics based on the first order k c approach which represents conventional first order removal kadlec and knight 1996 the constructed wetland 2 d model langergraber 2001 is a well developed treatment wetland model designed to estimate the biochemical transformation and degradation of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus species in subsurface flow treatment wetlands using numerical modelling this multifaceted model performs well for bulk influent and effluent properties but does not provide partitioning and concentration estimates for specific chemicals and does not include vegetation mediated processes of contaminant removal such as evapotranspiration several models have been developed to describe the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the fate of pollutants within wetlands models that describe the uptake and fate of nonionic organic substances in wetland vegetation often use ratios of chemical concentrations in the plant compartment of interest e g shoots roots xylem sap to those in the exposure medium soil pore water hydroponic solution these concentration ratios are generally referred to as bioconcentration factors bcfs but have also been named for their specific plant tissue compartment such as root concentration factor rcf briggs et al 1983 topp et al 1986 stem concentration factor scf mackay and gschwend 2000 trapp 2002 or transpiration stream xylem sap concentration factor tscf trapp and matthies 1995 rein et al 2011 empirical correlations between bcf and certain physicochemical properties such as the octanol water partition coefficient kow have been used to estimate plant tissue concentrations from concentrations of contaminants dissolved in porewater gobas et al 1991 the bcfs and their correlations with physicochemical properties have been used in support of various chemical management strategies around the world e g environment canada 1995 euses 2012 industries that face wastewater challenges need decision tools that can demonstrate the potential for a treatment wetland system to meet water quality objectives e g ccme 1999 aep 1995 esrd 2014 while considering tradeoffs in their design and operation there is a current need to develop mechanistic models that can effectively predict the fate and removal efficiency of hydrophobic organic contaminants in treatment wetlands these models can be useful tools for evaluating the feasibility and design of treatment wetlands for contaminant and site specific industrial applications the present study involves the development and evaluation of a mechanistic model to assess the fate and removal efficiency of non ionising hydrophobic organic contaminants in horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands the developed model is designed to estimate contaminant removal efficiencies based on the dynamics of plant uptake intermedia transport sorption and transformation the ultimate goal of the model is to understand how to safely and effectively implement treatment wetlands under a variety of environmental conditions and treatment scenarios the model is applied to a large scale treatment wetland in singapore the lorong halus treatment wetland lhtw the model is evaluated using concentration data from a recent field investigation of hydrophobic organic contaminants in different compartments of this treatment wetland wang and kelly 2017 we further provide an assessment of the behaviour merits and limitations of the model and the results of a sensitivity analysis to better understand the influence of various model parameters 1 1 theory treatment wetland systems are grouped into three hydrologic flow regimes i free water surface fws wetlands which are artificial streams that have an open surface water column with emergent vegetation planted in saturated rooting media ii horizontal h and iii vertical v subsurface flow ssf wetlands which are aquifer like designs that permit the flow of water horizontally or vertically through a coarse grained medium kadlec and knight 1996 fig 1 singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland is a horizontal subsurface flow wetland design information from the lorong halus treatment wetland provides an opportunity to evaluate the performance of this type of treatment wetland for the present modelling study of hydrophobic organic contaminants in treatment wetlands we utilized an environmental modelling approach that has been developed and used by many authors including mackay et al 1983 quantitative water air sediment interaction qwasi model mackay 2001 level i iv fugacity models gobas 1993 food web model clark et al 1995 sewage treatment plant stp model arnot and gobas 2004 aquaweb food web bioaccumulation model and others 1 2 model design the objective of the model is to describe the behaviour of hydrophobic organic contaminants in treatment wetlands the evaluative components of the wetland environment consist of water w rhizome vegetation rh and emergent vegetation ev water that enters the treatment wetland environment flows through the pore space of the rooting medium gravel i e horizontal subsurface flow chemicals enter the rhizomes through diffusion from water and xylem transport carries the chemical through to the emergent fraction of the vegetation where transpiration may occur fig 1 provides a conceptual diagram of the wetland and illustrates these transformation and intermedia transport processes for each of the three modelled wetland compartments these processes are described in terms of first order kinetics in mass balance equations eqs 1 3 1

wastewater and is the product of the inflow rate qin l day and individual chemical concentration cin g l the model is programmed to run a euler type numerical integration to derive the time course of contaminant concentrations in the compartments of the treatment wetland this solution is useful to assess the response of the wetland to contaminant loading as it approaches steady state and for pulse loading scenarios to assess the distribution of chemicals over time the model is also solved for a system at steady state dmi dt 0 this solution of the model is useful to assess the long term capacity

characteristics of the wetland system since m out is simply c out k o el and ec are equal when there is equal water inflow and outflow i e no net change to the water budget the relationship between removal efficiency and the configuration and conditions of the wetland is investigated through model demonstrations and a sensitivity analysis 1 3 model assumptions and limitations the model assumes that within each compartment the chemical is homogeneously mixed the substrate gravel is parameterized to have no inherent sorptive capacity for organics but does offer a surface for suspended sediment deposition which offers sites for sorption of freely dissolved contaminants in the water contaminant transport from the rhizomes to the emergent vegetation is assumed to occur principally through xylem flow while phloem and aerenchymal transport are considered negligible thus the model is not applicable to describe the fate of gases such as methane or oxygen or essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus for our modelling purposes the atmosphere does not act as a source of contaminant mass but only as a contaminant sink no seasonal or diurnal variability is modelled for the climatic variables e g temperature precipitation evapotranspiration the model accounts for the combined transformation by chemical reactions physical degradation and biological transformation chemical transformations result from reactions with other chemicals within the wetland environment and physical transformations may occur from uv exposure fasnacht and blough 2002 biological transformation biotransformation occurs from microbial activity or enzymatic degradation within wetland vegetation rhizomes and emergent vegetation all transformation processes are modelled as non reversible first order degradation pathways transformation is assumed to act upon the freely dissolved contaminant fraction in the environmental media whereas particle bound contaminant fractions are not subject to transformation kickham et al 2012 transformation rate constants kt in each medium are first order rates that can represent both biotic and abiotic transformation processes in water rhizomes and emergent vegetation 2 methods the model was parameterized and calibrated for a single reed bed rb3 of singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland lhtw table 2 the lhtw system was constructed to treat landfill leachate and includes a pre treatment system 8000 m2 five constructed reed beds that run in parallel total 38 000 m2 and five polishing ponds total 13 000 m2 data on the lhtw configuration and design including parameter data for rb3 was obtained from wang and kelly 2017 and sim et al 2013 2 1 chemicals nine hydrophobic organic contaminants were used for model calibration galaxolide tonalide pentachlorobenzene hexachlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene musk ketone methyl triclosan pcb52 and endosulfan sulfate these substances were selected from the original data set 86 chemicals reported by wang and kelly 2017 because they were detected in more than two of three grab samples in two sampling events 8th october 2015 and 11th february 2016 and observed concentrations were below each chemical s aqueous solubility limit concentrations of hexachlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene and endosulfan sulfate were non detectable in one of the grab samples and were assumed to equal 50 of the method detection limit reported by wang and kelly 2017 the recurrence of chemicals detected in wetland media indicate that the chemicals have been consistently present in the influent between sampling events justifying the use of the steady state version of the model the concentration measurements of these substances in influent leachate cin effluent cout vegetation rhizome crh and emergent vegetation leaves cev were averaged over the two sampling events for model calibration physicochemical properties were obtained from the episuite v4 11 program u s epa 2013 and half life times for chemical transformations were derived from the episuite v4 11 biowin model for primary biodegradation boethling et al 1994 pentachlorobenzene hexachlorobenzene pcb 52 and endosulfan sulfate are considered to be recalcitrant and therefore assigned a t1 2 of 103 days to represent a negligible rate of transformation in the model galaxolide tonalide musk ketone 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene and methyl triclosan are considered biodegradable on the order of months and were assigned a t1 2 of 250 days in water and in the absence of information on the biotransformation of the chemicals in wetland vegetation 2500 days in rhizomes and emergent vegetation 2 2 model calibration to calibrate the model for the lhtw system the rate constant for contaminant transport from water to rhizome kw rh and rhizome to emergent vegetation krh ev was multiplied by a calibration coefficient β1 logkow and β2 logkow using 8 k w rh k w rh β 1 logkow 9 k rh ev k rh ev β 2 logkow where k is the calibrated rate constant day 1 kow is the octanol water partition coefficients and β1 and β2 are the calibration coefficients derived by calibrating the model to the empirical data a calibration coefficient equal to one indicates no calibration of the model the rationale for the calibration of the rate constants for the transport of the chemical from water to rhizome and from rhizome to emergent vegetation is that there is a lack of information on the uptake and elimination kinetics of the test chemicals in wetland vegetation kow is used in eqs 8 and 9 because it is an important chemical property that controls the environmental fate of organic chemicals 2 3 model performance analysis model performance was evaluated by comparing empirical concentrations cobs to the model estimated concentrations cmodel of the nine contaminants using the concentration of the contaminants in the influent cin as the external variable the mean model bias mbi was estimated for each medium for which concentration data were available i water rhizome or emergent vegetation using 10 mb i e j 1 n ln c model j c obs j n where j represents the individual contaminants n 9 used for model calibration and testing this method of model performance evaluation assumes that the ratio cmodel cobs has a log normal distribution an mbi greater than one indicates the model systematically over estimates chemical concentrations in medium i by a factor equal to the mbi value an mbi less than one indicates the model systematically under estimates chemical concentrations in medium i by a factor equal to the mbi value an mbi of one indicates that on average empirical observation and model calculations are in agreement i e minimal model bias the 95 confidence intervals of mbi represents the uncertainty in the model calculations the mbi value and the 95 confidence interval reflect the combined sum of error in the model calculations including model parameterization errors errors in model structure and analytical errors and variability in the empirical data used for model performance analysis the steady state assumption of the model was assessed by estimating the time to reach 95 of steady state i e t95 for each chemical in the three environmental compartments t95 is estimated as 3 kdep i where kdep i is the total depuration rate constant for environmental compartment i these estimates were verified with the dynamic non steady state version of the model and were used to evaluate whether steady state conditions were achievable within the timeline of the two sampling events at the lhtw 2 4 sensitivity analysis the model uses 42 state variables n 42 for the contaminant fate calculations the sensitivity of each of these parameters was evaluated by the effect of each model parameter on mass removal efficiency el using a method developed by morris 1991 this method is useful for determining whether the effect of the input parameter on the mass removal efficiency is a negligible b linear and additive or c non linear or involved in interactions with other parameters campolongo and saltelli 1997 saltelli et al 2005 campolongo et al 2007 following the approach outlined in saltelli et al 2008 the elementary effects of parameter i eei were estimated using the mass removal efficiency as the model output y such that 11 ee i y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x n y x 1 x 2 x n δ the parameter values xi are discretized along a 4 level grid i e δ 0 1 3 2 3 1 such that xi δ max min min additional details on the calculations for eei are available in the supplementary information the mean and standard deviation μi and σi of the elementary effects for each parameter were used to analyze the sensitivity of the input parameters and demonstrate their effects on el μi represents the magnitude of parameter sensitivity to removal efficiency and σi represents the degree of interactions between input parameters 2 5 model simulations to assess model behaviour two applications of the model were used to evaluate horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands for the removal of various industrial contaminants from wastewater and to illustrate the merits and limitations of the model the first application of the model explores the effects of the water budget on the treatment of specific organic pollutants the second application of the model explores removal efficiency transpiration and volatilization of a wide range of contaminants based on their physicochemical properties and demonstrates the significance of biotransformation in contaminant removal the model was parameterized to the lorong halus treatment wetland lhtw 2 5 1 simulations to assess the influence of the water balance discharge rates for rb3 are not available for the individual treatment wetland cells and therefore the outflow rate was estimated from the steady state water budget 12 q out q in q ext q et q gw and 13 q ext q prec q runoff q gw where qout is the flow rate m3 day of water leaving the wetland cell qin is the water flow rate entering the cell from the sedimentation tank qprec represents the rate that water enters the wetland via precipitation qprec p sarb3 qrunoff represents the rate that water enters the wetland via runoff qet is the evapotranspiration rate from the lhtw qet et sarb3 and qgw is the discharge into groundwater or recharge into the wetland the sum of qprec qrunoff and qgw represent the total input of water from external sources i e qext within the wetland qext competes with qet and qgw to determine the water balance this water balance can be represented by the ratio of qout qin a qout qin ratio greater than one indicates that the input from precipitation runoff or groundwater recharge i e qext exceeds the water loss via evapotranspiration and groundwater discharge a qout qin ratio less than one indicates that the total loss of water exceeds qext at the lhtw system runoff and groundwater recharge and discharge are considered negligible due to the impermeable liners and physical controls qin was estimated from sim et al 2013 to be 100 000 l day of landfill leachate the lhtw has an average annual precipitation rate of 2330 mm year meteorological service singapore 2015 an estimated evapotranspiration rate of 2385 mm year penman monteith equation an estimated outflow rate of 98 500 l day qin 100 000 l day and a mean hydraulic retention time hrt of 22 7 days hrt vwater qout 2 5 2 simulations to assess the influence of physicochemical properties this application of the model explores which chemical substances are efficiently removed by wetland treatment and which chemical substances are not a distribution of kow octanol water partition coefficient and kaw air water partition coefficient was created based on the 3 solubility approach for environmental distribution of organic chemicals between water air and organic media mackay 2001 kow ranged from 3 0 to 7 0 and kaw ranged from 8 0 to 4 0 to reflect various organic contaminants that may enter the treatment wetland the concentration in the influent was set to 1 ppm all other physicochemical properties such as henry s law constant h pa m3 mol and the organic carbon water partition coefficient koc were derived from kow and kaw the roles of kow and kaw were evaluated using steady state model outputs volatilization transpiration and mass loading removal efficiency el volatilization and transpiration are shown as a percentage of total removal of contaminant mass from the inflowing wastewater to highlight the removal via volatilization and transpiration biotransformation rates in all media were set to 10 10 day 1 to represent negligible biotransformation within the wetland media since biotransformation is not easily estimated based on kow and kaw these rates were applied to the entire domain of kow and kaw these modelling results represent removal for non biodegradable recalcitrant contaminants to explore the effects of biotransformation on wetland treatment this model application was repeated with biotransformation rates of 0 01 day 1 0 1 day 1 and 0 3 day 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration model estimated concentrations of the test chemicals n 9 in water rhizomes and emergent vegetation from the lhtw are shown to be within a factor of three to observed concentrations fig 2 the value of the calibration coefficients β1 and β2 eqs 8 9 are 0 60 and 1 56 respectively β1 is less than one which indicates an over prediction of water to rhizome mass transport by the uncalibrated model whereas β2 is greater than one indicating the rhizome to emergent vegetation mass transport is under predicted by the uncalibrated model these deviations of the model from the empirical data appear to increase with increasing kow of the chemical this calibration approach lowers contaminant concentrations in the rhizomes and elevates contaminant mass within the emergent vegetation to better correlate with the observed data this suggests that aquatic plants may have a smaller influence on the mass balance than is apparent from plant water exchange models 3 2 model behaviour 3 2 1 model bias the resulting mean model bias mb and its 95 confidence range in the water rhizome and emergent vegetation is 0 97 0 41 2 24 1 03 0 53 2 00 and 1 00 0 27 3 71 respectively the mean model bias of the calibrated model is close to one for the media investigated illustrating low systematic bias for the lhtw system based on the nine test chemicals that are poorly biotransformed the 95 confidence intervals of the overall model bias indicate uncertainty equivalent to a factor of 2 3 for water concentration estimates 2 0 for rhizome concentration estimates and 3 7 for emergent vegetation concentration estimates 3 2 2 steady state vs non steady state the time expected to reach 95 of steady state t95 in water ranges from 40 days endosulfan sulfate to 66 days pcb 52 for the nine test chemicals generally t95 of the test chemicals in water increases with increasing log kow of the chemical the t95 for the rhizome and emergent vegetation compartments range from 75 to 4200 days and 1 0 104 to 4 3 104 days table b 7 large estimates of t95 for these test chemicals in rhizomes and emergent vegetation result from the slow depuration rates determined by the model this is in part due to the slow biotransformation rates of these hydrophobic test chemicals this suggests that the use of the steady state version of the model is appropriate to estimate chemical concentrations in the water but not in vegetation the t95 estimates for rhizomes and emergent vegetation suggests that the concentration of the test chemicals in the vegetation of the lhtw can be expected to continuously increase over time non steady state condition this may explain why the calibration coefficient β1 for water to rhizome exchange is less than one 3 3 sensitivity analysis the elementary effects sensitivity metrics μi and σi table b 8 demonstrate significant sensitivity of the mass removal efficiency to a number of parameters the most sensitive parameters are log kow μlogkow 0 30 σlogkow 0 86 water side water rhizome mass transfer coefficient μw rh 0 27 σw rh 0 29 transformation half life in water μt1 2 water 0 19 σt1 2 water 0 24 water temperature μtemp 0 14 σtemp 0 16 and plant stem density i e the number of plants in the wetland μnp 0 13 σnp 0 14 the log kow is a central parameter in the treatment wetland model it is used to calculate the vegetation water and suspended sediment water partition coefficients which are then used to calculate mass transfer coefficients and rate constants the direct and indirect relationships of log kow with other variables create many different interactions throughout the model resulting in a large mean μi and standard deviation σi of its elementary effects on mass removal efficiency the water side rhizome water mass transfer coefficient is used to calculate overall chemical mass transfer from water to rhizome using a two film diffusion model this suggests that removal efficiency in the wetland is dependent on characteristics of the vegetation and properties of the chemical that promote diffusion between water and rhizomes the sensitivity of mass removal efficiency to the transformation half life of the chemical in water demonstrates the importance of biotransformation on the removal of chemicals in wetlands chemicals that are more easily biotransformed in wetland media will be more efficiently removed in the wetland biotransformation in the water reduces the availability of the chemical for mass transfer into vegetation and therefore affects the contribution of other biogeochemical processes on chemical removal this is shown by the sensitivity analysis with the large standard deviation of elementary effects suggesting transformation rates in water interacts with other model parameters that affect removal efficiency water temperature and plant density plants per m2 are design criteria for the treatment wetland their large μi and σi show that mass removal efficiency is dependent on the wetland design this suggests that future treatment wetlands can be designed to improve mass removal efficiency by optimizing these parameters for a site specific application of a treatment wetland system however there are complex interactions between these parameters that influence the performance of the treatment wetland these complex interactions provide a rationale for developing a treatment wetland model to aid in future wetland designs the analysis also suggests that some parameters may have little to no significant effect on the estimated mass removal efficiency el or other outputs from the treatment wetland model such parameters include aspect ratio of the wetland design i e length width 1 1 8 1 which suggests that many different wetland configurations can be suitable for treatment and size of emergent vegetation 0 1 1 0 kg which suggests that a variety of plants can be used in treatment wetlands however there may be practical implications of these parameters that are not captured by the model for instance the aspect ratio of the wetland design may influence mixing of wastewater and erosion of berms and can be used by the model to estimate the total surface area of the rooting medium gravel see appendix a sensitivity to the aspect ratio may occur for model applications that include biofilm as a compartment relevant for the environmental fate of substances within the wetland the size of emergent vegetation may correlate with the size of the rhizomes which is a more sensitive parameter for removal efficiency or may also correlate with wetland maturity and productivity further analysis is required before suggesting these parameters are not influential for treatment wetland design and to properly assess the influence of these parameters on overall contaminant removal for various treatment wetland systems 3 4 role of the water balance fig 3 demonstrates how external inputs such as precipitation runoff and groundwater recharge can affect el and ec for hexachlorobenzene hcb at the lhtw if there were no inputs of water into the wetland other than influent i e qext 0 l day the evapotranspiration is expected to reduce water outflow to 70 of qin qout qin 0 70 this water deficit through the wetland results in an ec for hcb below zero i e concentration of hcb in the effluent exceeds that in the influent despite actual removal of the mass of hcb el 0 from the water by the wetland if the purpose of the treatment wetland is to reclaim water for discharge into the environment then the treatment wetland may not be effective as the concentration of hcb in the effluent is greater than that in the influent if inputs of water into the wetland are able to surpass water losses through evapotranspiration resulting in qout qin 1 then dilution of the hcb occurs causing both el and ec to adopt values greater than zero the added volume of water increases flow rates through the lhtw and therefore decreases the hydraulic retention time within the wetland limiting the exposure of hcb to wetland biogeochemical removal mechanisms a similar response on el and ec can be shown for evapotranspiration with greater evapotranspiration rates there is an increase in el for hcb within the wetland resulting from i greater xylem flow through vegetation providing a more rapid transport of the chemical from the subsurface water into the vegetation to undergo transpiration ii greater volatilization from the subsurface water through the rooting medium and iii greater hydraulic retention time within the wetland since the volume of water within the wetland is reduced by evapotranspiration the hydraulic retention time has been explored in many treatment wetland studies and is a critical design feature for the success of a treatment wetland application knight et al 1999 hijosa valsero et al 2010 pavlineri et al 2017 for substances that are quickly biotransformed the water balance also affects biotransformation rates since the rate of biotransformation is a function of the concentration of the substance in the water of the wetland however water balance has less effect on el and ec for quickly biotransforming substances than for recalcitrant substances fig b1 supplementary information demonstrates the effect of external water sources on el and ec for pyrene to show the influence of the water budget with a more rapidly biotransformed substance 3 5 influence of physicochemical properties fig 4 a demonstrates that volatilization of substances is responsible for up to 70 of contaminant removal in absence of biotransformation in the lhtw for substances with a log kow 3 5 and log kaw 0 volatilization contributes up to 10 of contaminant removal for persistent substances with a log kaw below 2 0 regardless of its log kow the contribution of volatilization to mass removal depends on the wetland design and environmental conditions at the lhtw there is little annual variability in air temperature which averages 24 7 deg c sd 0 5 with an average daily maximum of 31 5 deg c sd 0 7 meteorological service singapore 2015 generally high temperatures at the surface of the wetland will promote volatilization from surface water however at the lhtw there is a 15 cm freeboard zone between the water surface and the open air that limits mass transfer of the contaminants from liquid aqueous phase to gas air phase reducing the freeboard zone may further improve volatilization of some contaminants fig 4b indicates that transpiration through the vegetation at the lhtw is responsible for up to 14 of contaminant removal in absence of biotransformation and is greatest for substances with log kow of 4 5 5 5 and log kaw of 5 0 0 0 this range of chemical properties describes chemicals that i do not strongly or irreversibly bind to organic media and ii do not have a high solubility in water these characteristics of a substance permit diffusion of the contaminant into the rhizomes and subsequently into the transpiration stream xylem flow without strongly binding to the organic carbon or lipid fraction of the vegetation if the chemical binds too strongly to the organic carbon in the vegetation only a small fraction of the chemical is left dissolved in the transpiration stream conversely if a chemical exhibits a high aqueous solubility and low affinity for organic carbon then there is little partitioning of the chemical from water into the vegetation fig 4c suggests that persistent chemicals having a log kow between 3 0 and 5 0 and log kaw greater than 1 0 are most efficiently removed from wastewater in the lhtw el 70 this range of chemical properties closely resembles the optimal range for volatilization which in the lhtw contributes to contaminant removal to a greater degree than transpiration the lowest mass removal el in absence of biotransformation was observed for substances with i a log kow 4 and log kaw 2 and ii a log kow 6 and log kaw 1 0 el 7 these properties describe substances that are either highly hydrophilic or highly hydrophobic and represent chemicals that are neither prone to volatilization nor transpiration hydrophilic substances tend to remain in the water compartment and have lower removal efficiencies because they are mainly subject to removal mechanisms in the water compartment transformation in the water is the main mechanism of removal for these substances hydrophobic substances bind strongly to organic media reducing the freely dissolved concentration in the water which limits the amount of chemical available for volatilization transpiration and transformation contaminants bound to organic media are initially extracted from the water and the wetland may show high treatment efficiencies that decrease as the system approaches steady state fig 5 a b and c demonstrate the effects of different biotransformation rates on the mass removal efficiency el of contaminants for biotransformation rates in water of 0 01 0 1 and 0 3 day 1 the maximum estimated el for the lhtw system is 75 84 and 90 respectively the greatest el values were found for substances having a log kow between 3 0 and 5 0 and log kaw 1 0 improvements to the maximum el as biotransformation rates increase are evident however the effects of biotransformation on mass removal are more profound for substances that are poorly removed by non biotransformation related removal mechanisms such as volatilization and transpiration for substances that do not readily undergo volatilization or transpiration even relatively low rates of biotransformation can significantly contribute to the overall removal from the wetland as biotransformation rates increase transpiration and volatilization processes become less significant to the overall mass removal efficiency for example when biotransformation rate is 0 3 day 1 volatilization and transpiration are responsible for 23 and 0 1 of contaminant removal respectively whereas total biotransformation accounts for 60 of contaminant removal fig 5 is useful for interpolating the removal efficiency of various chemicals that occupy regions within the range of kow and kaw shown in the figures biotransformation rates of chemicals are often unknown for organic chemicals within environmental media but their influence on the wetland s removal efficiency is illustrated in these figures since biotransformation is shown to be significant to the overall removal capacity of contaminants maintaining a strong community of microorganisms and vegetation that can facilitate various biotransformation processes is important to the performance of these systems ibekwe et al 2003 button et al 2016 mustafa et al 2017 characterizing the biotransformation capacity in the wetland through bioassays or other methods is a crucial component to assess treatment efficiencies of remediation wetlands 4 conclusions a mechanistic model was developed to assess the fate and removal efficiency of hydrophobic organic contaminants in horizontal subsurface flow wetlands the model was applied to singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland system and evaluated under different modelling scenarios the calibrated model for the lorong halus treatment wetland provided an adequate description of the concentrations of nine neutral organic substances in the water rhizomes and emergent vegetation of the wetland the model demonstrates the influence of the water balance on both mass removal and contaminant concentration reduction efficiency for recalcitrant substances in the wetland water inputs into the wetland in addition to wastewater influents e g precipitation will reduce concentrations of contaminants as a result of dilution but also shorten hydraulic retention times which reduce contaminant

19060,a mechanistic model for assessing the fate and removal efficiency of hydrophobic organic contaminants in horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands was developed and evaluated using empirical concentration data from singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland this treatment wetland consists of a series of horizontal subsurface flow reed beds the model calibrated for the lorong halus treatment wetland provided an adequate description of the concentrations of nine neutral organic substances in water rhizomes and emergent vegetation in the wetland the model was applied to investigate the sensitivity of the contaminant removal efficiency to environmental conditions and physicochemical properties of contaminants that enter the wetland the water budget of the wetland was found to exhibit an important influence on both the mass removal efficiency and reduction of contaminant concentrations that can be achieved through wetland treatment the model illustrated that removal pathways of organic contaminants in the wetland varied as a function of the properties of the contaminants the mass removal efficiency of the treatment wetland was greatest for chemicals with a log kow between 3 0 and 5 0 and log kaw 1 0 removal of contaminants through volatilization was found to be greatest for substances with a log kow between 3 and 5 and log kaw 0 transpiration flux in

efficiency 1 introduction treatment wetlands are constructed artificial ecosystems designed to harness the natural biogeochemistry of wetlands for reclamation and remediation services these systems have emerged as a viable solution to various wastewater challenges including municipal and domestic wastewater e g toscano et al 2009 minewater e g batty and younger 2004 agricultural runoff e g page et al 2010 industrial wastewater e g lin et al 2005 and leachate e g sim et al 2013 in these applications treatment wetland systems have demonstrated their ability to reclaim and remediate soil groundwater and surface water with their complex symbiosis between microorganisms vegetation and rooting media u s epa 2000 reddy and delaune 2008 kadlec and wallace 2009 models have also been developed and applied to entire constructed wetland systems to assess specific criteria such as hydraulic characteristics throughout the system chazarenc et al 2003 garcia et al 2004 changes to biochemical oxygen demand or chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater chen et al 1999 wynn and liehr 2001 and nutrient cycling mayo and bigambo 2005 many of these models incorporate reactive transport dynamics based on the first order k c approach which represents conventional first order removal kadlec and knight 1996 the constructed wetland 2 d model langergraber 2001 is a well developed treatment wetland model designed to estimate the biochemical transformation and degradation of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus species in subsurface flow treatment wetlands using numerical modelling this multifaceted model performs well for bulk influent and effluent properties but does not provide partitioning and concentration estimates for specific chemicals and does not include vegetation mediated processes of contaminant removal such as evapotranspiration several models have been developed to describe the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the fate of pollutants within wetlands models that describe the uptake and fate of nonionic organic substances in wetland vegetation often use ratios of chemical concentrations in the plant compartment of interest e g shoots roots xylem sap to those in the exposure medium soil pore water hydroponic solution these concentration ratios are generally referred to as bioconcentration factors bcfs but have also been named for their specific plant tissue compartment such as root concentration factor rcf briggs et al 1983 topp et al 1986 stem concentration factor scf mackay and gschwend 2000 trapp 2002 or transpiration stream xylem sap concentration factor tscf trapp and matthies 1995 rein et al 2011 empirical correlations between bcf and certain physicochemical properties such as the octanol water partition coefficient

have been used in support of various chemical management strategies around the world e g environment canada 1995 euses 2012 industries that face wastewater challenges need decision tools that can demonstrate the potential for a treatment wetland system to meet water quality objectives e g ccme 1999 aep 1995 esrd 2014 while considering tradeoffs in their design and operation there is a current need to develop mechanistic models that can effectively predict the fate and removal efficiency of hydrophobic organic contaminants in treatment wetlands these models can be useful tools for evaluating the feasibility and design of treatment wetlands for contaminant and site specific industrial applications the present study involves the development and evaluation of a mechanistic model to assess the fate and removal efficiency of non ionising hydrophobic organic contaminants in horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands the developed model is designed to estimate contaminant removal efficiencies based on the dynamics of plant uptake intermedia transport sorption and transformation the ultimate goal of the model is to understand how to safely and effectively implement treatment wetlands under a variety of environmental conditions and treatment scenarios the model is applied to a large scale treatment wetland in singapore the lorong halus treatment wetland lhtw the model is evaluated using concentration data from a recent field investigation of hydrophobic organic contaminants in different compartments of this treatment wetland wang and kelly 2017 we further provide an assessment of the behaviour merits and limitations of the model and the results of a sensitivity analysis to better understand the influence of various model parameters 1 1 theory treatment wetland systems are grouped into three hydrologic flow regimes i free water surface fws wetlands which are artificial streams that have an open surface water column with emergent vegetation planted in saturated rooting media ii horizontal h and iii vertical v subsurface flow ssf wetlands which are aquifer like designs that permit the flow of water horizontally or vertically through a coarse grained medium kadlec and knight 1996 fig 1 singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland is a horizontal subsurface flow wetland design information from the lorong halus treatment wetland provides an opportunity to evaluate the performance of this type of treatment wetland for the present modelling study of hydrophobic organic contaminants in treatment wetlands we utilized an environmental modelling approach that has been developed and used by many authors including mackay et al 1983 quantitative water air sediment interaction qwasi model mackay 2001 level i iv fugacity models gobas 1993 food web model clark et al 1995 sewage treatment plant stp model arnot and gobas 2004 aquaweb food web bioaccumulation model and others 1 2 model design the objective of the model is to describe the behaviour of hydrophobic organic contaminants in treatment wetlands the evaluative components of the wetland environment consist of water w rhizome vegetation rh and emergent vegetation ev water that enters the treatment wetland environment flows through the pore space of the rooting medium gravel i e horizontal subsurface flow chemicals enter the rhizomes through diffusion from water and xylem transport carries the chemical through to the emergent fraction of the vegetation where transpiration may occur fig 1 provides a conceptual diagram of the wetland and illustrates these transformation and intermedia transport processes for each of the three modelled wetland compartments these processes are described in terms of first order kinetics in mass balance equations eqs 1 3 1

wastewater and is the product of the inflow rate qin l day and individual chemical concentration cin g l the model is programmed to run a euler type numerical integration to derive the time course of contaminant concentrations in the compartments of the treatment wetland this solution is useful to assess the response of the wetland to contaminant loading as it approaches steady state and for pulse loading scenarios to assess the distribution of chemicals over time the model is also solved for a system at steady state dmi dt 0 this solution of the model is useful to assess the long term capacity

characteristics of the wetland system since m out is simply c out k o el and ec are equal when there is equal water inflow and outflow i e no net change to the water budget the relationship between removal efficiency and the configuration and conditions of the wetland is investigated through model demonstrations and a sensitivity analysis 1 3 model assumptions and limitations the model assumes that within each compartment the chemical is homogeneously mixed the substrate gravel is parameterized to have no inherent sorptive capacity for organics but does offer a surface for suspended sediment deposition which offers sites for sorption of freely dissolved contaminants in the water contaminant transport from the rhizomes to the emergent vegetation is assumed to occur principally through xylem flow while phloem and aerenchymal transport are considered negligible thus the model is not applicable to describe the fate of gases such as methane or oxygen or essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus for our modelling purposes the atmosphere does not act as a source of contaminant mass but only as a contaminant sink no seasonal or diurnal variability is modelled for the climatic variables e g temperature precipitation evapotranspiration the model accounts for the combined transformation by chemical reactions physical degradation and biological transformation chemical transformations result from reactions with other chemicals within the wetland environment and physical transformations may occur from uv exposure fasnacht and blough 2002 biological transformation biotransformation occurs from microbial activity or enzymatic degradation within wetland vegetation rhizomes and emergent vegetation all transformation processes are modelled as non reversible first order degradation pathways transformation is assumed to act upon the freely dissolved contaminant fraction in the environmental media whereas particle bound contaminant fractions are not subject to transformation kickham et al 2012 transformation rate constants kt in each medium are first order rates that can represent both biotic and abiotic transformation processes in water rhizomes and emergent vegetation 2 methods the model was parameterized and calibrated for a single reed bed rb3 of singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland lhtw table 2 the lhtw system was constructed to treat landfill leachate and includes a pre treatment system 8000 m2 five constructed reed beds that run in parallel total 38 000 m2 and five polishing ponds total 13 000 m2 data on the lhtw configuration and design including parameter data for rb3 was obtained from wang and kelly 2017 and sim et al 2013 2 1 chemicals nine hydrophobic organic contaminants were used for model calibration galaxolide tonalide pentachlorobenzene hexachlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene musk ketone methyl triclosan pcb52 and endosulfan sulfate these substances were selected from the original data set 86 chemicals reported by wang and kelly 2017 because they were detected in more than two of three grab samples in two sampling events 8th october 2015 and 11th february 2016 and observed concentrations were below each chemical s aqueous solubility limit concentrations of hexachlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene and endosulfan sulfate were non detectable in one of the grab samples and were assumed to equal 50 of the method detection limit reported by wang and kelly 2017 the recurrence of chemicals detected in wetland media indicate that the chemicals have been consistently present in the influent between sampling events justifying the use of the steady state version of the model the concentration measurements of these substances in influent leachate cin effluent cout vegetation rhizome crh and emergent vegetation leaves cev were averaged over the two sampling events for model calibration physicochemical properties were obtained from the episuite v4 11 program u s epa 2013 and half life times for chemical transformations were derived from the episuite v4 11 biowin model for primary biodegradation boethling et al 1994 pentachlorobenzene hexachlorobenzene pcb 52 and endosulfan sulfate are considered to be recalcitrant and therefore assigned a t1 2 of 103 days to represent a negligible rate of transformation in the model galaxolide tonalide musk ketone 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene and methyl triclosan are considered biodegradable on the order of months and were assigned a t1 2 of 250 days in water and in the absence of information on the biotransformation of the chemicals in wetland vegetation 2500 days in rhizomes and emergent vegetation 2 2 model calibration to calibrate the model for the lhtw system the rate constant for contaminant transport from water to rhizome kw rh and rhizome to emergent vegetation krh ev was multiplied by a calibration coefficient β1 logkow and β2 logkow using 8 k w rh k w rh β 1 logkow 9 k rh ev k rh ev β 2 logkow where k is the calibrated rate constant day 1 kow is the octanol water partition coefficients and β1 and β2 are the calibration coefficients derived by calibrating the model to the empirical data a calibration coefficient equal to one indicates no calibration of the model the rationale for the calibration of the rate constants for the transport of the chemical from water to rhizome and from rhizome to emergent vegetation is that there is a lack of information on the uptake and elimination kinetics of the test chemicals in wetland vegetation kow is used in eqs 8 and 9 because it is an important chemical property that controls the environmental fate of organic chemicals 2 3 model performance analysis model performance was evaluated by comparing empirical concentrations cobs to the model estimated concentrations cmodel of the nine contaminants using the concentration of the contaminants in the influent cin as the external variable the mean model bias mbi was estimated for each medium for which concentration data were available i water rhizome or emergent vegetation using 10 mb i e j 1 n ln c model j c obs j n where j represents the individual contaminants n 9 used for model calibration and testing this method of model performance evaluation assumes that the ratio cmodel cobs has a log normal distribution an mbi greater than one indicates the model systematically over estimates chemical concentrations in medium i by a factor equal to the mbi value an mbi less than one indicates the model systematically under estimates chemical concentrations in medium i by a factor equal to the mbi value an mbi of one indicates that on average empirical observation and model calculations are in agreement i e minimal model bias the 95 confidence intervals of mbi represents the uncertainty in the model calculations the mbi value and the 95 confidence interval reflect the combined sum of error in the model calculations including model parameterization errors errors in model structure and analytical errors and variability in the empirical data used for model performance analysis the steady state assumption of the model was assessed by estimating the time to reach 95 of steady state i e t95 for each chemical in the three environmental compartments t95 is estimated as 3 kdep i where kdep i is the total depuration rate constant for environmental compartment i these estimates were verified with the dynamic non steady state version of the model and were used to evaluate whether steady state conditions were achievable within the timeline of the two sampling events at the lhtw 2 4 sensitivity analysis the model uses 42 state variables n 42 for the contaminant fate calculations the sensitivity of each of these parameters was evaluated by the effect of each model parameter on mass removal efficiency el using a method developed by morris 1991 this method is useful for determining whether the effect of the input parameter on the mass removal efficiency is a negligible b linear and additive or c non linear or involved in interactions with other parameters campolongo and saltelli 1997 saltelli et al 2005 campolongo et al 2007 following the approach outlined in saltelli et al 2008 the elementary effects of parameter i eei were estimated using the mass removal efficiency as the model output y such that 11 ee i y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x n y x 1 x 2 x n δ the parameter values xi are discretized along a 4 level grid i e δ 0 1 3 2 3 1 such that xi δ max min min additional details on the calculations for eei are available in the supplementary information the mean and standard deviation μi and σi of the elementary effects for each parameter were used to analyze the sensitivity of the input parameters and demonstrate their effects on el μi represents the magnitude of parameter sensitivity to removal efficiency and σi represents the degree of interactions between input parameters 2 5 model simulations to assess model behaviour two applications of the model were used to evaluate horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands for the removal of various industrial contaminants from wastewater and to illustrate the merits and limitations of the model the first application of the model explores the effects of the water budget on the treatment of specific organic pollutants the second application of the model explores removal efficiency transpiration and volatilization of a wide range of contaminants based on their physicochemical properties and demonstrates the significance of biotransformation in contaminant removal the model was parameterized to the lorong halus treatment wetland lhtw 2 5 1 simulations to assess the influence of the water balance discharge rates for rb3 are not available for the individual treatment wetland cells and therefore the outflow rate was estimated from the steady state water budget 12 q out q in q ext q et q gw and 13 q ext q prec q runoff q gw where qout is the flow rate m3 day of water leaving the wetland cell qin is the water flow rate entering the cell from the sedimentation tank qprec represents the rate that water enters the wetland via precipitation qprec p sarb3 qrunoff represents the rate that water enters the wetland via runoff qet is the evapotranspiration rate from the lhtw qet et sarb3 and qgw is the discharge into groundwater or recharge into the wetland the sum of qprec qrunoff and qgw represent the total input of water from external sources i e qext within the wetland qext competes with qet and qgw to determine the water balance this water balance can be represented by the ratio of qout qin a qout qin ratio greater than one indicates that the input from precipitation runoff or groundwater recharge i e qext exceeds the water loss via evapotranspiration and groundwater discharge a qout qin ratio less than one indicates that the total loss of water exceeds qext at the lhtw system runoff and groundwater recharge and discharge are considered negligible due to the impermeable liners and physical controls qin was estimated from sim et al 2013 to be 100 000 l day of landfill leachate the lhtw has an average annual precipitation rate of 2330 mm year meteorological service singapore 2015 an estimated evapotranspiration rate of 2385 mm year penman monteith equation an estimated outflow rate of 98 500 l day qin 100 000 l day and a mean hydraulic retention time hrt of 22 7 days hrt vwater qout 2 5 2 simulations to assess the influence of physicochemical properties this application of the model explores which chemical substances are efficiently removed by wetland treatment and which chemical substances are not a distribution of kow octanol water partition coefficient and kaw air water partition coefficient was created based on the 3 solubility approach for environmental distribution of organic chemicals between water air and organic media mackay 2001 kow ranged from 3 0 to 7 0 and kaw ranged from 8 0 to 4 0 to reflect various organic contaminants that may enter the treatment wetland the concentration in the influent was set to 1 ppm all other physicochemical properties such as henry s law constant h pa m3 mol and the organic carbon water partition coefficient koc were derived from kow and kaw the roles of kow and kaw were evaluated using steady state model outputs volatilization transpiration and mass loading removal efficiency el volatilization and transpiration are shown as a percentage of total removal of contaminant mass from the inflowing wastewater to highlight the removal via volatilization and transpiration biotransformation rates in all media were set to 10 10 day 1 to represent negligible biotransformation within the wetland media since biotransformation is not easily estimated based on kow and kaw these rates were applied to the entire domain of kow and kaw these modelling results represent removal for non biodegradable recalcitrant contaminants to explore the effects of biotransformation on wetland treatment this model application was repeated with biotransformation rates of 0 01 day 1 0 1 day 1 and 0 3 day 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration model estimated concentrations of the test chemicals n 9 in water rhizomes and emergent vegetation from the lhtw are shown to be within a factor of three to observed concentrations fig 2 the value of the calibration coefficients β1 and β2 eqs 8 9 are 0 60 and 1 56 respectively β1 is less than one which indicates an over prediction of water to rhizome mass transport by the uncalibrated model whereas β2 is greater than one indicating the rhizome to emergent vegetation mass transport is under predicted by the uncalibrated model these deviations of the model from the empirical data appear to increase with increasing kow of the chemical this calibration approach lowers contaminant concentrations in the rhizomes and elevates contaminant mass within the emergent vegetation to better correlate with the observed data this suggests that aquatic plants may have a smaller influence on the mass balance than is apparent from plant water exchange models 3 2 model behaviour 3 2 1 model bias the resulting mean model bias mb and its 95 confidence range in the water rhizome and emergent vegetation is 0 97 0 41 2 24 1 03 0 53 2 00 and 1 00 0 27 3 71 respectively the mean model bias of the calibrated model is close to one for the media investigated illustrating low systematic bias for the lhtw system based on the nine test chemicals that are poorly biotransformed the 95 confidence intervals of the overall model bias indicate uncertainty equivalent to a factor of 2 3 for water concentration estimates 2 0 for rhizome concentration estimates and 3 7 for emergent vegetation concentration estimates 3 2 2 steady state vs non steady state the time expected to reach 95 of steady state t95 in water ranges from 40 days endosulfan sulfate to 66 days pcb 52 for the nine test chemicals generally t95 of the test chemicals in water increases with increasing log kow of the chemical the t95 for the rhizome and emergent vegetation compartments range from 75 to 4200 days and 1 0 104 to 4 3 104 days table b 7 large estimates of t95 for these test chemicals in rhizomes and emergent vegetation result from the slow depuration rates determined by the model this is in part due to the slow biotransformation rates of these hydrophobic test chemicals this suggests that the use of the steady state version of the model is appropriate to estimate chemical concentrations in the water but not in vegetation the t95 estimates for rhizomes and emergent vegetation suggests that the concentration of the test chemicals in the vegetation of the lhtw can be expected to continuously increase over time non steady state condition this may explain why the calibration coefficient β1 for water to rhizome exchange is less than one 3 3 sensitivity analysis the elementary effects sensitivity metrics μi and σi table b 8 demonstrate significant sensitivity of the mass removal efficiency to a number of parameters the most sensitive parameters are log kow μlogkow 0 30 σlogkow 0 86 water side water rhizome mass transfer coefficient μw rh 0 27 σw rh 0 29 transformation half life in water μt1 2 water 0 19 σt1 2 water 0 24 water temperature μtemp 0 14 σtemp 0 16 and plant stem density i e the number of plants in the wetland μnp 0 13 σnp 0 14 the log kow is a central parameter in the treatment wetland model it is used to calculate the vegetation water and suspended sediment water partition coefficients which are then used to calculate mass transfer coefficients and rate constants the direct and indirect relationships of log kow with other variables create many different interactions throughout the model resulting in a large mean μi and standard deviation σi of its elementary effects on mass removal efficiency the water side rhizome water mass transfer coefficient is used to calculate overall chemical mass transfer from water to rhizome using a two film diffusion model this suggests that removal efficiency in the wetland is dependent on characteristics of the vegetation and properties of the chemical that promote diffusion between water and rhizomes the sensitivity of mass removal efficiency to the transformation half life of the chemical in water demonstrates the importance of biotransformation on the removal of chemicals in wetlands chemicals that are more easily biotransformed in wetland media will be more efficiently removed in the wetland biotransformation in the water reduces the availability of the chemical for mass transfer into vegetation and therefore affects the contribution of other biogeochemical processes on chemical removal this is shown by the sensitivity analysis with the large standard deviation of elementary effects suggesting transformation rates in water interacts with other model parameters that affect removal efficiency water temperature and plant density plants per m2 are design criteria for the treatment wetland their large μi and σi show that mass removal efficiency is dependent on the wetland design this suggests that future treatment wetlands can be designed to improve mass removal efficiency by optimizing these parameters for a site specific application of a treatment wetland system however there are complex interactions between these parameters that influence the performance of the treatment wetland these complex interactions provide a rationale for developing a treatment wetland model to aid in future wetland designs the analysis also suggests that some parameters may have little to no significant effect on the estimated mass removal efficiency el or other outputs from the treatment wetland model such parameters include aspect ratio of the wetland design i e length width 1 1 8 1 which suggests that many different wetland configurations can be suitable for treatment and size of emergent vegetation 0 1 1 0 kg which suggests that a variety of plants can be used in treatment wetlands however there may be practical implications of these parameters that are not captured by the model for instance the aspect ratio of the wetland design may influence mixing of wastewater and erosion of berms and can be used by the model to estimate the total surface area of the rooting medium gravel see appendix a sensitivity to the aspect ratio may occur for model applications that include biofilm as a compartment relevant for the environmental fate of substances within the wetland the size of emergent vegetation may correlate with the size of the rhizomes which is a more sensitive parameter for removal efficiency or may also correlate with wetland maturity and productivity further analysis is required before suggesting these parameters are not influential for treatment wetland design and to properly assess the influence of these parameters on overall contaminant removal for various treatment wetland systems 3 4 role of the water balance fig 3 demonstrates how external inputs such as precipitation runoff and groundwater recharge can affect el and ec for hexachlorobenzene hcb at the lhtw if there were no inputs of water into the wetland other than influent i e qext 0 l day the evapotranspiration is expected to reduce water outflow to 70 of qin qout qin 0 70 this water deficit through the wetland results in an ec for hcb below zero i e concentration of hcb in the effluent exceeds that in the influent despite actual removal of the mass of hcb el 0 from the water by the wetland if the purpose of the treatment wetland is to reclaim water for discharge into the environment then the treatment wetland may not be effective as the concentration of hcb in the effluent is greater than that in the influent if inputs of water into the wetland are able to surpass water losses through evapotranspiration resulting in qout qin 1 then dilution of the hcb occurs causing both el and ec to adopt values greater than zero the added volume of water increases flow rates through the lhtw and therefore decreases the hydraulic retention time within the wetland limiting the exposure of hcb to wetland biogeochemical removal mechanisms a similar response on el and ec can be shown for evapotranspiration with greater evapotranspiration rates there is an increase in el for hcb within the wetland resulting from i greater xylem flow through vegetation providing a more rapid transport of the chemical from the subsurface water into the vegetation to undergo transpiration ii greater volatilization from the subsurface water through the rooting medium and iii greater hydraulic retention time within the wetland since the volume of water within the wetland is reduced by evapotranspiration the hydraulic retention time has been explored in many treatment wetland studies and is a critical design feature for the success of a treatment wetland application knight et al 1999 hijosa valsero et al 2010 pavlineri et al 2017 for substances that are quickly biotransformed the water balance also affects biotransformation rates since the rate of biotransformation is a function of the concentration of the substance in the water of the wetland however water balance has less effect on el and ec for quickly biotransforming substances than for recalcitrant substances fig b1 supplementary information demonstrates the effect of external water sources on el and ec for pyrene to show the influence of the water budget with a more rapidly biotransformed substance 3 5 influence of physicochemical properties fig 4 a demonstrates that volatilization of substances is responsible for up to 70 of contaminant removal in absence of biotransformation in the lhtw for substances with a log kow 3 5 and log kaw 0 volatilization contributes up to 10 of contaminant removal for persistent substances with a log kaw below 2 0 regardless of its log kow the contribution of volatilization to mass removal depends on the wetland design and environmental conditions at the lhtw there is little annual variability in air temperature which averages 24 7 deg c sd 0 5 with an average daily maximum of 31 5 deg c sd 0 7 meteorological service singapore 2015 generally high temperatures at the surface of the wetland will promote volatilization from surface water however at the lhtw there is a 15 cm freeboard zone between the water surface and the open air that limits mass transfer of the contaminants from liquid aqueous phase to gas air phase reducing the freeboard zone may further improve volatilization of some contaminants fig 4b indicates that transpiration through the vegetation at the lhtw is responsible for up to 14 of contaminant removal in absence of biotransformation and is greatest for substances with log kow of 4 5 5 5 and log kaw of 5 0 0 0 this range of chemical properties describes chemicals that i do not strongly or irreversibly bind to organic media and ii do not have a high solubility in water these characteristics of a substance permit diffusion of the contaminant into the rhizomes and subsequently into the transpiration stream xylem flow without strongly binding to the organic carbon or lipid fraction of the vegetation if the chemical binds too strongly to the organic carbon in the vegetation only a small fraction of the chemical is left dissolved in the transpiration stream conversely if a chemical exhibits a high aqueous solubility and low affinity for organic carbon then there is little partitioning of the chemical from water into the vegetation fig 4c suggests that persistent chemicals having a log kow between 3 0 and 5 0 and log kaw greater than 1 0 are most efficiently removed from wastewater in the lhtw el 70 this range of chemical properties closely resembles the optimal range for volatilization which in the lhtw contributes to contaminant removal to a greater degree than transpiration the lowest mass removal el in absence of biotransformation was observed for substances with i a log kow 4 and log kaw 2 and ii a log kow 6 and log kaw 1 0 el 7 these properties describe substances that are either highly hydrophilic or highly hydrophobic and represent chemicals that are neither prone to volatilization nor transpiration hydrophilic substances tend to remain in the water compartment and have lower removal efficiencies because they are mainly subject to removal mechanisms in the water compartment transformation in the water is the main mechanism of removal for these substances hydrophobic substances bind strongly to organic media reducing the freely dissolved concentration in the water which limits the amount of chemical available for volatilization transpiration and transformation contaminants bound to organic media are initially extracted from the water and the wetland may show high treatment efficiencies that decrease as the system approaches steady state fig 5 a b and c demonstrate the effects of different biotransformation rates on the mass removal efficiency el of contaminants for biotransformation rates in water of 0 01 0 1 and 0 3 day 1 the maximum estimated el for the lhtw system is 75 84 and 90 respectively the greatest el values were found for substances having a log kow between 3 0 and 5 0 and log kaw 1 0 improvements to the maximum el as biotransformation rates increase are evident however the effects of biotransformation on mass removal are more profound for substances that are poorly removed by non biotransformation related removal mechanisms such as volatilization and transpiration for substances that do not readily undergo volatilization or transpiration even relatively low rates of biotransformation can significantly contribute to the overall removal from the wetland as biotransformation rates increase transpiration and volatilization processes become less significant to the overall mass removal efficiency for example when biotransformation rate is 0 3 day 1 volatilization and transpiration are responsible for 23 and 0 1 of contaminant removal respectively whereas total biotransformation accounts for 60 of contaminant removal fig 5 is useful for interpolating the removal efficiency of various chemicals that occupy regions within the range of kow and kaw shown in the figures biotransformation rates of chemicals are often unknown for organic chemicals within environmental media but their influence on the wetland s removal efficiency is illustrated in these figures since biotransformation is shown to be significant to the overall removal capacity of contaminants maintaining a strong community of microorganisms and vegetation that can facilitate various biotransformation processes is important to the performance of these systems ibekwe et al 2003 button et al 2016 mustafa et al 2017 characterizing the biotransformation capacity in the wetland through bioassays or other methods is a crucial component to assess treatment efficiencies of remediation wetlands 4 conclusions a mechanistic model was developed to assess the fate and removal efficiency of hydrophobic organic contaminants in horizontal subsurface flow wetlands the model was applied to singapore s lorong halus treatment wetland system and evaluated under different modelling scenarios the calibrated model for the lorong halus treatment wetland provided an adequate description of the concentrations of nine neutral organic substances in the water rhizomes and emergent vegetation of the wetland the model demonstrates the influence of the water balance on both mass removal and contaminant concentration reduction efficiency for recalcitrant substances in the wetland water inputs into the wetland in addition to wastewater influents e g precipitation will reduce concentrations of contaminants as a result of dilution but also shorten hydraulic retention times which reduce contaminant mass removal water loss from the wetland through evapotranspiration reduces the concentration reduction efficiency of the wetland but increases the mass removal efficiency of contaminants in the wetland the balance between inputs and losses of water in the wetland has an important effect on the treatment performance the model illustrated that removal pathways of organic contaminants in the wetland varied as a function of the properties of the contaminants the mass removal efficiency of the treatment wetland was greatest for chemicals with a log kow between 3 0 and 5 0 and log kaw 1 0 removal of persistent contaminants through volatilization was found to be greatest for substances with a log kow between 3 and 5 and log kaw 0 transpiration flux in vegetation was found to be most important for substances with a log kow between 4 5 and 5 5 and a log kaw between 5 0 and 0 0 biotransformation rates of the contaminants in the wetland media play a crucial role in removal of contaminants from wastewater the model provides a tool for assessing the organic contaminant removal capacity and evaluating trade offs in the design and operation of a horizontal subsurface flow

19061,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds are a promising technology for the disinfection of water and wetted surfaces but research into these applications remains limited in the drinking water field uv leds emitting at wavelengths ranging from 254 nm to 285 nm uvc leds have been shown to be effective for the inactivation of numerous pathogens and pathogen surrogate organisms at uv doses comparable to conventional germicidal uv lamps surface disinfection with uv light from uvc leds or from conventional uv lamps is not as well understood as the technology underlying the design and construction of uv leds matures and their energy efficiency improves it is likely that they will become ubiquitous in small scale water treatment applications and surface disinfection in various industries including the medical and dental fields a simple easily replicated methodology was developed and optimized to grow irradiate and recover biofilms from coupons it was hypothesized that higher uv doses would be required to inactivate biofilm bound bacteria than planktonic free floating bacteria because the biofilm would provide some degree of protection from the effects of uvc irradiation indeed uv led irradiation at 265 nm achieved 1 3 0 2 log inactivation of biofilm bound pseudomonas aeruginosa at a uv dose of 8 mj cm2 this inactivation level is lower than those that have been reported by researchers using uvc leds to inactivate planktonic p aeruginosa a finding that can be explained by the higher resistance of biofilm bound bacteria to uv inactivation a dose response curve was developed and fitted to three disinfection models the chick watson model the multi target model and the geeraerd model this last which posits a subpopulation of organisms that are resistant to treatment was a good fit to the dose response data atp results obtained using the biomass recovery atp method atpbr a method that includes a 4 h incubation period after treatment was well correlated to the results of conventional plate counts graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection biofilm uv light emitting diodes uv led 1 introduction light emitting diodes leds are semi conductor p n junction diodes that emit radiation at a single wavelength when a forward voltage is applied in recent years development in materials and manufacturing have allowed for the production of leds that emit in the uv spectrum 200 400 nm specifically uvc leds emitting in the germicidal range 220 nm 290 nm have created opportunities for disinfection applications as described by bolton and cotton 2008 mercury based uv lamps were first implemented for water purification in france in early 20th century but first operated in a consistent manner at full scale in 1955 and today are widely used for disinfection in many industries however these lamps require large amounts of energy contain hazardous materials and are bulky uv leds address some of these drawbacks by offering reduced power consumption environmental impact and size additionally uv leds can be produced at any wavelength which could help to target specific microorganisms of concern the benefits of uv led technology will provide a chance to rethink reactor designs and offer great potential for novel applications surface sterilization is a priority in industries ranging from health care to food preparation and storage as such studies evaluating the utility of uv light for surface disinfection have been published by researchers in many fields many of whom have focused on niche applications of relevance to specific industries in aggregate these studies provide useful information about the factors that are most likely to impact inactivation efficiency and point the way towards the effective application of uv light for surface disinfection a selection of these is summarized in table 1 many bacterial species can produce protective biofilms that help them attach to surface and resist environmental threats including chemical disinfectants and cell damaging irradiation the presence or absence of a biofilm can strongly affect the amount of uv irradiation required to inactivate microorganisms hadjok et al 2008 determined that approximately 38 mj cm2 was required to achieve 2 log inactivation of salmonella bacteria sprayed onto iceberg lettuce while bae and lee demonstrated that over 1000 mj cm2 of uv light was required to achieve the same amount of inactivation of salmonella present in biofilms attached to plastic and steel surfaces 2012 although these two studies were conducted in two separate fields food science vs medical and undoubtedly had many differences in experimental design their results suggest that a substantially higher amount uv light may be required to inactivate microorganisms protected by biofilms than those not protected by a biofilm as with planktonic microorganisms some surface bound microorganisms are more vulnerable to inactivation with uv light than others for example bae and lee showed that biofilm bound p aeruginosa was more vulnerable to uv irradiation at 254 nm than e coli and salmonella additionally pure cultures are more easily inactivated with uv light than wild indigenous bacterial communities found on surfaces a series of catheter focused experiments by bak et al 2009 2010 demonstrated that pure culture biofilms were more vulnerable to uv inactivation than indigenous mixed bacterial communities and that up to 250 times more uv irradiation was required to inactivate mature indigenous biofilm communities than pure culture bacteria in fresh biofilms finally some surfaces are more easily disinfected than others bae and lee 2012 showed that common food borne pathogens were more easily inactivated when they were attached to polypropylene surfaces than when they were attached to stainless steel surfaces the studies summarized in table 1 varied substantially in terms of experimental design and apparatus used which likely explains why some studies reported greater inactivation than others for the same microorganisms bak et al 2010 used a 265 nm uvc led light source for their experiments on pure cultures of p aeruginosa in biofilm but most of the other studies listed in table 1 used lpuv lamps with a peak emission wavelength of 254 nm studies conducted in the water treatment field e g rattanakul and oguma 2018 have suggested that some microorganisms are particularly sensitive to light at 265 nm which may help to explain why bak et al achieved such high inactivation rates in their 2010 study compared to the results of researchers applying uv light at 254 nm both wavelengths are within the action spectrum of biofilm bound p aeruginosa lakretz et al 2010 however so the variability may be associated with other experimental factors for example some studies made use of collimated beam apparatuses where the entire surface to be disinfected was exposed to the same amount of irradiation e g gardner and shama 1999 tseng and li 2007 but others e g bae and lee 2012 hadjok et al 2008 had to account for the uneven distribution of light over the samples the majority of these studies made use of standard uv radiometers calibrated to the peak wavelength s emitted by the uv light source but some made use of other methods such as biodosimetry to determine the uv dose directly gardner and shama 1999 the use of other methods other then radiometry e g chemical actinometry biodosimetry and spectrometry may prove better for dose determination of uv led systems as they are better suited for measuring energy outputs across the uv spectrum 2 methods and materials 2 1 uv led apparatus all uv inactivation experiments were conducted with a uvc led collimated beam apparatus aquisense technologies the apparatus consists of a light holder equipped with uvc leds that emit light at 255 nm 265 nm or 285 nm all of the experiments were conducted at with the 265 nm uvc leds which have a peak wavelength of 268 nm and a full width at half maximum of 11 5 nm the power draw of the collimated beam apparatus during the experiments was 35 w including 265 nm uvc leds fan etc light from the leds is directed to the sample holder via a collimator intensity profiles were collected for the collimated beam using a usb4000 spectrometer ocean optics inc fl usa the spectrometer uses a fibre optic with an active diameter of 3900 μm a grating of 600 lines blazed at 300 nm a slit size of 25 and uses a det4 200 850 detector profiles were collected over a 6 6 cm square grid with a spatial resolution of 0 5 cm at 1 5 3 5 and 7 cm from the edge of the 22 cm collimator a rectangular method was used to determine the intensity of the entire uv led spectrum from 250 to 400 nm integration time for each point was 5 s and 3 scans were used to smooth the curve intensity distribution profiles were also developed using an international light technologies ilt1400 radiometer measurements were collected over a 5 5 cm square grid with a 1 cm spatial resolution at distances of 1 5 3 5 and 7 cm from the edge of the 22 cm collimator readings at each location along the grid were taken as 60 s averages and corrected for the sensitivity of the radiometer with respect to the peak wavelength of the uvc led 2 2 uvc led inactivation experiments all experiments were conducted with a lab grade strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 an opportunistic pathogen that can be found in premise plumbing e g bédard et al 2016 falkinham et al 2015 and is widely used in biofilm studies due to its ability to easily grow under a wide range of environmental conditions bjarnsholt 2013 p aeruginosa biofilm was grown on clear polycarbonate coupons in a centers for disease control and prevention cdc biofilm reactor model cbr 90 1 biosurface technologies corp bozeman mt according to the usepa s standard operating procedure for growing p aeruginosa biofilm in a cdc biofilm reactor us enviromental protection agency office of pesticide programs 2013 a 1 ml volume of p aeruginosa inoculum was added to the reactor which contained 500 ml of a solution of 300 mg l tsb and stirred continuously at 250 rpm the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 23 1 c in batch conditions for 24 1 h following this initial growth period the reactor was switched to flow through mode and a continuous stream of 100 mg l tsb was passed through the reactor at a rate of approximately 10 ml min for an additional 24 1 h the development of standardized procedures for biofilm inactivation extraction and analysis was one of the goals of this project and the evolution of this procedure is described in detail in the results section of this paper coupons were exposed to uvc irradiation at 265 nm for times ranging from 0 to 60 min after treatment the biofilm was recovered from the coupons homogenized using a vortex and analyzed using standard plate counts standard plate count was performed using tryptic soy agar tsa with an incubation time of 16 24 h at 37 c as recommended by the usepa s standard operating procedure for growing p aeruginosa biofilm in a cdc biofilm reactor us enviromental protection agency office of pesticide programs 2013 adenosine triphosphate atp is a molecule produced by living cells during metabolic processes the atp content of a water sample is therefore a measure of the biological activity occurring within the sample the effectiveness of uv treatment can be difficult to characterize using standard atp analyses because unlike physical removal or chemical disinfection processes uv light renders microorganisms incapable of replicating rather than removing or killing them outright the inactivated cells continue to create atp during their normal metabolic activities making it difficult to establish the extent of inactivation to avoid this problem the biomass recovery atp method described by rauch et al 2018 and used in this study includes a 4 h grow out period after treatment after which the sample is analyzed using a standard atp test cells that have not been inactivated by the treatment will continue to replicate during the 4 h grow out period while those that have been inactivated will not the resulting atp measurement which is referred to as atpbr throughout this paper to distinguish it from atp measurements made on samples that have not been subjected to the 4 h grow out procedure is compared to a control that has also been allowed to grow out for 4 h the difference between the two samples is correlated to the amount of inactivation caused by the uv treatment rauch et al 2018 in this study an aliquot of the uvc led treated biofilm was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution pbs added to a culture media in a ratio of 1 10 and incubated for 4 h this culture was then sampled and analyzed for intracellular atp using luminultra s standard quench gone aqueous qga test luminultra 2017 2 2 1 data analysis and calculations 2 2 1 1 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted at the 95 confidence level error bars correspond to the 95 confidence interval on the mean unless otherwise noted 2 2 1 2 determination of uvc led intensity petri factors and dose average intensities and petri factors were determined for different treatment areas defined by the surface area required to accommodate different numbers of coupons intensity values were measured by two means to compare radiometers and spectrometers as measurement tools for uvc leds petri factors were for only the radiometer dose calculations by determining the average intensity over the profile of the treatment fields and then dividing by the centre value the exposure times to achieve the selected uv doses were determined by first calculating or measuring the actual intensity of the uvc led at the surface of the coupons this was competed for each of the 5 distances between the collimator and coupon surface the actual intensity was determined by two methods depending on the measurement tool being used when using the radiometer a modified version of the monochromatic bolton method was used bolton and linden 2003 the radiometer was used to determine the intensity at centre of the collimator which was then inputted into equation 1 to determine the actual intensity of the leds 1 i a c t i 0 p f r d f where iact is the actual intensity at the surface of the coupons in mw cm2 i0 is the measured intensity using the radiometer in mw cm2 p f is the petri factor and rd f is the radiometer responsivity correction factor at the peak wavelength of the uv led 0 75 when using the spectrometer the actual intensity iact was determined as the measured intensity over the treatment field of the coupons equation 2 was used to determine the required exposure times for both measurement tools 2 t e x p d i a c t where iact is the actual intensity over the treatment field 2 3 disinfection models the uv dose response data gathered in this study was fitted to three disinfection models the chick watson model the multi target model and the geeraerd model the chick watson model assumes a log linear response and pseudo first order behaviour between the uv dose applied and the extent of microbial inactivation 3 n t n o 10 k d where nt is the microbial population at time t no is the original microbial population k is the inactivation rate constant and d is the uv dose applied the multi target model expands upon the chick watson model to account for the shoulder that can develop in the dose response curve when multiple hits of the disinfection treatment are required to inactivate the microorganisms 4 n t n o 1 1 10 k d n c the geeraerd model was originally developed to better characterize non log linear behaviour observed during the mild heat sterilization treatment of food products geeraerd et al 2000 this model differs from the other two models applied in this study because it assumes that some portion of the microbial population is resistant to the treatment being applied in its original form the model incorporates two additional parameters the shoulder length t1 and a resistant population of microorganisms nres rattanakul and oguma 2018 used an adapted version of this model to characterize the inactivation of p aeruginosa and other microorganisms by uv leds in some cases including the current study there is no evidence of a shoulder and the model simplifies to 5 n t n o n r e s e k d n r e s ginafit an excel plug in developed by geeraerd et al 2005 was used to solve for k and nres the goodness of fit of the three disinfection models used in this study was evaluated based on the root mean squared error rmse between the predicted and observed log inactivation values 6 r m s e i 1 n l i p r e d l i o b s 2 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of uv led apparatus the average intensity and petri factor of the light emitted by the led apparatus was determined at five different distances from the edge of the collimator using a spectrometer calibrated to measure light in the uv range 200 nm 400 nm and a radiometer with a maximum sensitivity at 254 nm the average intensity and petri factor values for the collimated 265 nm uvc leds were calculated over the circular area required to illuminate the coupons 3 cm in diameter as expected intensity increased as the distance between the spectrometer sensor and the uvc leds decreased the petri factor was high 0 9 and essentially uniform across the 3 cm diameter area irrespective of the distance between the spectrometer sensor and the uvc leds fig 1 shows the intensity of the light across the area of a 6 cm diameter petri dish the petri factors determined from the radiometer measurements were all above 0 89 and were similar to those determined with the spectrometer this was not the case for the measured intensities fig 2 shows the difference between the measured intensities from both measurement tools on average the radiometer intensity measurements were 43 less than those obtained using the spectrometer and the difference between the measurements were found to increase as the radiometer was moved closer to the collimator this difference can be partly explained by the smaller viewing angle of the radiometer relative to that of the spectrometer furthermore the dose calculations were calculated for a monochromatic light source such that the measured intensity was only corrected with the relative spectral responsivity of the radiometer at the peak wavelength rd f 0 75 relative spectral responsivity refers to the relative efficiency of the sensor at detecting light of different wavelengths if the measured intensity was corrected with a weighted relative spectral responsivity across the uv led spectrum 250 400 nm the correction factor was found to be 0 66 this change in the radiometer correction factor indicates that the intensities determined by the monochromatic calculations were underestimated by approximately 14 accounting for this underestimation reduces the difference between the two measurements however it does not account for all the difference or change the fact that the difference between the two instruments increases as the distance from the collimator decreases one implication of this is that the uv doses reported in previous surface disinfection studies that relied on uv radiometers may underestimate the actual uv dose delivered to the surface therefore the uv dose for all disinfection experiments in this study were determined using the spectrometer 3 2 method development biofilm growth treatment and recovery 3 2 1 uvc inactivation experiments a set of experiments was conducted to establish ideal uvc led treatment conditions including the number of coupons that could be treated at once and whether the coupons were rotated 5 rpm during uvc led exposure the results of the spectral characterization of the uv led apparatus indicated that particularly at short distances the light emitted by the uvc leds was fairly consistent across the coupon area but that it was not 100 uniform a rotating apparatus was built to ensure that the coupons were exposed to the same uv dose the average surface concentration of p aeruginosa and atpbr per unit area were determined for coupons exposed to 8 1 mj cm2 of 265 nm uvc led light at a distance of 3 cm from the base of the collimator which corresponded to a uv intensity of 0 0742 mw cm2 the results summarized in table 2 demonstrated that the treatment conditions had only a small impact on overall inactivation ranging from 1 4 0 3 log inactivation for coupons treated one at a time without rotation to 2 0 0 3 for coupons treated one at a time with rotation the plate count results were analyzed as a 2 2 factorial with three replicates n 12 at the 95 confidence level the analysis indicated that rotation significantly improved inactivation but that the number of coupons treated at a time did not have an impact on the extent of inactivation there were no significant interactions between rotation and number of coupons atp values were converted from pgcatp ml to pgcatp cm2 by multiplying the former by the volume of buffer used in biofilm resuspension 50 ml and dividing the resulting value by the surface area of one of the sides of the coupon 1 27 cm2 atpbr was only analyzed for the coupons that were exposed three at a time so a paired t test was performed to determine whether there was any statistically significant difference between the atpbr results from the coupons that were rotated during treatment and those that were kept stationary as with the plate count results there was a statistically significant difference between the coupons coupons that were rotated showed evidence of improved inactivation 3 2 2 biofilm recovery and resuspension a set of experiments was conducted to evaluate two biofilm recovery methods swabbing and scraping and four resuspension methods shaking vortexing stomaching and sonication the conditions used for each method were drawn from an earlier study gagnon and slawson 1999 swabbing a sterile cotton swab was rolled along entire face of coupon and swirled 10 s in 50 ml pbs repeated 5 times scraping a flame sterilized utility blade was pulled across the entire face of the coupon and swirled in pbs repeated 5 times control the sample was shaken vigorously for 30 s after adding biofilm to distribute it in resuspension fluid vortex the sample was vortexed for 2 min single pulse stomach the sample was stomached for 2 min using standard settings sonicate sample was sonicated for 2 min at 47 khz the vortexed stomached and sonicated suspensions were initially subjected to the control resuspension method before being mixed more intensely by one of these three advanced resuspension methods a two way anova was conducted to establish whether there were any significant differences in terms of organism recovery related to the different biofilm recovery and resuspension methods based on standard plate counts or atpbr swabbing was superior to scraping for biofilm recovery but the advanced resuspension methods had no effect compared to the control fig 3 there was no evidence of interactions between the recovery and suspension methods 3 2 3 summary of biofilm growth treatment and resuspension methods the method optimization experiments demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between coupons treated one at a time and those treated in groups of three the experiments also showed that the variability between samples could be reduced by rotating the samples during treatment swabbing was shown to be superior to scraping for the removal of biofilm from the coupons but there were no statistically significant differences between vigorous shaking vortexing stomaching and sonication for the resuspension of the bacteria in solution after removal from the coupons despite this last finding vortexing was chosen as the preferred resuspension method because it minimizes operator error a standardized methodology was developed based on these findings 1 grow p aeruginosa biofilms on sterile polycarbonate coupons according to the standard usepa protocol in a cdc reactor 2 carefully remove the coupons from the reactor and expose them to collimated uvc leds emitting light at 265 nm three at a time on a rotating platform for times corresponding to the desired uv doses 3 remove the biofilm from the treated coupons by swabbing 4 resuspend in appropriate media via vortexing 5 analyze the resuspended sample using heterotrophic plate counts atpbr analysis or other methods as appropriate for the experiments this recommended methodology is summarized in fig 4 3 3 inactivation of biofilm bound p aeruginosa with uv leds dose response curves based on log cfu reduction and atpbr reduction for p aeruginosa exposed to uvc led light at 265 nm are provided in fig 5 other researchers have reported that planktonic free floating p aeruginosa cells are easily inactivated by uvc led light at 265 nm for example rattankul and oguma 2018 reported that 2 mj cm2 of uv light could achieve approximately 1 log reduction of p aeruginosa while 4 mj cm2 achieved approximately 2 log inactivation the results of the dose response curve developed in this experiment indicate that biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells are more resistant to inactivation by uvc led light at 265 nm than planktonic cells in the current study a uv dose of 4 mj cm2 achieved only 0 9 0 2 log inactivation less than half that reported for this uv dose by rattankul and oguma likely because the biofilm afforded some level of protection to the cells embedded within it bak et al 2010 reported that they achieved 4 log reduction of biofilm bound p aeruginosa at a uv dose of 7 9 mj cm2 from a 265 nm uvc led which is well above the 1 3 0 2 log reduction that was observed at a uv dose of 8 mj cm2 in the current study in this case the discrepancy might be related to the methods used to quantify the uv dose in each study the chick watson model which assumes a log linear relationship between treatment level in this case uv dose and inactivation was not a good fit to the plate count and atpbr datasets because it did not account for the tailing of the data at higher uv doses this tailing behaviour biased the model such that it also consistently under predicted uv inactivation efficacy at lower uv doses one surprising finding of this study was the lack of shoulder at lower uv doses shoulders are commonly observed when the target microorganisms are not immediately destroyed by the treatment being applied the lack of shouldering observed in this study suggests that the ability of the microorganisms to reproduce and to create atp was quickly impacted by the uvc led treatment the multi target model which assumes an initial lag in inactivation followed by a linear relationship between treatment level and inactivation had the poorest fit to the plate count and atpbr datasets rmsepc 1 31 rmseatp 1 00 the geeraerd model had the lowest rmse for both the plate count results rmse 0 39 and the atpbr results rmse 0 40 indicating that it was the best fit to the observed data this is similar to results reported by rattanakul et al rattanakul and oguma 2018 for planktonic p aeruginosa cells this model assumes that some proportion of the microbial population is resistant to the treatment being applied due to intrinsic or external factors geeraerd et al 2000 in this study it is likely that the biofilm provided this resistance to treatment by protecting the cells from the uvc led treatment 3 4 effect of uv intensity on inactivation in theory the amount of inactivation achieved during uv disinfection should be a function both of the amount of light provided the uv dose as well as the intensity of that light its irradiance with greater inactivation expected at higher uv intensities a previous study completed sommer et al 1998 examined the effect uv intensity had on inactivation of e coli ms2 ψx174 b40 8 and b subtillis their study concluded that an additional 1 log reduction in e coli could be achieved with a high uv intensity 200 μw cm2 versus a lower one 2 μw cm2 but this effect was not observed for the other microorganisms studied fig 6 shows the log surface concentration of pseudomonas aeruginosa on coupons exposed to 8 1 mj cm2 of light from 265 nm uvc leds at various intensities in the current study the intensity of the light hitting the biofilm covered coupons was varied by placing the coupons at different distances from the collimator thus changing the average intensity of the light hitting the biofilm coated coupons the exposure time was varied to the ensure that all samples were exposed to the same uv dose 8 1 mj cm2 all of the treatment levels were significantly different from the control at a 95 confidence level indicating that irrespective of the intensity of the irradiated light the uv treatment was successful at inactivating some portion of the bacteria present in the biofilms there was less obvious variability between the treatments and the only statistically significant difference was between 53 μw cm2 and 97 μw cm2 this result though subtle is in line with the findings of previous studies sommer et al 1998 and justifies further investigation into the effects of uvc led intensity on microbial inactivation as with the plate count results the atpbr content of the biofilms recovered from the control and treated coupons was analyzed with a one way anova at the 95 confidence level although the biofilms recovered from all of the treated coupons created significantly less atp after the 4 h atpbr culturing step than those recovered from the control biofilms there were no significant differences in atp production observed in biofilms treated with different uv intensities irrespective of whether or not intensity had an effect on inactivation efficacy there are practical implications to the use of higher uv intensity for uvc led treatment of biofilms specifically less time is required to achieve a given dose of uv light at higher intensity in the experimental set up used in this study 1 4 min of irradiation were required to achieve a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 when the sample was located 1 5 mm from the base of the collimator uv intensity 97 μw cm2 but nearly 5 min would be required to achieve this same uv dose if the sample was located 10 cm from the base of the collimator fig 7 energy and cost estimates were developed assuming an overall irradiated surface area of 7 1 cm2 and a power cost of 0 15 kw the following equation was used to calculate the power required per unit area to achieve a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 7 power kwh c m 2 u v d o s e μ j c m 2 u v i n t e n s i t y μ w c m 2 p o w e r r e q u i r e d k w i r r a d i a t e d s u r f a c e a r e a c m 2 as illustrated in fig 7 the relationship between uv dose uv intensity and irradiation time has direct impacts on overall energy requirements and thus energy costs which increase with irradiation time the collimated beam apparatus used in this study had a power draw of 35 w but was equipped with early version uvc leds as such the energy per unit area values shown in fig 7 though correct for the apparatus used in this study overestimate the amount of energy that would be required to achieve a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 using current or future generations of uvc leds they do nonetheless illustrate the energy savings and associated cost savings that can be achieved by decreasing the distance between the sample and the light source thus increasing the intensity of the uvc light applied to the sample 3 5 relationship between atpbr results and plate counts as shown in fig 8 the atpbr results obtained using the biomass recovery atp method were highly correlated r2 0 93 to standard enumeration techniques indicating that this new method is likely to be appropriate for uv inactivation studies and applications this relationship has been shown to exist between heterotrophic plate count results and standard atp results for untreated samples deininger and lee 2001 delahaye et al 2003 and chlorinated samples linklater and örmeci 2014 but never before between standard plating methods and standard atp e g luminultra qga methods in a uv treatment application the results presented here confirm that atpbr is a useful parameter to predict the inactivation of microorganisms by uv light 4 conclusions a simple methodology was developed for the growth treatment recovery and resuspension of p aeruginosa biofilms for surface disinfection studies with uvc leds uvc leds emitting light at 265 nm were able to inactivate p aeruginosa in biofilms grown on polycarbonate coupons the uv dose required to achieve inactivation was higher than that reported by other researchers for planktonic p aeruginosa cells likely because the bacteria in the current study were partially protected from the uvc irradiation by the biofilm the geeraerd model for disinfection which assumes that some proportion of the microbial population is resistant to the treatment being applied was a good fit to the dose response data collected in this study the effect of intensity on the inactivation of p aeruginosa was clouded by variability but there was some evidence that higher intensities resulted in greater inactivation inactivation vs intensity effects may be more apparent at a larger uv dose and or over a larger range of intensities surface disinfection and biofilm mitigation are topics of interest in fields ranging from food safety to medicine to water treatment and the findings presented here lay the groundwork for future studies and product development in these and other industries declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

19061,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds are a promising technology for the disinfection of water and wetted surfaces but research into these applications remains limited in the drinking water field uv leds emitting at wavelengths ranging from 254 nm to 285 nm uvc leds have been shown to be effective for the inactivation of numerous pathogens and pathogen surrogate organisms at uv doses comparable to conventional germicidal uv lamps surface disinfection with uv light from uvc leds or from conventional uv lamps is not as well understood as the technology underlying the design and construction of uv leds matures and their energy efficiency improves it is likely that they will become ubiquitous in small scale water treatment applications and surface disinfection in various industries including the medical and dental fields a simple easily replicated methodology was developed and optimized to grow irradiate and recover biofilms from coupons it was hypothesized that higher uv doses would be required to inactivate biofilm bound bacteria than planktonic free floating bacteria because the biofilm would provide some degree of protection from the effects of uvc irradiation indeed uv led irradiation at 265 nm achieved 1 3 0 2 log inactivation of biofilm bound pseudomonas aeruginosa at a uv dose of 8 mj cm2 this inactivation level is lower than those that have been reported by researchers using uvc leds to inactivate planktonic p aeruginosa a finding that can be explained by the higher resistance of biofilm bound bacteria to uv inactivation a dose response curve was developed and fitted to three disinfection models the chick watson model the multi target model and the geeraerd model this last which posits a subpopulation of organisms that are resistant to treatment was a good fit to the dose response data atp results obtained using the biomass recovery atp method atpbr a method that includes a 4 h incubation period after treatment was well correlated to the results of conventional plate counts graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection biofilm uv light emitting diodes uv led 1 introduction light emitting diodes leds are semi conductor p n junction diodes that emit radiation at a single wavelength when a forward voltage is applied in recent years development in materials and manufacturing have allowed for the production of leds that emit in the uv spectrum 200 400 nm specifically uvc leds emitting in the germicidal range 220 nm 290 nm have created opportunities for disinfection applications as described by bolton and cotton 2008 mercury based uv lamps were first implemented for water purification in france in early 20th century but first operated in a consistent manner at full scale in 1955 and today are widely used for disinfection in many industries however these lamps require large amounts of energy contain hazardous materials and are bulky uv leds address some of these drawbacks by offering reduced power consumption environmental impact and size additionally uv leds can be produced at any wavelength which could help to target specific microorganisms of concern the benefits of uv led technology will provide a chance to rethink reactor designs and offer great potential for novel applications surface sterilization is a priority in industries ranging from health care to food preparation and storage as such studies evaluating the utility of uv light for surface disinfection have been published by researchers in many fields many of whom have focused on niche applications of relevance to specific industries in aggregate these studies provide useful information about the factors that are most likely to impact inactivation efficiency and point the way towards the effective application of uv light for surface disinfection a selection of these is summarized in table 1 many bacterial species can produce protective biofilms that help them attach to surface and resist environmental threats including chemical disinfectants and cell damaging irradiation the presence or absence of a biofilm can strongly affect the amount of uv irradiation required to inactivate microorganisms hadjok et al 2008 determined that approximately 38 mj cm2 was required to achieve 2 log inactivation of salmonella bacteria sprayed onto iceberg lettuce while bae and lee demonstrated that over 1000 mj cm2 of uv light was required to achieve the same amount of inactivation of salmonella present in biofilms attached to plastic and steel surfaces 2012 although these two studies were conducted in two separate fields food science vs medical and undoubtedly had many differences in experimental design their results suggest that a substantially higher amount uv light may be required to inactivate microorganisms protected by biofilms than those not protected by a biofilm as with planktonic microorganisms some surface bound microorganisms are more vulnerable to inactivation with uv light than others for example bae and lee showed that biofilm bound p aeruginosa was more vulnerable to uv irradiation at 254 nm than e coli and salmonella additionally pure cultures are more easily inactivated with uv light than wild indigenous bacterial communities found on surfaces a series of catheter focused experiments by bak et al 2009 2010 demonstrated that pure culture biofilms were more vulnerable to uv inactivation than indigenous mixed bacterial communities and that up to 250 times more uv irradiation was required to inactivate mature indigenous biofilm communities than pure culture bacteria in fresh biofilms finally some surfaces are more easily disinfected than others bae and lee 2012 showed that common food borne pathogens were more easily inactivated when they were attached to polypropylene surfaces than when they were attached to stainless steel surfaces the studies summarized in table 1 varied substantially in terms of experimental design and apparatus used which likely explains why some studies reported greater inactivation than others for the same microorganisms bak et al 2010 used a 265 nm uvc led light source for their experiments on pure cultures of p aeruginosa in biofilm but most of the other studies listed in table 1 used lpuv lamps with a peak emission wavelength of 254 nm studies conducted in the water treatment field e g rattanakul and oguma 2018 have suggested that some microorganisms are particularly sensitive to light at 265 nm which may help to explain why bak et al achieved such high inactivation rates in their 2010 study compared to the results of researchers applying uv light at 254 nm both wavelengths are within the action spectrum of biofilm bound p aeruginosa lakretz et al 2010 however so the variability may be associated with other experimental factors for example some studies made use of collimated beam apparatuses where the entire surface to be disinfected was exposed to the same amount of irradiation e g gardner and shama 1999 tseng and li 2007 but others e g bae and lee 2012 hadjok et al 2008 had to account for the uneven distribution of light over the samples the majority of these studies made use of standard uv radiometers calibrated to the peak wavelength s emitted by the uv light source but some made use of other methods such as biodosimetry to determine the uv dose directly gardner and shama 1999 the use of other methods other then radiometry e g chemical actinometry biodosimetry and spectrometry may prove better for dose determination of uv led systems as they are better suited for measuring energy outputs across the uv spectrum 2 methods and materials 2 1 uv led apparatus all uv inactivation experiments were conducted with a uvc led collimated beam apparatus aquisense technologies the apparatus consists of a light holder equipped with uvc leds that emit light at 255 nm 265 nm or 285 nm all of the experiments were conducted at with the 265 nm uvc leds which have a peak wavelength of 268 nm and a full width at half maximum of 11 5 nm the power draw of the collimated beam apparatus during the experiments was 35 w including 265 nm uvc leds fan etc light from the leds is directed to the sample holder via a collimator intensity profiles were collected for the collimated beam using a usb4000 spectrometer ocean optics inc fl usa the spectrometer uses a fibre optic with an active diameter of 3900 μm a grating of 600 lines blazed at 300 nm a slit size of 25 and uses a det4 200 850 detector profiles were collected over a 6 6 cm square grid with a spatial resolution of 0 5 cm at 1 5 3 5 and 7 cm from the edge of the 22 cm collimator a rectangular method was used to determine the intensity of the entire uv led spectrum from 250 to 400 nm integration time for each point was 5 s and 3 scans were used to smooth the curve intensity distribution profiles were also developed using an international light technologies ilt1400 radiometer measurements were collected over a 5 5 cm square grid with a 1 cm spatial resolution at distances of 1 5 3 5 and 7 cm from the edge of the 22 cm collimator readings at each location along the grid were taken as 60 s averages and corrected for the sensitivity of the radiometer with respect to the peak wavelength of the uvc led 2 2 uvc led inactivation experiments all experiments were conducted with a lab grade strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 an opportunistic pathogen that can be found in premise plumbing e g bédard et al 2016 falkinham et al 2015 and is widely used in biofilm studies due to its ability to easily grow under a wide range of environmental conditions bjarnsholt 2013 p aeruginosa biofilm was grown on clear polycarbonate coupons in a centers for disease control and prevention cdc biofilm reactor model cbr 90 1 biosurface technologies corp bozeman mt according to the usepa s standard operating procedure for growing p aeruginosa biofilm in a cdc biofilm reactor us enviromental protection agency office of pesticide programs 2013 a 1 ml volume of p aeruginosa inoculum was added to the reactor which contained 500 ml of a solution of 300 mg l tsb and stirred continuously at 250 rpm the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 23 1 c in batch conditions for 24 1 h following this initial growth period the reactor was switched to flow through mode and a continuous stream of 100 mg l tsb was passed through the reactor at a rate of approximately 10 ml min for an additional 24 1 h the development of standardized procedures for biofilm inactivation extraction and analysis was one of the goals of this project and the evolution of this procedure is described in detail in the results section of this paper coupons were exposed to uvc irradiation at 265 nm for times ranging from 0 to 60 min after treatment the biofilm was recovered from the coupons homogenized using a vortex and analyzed using standard plate counts standard plate count was performed using tryptic soy agar tsa with an incubation time of 16 24 h at 37 c as recommended by the usepa s standard operating procedure for growing p aeruginosa biofilm in a cdc biofilm reactor us enviromental protection agency office of pesticide programs 2013 adenosine triphosphate atp is a molecule produced by living cells during metabolic processes the atp content of a water sample is therefore a measure of the biological activity occurring within the sample the effectiveness of uv treatment can be difficult to characterize using standard atp analyses because unlike physical removal or chemical disinfection processes uv light renders microorganisms incapable of replicating rather than removing or killing them outright the inactivated cells continue to create atp during their normal metabolic activities making it difficult to establish the extent of inactivation to avoid this problem the biomass recovery atp method described by rauch et al 2018 and used in this study includes a 4 h grow out period after treatment after which the sample is analyzed using a standard atp test cells that have not been inactivated by the treatment will continue to replicate during the 4 h grow out period while those that have been inactivated will not the resulting atp measurement which is referred to as atpbr throughout this paper to distinguish it from atp measurements made on samples that have not been subjected to the 4 h grow out procedure is compared to a control that has also been allowed to grow out for 4 h the difference between the two samples is correlated to the amount of inactivation caused by the uv treatment rauch et al 2018 in this study an aliquot of the uvc led treated biofilm was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution pbs added to a culture media in a ratio of 1 10 and incubated for 4 h this culture was then sampled and analyzed for intracellular atp using luminultra s standard quench gone aqueous qga test luminultra 2017 2 2 1 data analysis and calculations 2 2 1 1 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted at the 95 confidence level error bars correspond to the 95 confidence interval on the mean unless otherwise noted 2 2 1 2 determination of uvc led intensity petri factors and dose average intensities and petri factors were determined for different treatment areas defined by the surface area required to accommodate different numbers of coupons intensity values were measured by two means to compare radiometers and spectrometers as measurement tools for uvc leds petri factors were for only the radiometer dose calculations by determining the average intensity over the profile of the treatment fields and then dividing by the centre value the exposure times to achieve the selected uv doses were determined by first calculating or measuring the actual intensity of the uvc led at the surface of the coupons this was competed for each of the 5 distances between the collimator and coupon surface the actual intensity was determined by two methods depending on the measurement tool being used when using the radiometer a modified version of the monochromatic bolton method was used bolton and linden 2003 the radiometer was used to determine the intensity at centre of the collimator which was then inputted into equation 1 to determine the actual intensity of the leds 1 i a c t i 0 p f r d f where iact is the actual intensity at the surface of the coupons in mw cm2 i0 is the measured intensity using the radiometer in mw cm2 p f is the petri factor and rd f is the radiometer responsivity correction factor at the peak wavelength of the uv led 0 75 when using the spectrometer the actual intensity iact was determined as the measured intensity over the treatment field of the coupons equation 2 was used to determine the required exposure times for both measurement tools 2 t e x p d i a c t where iact is the actual intensity over the treatment field 2 3 disinfection models the uv dose response data gathered in this study was fitted to three disinfection models the chick watson model the multi target model and the geeraerd model the chick watson model assumes a log linear response and pseudo first order behaviour between the uv dose applied and the extent of microbial inactivation 3 n t n o 10 k d where nt is the microbial population at time t no is the original microbial population k is the inactivation rate constant and d is the uv dose applied the multi target model expands upon the chick watson model to account for the shoulder that can develop in the dose response curve when multiple hits of the disinfection treatment are required to inactivate the microorganisms 4 n t n o 1 1 10 k d n c the geeraerd model was originally developed to better characterize non log linear behaviour observed during the mild heat sterilization treatment of food products geeraerd et al 2000 this model differs from the other two models applied in this study because it assumes that some portion of the microbial population is resistant to the treatment being applied in its original form the model incorporates two additional parameters the shoulder length t1 and a resistant population of microorganisms nres rattanakul and oguma 2018 used an adapted version of this model to characterize the inactivation of p aeruginosa and other microorganisms by uv leds in some cases including the current study there is no evidence of a shoulder and the model simplifies to 5 n t n o n r e s e k d n r e s ginafit an excel plug in developed by geeraerd et al 2005 was used to solve for k and nres the goodness of fit of the three disinfection models used in this study was evaluated based on the root mean squared error rmse between the predicted and observed log inactivation values 6 r m s e i 1 n l i p r e d l i o b s 2 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of uv led apparatus the average intensity and petri factor of the light emitted by the led apparatus was determined at five different distances from the edge of the collimator using a spectrometer calibrated to measure light in the uv range 200 nm 400 nm and a radiometer with a maximum sensitivity at 254 nm the average intensity and petri factor values for the collimated 265 nm uvc leds were calculated over the circular area required to illuminate the coupons 3 cm in diameter as expected intensity increased as the distance between the spectrometer sensor and the uvc leds decreased the petri factor was high 0 9 and essentially uniform across the 3 cm diameter area irrespective of the distance between the spectrometer sensor and the uvc leds fig 1 shows the intensity of the light across the area of a 6 cm diameter petri dish the petri factors determined from the radiometer measurements were all above 0 89 and were similar to those determined with the spectrometer this was not the case for the measured intensities fig 2 shows the difference between the measured intensities from both measurement tools on average the radiometer intensity measurements were 43 less than those obtained using the spectrometer and the difference between the measurements were found to increase as the radiometer was moved closer to the collimator this difference can be partly explained by the smaller viewing angle of the radiometer relative to that of the spectrometer furthermore the dose calculations were calculated for a monochromatic light source such that the measured intensity was only corrected with the relative spectral responsivity of the radiometer at the peak wavelength rd f 0 75 relative spectral responsivity refers to the relative efficiency of the sensor at detecting light of different wavelengths if the measured intensity was corrected with a weighted relative spectral responsivity across the uv led spectrum 250 400 nm the correction factor was found to be 0 66 this change in the radiometer correction factor indicates that the intensities determined by the monochromatic calculations were underestimated by approximately 14 accounting for this underestimation reduces the difference between the two measurements however it does not account for all the difference or change the fact that the difference between the two instruments increases as the distance from the collimator decreases one implication of this is that the uv doses reported in previous surface disinfection studies that relied on uv radiometers may underestimate the actual uv dose delivered to the surface therefore the uv dose for all disinfection experiments in this study were determined using the spectrometer 3 2 method development biofilm growth treatment and recovery 3 2 1 uvc inactivation experiments a set of experiments was conducted to establish ideal uvc led treatment conditions including the number of coupons that could be treated at once and whether the coupons were rotated 5 rpm during uvc led exposure the results of the spectral characterization of the uv led apparatus indicated that particularly at short distances the light emitted by the uvc leds was fairly consistent across the coupon area but that it was not 100 uniform a rotating apparatus was built to ensure that the coupons were exposed to the same uv dose the average surface concentration of p aeruginosa and atpbr per unit area were determined for coupons exposed to 8 1 mj cm2 of 265 nm uvc led light at a distance of 3 cm from the base of the collimator which corresponded to a uv intensity of 0 0742 mw cm2 the results summarized in table 2 demonstrated that the treatment conditions had only a small impact on overall inactivation ranging from 1 4 0 3 log inactivation for coupons treated one at a time without rotation to 2 0 0 3 for coupons treated one at a time with rotation the plate count results were analyzed as a 2 2 factorial with three replicates n 12 at the 95 confidence level the analysis indicated that rotation significantly improved inactivation but that the number of coupons treated at a time did not have an impact on the extent of inactivation there were no significant interactions between rotation and number of coupons atp values were converted from pgcatp ml to pgcatp cm2 by multiplying the former by the volume of buffer used in biofilm resuspension 50 ml and dividing the resulting value by the surface area of one of the sides of the coupon 1 27 cm2 atpbr was only analyzed for the coupons that were exposed three at a time so a paired t test was performed to determine whether there was any statistically significant difference between the atpbr results from the coupons that were rotated during treatment and those that were kept stationary as with the plate count results there was a statistically significant difference between the coupons coupons that were rotated showed evidence of improved inactivation 3 2 2 biofilm recovery and resuspension a set of experiments was conducted to evaluate two biofilm recovery methods swabbing and scraping and four resuspension methods shaking vortexing stomaching and sonication the conditions used for each method were drawn from an earlier study gagnon and slawson 1999 swabbing a sterile cotton swab was rolled along entire face of coupon and swirled 10 s in 50 ml pbs repeated 5 times scraping a flame sterilized utility blade was pulled across the entire face of the coupon and swirled in pbs repeated 5 times control the sample was shaken vigorously for 30 s after adding biofilm to distribute it in resuspension fluid vortex the sample was vortexed for 2 min single pulse stomach the sample was stomached for 2 min using standard settings sonicate sample was sonicated for 2 min at 47 khz the vortexed stomached and sonicated suspensions were initially subjected to the control resuspension method before being mixed more intensely by one of these three advanced resuspension methods a two way anova was conducted to establish whether there were any significant differences in terms of organism recovery related to the different biofilm recovery and resuspension methods based on standard plate counts or atpbr swabbing was superior to scraping for biofilm recovery but the advanced resuspension methods had no effect compared to the control fig 3 there was no evidence of interactions between the recovery and suspension methods 3 2 3 summary of biofilm growth treatment and resuspension methods the method optimization experiments demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between coupons treated one at a time and those treated in groups of three the experiments also showed that the variability between samples could be reduced by rotating the samples during treatment swabbing was shown to be superior to scraping for the removal of biofilm from the coupons but there were no statistically significant differences between vigorous shaking vortexing stomaching and sonication for the resuspension of the bacteria in solution after removal from the coupons despite this last finding vortexing was chosen as the preferred resuspension method because it minimizes operator error a standardized methodology was developed based on these findings 1 grow p aeruginosa biofilms on sterile polycarbonate coupons according to the standard usepa protocol in a cdc reactor 2 carefully remove the coupons from the reactor and expose them to collimated uvc leds emitting light at 265 nm three at a time on a rotating platform for times corresponding to the desired uv doses 3 remove the biofilm from the treated coupons by swabbing 4 resuspend in appropriate media via vortexing 5 analyze the resuspended sample using heterotrophic plate counts atpbr analysis or other methods as appropriate for the experiments this recommended methodology is summarized in fig 4 3 3 inactivation of biofilm bound p aeruginosa with uv leds dose response curves based on log cfu reduction and atpbr reduction for p aeruginosa exposed to uvc led light at 265 nm are provided in fig 5 other researchers have reported that planktonic free floating p aeruginosa cells are easily inactivated by uvc led light at 265 nm for example rattankul and oguma 2018 reported that 2 mj cm2 of uv light could achieve approximately 1 log reduction of p aeruginosa while 4 mj cm2 achieved approximately 2 log inactivation the results of the dose response curve developed in this experiment indicate that biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells are more resistant to inactivation by uvc led light at 265 nm than planktonic cells in the current study a uv dose of 4 mj cm2 achieved only 0 9 0 2 log inactivation less than half that reported for this uv dose by rattankul and oguma likely because the biofilm afforded some level of protection to the cells embedded within it bak et al 2010 reported that they achieved 4 log reduction of biofilm bound p aeruginosa at a uv dose of 7 9 mj cm2 from a 265 nm uvc led which is well above the 1 3 0 2 log reduction that was observed at a uv dose of 8 mj cm2 in the current study in this case the discrepancy might be related to the methods used to quantify the uv dose in each study the chick watson model which assumes a log linear relationship between treatment level in this case uv dose and inactivation was not a good fit to the plate count and atpbr datasets because it did not account for the tailing of the data at higher uv doses this tailing behaviour biased the model such that it also consistently under predicted uv inactivation efficacy at lower uv doses one surprising finding of this study was the lack of shoulder at lower uv doses shoulders are commonly observed when the target microorganisms are not immediately destroyed by the treatment being applied the lack of shouldering observed in this study suggests that the ability of the microorganisms to reproduce and to create atp was quickly impacted by the uvc led treatment the multi target model which assumes an initial lag in inactivation followed by a linear relationship between treatment level and inactivation had the poorest fit to the plate count and atpbr datasets rmsepc 1 31 rmseatp 1 00 the geeraerd model had the lowest rmse for both the plate count results rmse 0 39 and the atpbr results rmse 0 40 indicating that it was the best fit to the observed data this is similar to results reported by rattanakul et al rattanakul and oguma 2018 for planktonic p aeruginosa cells this model assumes that some proportion of the microbial population is resistant to the treatment being applied due to intrinsic or external factors geeraerd et al 2000 in this study it is likely that the biofilm provided this resistance to treatment by protecting the cells from the uvc led treatment 3 4 effect of uv intensity on inactivation in theory the amount of inactivation achieved during uv disinfection should be a function both of the amount of light provided the uv dose as well as the intensity of that light its irradiance with greater inactivation expected at higher uv intensities a previous study completed sommer et al 1998 examined the effect uv intensity had on inactivation of e coli ms2 ψx174 b40 8 and b subtillis their study concluded that an additional 1 log reduction in e coli could be achieved with a high uv intensity 200 μw cm2 versus a lower one 2 μw cm2 but this effect was not observed for the other microorganisms studied fig 6 shows the log surface concentration of pseudomonas aeruginosa on coupons exposed to 8 1 mj cm2 of light from 265 nm uvc leds at various intensities in the current study the intensity of the light hitting the biofilm covered coupons was varied by placing the coupons at different distances from the collimator thus changing the average intensity of the light hitting the biofilm coated coupons the exposure time was varied to the ensure that all samples were exposed to the same uv dose 8 1 mj cm2 all of the treatment levels were significantly different from the control at a 95 confidence level indicating that irrespective of the intensity of the irradiated light the uv treatment was successful at inactivating some portion of the bacteria present in the biofilms there was less obvious variability between the treatments and the only statistically significant difference was between 53 μw cm2 and 97 μw cm2 this result though subtle is in line with the findings of previous studies sommer et al 1998 and justifies further investigation into the effects of uvc led intensity on microbial inactivation as with the plate count results the atpbr content of the biofilms recovered from the control and treated coupons was analyzed with a one way anova at the 95 confidence level although the biofilms recovered from all of the treated coupons created significantly less atp after the 4 h atpbr culturing step than those recovered from the control biofilms there were no significant differences in atp production observed in biofilms treated with different uv intensities irrespective of whether or not intensity had an effect on inactivation efficacy there are practical implications to the use of higher uv intensity for uvc led treatment of biofilms specifically less time is required to achieve a given dose of uv light at higher intensity in the experimental set up used in this study 1 4 min of irradiation were required to achieve a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 when the sample was located 1 5 mm from the base of the collimator uv intensity 97 μw cm2 but nearly 5 min would be required to achieve this same uv dose if the sample was located 10 cm from the base of the collimator fig 7 energy and cost estimates were developed assuming an overall irradiated surface area of 7 1 cm2 and a power cost of 0 15 kw the following equation was used to calculate the power required per unit area to achieve a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 7 power kwh c m 2 u v d o s e μ j c m 2 u v i n t e n s i t y μ w c m 2 p o w e r r e q u i r e d k w i r r a d i a t e d s u r f a c e a r e a c m 2 as illustrated in fig 7 the relationship between uv dose uv intensity and irradiation time has direct impacts on overall energy requirements and thus energy costs which increase with irradiation time the collimated beam apparatus used in this study had a power draw of 35 w but was equipped with early version uvc leds as such the energy per unit area values shown in fig 7 though correct for the apparatus used in this study overestimate the amount of energy that would be required to achieve a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 using current or future generations of uvc leds they do nonetheless illustrate the energy savings and associated cost savings that can be achieved by decreasing the distance between the sample and the light source thus increasing the intensity of the uvc light applied to the sample 3 5 relationship between atpbr results and plate counts as shown in fig 8 the atpbr results obtained using the biomass recovery atp method were highly correlated r2 0 93 to standard enumeration techniques indicating that this new method is likely to be appropriate for uv inactivation studies and applications this relationship has been shown to exist between heterotrophic plate count results and standard atp results for untreated samples deininger and lee 2001 delahaye et al 2003 and chlorinated samples linklater and örmeci 2014 but never before between standard plating methods and standard atp e g luminultra qga methods in a uv treatment application the results presented here confirm that atpbr is a useful parameter to predict the inactivation of microorganisms by uv light 4 conclusions a simple methodology was developed for the growth treatment recovery and resuspension of p aeruginosa biofilms for surface disinfection studies with uvc leds uvc leds emitting light at 265 nm were able to inactivate p aeruginosa in biofilms grown on polycarbonate coupons the uv dose required to achieve inactivation was higher than that reported by other researchers for planktonic p aeruginosa cells likely because the bacteria in the current study were partially protected from the uvc irradiation by the biofilm the geeraerd model for disinfection which assumes that some proportion of the microbial population is resistant to the treatment being applied was a good fit to the dose response data collected in this study the effect of intensity on the inactivation of p aeruginosa was clouded by variability but there was some evidence that higher intensities resulted in greater inactivation inactivation vs intensity effects may be more apparent at a larger uv dose and or over a larger range of intensities surface disinfection and biofilm mitigation are topics of interest in fields ranging from food safety to medicine to water treatment and the findings presented here lay the

introduction the textile industry is one of the greatest and complicated industries in the world the more technology of these industries goes forward the more complicated is the wastewater which is

technique in predicting complex processes numerical methods involve finite difference method fdm finite element method fem finite volume method fvm and lattice boltzmann method lbm fvm can be introduced as the most applicable method anderson and wendt 1995 elyasi and taghipour 2010 versteeg and malalasekera 1995 there are a few studies on cfd simulation of aops in all of the investigations the direct effect of hydrodynamic had been neglected in the controlling reaction rates of the process and moreover there is not peer reviewed research in the simulation of heterogeneous fenton process alpert et al 2010 boyjoo et al 2013 chuang et al 2016 lopes and quinta ferreira 2010 mohajerani et al 2010 santoro et al 2017 verbruggen et al 2015 the rationale behind this issue is the costly and time consuming trait of modeling heterogeneous processes in this study we have scaled up both fluidized bed and stirred tank reactors simultaneously and we have extended this approach to pilot scale moreover for approaching these reactors to industrial applications we have assessed the advantages and disadvantages of them by both experiments and computational fluid dynamics cfd model for both of the reactors a modified cfd model of heterogeneous fenton process has been developed for the first time the experiments confirmed the cfd model with high precision by reaching to this cfd model there is no need to carry out any experiments which makes it cost effective and time saving in addition we can easily interpret some difficult issues about the results via developed cfd model furthermore firstly a new parameter named mixing rate has been introduced in this study importing this rate to the modified cfd model has made it more precise and reliable for instance evaluating the ph changes during the process has become possible by using this developed cfd model approximately in the all of the previous conventional modeling studies the ph changes during aops has been neglected to the best of our knowledge there is not any investigation to compare two kinds of reactors for aops also they have conducted their experiments in laboratory scale 2 experimental details 2 1 material h 2 o 2 h 2 s o 4 and n a o h were obtained from merck germany as mentioned ay36 is a prevalent textile color that is classified as an azo dye malik 2003 it is provided from boyakhsaz iran in this study the natural ironstone that has been utilized as a catalyst was pyrite that was prepared from songun copper mine in azarbayjan iran 2 2 analysis characterization of pyrite has been investigated by using x ray diffraction xrd method d 5000 siemens germany for studying morphology and the size of the catalysts scanning electron microscopy sem method was carried out fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra of pyrite have been recorded on ft ir spectrophotometer bruker tensor 27 germany with kbr pellets for analyzing ay36 concentration uv spectrophotometer shimadzu has been used in the range of visible wavelengths the maximum wavelength for ay36 had been found at 460 nm by relating the absorbance with the concentration of ay36 a calibration curve provided for finding out the concentration value it has been depicted in fig 1 2 3 experimental procedure as mentioned before in this study the heterogeneous fenton process has been operated in stirred tank and fluidized bed reactors which has been demonstrated in fig 2 stirred tank reactor contains a tank with a stainless steel stirrer inside it fluidized bed reactor contains cylindrical reactor pump reservoir pipes and fitting a distributor is located at the bottom of the reactor to make developed flow inside the reactor it has been made of stainless steel to prevent interfering the distributor in the reaction the stirred tank and the fluidized bed reactors are 20 cm and 6 cm in diameter and 40 cm and 100 cm in height respectively the catalysts pyrite were sieved 600 μm and maintained in an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min in the presence of 95 ethanol and after that they were washed off by deionized water to remove the surface impurities these catalysts were poured on the distributor the inlet and outlet of the reactor are connected to the pump and reservoir by plastic tubes respectively a rotameter has been placed after the pump to control the flow rate of the effluent the effluent pumps inside the reactor and fluidizes the catalysts uniformly from this moment the reaction begins the products and reactants pass the reactor and pours into the reservoir this cycle will continue until reaching to the maximum contaminant degradation value it should be mentioned that there are various efficient parameters that affect on this process such as the initial dye concentration mg l ph value of the effluent initial concentration of h 2 o 2 mmol l catalyst dosage g l the optimum amounts for these parameters obtained through our last investigation by means of central composite design method 2 mmol l h 2 o 2 10 mg l initial concentration of dye ph 3 1 g l pyrite aghdasinia et al 2016b the required amount of h 2 o 2 was injected into the reservoir and for controlling the initial ph value n a o h and h 2 s o 4 were used before starting the process of the pilot system 3 cfd modeling 3 1 governing equations velocities and mass fractions of the species in three dimensions were governed by continuity momentum and mass balance equations these equations are indicated in below forms 1 α q ρ q t α q ρ q u q p 1 n m p q 2 α q ρ q u q t α q ρ q u q u q α q p α q ρ q g τ q p 1 n r p q m p q u

α ρ y and u are volume fraction density mass fraction and velocity vector of diverse phases q and i indexes represent phase and species numbers respectively bird et al 2007 in equation 1 the term on the rhs shows mass interface exchange between the phases the fourth term on the rhs of equation 2 indicates interface forces and mass exchanges between phases and the fifth one declares the external forces like lift drag virtual mass etc the first to fourth terms on the rhs of equation 3 define respectively diffusion homogeneous reactions homogeneous productions and heterogeneous reactions arrhenius model has been used for all the reactions these equations were discretized and solved contemporaneously for this process this model contains two phases the first one is solid phase pyrite and the second one is aqueous phase such as water ay 36 radicals etc aforementioned equations are solved for both phases hence they include the reaction between two phases which is named as heterogeneous reaction 3 2 boundary conditions in all of the computational fluid dynamics methods boundary condition plays an important role to enhance the convergence and accuracy of the solution the geometry of the computational domains of both reactors is demonstrated in fig 2 as shown conical distributer has been placed at the bottom of the fluidized bed reactor and the inlet and the outlet of the flow of effluent are demonstrated in this figure the mass flow inlet is 13 l min and the optimum amounts of operational parameters which have been mentioned in the last sections were adjusted to the inlet boundary condition the side surface of the reactor has been considered as a rigid wall and no slip boundary condition is assumed to the walls of this reactor all the components which exit the reactor from the outlet zone are recirculated to the inlet of the reactor in this system eddy and turbulence have a crucial role consequently k ε model have been employed as a turbulence model to approach the results of the simulation to the practical results wilcox 1998 3 3 numerical method the geometry of the problem is designed and has been meshed by gambit and the governing equations have been solved by ansys fluent software with the basis of finite volume method in the meshed computational domain in unsteady state problem for an incompressible fluid pressure based solving algorithm is appropriate accordingly this approach has been utilized for solving the governing equations for having good stability of the solution first order implicit discretization has been adjusted to the transient formulation node base solving is used to store pressure velocity and mole fraction of the species for coupling pressure and velocity parameters phase coupled simple algorithm has been chosen anderson and wendt 1995 versteeg and malalasekera 1995 the convective terms of the equations in the first set of all runs are discretized by first order and in the next set second order and quick methods have been utilized diffusion terms are discretized by green gauss method that is proper as far as other methods anderson and wendt 1995 versteeg and malalasekera 1995 eventually the convergence of the solution has been adjudicated by residuals lower than 10 6 it should be mentioned that for the stirred tank reactor moving reference frame mrf method has been used in this method the computational zone contains two different zones the internal one encompasses the stirrer of the reactor and the other contains the rest of the reactor by introducing a rotational velocity to the internal zone instead of stirrer this process is simulated in a way that the stirrer is stable and the computational zone is rotating around the stirrer in this kind of numerical studies certainly the solution depends on the size of the grids therefore the grid independence investigation has been carried out by considering three different grid numbers that have been shown in table 2 these results declare that the percentage difference between case 2 and 3 for the turbulent kinetic rate for both reactors is about 0 3 consequently case 2 has been preferred to be utilized for the rest of the simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis results sem xrd and ft ir results are exhibited in the figs 3 5 respectively sem pictures indicate micro pore and the roughness of the pyrite surface which helps to have more contact area with the various components in xrd analysis the peaks appeared at 2θ values of 28ᵒ 33ᵒ 37ᵒ 40ᵒ 47ᵒ 56ᵒ 59ᵒ 62ᵒ and 64ᵒ which correspond to the 111 200 210 211 220 311 222 023 and 321 reflection planes of pyrite jcpds file no 42 1340 xrd pattern matches up with the standard xrd analysis of pyrite which confirms the cubic and crystalized structure of the pyrite liu et al 2013 ft ir result demonstrates some vibrations in distinct wavenumbers f e s f e o o h f e s o 4 o h vibrations are apparent in this analysis with their wavenumbers chernyshova 2003 2004 reyes bozo et al 2015 the main result of ft ir is the same vibrations of pyrite after and before the tests it shows that there are not any physical and chemical changes during the process another issue that could be concluded from ft ir analysis is the effect of adsorption in ay36 elimination the adsorption of the contaminants by pyrite does not play any roles in the elimination of the contaminants otherwise we would confronted with advent of new peaks in other wavelength numbers in fig 5b for confirming ft ir results another experiment has been designed by adding a quenching reagent in the beginning of the process to the effluent without addition of excess h 2 o 2 the reaction between dissolved oxygen and ferrous iron associated with pyrite via haber weiss reaction mechanism can form superoxide anion o 2 and then superoxide anion reacts with h to form h 2 o 2 eqs 4 and 5 farshchi et al 2018 hao et al 2014 schoonen et al 2006 4 f e p y r i t e 2 o 2 f e 3 o 2 5 f e p y r i t e 2 o 2 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 as mentioned before hydroxyl free radicals are highly reactive species that can easily have a reaction with organic substances if there were adequate quenching reagents inside of the effluent at first o h would react with them instead of reacting with the dye or other contaminants hence by adding quenching reagents o h will not have any opportunity to have reaction with ay36 in this experiment methanol as a hydroxyl quenching reagent has been added to the effluent with initial dye concentration of 50 mg l fig 6 shows that without adding surplus h 2 o 2 the rate of dye degradation is low about 50 percent after 6 h because pyrite has a low capacity to form h 2 o 2 eqs 4 and 5 moreover in presence of quenching reagent aforementioned low degradation of pyrite approaches to approximately 2 percent adsorption phenomenon can only be responsible for this 2 percent removal of dye which reveals negligible role of adsorption in this process 4 2 experimental results the rationale for degradation of dye and other contaminants is hydroxyl radicals o h o h attacks to the organic species and mineralizes them o h has a very high potential to react with other species fig 7 demonstrates the removal ratio of ay36 during the process for four different initial dye concentrations in both stirred tank and fluidized bed reactors as the process time goes on the slope of the removal graph decrease because at the beginning of the process there were more ay36 to react with o h in other words the rate of the degradation is decreasing by the development of the process this is true for both reactors but as fig 7 shows for the fluidized bed reactor the rate of the degradation is higher than the stirred tank reactor this issue is due to the characterization of the reactors the turbulence of fluidized bed reactor is higher than stirred one so the catalysts have more chance to be in contact with other species another significant result which can be concluded from fig 7 is that in one hour process time the removal ratio of fluidized bed reactor is higher than the stirred tank because in this process the main reason for the radical production is r1 in table 1 so that r1 occurs just in a situation that catalysts exist in the stirred tank reactor catalysts are in all over the fluid domain therefore o h reacts with each other in addition of reacting with ay36 which results in reduction of removal rate of ay36 on the other hand in a fluidized bed reactor the catalysts are submerged in the bottom of the reactor so that on the top of the reactor excess h 2 o 2 which has not reacted with f e 2 has more chance to back to the reactor in other words in the stirred tank reactors the excess h 2 o 2 decompose to o h by r1 and due to the high activity of this species the excess o h reacts with the other component except for ay36 r2 r8 r13 r14 r15 and r17 in table 1 these results will be more discussed in the simulation results and the results will be interpreted in details in the next sections fig 8 exhibits the change of ph during the process for both reactors the limiting reaction in fenton process is r1 in table 1 which starts the process one of the products of this reaction is o h so it is apparent that by the progress of the process ph value increases if the ph plot was divided into three different sections in the first section we confront with low incline of the lines because in the beginning of the process when the ph is low enough ph 3 oxidizing of pyrite cause production of h on the other hand the main reaction r1 produces o h whereas the dominant reaction is the fenton reaction hence o h concentration overcomes h concentration nevertheless in the second section as ph increases the oxidizing of pyrite decreases so that h concentration decreases and the ph grows with the higher incline in the third section most of h 2 o 2 have been utilized so there is not any production of o h therefore ph values stop increasing and remains at a constant value ph changes for both of the reactors behave in the same way and the results are approximately similar to each other because o h is produced in the all of the 18 reactions and it is not consumed in another reaction so that unlike free radicals characteristics of the reactors do not affect on ph value moreover it should be mentioned that in some cases which there is ample amount of h 2 o 2 ph will be decreased violently in a little period of process time because the excess amount of it would participate in side reactions like r8 r9 and r10 which triggers a sudden decrement in ph value by producing h zhang et al 2014 in the next section these results are discussed in detail from the stand point of cfd 4 3 cfd results simulation of this process has been assessed from two aspects hydrodynamic and chemical evaluations cfd computational domain of the reactors was exhibited in fig 2 4 3 1 hydrodynamic evaluation to study the effects of flow rate in the reactors residence time distribution rtd is used pulse injection is performed at the inlet of fluidized bed reactor where the steady state of bulk flow had already been reached the response of the tracer at the outlet was recorded using cfd and also by analyzing it experimentally by using uv spectrophotometer by using the following functions equations 6 9 rtd has been obtained for both experiment and simulation 6 e t c t 0 c t dt 7 τ 0 te t d t 8 θ t τ 9 e θ τ e t t c τ θ e t and e θ denote time concentration of tracer mean residence time dimensionless time normalized distribution function and dimensionless normalized distribution function respectively fogler 2016 fig 9 shows rtd of the fluidized bed reactor simulation result has a good agreement with the experiment furthermore mean residence time has been calculated and is shown in table 3 based on the definition of the dimensionless normalized distribution function the surface area of e θ must equal 1 as is indicated in table 3 the experimental and cfd results confirm this issue it should be mentioned that rtd is significant for the reactors which contain the flow hence rtd analysis had been carried out just for the fluidized bed reactor fig 10 shows the velocity vectors for both reactors as expected in stirred tank reactor vortexes are formed at the four side of the stirrer that causes the formation of dead zones inside the reactor and fig 10a confirms it as is exhibited in the fluidized bed reactor there are not dead zones inside the reactor image processing of the heterogeneous catalysis pyrite in the fluid is another analysis that has been carried out to validate the hydrodynamic of reactors by taking pictures from the pilot reactors in special times and processing the picture with matlab software 2013 we could find out the exact locations of pyrite inside the reactor at that special time the volume fraction contour of pyrite has been obtained from the simulation in a special time of the image processing these results are demonstrated in fig 11 it is clear that image processing of the experiment and the simulation are similar in results as mentioned beforehand the bed height is measured from the bottom of the reactors the stirred tank and the fluidized bed reactors are 20 cm and 6 cm in diameter respectively in addition the volume fraction of pyrite as a representative for the movement of pyrite inside the reactor has been animated and is accessible in animation 1 and animation 2 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 12 011 the following are the supplementary data related to this article fbr fbr str str 4 3 2 chemical evaluation in cfd method momentum equation is solved in conjunction with mass balances between all species the last term in equation 3 includes the reactions between involved components in the process the main difference between kinetic modeling and cfd modeling is the momentum equation which could expect the location and the velocity of each component figs 12 and 13 indicate the contour of various parameters in the stirred tank and fluidized bed reactors respectively as shown in these two pictures fenton reaction occurs pyrite reacts with h 2 o 2 on the surface of pyrite the contour of o h shows that o h is in the same location that pyrites are there it reveals that reaction takes place on the surface of catalysts and also o h is very reactive species so it cannot move to another place because as it is produced it is consumed in another reaction especially r18 in table 1 figs 12a and 13a show the contour of h 2 o 2 in the reactors it is vivid that wherever pyrites are the concentration of h 2 o 2 is lower hence these results validate the experiments for determining the role of homogeneous fenton reaction an experiment has been carried out in this experiment 0 94 mg l of f e 2 solution as same as the leached iron amount detected by aas in our previous study khataee et al 2018 at ph 3 was prepared containing 30 mg l of ay36 and 2 mm of h 2 o 2 the elimination percentage was observed as 8 5 after an hour at the same experimental conditions in the presence of the pyrite catalyst 1 g l the degradation percentage was observed as 93 7 as mentioned before reaction r1 in table 1 is the only source for production of o h by comparing figs 12a and 13a with figs 12b and 13b respectively it reveals that o h has been produced only in a place that pyrite exists there in other words pyrite heterogeneous fenton reaction is the main source for the production of hence role of released f e 2 homogeneous fenton reaction is negligible in contrast with pyrites role ph changes during the process were illustrated in fig 8 as mentioned before ph changes do not depend on the type of reactor because o h is just production in this process and it does not consume in any reactions for both kinds of reactors ph changes in the simulation results were the same but for the removal ratio this theory is not correct because the main species that degrades ay36 is o h incessant production incessant consumption and high reactivity of o h are the reasons that the turbulent mixing rate in the reactor could be a limiting factor for aops in other words the reaction rate of radicals was limited by mixing rate as mentioned before in this simulation k ε model had been used for predicting the turbulence in the reactors k is turbulence kinetic energy m 2 s 2 and ε is turbulent dissipation rate m 2 s 3 the values of k and ε could be calculated by solving momentum equation for these two parameters equation 10 indicates the rate of turbulence based on the mass fractions of each reactant 10 r i r a c k ε m w i y i i n m w i y i where a is stoichiometric coefficient mw is molecular weight c is total concentration y is the mass fraction and k ε is large eddy mixing time scale s it represents the lifetime of an eddy in the turbulent flow the subscripts i and r represent particular reactant and reaction respectively wilcox 1998 as mentioned in this process the default reaction rate for all of the reactions is arrhenius reaction rate assuming an elementary reaction for radicals arrhenius reaction rate has been calculated for elementary reactions and moreover turbulence mixing rate has been calculated the reaction rate is taken as the minimum of these two rates it is vivid that for all the radicals the limiting reaction rate is the mixing rate by comparing kinetic modeling without including mixing rate versus cfd modeling including turbulence mixing rate this theory is confirmed kinetic modeling was investigated in our previous study farshchi et al 2018 fig 14 exhibits the removal ratio of experimental kinetic modeling and cfd simulation results in both kinds of reactors the kinetic modeling result is the same for both reactors because in this kind of modeling the hydrodynamic of the reactor is not solved also in the kinetic modeling it is assumed that all the species are in contact with each other this is the reason of overestimation of kinetic modeling in other words when two radicals are far from each other in the reactor there is not any chance for them to react but in kinetic modeling this issue is not considered and it is due to quiddity of this kind of modeling unlike kinetic modeling in cfd modeling in addition to solving momentum equations the turbulence mixing rate is imported to the reaction rates to distinguish the minimum value between arrhenius and mixing rate consequently the minimum value has been considered in reaction terms on the rhs of equation 3 third and fourth term on the rhs fig 14 confirms the simulation results cfd modeling results for both reactors agree with the experiments compared with kinetic modeling of this process 5 conclusion aops are very efficient alternatives for conventional wastewater treatments heterogeneous fenton reaction is one of these processes that has received considerable attentions in last decade pyrite as a mineral and nontoxic stone had been used in this study effect of two semi pilot reactors fluidized bed and stirred tank reactors on the heterogeneous fenton process was investigated in order to approaching to industrial scale from the viewpoint of dye removal and process time the performance of the fluidized bed reactor was better than the other do also cfd simulation results for both of the reactor confirmed this issue simulation for this process was conducted by cfd method for obtaining better results a parameter which named turbulence mixing rate had been introduced for reactive species like hydroxyl radicals the reason for introducing this parameter was the high rate of reaction for the reactive components in this case the limiting rate for the components is mixing and contact time of the species during the process in a turbulence flow experiment and modified cfd results were adequately identical in removal ratio and ph value during the process moreover the cfd method could rationally interpret the experiment results such as the ph changes and the role of homogeneous fenton reaction in this process declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests acknowledgment we appreciate the support of the university of tabriz for accomplishing this project 
19062,heterogeneous fenton process is a kind of advanced oxidation processes aops that is significant for wastewater treatment in the first part of this study acid yellow 36 ay36 degradation process has occurred in two kinds of reactors fluidized bed and stirred tank reactors performances of these two semi pilot reactors are compared by evaluating the removal ratio of the dye and ph changes during the process pyrite has been used as a heterogeneous catalyst for obtaining the characteristics of pyrite xrd sem and ft ir analysis have been carried out in the second part of this study a modified computational fluid dynamics cfd method has been utilized to solve the momentum and mass balances for heterogeneous fenton process in both reactors in aops free radicals are reactive and have a short lifetime so that turbulence mixing would be a limiting factor for the reactions that radicals are involved by introducing a new parameter named turbulence mixing rate as a reaction rate for reactive species like hydroxyl radicals the results of removal ratio and ph changes during the process showed a good agreement between the experiments and the cfd simulations compared with not including the mixing rate in the cfd simulations conventional kinetic modeling in addition the results revealed the high performance of the fluidized bed reactor for this process in both experiments

introduction the textile industry is one of the greatest and complicated industries in the world the more technology of these industries goes forward the more complicated is the wastewater which is discharged from this industry the production of contaminated water from this industry is about 2 billion tons for each year this amount of wastewater poses a dilemma to the environment hence new wastewater treatment technologies must be employed to degrade hazardous and non biodegradable contaminants the conventional techniques for wastewater treatment contain biological treatment process

utilizing pyrite is of vital importance due to not creating sludge being ubiquitous having micro porous structure and having high active reaction surface simultaneously also it is environmentally friendly and sustainable as a catalyst for fenton process barhoumi et al 2016 barreiro et al 2007 nidheesh 2015 most of the investigations in this field are conducted in the stirred tank reactors these are batch reactors which have a simpler configuration than the others have like fluidized bed reactors alcocer et al 2018 blanco et al 2014 esteves et al 2016 queirós et al 2015 rott et al 2017 according to the state of art of the wastewater treatment utilizing aops in a fluidized bed reactor has drawn attention to this technology by a few researchers aghdasinia et al 2016a 2016b 2017 farshchi et al 2018 liu et al 2014 in fluidized bed reactors solid particles are loaded on a distributer that is located at the bottom of the reactor they are fluidized by liquid or gas flow this kind of reactors comparatively has many advantages like uniform particle mixing due to the fluid like behavior of the catalysts high mass transfer rate and turbulence between phases catalysts and effluent albeit conducting a deficient investigation on it bello et al 2017 fogler 2016 kunii and levenspiel 1991 lack of appropriate models and simulations get in the way of the extension of practical

α ρ y and u are volume fraction density mass fraction and velocity vector of diverse phases q and i indexes represent phase and species numbers respectively bird et al 2007 in equation 1 the term on the rhs shows mass interface exchange between the phases the fourth term on the rhs of equation 2 indicates interface forces and mass exchanges between phases and the fifth one declares the external forces like lift drag virtual mass etc the first to fourth terms on the rhs of equation 3 define respectively diffusion homogeneous reactions homogeneous productions and heterogeneous reactions arrhenius model has been used for all the reactions these equations were discretized and solved contemporaneously for this process this model contains two phases the first one is solid phase pyrite and the second one is aqueous phase such as water ay 36 radicals etc aforementioned equations are solved for both phases hence they include the reaction between two phases which is named as heterogeneous reaction 3 2 boundary conditions in all of the computational fluid dynamics methods boundary condition plays an important role to enhance the convergence and accuracy of the solution the geometry of the computational domains of both reactors is demonstrated in fig 2 as shown conical distributer has been placed at the bottom of the fluidized bed reactor and the inlet and the outlet of the flow of effluent are demonstrated in this figure the mass flow inlet is 13 l min and the optimum amounts of operational parameters which have been mentioned in the last sections were adjusted to the inlet boundary condition the side surface of the reactor has been considered as a rigid wall and no slip boundary condition is assumed to the walls of this reactor all the components which exit the reactor from the outlet zone are recirculated to the inlet of the reactor in this system eddy and turbulence have a crucial role consequently k ε model have been employed as a turbulence model to approach the results of the simulation to the practical results wilcox 1998 3 3 numerical method the geometry of the problem is designed and has been meshed by gambit and the governing equations have been solved by ansys fluent software with the basis of finite volume method in the meshed computational domain in unsteady state problem for an incompressible fluid pressure based solving algorithm is appropriate accordingly this approach has been utilized for solving the governing equations for having good stability of the solution first order implicit discretization has been adjusted to the transient formulation node base solving is used to store pressure velocity and mole fraction of the species for coupling pressure and velocity parameters phase coupled simple algorithm has been chosen anderson and wendt 1995 versteeg and malalasekera 1995 the convective terms of the equations in the first set of all runs are discretized by first order and in the next set second order and quick methods have been utilized diffusion terms are discretized by green gauss method that is proper as far as other methods anderson and wendt 1995 versteeg and malalasekera 1995 eventually the convergence of the solution has been adjudicated by residuals lower than 10 6 it should be mentioned that for the stirred tank reactor moving reference frame mrf method has been used in this method the computational zone contains two different zones the internal one encompasses the stirrer of the reactor and the other contains the rest of the reactor by introducing a rotational velocity to the internal zone instead of stirrer this process is simulated in a way that the stirrer is stable and the computational zone is rotating around the stirrer in this kind of numerical studies certainly the solution depends on the size of the grids therefore the grid independence investigation has been carried out by considering three different grid numbers that have been shown in table 2 these results declare that the percentage difference between case 2 and 3 for the turbulent kinetic rate for both reactors is about 0 3 consequently case 2 has been preferred to be utilized for the rest of the simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis results sem xrd and ft ir results are exhibited in the figs 3 5 respectively sem pictures indicate micro pore and the roughness of the pyrite surface which helps to have more contact area with the various components in xrd analysis the peaks appeared at 2θ values of 28ᵒ 33ᵒ 37ᵒ 40ᵒ 47ᵒ 56ᵒ 59ᵒ 62ᵒ and 64ᵒ which correspond to the 111 200 210 211 220 311 222 023 and 321 reflection planes of pyrite jcpds file no 42 1340 xrd pattern matches up with the standard xrd analysis of pyrite which confirms the cubic and crystalized structure of the pyrite liu et al 2013 ft ir result demonstrates some vibrations in distinct wavenumbers f e s f e o o h f e s o 4 o h vibrations are apparent in this analysis with their wavenumbers chernyshova 2003 2004 reyes bozo et al 2015 the main result of ft ir is the same vibrations of pyrite after and before the tests it shows that there are not any physical and chemical changes during the process another issue that could be concluded from ft ir analysis is the effect of adsorption in ay36 elimination the adsorption of the contaminants by pyrite does not play any roles in the elimination of the contaminants otherwise we would confronted with advent of new peaks in other wavelength numbers in fig 5b for confirming ft ir results another experiment has been designed by adding a quenching reagent in the beginning of the process to the effluent without addition of excess h 2 o 2 the reaction between dissolved oxygen and ferrous iron associated with pyrite via haber weiss reaction mechanism can form superoxide anion o 2 and then superoxide anion reacts with h to form h 2 o 2 eqs 4 and 5 farshchi et al 2018 hao et al 2014 schoonen et al 2006 4 f e p y r i t e 2 o 2 f e 3 o 2 5 f e p y r i t e 2 o 2 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 as mentioned before hydroxyl free radicals are highly reactive species that can easily have a reaction with organic substances if there were adequate quenching reagents inside of the effluent at first o h would react with them instead of reacting with the dye or other contaminants hence by adding quenching reagents o h will not have any opportunity to have reaction with ay36 in this experiment methanol as a hydroxyl quenching reagent has been added to the effluent with initial dye concentration of 50 mg l fig 6 shows that without adding surplus h 2 o 2 the rate of dye degradation is low about 50 percent after 6 h because pyrite has a low capacity to form h 2 o 2 eqs 4 and 5 moreover in presence of quenching reagent aforementioned low degradation of pyrite approaches to approximately 2 percent adsorption phenomenon can only be responsible for this 2 percent removal of dye which reveals negligible role of adsorption in this process 4 2 experimental results the rationale for degradation of dye and other contaminants is hydroxyl radicals o h o h attacks to the organic species and mineralizes them o h has a very high potential to react with other species fig 7 demonstrates the removal ratio of ay36 during the process for four different initial dye concentrations in both stirred tank and fluidized bed reactors as the process time goes on the slope of the removal graph decrease because at the beginning of the process there were more ay36 to react with o h in other words the rate of the degradation is decreasing by the development of the process this is true for both reactors but as fig 7 shows for the fluidized bed reactor the rate of the degradation is higher than the stirred tank reactor this issue is due to the characterization of the reactors the turbulence of fluidized bed reactor is higher than stirred one so the catalysts have more chance to be in contact with other species another significant result which can be concluded from fig 7 is that in one hour process time the removal ratio of fluidized bed reactor is higher than the stirred tank because in this process the main reason for the radical production is r1 in table 1 so that r1 occurs just in a situation that catalysts exist in the stirred tank reactor catalysts are in all over the fluid domain therefore o h reacts with each other in addition of reacting with ay36 which results in reduction of removal rate of ay36 on the other hand in a fluidized bed reactor the catalysts are submerged in the bottom of the reactor so that on the top of the reactor excess h 2 o 2 which has not reacted with f e 2 has more chance to back to the reactor in other words in the stirred tank reactors the excess h 2 o 2 decompose to o h by r1 and due to the high activity of this species the excess o h reacts with the other component except for ay36 r2 r8 r13 r14 r15 and r17 in table 1 these results will be more discussed in the simulation results and the results will be interpreted in details in the next sections fig 8 exhibits the change of ph during the process for both reactors the limiting reaction in fenton process is r1 in table 1 which starts the process one of the products of this reaction is o h so it is apparent that by the progress of the process ph value increases if the ph plot was divided into three different sections in the first section we confront with low incline of the lines because in the beginning of the process when the ph is low enough ph 3 oxidizing of pyrite cause production of h on the other hand the main reaction r1 produces o h whereas the dominant reaction is the fenton reaction hence o h concentration overcomes h concentration nevertheless in the second section as ph increases the oxidizing of pyrite decreases so that h concentration decreases and the ph grows with the higher incline in the third section most of h 2 o 2 have been utilized so there is not any production of o h therefore ph values stop increasing and remains at a constant value ph changes for both of the reactors behave in the same way and the results are approximately similar to each other because o h is produced in the all of the 18 reactions and it is not consumed in another reaction so that unlike free radicals characteristics of the reactors do not affect on ph value moreover it should be mentioned that in some cases which there is ample amount of h 2 o 2 ph will be decreased violently in a little period of process time because the excess amount of it would participate in side reactions like r8 r9 and r10 which triggers a sudden decrement in ph value by producing h zhang et al 2014 in the next section these results are discussed in detail from the stand point of cfd 4 3 cfd results simulation of this process has been assessed from two aspects hydrodynamic and chemical evaluations cfd computational domain of the reactors was exhibited in fig 2 4 3 1 hydrodynamic evaluation to study the effects of flow rate in the reactors residence time distribution rtd is used pulse injection is performed at the inlet of fluidized bed reactor where the steady state of bulk flow had already been reached the response of the tracer at the outlet was recorded using cfd and also by analyzing it experimentally by using uv spectrophotometer by using the following functions equations 6 9 rtd has been obtained for both experiment and simulation 6 e t c t 0 c t dt 7 τ 0 te t d t 8 θ t τ 9 e θ τ e t t c τ θ e t and e θ denote time concentration of tracer mean residence time dimensionless time normalized distribution function and dimensionless normalized distribution function respectively fogler 2016 fig 9 shows rtd of the fluidized bed reactor simulation result has a good agreement with the experiment furthermore mean residence time has been calculated and is shown in table 3 based on the definition of the dimensionless normalized distribution function the surface area of e θ must equal 1 as is indicated in table 3 the experimental and cfd results confirm this issue it should be mentioned that rtd is significant for the reactors which contain the flow hence rtd analysis had been carried out just for the fluidized bed reactor fig 10 shows the velocity vectors for both reactors as expected in stirred tank reactor vortexes are formed at the four side of the stirrer that causes the formation of dead zones inside the reactor and fig 10a confirms it as is exhibited in the fluidized bed reactor there are not dead zones inside the reactor image processing of the heterogeneous catalysis pyrite in the fluid is another analysis that has been carried out to validate the hydrodynamic of reactors by taking pictures from the pilot reactors in special times and processing the picture with matlab software 2013 we could find out the exact locations of pyrite inside the reactor at that special time the volume fraction contour of pyrite has been obtained from the simulation in a special time of the image processing these results are demonstrated in fig 11 it is clear that image processing of the experiment and the simulation are similar in results as mentioned beforehand the bed height is measured from the bottom of the reactors the stirred tank and the fluidized bed reactors are 20 cm and 6 cm in diameter respectively in addition the volume fraction of pyrite as a representative for the movement of pyrite inside the reactor has been animated and is accessible in animation 1 and animation 2 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 12 011 the following are the supplementary data related to this article fbr fbr str str 4 3 2 chemical evaluation in cfd method momentum equation is solved in conjunction with mass balances between all species the last term in equation 3 includes the reactions between involved components in the process the main difference between kinetic modeling and cfd modeling is the momentum equation which could expect the location and the velocity of each component figs 12 and 13 indicate the contour of various parameters in the stirred tank and fluidized bed reactors respectively as shown in these two pictures fenton reaction occurs pyrite reacts with h 2 o 2 on the surface of pyrite the contour of o h shows that o h is in the same location that pyrites are there it reveals that reaction takes place on the surface of catalysts and also o h is very reactive species so it cannot move to another place because as it is produced it is consumed in another reaction especially r18 in table 1 figs 12a and 13a show the contour of h 2 o 2 in the reactors it is vivid that wherever pyrites are the concentration of h 2 o 2 is lower hence these results validate the experiments for determining the role of homogeneous fenton reaction an experiment has been carried out in this experiment 0 94 mg l of f e 2 solution as same as the leached iron amount detected by aas in our previous study khataee et al 2018 at ph 3 was prepared containing 30 mg l of ay36 and 2 mm of h 2 o 2 the elimination percentage was observed as 8 5 after an hour at the same experimental conditions in the presence of the pyrite catalyst 1 g l the degradation percentage was observed as 93 7 as mentioned before reaction r1 in table 1 is the only source for production of o h by comparing figs 12a and 13a with figs 12b and 13b respectively it reveals that o h has been produced only in a place that pyrite exists there in other words pyrite heterogeneous fenton reaction is the main source for the production of hence role of released f e 2 homogeneous fenton reaction is negligible in contrast with pyrites role ph changes during the process were illustrated in fig 8 as mentioned before ph changes do not depend on the type of reactor because o h is just production in this process and it does not consume in any reactions for both kinds of reactors ph changes in the simulation results were the same but for the removal ratio this theory is not correct because the main species that degrades ay36 is o h incessant production incessant consumption and high reactivity of o h are the reasons that the turbulent mixing rate in the reactor could be a limiting factor for aops in other words the reaction rate of radicals was limited by mixing rate as mentioned before in this simulation k ε model had been used for predicting the turbulence in the reactors k is turbulence kinetic energy m 2 s 2 and ε is turbulent dissipation rate m 2 s 3 the values of k and ε could be calculated by solving momentum equation for these two parameters equation 10 indicates the rate of turbulence based on the mass fractions of each reactant 10 r i r a c k ε m w i y i i n m w i y i where a is stoichiometric coefficient mw is molecular weight c is total concentration y is the mass fraction and k ε is large eddy mixing time scale s it represents the lifetime of an eddy in the turbulent flow the subscripts i and r represent particular reactant and reaction respectively wilcox 1998 as mentioned in this process the default reaction rate for all of the reactions is arrhenius reaction rate assuming an elementary reaction for radicals arrhenius reaction rate has been calculated for elementary reactions and moreover turbulence mixing rate has been calculated the reaction rate is taken as the minimum of these two rates it is vivid that for all the radicals the limiting reaction rate is the mixing rate by comparing kinetic modeling without including mixing rate versus cfd modeling including turbulence mixing rate this theory is confirmed kinetic modeling was investigated in our previous study farshchi et al 2018 fig 14 exhibits the removal ratio of experimental kinetic modeling and cfd simulation results in both kinds of reactors the kinetic modeling result is the same for both reactors because in this kind of modeling the hydrodynamic of the reactor is not solved also in the kinetic modeling it is assumed that all the species are in contact with each other this is the reason of overestimation of kinetic modeling in other words when two radicals are far from each other in the reactor there is not any chance for them to react but in kinetic modeling this issue is not considered and it is due to quiddity of this kind of modeling unlike kinetic modeling in cfd modeling in addition to solving momentum equations the turbulence mixing rate is imported to the reaction rates to distinguish the minimum value between arrhenius and mixing rate consequently the minimum value has been considered in reaction terms on the rhs of equation 3 third and fourth term on the rhs fig 14 confirms the simulation results cfd modeling results for both reactors agree with the experiments compared with kinetic modeling of this process 5 conclusion aops are very efficient alternatives for conventional wastewater treatments heterogeneous fenton reaction is one of these processes that has received considerable attentions in last decade pyrite as a mineral and nontoxic stone had been used in this study effect of two semi pilot reactors fluidized bed and stirred tank reactors on the heterogeneous fenton process was investigated in order to approaching to industrial scale from the viewpoint of dye removal and process time the performance of the fluidized bed reactor was better than the other do also cfd simulation results for both of the reactor confirmed this issue simulation for this process was conducted by cfd method for obtaining better results a parameter which named turbulence mixing rate had been introduced for reactive species like hydroxyl radicals the reason for introducing this parameter was the high rate of reaction for the reactive components in this case the limiting rate for the components is mixing and contact time of the species during the process in a turbulence flow experiment and modified cfd results were adequately identical in removal ratio and ph value during the process moreover the cfd method could rationally interpret the experiment results such as the ph changes and the role of homogeneous fenton reaction in this process declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests acknowledgment we appreciate the support of the

19063,microplastics 5 mm are increasingly detected in aquatic environment and the high levels of brominated flame retardants bfrs contained in them can potentially impact water quality this study characterized the release kinetics of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe from millimeter sized microplastic pellets in water at environmentally relevant temperatures leaching rates of bfrs from the microplastic pellets made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs were found to be controlled by their diffusion within the plastic matrix and their diffusion coefficients d in the plastic matrices ranged from 10 28 30 to 10 20 84 m2 s 1 the apparent activation energies of the bfrs diffusion coefficients were estimated to be in the range of 64 1 131 8 kj mol 1 based on their temperature dependence and the arrhenius equation the diffusion coefficients of the bfrs decrease with their molecular diameters while the activation energies for diffusion increase with the molecular diameters which are indicative of significant steric hindrance for bfr diffusion within the plastic matrices a semi empirical linear relationship was observed between log10 d and the glass transition temperature t g of plastics which allows prediction of the diffusion coefficients of bfrs in other types of microplastics commonly found in marine environment the half lives of bfr leaching i e 50 depletion from the microplastic pellets would range from tens of thousands to hundreds of billions of years at ambient temperatures if their physical and chemical structures could remain intact although the release fluxes of bfrs from microplastics are extremely low under the model conditions a range of physical and chemical processes in the natural environment and the digestive systems of organisms that ingested them could potentially accelerate their leaching by causing breakdown and swelling of the plastic matrices graphical abstract image 1 keywords brominated flame retardants bfrs microplastic release kinetics diffusion coefficient activation energy aquatic environment 1 introduction with properties that can be engineered to meet the demand of almost any applications plastics have increasingly displaced wood metal and glass in a wide range of products over the past several decades the global production of plastics has exceeded 300 million tonnes in 2014 lebreton et al 2017 and the industry is expected to continue to grow up to 10 of the plastics used by the society are believed to end up in the oceans where they can last very long times because of their chemical stability andrady 2011 abundant waste plastics have been found in oceans and polar regions derraik 2002 waller et al 2017 recently microplastics which are plastic pieces of less than 5 mm in size as defined by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa have emerged as an important concern in the marine environment castillo et al 2016 microplastics are generated from the disintegration of large pieces of plastic materials such as monofilament line plastic strapping and plastic bags under the action of external forces and solar radiation andrady 2011 derraik 2002 they can be subsequently suspended in the sea water or deposit to the ocean bottom and become components of the sediments microplastics occurring in oceans pose potential risk to marine ecosystems and they have been found in organisms of different trophic levels in the marine food chain besseling et al 2012 gaylor et al 2013 once ingested by marine organisms microplastics can produce mechanical damage and block the eating organ resulting in reduction of nutrient absorption starvation injury and even death of the organisms andrady 2011 derraik 2002 spear et al 1995 in addition microplastics also act as a source of organic pollutants ingestion of microplastics by biota could lead to increased exposure to plastic additives such as brominated flame retardants bfrs gandara e silva et al 2016 narváez valderrama et al 2016 tanaka et al 2015 polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are a major class of bfrs that have been widely used in electronic and electrical products they were later discovered to have significant negative effects on human health and the use of those with high biological toxicity including penta bdes octa bdes and deca bde bde 209 were gradually phased out in the 2000s nonetheless pbdes including the banned ones continue to exist in the plastics of a wide variety of current use and discarded electrical and electronic products and are thus widely detected in environmental matrices meanwhile new bfrs such as 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe have been developed as substitutes unfortunately these alternative bfrs have also been increasingly detected in the environment yang et al 2012 as bfrs are mechanically added into the polymer blocks of plastics without formation of chemical bonds they can escape from the plastic matrix over time despite of their low volatilities and poor water solubilities gaylor et al 2013 plastics can gradually lose structural integrity during use and after being disposed of through processes such as weathering wear and tear and pulverization resulting in breakaway of small fragments from the bulk plastic body andrady 2011 teuten et al 2009 consequently releases of the additives from the plastics can be significantly accelerated due to the physical and or chemical disintegration of their matrices gaylor et al 2013 to date research on pollution of microplastics has focused mainly on their ecological effect and to a less extent on their role as a sink for hydrophobic organic chemicals hocs in the marine environment bakir et al 2014a mato et al 2001 the release of plastic additives bfrs in particular from microplastics in aquatic environment has received little attention this study was conducted to evaluate the release kinetics of bfrs from millimeter sized pellets of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs a common type of microplastic found in the environment castillo et al 2016 in water at environmentally relevant temperatures although the types of microplastics in the environment are diverse the release rates obtained and the dependence of diffusion coefficient on molecular size of the diffusant and the glass transition temperature t g of the plastic matrix observed could provide important insights for assessing the release kinetics of bfrs from other types of microplastics and thus help assess their risk in aquatic environment 2 materials and method 2 1 materials approximately spherical plastic pellets fig s1 made of abs in the size ranges of 10 20 30 40 and 50 100 meshes 0 841 2 000 0 420 0 595 and 0 149 0 297 mm respectively were obtained by grinding the plastic rear covers of two computer displays and then sieving with wire meshes supplementary data their bfr contents were determined by exhaustive extraction sequential microwave assisted extraction for five times and quantitation using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms supplementary data the contents of bfrs in the microplastic pellets are summarized in table s1 low density polyethylene ldpe sheets 50 μm thick were purchased from maolu plastic changzhou china stripes of ldpe 2 cm 3 cm were successively pre cleaned by soaking in dichoromethane for 48 h methanol for 24 h and triple distilled water for 24 h the pre cleaned ldpe stripes were cleaned again in triple distilled water immediately before being used to ensure cleanness all laboratory glassware used was soaked in chromic acid mixture for 12 h then cleaned with tap water and triple distilled water successively finally oven dried at 450 c for 4 h prior to use 2 2 bfr release experiment kinetics of bfr releases from the plastic pellets was investigated in sealed glass bottles using ldpe film as the infinite sink approximately 1 00 g 0 1 mg of plastic pellets were wrapped in copper wire of 180 mesh and inserted into 100 ml wide mouth glass bottles wrapped with aluminum foil followed by three stripes of pre cleaned ldpe film the bottles were then filled with triple distilled water sealed and equilibrated in dark constant temperature chambers 10 and 30 c to avoid potential breakdown of the microplastic pellets no mechanical mixing was used during the course of leaching experiment although marine water could be a more realistic environmental medium to study the leaching behaviors of the bfrs from the plastic pieces it has been demonstrated that there was little difference in the leaching of bde 209 from high density polyethylene hdpe plates soaked in distilled water seawater and acidic pepsin solution tanaka et al 2015 triple distilled water was used in this study because the diffusion within the polymeric matrix was believed to be the rate limiting step in the overall release processes and it eliminated the need to control microbial growth during the experimental period at preset sampling time points the ldpe stripes were taken out of the sealed bottles and rinsed with triple distilled water and then extracted consecutively with 20 ml dichloromethane for 24 h and 20 ml hexane for 24 h each extract was concentrated to 5 10 ml by rotary evaporation at 30 c passed through a glass column filled with anhydrous na2so4 then further concentrated to 1 ml by nitrogen blowdown finally the extract was solvent exchanged to about 30 or 1000 μl of hexane depending on the targeted analytes the ldpe and water samples were spiked with 13c pcb 209 as a recovery standard prior to being extracted and all experiments were conducted in triplicates bfrs were analyzed by gc ms following the methods reported in our previous work sun et al 2016 the contents of bfrs in the microplastic pellets could be treated as essentially constant because only negligible fractions 5 94 10 7 1 82 10 3 of them leached out during the experimental period instrument detection limits defined as three times of the signal to noise ratios ranged from 0 01 to 0 15 ng ml for the targeted analytes table s2 all measurement results reported were the averages of triplicated samples details of the quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures are presented in the supplementary data 2 3 modeling of bfr leaching kinetics fig 1 schematically illustrates the major mass transfer processes involved in the leaching of bfrs from the microplastic matrix to the ldpe strips in a close system leaching of a given bfr molecule occurs via five consecutive steps diffusion within the plastic matrix mass transfer across the microplastic water boundary layer diffusion in water mass transfer across the ldpe water boundary layer and diffusion in ldpe matrix esquerdo et al 2015 recasens et al 1989 in the absence of strong interactions between the fluid and plastic matrix i e no swelling or plasticization of the polymers leaching of bfrs from the approximately spherical plastic pellets can be considered as governed by the fick s second law lee et al 2018 vitrac et al 2007 1 c r t t d p 2 c r t r 2 0 r r where c is the local concentration of the bfr in the plastic matrix d p is the diffusion coefficient in the plastic matrix and r is the characteristic dimension of the plastic layer and is equal to the radius of the plastic pellets the rate controlling step among the various mass transfer processes involved in the release of bfrs from microplastic pellets to water and their subsequent sorption on the ldpe film can be evaluated with the mass transfer biot number b i which represents the ratio of the rate of transport across the liquid boundary layer to the rate of diffusion within the plastic phase b i is calculated as vitrac et al 2007 2 b i k m l d where d is the diffusion coefficient in the plastic phase d p or d ldpe which could be the abs microplastic pellet or the ldpe film depending on the mass transfer process studied and l is the characteristic dimension of the plastic layer which is the radius r of the plastic pellets or half of the thickness of the ldpe film k m is the mass transfer coefficient in the plastic water boundary layer and can be estimated as booij et al 2003 crank 1975 3 k m d w k p w δ where d w is the diffusion coefficient of bfr in water k pw is its plastic water partition coefficient and δ is the thickness of the aqueous boundary layer which can be approximated as the radius of the microplastic pellets for mass transfer from the plastic pellets to water or half of the thickness of the ldpe film for mass transfer from water to the ldpe film the value of d w can be estimated from the hayduk laudie correlation hayduk and laudie 1974 4 d w 13 26 10 9 μ 1 4 v m 0 589 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s v m is the lebas molar volume cm3 mol 1 and can be calculated from the molecular structure of the diffusant using a simple additive method reid et al 1977 5 v m 7 n c n h n o n

counted once for diffusants with one or more aromatic rings when both the diffusive mass transfer within the solid matrix and the external mass transfer are considered the released mass fraction m t m

are the roots of 7 β n c o t β n b i 1 0 as detailed in the supplementary data depending on the value of b i m t m 0 can be approximated as different functions of d p r and t 8 m t m 0 a d p t r 2 b i

shown on fig s3 while the fractions of bfrs released from the microplastic pellets over 150 days were in the ranges of 10 5 72 to 10 2 74 the model predicts that all the bfrs in the microplastic pellets would have been completely released by 150 days at 30 c i e m t m 0 1 for the cases of b i 1 and 1 b i 100 table s3 thus the b i values for releases of bfrs from the microplastic pellets must be greater than 100 based on fitting of the experimentally observed m t m 0 values b i ranged from 109 to 1015 for different bfrs table s4 figure s4 shows the plots of m t m 0 versus d p t r 2 1 2 for the releases of pbdes and btbpe from the two types of microplastic pellets good linearity is observed in all cases and the slopes of the fitted lines for the releases of bfrs from the pellets 30 40 mesh of plastics a 3 31 0 54 and b 3 38 0 29 are all reasonably close to the value of 6 π i e 3 38 these results consistently indicate that the release kinetics of bfrs from the microplastic pellets could be well described by the following equation for b i 100 9 m t m 0 6 π d p t r 2 1 2 as a result d p can be estimated as 10 d p π r 2 36 t m t m 0 2 the mass transfer biot number reflects the relative importance of the external mass transfer and the diffusive mass transfer within the solid matrix it has been reported that external mass transport resistance controls the mass transfer step when b i 1 for hoc desorption from spherical particles and diffusion in the plastic is the step controlling mass transfer when b i is greater than 100 while both mass transfer steps are important when b i is between 1 and 100 cho et al 2006 for desorption of water from a flat slab diffusion in the matrix has been shown to control the overall mass transfer when b i is above 30 cdrdova quiroz et al 1996 based on the typical values of the related parameters the values of b i for diffusion of bfrs from the plastic matrix to the aqueous phase are much greater than 100 109 1016 and are orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding ones for their transport from the aqueous phase onto the ldpe film table s4 that is diffusion of bfrs within the matrix of microplastics is the overall rate limiting step in the leaching system fig 1 which is also consistent with the previous findings that the diffusion rates of bfrs within the microplastic pellets were far smaller than those within the aqueous phase and the ldpe film mato et al 2001 narváez valderrama et al 2016 as a result it is reasonable to assume that the overall leaching of bfrs which are initially distributed homogeneously in the matrix of microplastic pellets is controlled solely by their diffusion within the plastic matrix accordingly the fraction of bfrs leached m t m 0 from the microplastic pellets at a given time t can be estimated as crank 1975 11 m t m 0 1 6 π 2 n 1 1 n 2 exp d p n 2 π 2 t r 2 based on the poisson s equation the above equation can be transformed and re arranged as reichenberg 1953 12 m t m 0 6 π 3 2 b t 3 π 2 b t 6 π 3 2 0 b t n 1 e n 2 π 2 b t b t d b t where b d p π 2 r 2 because only the first two terms of equation 12 are significant reichenberg 1953 it can be reduced to 13 m t m 0 6 π 3 2 b t 3 π 2 b t as the fractions of bfrs that leached out of the microplastic pellets were only in the range of 10 5 72 to 10 2 74 over the experimental period equation 13 can be further simplified as 14 m t m 0 6 π 3 2 b t 6 π 3 2 d p π 2 t r 2 6 π d p t r 2 1 2 equations 9 and 14 are identical that is after incorporation of the partition constants of bfrs between plastic pellets and the surrounding water at the interface the model is the same for the specific set of conditions in this study as that derived based on the assumption that the external resistance in the plastic water boundary layer is negligible compared to that of mass transfer within the plastic matrix 3 results 3 1 leaching rates of bfrs as shown on table s1 bde 209 which was present at 63 00 1 26 and 910 9 19 5 μg g in plastics a and b respectively accounted for 85 of the total pbdes in both plastics while di bdes to hexa bdes occurred at μg g levels btbpe a replacement for octa bde was also detected at rather high levels in them a 6 06 0 10 mg g b 660 00 2 98 μg g the leaching behaviors of pbdes and btbpe from the microplastic pellets 30 40 mesh in water are shown on fig s5 the masses of bfrs leached quantified from those accumulated on the ldpe strips increased linearly over time which indicates that the uptake capacities of the ldpe stripes for the bfrs were not saturated i e they functioned as an infinite sink during the experimental period table s5 the leaching fluxes of bfrs from microplastics a and b were 0 28 38 90 and 0 16 7 43 ng m 2 d 1 at 10 c and 2 24 116 31 and 0 86 38 16 ng m 2 d 1 at 30 c respectively as expected the most abundant bfrs in the microplastic pellets bde 209 and btbpe also had the highest leaching fluxes based on the data reported by tanaka et al 2015 the flux of bde 209 leaching from hdpe plate 2 mm 3 mm 3 mm in aqueous media distilled water seawater and pepsin solution at 20 c was up to 2 10 105 ng m 2 d 1 tanaka et al 2015 which is 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those observed for bde 209 leaching from the microplastic pellets here this may be due to the much lower t g of hdpe compared to that of abs plastics evaluated in this study as discussed later according to the results of field sorption experiment conducted by mato and co workers the combined sorption rate of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs onto polypropylene pp 0 1 0 5 cm pellets in seawater was approximately 0 1 ng g 1 d 1 at 12 c mato et al 2001 this translates to an area specific sorption rate of up to 45 5 ng m 2 d 1 which is comparable to the leaching fluxes of bfrs σ9pbdes btbpe from the microplastic pellets of 30 40 mesh at 10 c observed in this study table s6 3 2 diffusion coefficients of bfrs in plastic matrices table 1 summarizes the estimated values for diffusion coefficients d of pbdes and btbpe in the matrices of plastics a and b at 10 and 30 c the values of logd m2 s 1 for pbdes and btbpe ranged from 28 30 to 22 06 and from 26 80 to 21 04 at 10 and 30 c in the matrix of plastic a respectively while the corresponding values were 25 71 to 21 93 at 10 c and 24 42 to 20 84 at 30 c in the matrix of plastic b although both materials were made primarily of abs the manufacturing processes and the types and amounts of additives e g plasticizers and flame retardants added to the polymers probably changed over the years compared to plastic b manufactured in 2005 plastic a manufactured in 1994 had been subjected to aging for a much longer time while its polymer structure was probably more compact and thus had greater steric hindrance for the diffusing bfr molecules besides increasing the surface area of microplastics weathering introduces a variety of oxygen containing functional groups to the polymers which can slow down the diffusion rates of hydrophobic molecules within the plastic matrix due to the increased inter molecular forces satoto et al 1997 on the other hand re arrangement of the amorphous part caused by weathering of polymers can contribute to a slight increase in their crystallinity satoto et al 1997 which also reduces the diffusion rates of hydrophobic molecules within the plastic matrix polymers with low t g values have greater chain segmental mobility allowing diffusant molecules to move more easily george and thomas 2001 the diffusion coefficient of benzene in various polymers at 25 c has been shown to increase with decreases in the polymer s t g brown and park 1970 the diffusant s diffusion coefficient in plastic matrix can be predicted from the t g of the plastic based on the following relationship brown and park 1970 16 ln d c b f v where c is an empirical constant b is a constant that depends on the critical local free volume needed for diffusion and its value increases with the molecular size of the diffusant and f v is the fractional free volume of the diffusant at temperature t f v can be estimated as 17 f v f g a 1 a 2 t t g where a 1 and a 2 are the expansion coefficients in the glassy state and at the transition to the rubbery state respectively and f g is the fraction of free space in the polymer at t g reduction in the diffusivity of diffusant in polymers with increasing glass transition temperatures has long been documented van amerongen 1950 for example the diffusion coefficients of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and pcbs permeating through silicone rubbers which have some of the lowest t g values of plastics were much higher than those in ldpe rusina et al 2007 2010a based on the molecular volumes 0 18 0 34 nm3 xu et al 2007 the mean molecular diameter d of pbdes are estimated to be in the range of 0 55 0 70 nm table s7 as shown on fig 2 the log10 d values of pbdes in the matrices of microplastics a and b depend linearly on their molecular diameters and apparently follow the linear line established by berens and hopfenberg 1982 according to the fitting method reported by brown and park 1970 it is reasonable to expect that the diffusion coefficients of pbdes in abs are close to those in polystyrene ps because they have comparable t g values 100 c based on the linear relationship between log10 d and the molecular diameter of diffusant in ps at 30 c the values of log10 d m2 s 1 for pbdes in abs are about 19 bde 1 to 23 bde 209 which are higher than those of bde 209 in the matrices of plastic b 23 99 and plastic a 26 38 it is obvious that the measured diffusion coefficients of pbdes are much lower than those estimated from the linear relationship which was established from anisometric molecules e g normal alkanes compared with the anisometric molecules pbdes molecules have rigid symmetric spherical structures thus they diffuse more slowly than the more elongated molecules of same molecular masses which have greater conformational freedom berens and hopfenberg 1982 rusina et al 2010b although the bfr molecules are additives and only interact with the plastic matrix through van der waals force and hydrogen bonding the rather low diffusion coefficients probably arise from the significant steric hindrance due to the need for constant bending of certain chemical bonds during their diffusion through the tight polymer brushes 3 3 leaching half lives of bfrs from microplastics table 1 also summarizes the activation energies e a for diffusion coefficients of the bfrs estimated from their temperature dependence based on the arrhenius equation the e a values ranged from 64 1 to 131 8 and 75 3 to 120 8 kj mol 1 in the matrices of plastics a and b respectively fig 3 plots the activation energies for diffusion coefficients of bfrs in the plastic matrices as a function of their molecular diameters the e a values for diffusion of pbdes in the abs plastics roughly observe the linear trend line between e a and the molecular diameter of diffusant observed in ps plastic reported by berens and hopfenberg 1982 the activation energies for diffusion of pbdes are higher than those of anisometric molecules e g normal alkanes of comparable sizes probably because of the lower conformational freedom associated with their rigid symmetric structures the release rates of bfrs from the two plastic materials in the air were measured in our previous study sun et al 2016 and their values were found to be in the same bulk ranges with the reported rates of pbde releases from tv plastics and waste tv hirai et al 2006 kemmlein et al 2003 ortuño et al 2015 as shown in tables 1 and s8 the diffusion coefficients of bfrs and the corresponding activation energies of diffusion in the two plastic materials determined with the leaching experiment in aqueous medium are comparable to those estimated based on their releases to the air these results further corroborate that diffusion within the plastic matrix is the rate controlling step in the releases of bfrs from the abs microplastic pellets irrespective of the surrounding medium e g air or water based on the arrhenius equation the diffusion coefficients and thus leaching half lives i e time for depletion of 50 of the initial masses of bfrs from microplastic pellets can be predicted at different ambient temperatures table s9 millions to hundreds of billions of years could be required for half of the bde 206 207 208 209 and btbpe to leach out of the microplastic pellets at 10 and 30 c if their structures could remain intact due to their very slow leaching rates under ambient conditions the bfrs contained in microplastics could pose very low risk to the marine environment when only diffusion is considered nonetheless in natural environment a range of processes such as breakdown of plastic matrix by physical and chemical processes and alteration of the polymer structure e g by uv exposure and swelling of the plastic matrix brought by the presence of organic phase can significantly enhance the releases of bfrs from microplastics and thus increase their risk as discussed later the size of the microplastic pellets also plays a key role in controlling the leaching rates of bfrs mechanical abrasion and chemical processes can damage the structural integrity of the plastic matrix and increase the specific surface areas of microplastics accelerating the releases of bfrs gaylor et al 2013 fig 4 shows the leaching of pbdes from microplastics a and b of 10 20 and 50 100 mesh sizes at 10 c along with the model predictions as expected the leaching rates of bfrs increased significantly with reduction in their particle sizes these results indicate that further breakdown of microplastics in marine environment would accelerate the leaching of bfrs due to the increase in their surface area to volume ratios consequently the actual times for releases of significant portions of the bfrs out of the microplastics would be greatly reduced 4 discussion diffusion in the plastic matrix and diffusion in the plastic water boundary layer are important steps involved in the leaching or desorption of hocs from plastic materials depending on the physiochemical properties of the hoc and the environmental conditions either diffusion in the plastic matrix or diffusion in the plastic water boundary layer or both could control the overall mass transfer rate lee et al 2018 observed that the desorption of hocs with low 103 and high 104 plastic water partition coefficients from polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp sheets was controlled by diffusion in the plastic film and diffusion in the aqueous boundary layer respectively although diffusion across the plastic water boundary layer is usually a rate limiting step for hocs with kow 104 in planar passive samplers lohmann 2012 rusina et al 2007 the approximately spherical shape of the microplastic pellets in this study would result in a much steeper concentration gradient across the boundary layer schwarzenbach et al 2003 the extremely high b i values for the mass transfer of bfrs from the microplastic pellets to aqueous phase indicate that their releases were limited by the diffusion within the plastic matrix and the leaching process was independent of the boundary conditions endo et al 2013 investigated the long term 128 days desorption of pcbs from field collected marine plastic pellets that had relatively high pcb concentrations the desorption kinetics could not be described by an intra particle diffusion model but followed an aqueous boundary layer diffusion model and the diffusion coefficients of pcb congeners in pe pellets were estimated to be in the range of 10 13 10 15 m2 s 1 endo et al 2013 nonetheless it should be noted that although pcb congeners were not spiked onto these field collected pe pellets they sorbed from the environment onto them and thus were more enriched near the surface layer of the plastic pellets theoretically the greater abundance of sorbate molecules at the particle surface would render diffusion in the plastic matrix less important i e there are already enough supply of sorbate molecules on the plastic water boundary layer in contrast the additives e g bfrs and plasticizers were present uniformly in the plastic matrix and there are no excess additive molecules on the plastic water boundary layer thus diffusion in the aqueous boundary layer cannot be a rate limiting step in fact diffusion within polymers has been well argued as the rate limiting step in the transfers of hocs from microplastics to sediment dwelling organisms teuten et al 2007 2009 in the conceptual model developed to simulate the effect of plastic on bioaccumulation of hocs koelmans et al 2013 considered that transfer of contaminants from pe plastic into the lugworm arenicola marina is controlled by diffusion in the polymer only teuten et al 2009 assumed that desorption of hocs from plastic spheres is limited by diffusion through the polymer matrix and estimated that the diffusion coefficients of toluene o xylene and tetrachloroethylene in hdpe and polyvinyl chloride pvc were in the ranges of 10 14 m2 s 1 and 10 17 10 18 m2 s 1 respectively narváez valderrama et al 2016 also predicted the releases of microplastic additives in aquatic environment based on the assumption that the mass transfer is solely controlled by diffusion within the microplastic sphere according to the linear dependence of both log10 d and e a of diffusants in different types of plastics including ps polymethyl methacrylate pmma and pvc on their molecular diameters figs s6 and s7 the diffusion coefficients at 20 c of bde 7 15 118 138 153 154 206 207 208 and 209 in ps pmma and pvc could be estimated tables s10 and s11 based on the diffusion coefficients of pcb 52 66 110 118 in polytetrafluoroethylen ptfe t g 129 c polyetheretherketone peek t g 162 c pp t g 10 c hdpe t g 120 c and ldpe t g 120 c liu et al 2014 the log10 d data for these diffusants in the matrices of various plastics could be described by the simple linear functions of t g fig s8 apparently log10 d of pbdes in plastics can also be described as a linear function of t g because of the similar molecular structures of pbdes and pcbs fig 5 a as a result of their larger molecular sizes the values of log10 d for pbdes decrease faster as the t g of the plastic increases compared to pcbs brown and park 1970 similarly the predicted log10 d values of bde 209 in a range of microplastics that occur commonly in the marine environment also exhibit the trend of linear dependence on the t g values of plastics fig 5b microplastics could be a source of pbdes in aquatic environment and pose risk to aquatic organisms the typical gut retention times of microplastics are 2 5 h and 3 20 days for lugworm and north sea cod respectively booij et al 2003 koelmans et al 2014 narváez valderrama et al 2016 figs 6 and s9 depict the fractions of pbdes leached out of different types of microplastic pellets as a function of their particle sizes predicted under the assumption that their overall mass transfer is limited by diffusion within the plastic matrix for a retention time of 0 15 day only bde 7 and 15 could leach out of ldpe pa pp and ps pellets of 0 01 mm in diameter or smaller while no significant bde 209 leaching could occur within such a short time period table s12 in contrast pbdes could not leach out from pet abs pmma pvc and ca pellets in the common size range 0 01 5 mm of microplastics it should be noted that the above estimation only holds for an ideal scenario where the gut of organism is considered as an infinite sink similar to that assumed in previous modeling efforts koelmans et al 2013 narváez valderrama et al 2016 the actual leaching rates of bfrs could be reduced due to the decreased fugacity gradient in the organism gut while the presence of stomach oil and digestive fluid may enhance their leaching through modifying the plastic matrix as discussed later under the infinite sink scenario and in the absence of plastic matrix modification appreciable releases of all the pbdes from the ldpe microplastic pellets would occur when the gut retention time is increased to 11 5 days table s13 bde 7 and 15 could leach out of ps particles of less than 0 1 mm and they could also leach out of pet and abs pellets of less than 0 01 mm in diameter none of the pbdes 1 could leach out of pmma and pvc pellets larger than 0 01 mm leaching of bde 209 from all the microplastics under both body retention times is insignificant tables s12 and s13 which is consistent with the absence of significant bde 209 release from ldpe microplastics under gut retention times of 0 25 and 20 d at 20 c reported in a recent study narváez valderrama et al 2016 under the simple model scenario the leaching of bfrs from microplastics is very slow due to their extremely low diffusion coefficients in the plastic matrices bfrs contained in the microplastics can also impact seabirds it has been reported that microplastics could be retained in the ventriculus of seabirds for six months or more and worn down in the muscular structures ryan 1988 spear et al 1995 once in the bodies of seabirds bfrs in the plastic matrix could leach out slowly and become bioavailable mato et al 2001 bde 209 has been detected as the major bfrs in the liver and abdominal adipose of seabirds with bde 207 being most abundant among the nona bdes tanaka et al 2015 that is with sufficiently long body retention times significant leaching of deca and nona bdes from microplastic pellets could occur previous studies have demonstrated that microplastics could act as a vector for the assimilation of hocs into marine organisms besseling et al 2012 observed that ingestion of ps microplastics pre equilibrated with the sediment that was natively contaminated with pcbs at a low ps dose of 0 074 increased the bioaccumulation of pcbs by a factor of 1 1 3 6 in lugworm arenicola marina l chua et al 2014 observed that the tissue of marine amphipod can assimilate pbdes derived from pe pellets with the gut fluids playing an important role of preferentially removing certain adsorbed pbdes a recent study found that the microplastics ingested by european seabass could affect the liver detoxification and lipid distribution of some pcbs and pbdes sorbed to microplastics and thus exacerbate their toxic effects granby et al 2018 bakir et al 2014a b observed that salinity exhibited no significant effect on the kinetics of sorption and desorption of phenanthrene dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp on pvc or pe microplastics while their desorption rates were faster in the presence of a gut surfactant than in seawater alone it should be noted that the hocs investigated in the above studies were sorbed to the microplastics instead of distributed uniformly within the plastic matrices with diffusion of bfrs within the microplastic matrix controlling their overall release rates it is unlikely that the presence of organic constituents in the leaching medium could significantly accelerate their leaching when the structure of the plastic matrix is not affected overall leaching of bfrs from microplastics is very slow due to their extremely low diffusion coefficients in the plastic matrices thus they could only pose relatively low risk to marine organisms based on the empirical relationships between log10 d and the t g of plastics as well as the size of microplastics releases of bfrs from microplastic ingested by marine organisms can be estimated however it should be noted that the above analysis holds only when the physical and chemical structures of the microplastic pieces remain intact the gradual breakdown of micrplastics in the digestive systems of organisms could reduce their particle sizes and thus significantly enhance the releases of bfrs from their matrices furthermore the swelling of plastic matrix could loosen the polymer chains and facilitate diffusion of bfrs narváez valderrama et al 2016 observed that swelling of ldpe caused by spiking with n hexane resulted in more homogenous distribution of pbde congeners in ldpe compared to spiking with methanol water in the study of lee et al 2018 hocs were loaded onto the plastic sheets by soaking them in n hexane containing these chemicals for 24 h and good swelling of the plastic sheets was noted the diffusion coefficients of hexachlorocyclohexanes and chlorinated benzenes in the pe and pp sheets after swelling by n hexane were on the orders of 10 14 and 10 16 m2 s 1 respectively lee et al 2018 which are several orders of magnitude higher than those of bfrs in the matrices of abs microplastics determined in this study this could be caused by the facts that the steric hindrance for diffusion of hexachlorocyclohexanes and chlorinated benzenes in the swollen pe and pp matrices was significantly reduced and these molecules are much less bulky compared to bfrs tanaka et al 2015 observed that only trace amounts of bde 209 could be leached out of hdpe plates containing bde 209 when soaked in distilled water seawater and acidic pepsin solution in contrast the amounts of bde 209 leached over 15 days increased by more than 20 and 50 times when the plates were soaked in the stomach oil of seabird and fish oil tanaka et al 2015 such drastic enhancement in bde 209 leaching probably resulted from significant reduction in the steric hindrance of the ldpe matrix on diffusion of bfrs with loosening of the polymer chains after penetration of the oil components therefore the magnitude of bfr releases would be under estimated based on their diffusion coefficients in the unaltered plastic matrices future study should focus on quantifying the impact of digestive fluids and lipids on the diffusion of bfrs in plastic matrices to better evaluate the bio accessibility of bfrs in microplastics ingested by marine organisms 5 conclusions the leaching of bfrs from microplastic pellets processed from two model waste plastics in water at environmentally relevant temperatures was investigated in this study the experimental data consistently support that the release rates of bfrs from the abs microplastics evaluated in this study were limited solely by their diffusion within the plastic matrix the leaching kinetics of bfrs could be described by the fick s second law and their diffusion coefficients and the apparent activation energies were found to be in the ranges of 10 28 30 10 20 84 m2 s 1 and 64 1 to 131 8 kj mol 1 respectively based on the empirical relationships between log10 d and the t g of plastics and molecular size of diffusant the diffusion coefficients of pbdes in the matrices of microplastics that appear commonly in the marine environment including ldpe hdpe ps pa pet ca were also predicted as a result of their extremely slow diffusion within the matrices of microplastics the half lives for releases of bfrs could range from tens of thousands to hundreds of billions of years if their physical and chemical structures could remain intact on the other hand the leaching rates of bfrs could increase greatly with further breakdown of microplastics in aquatic environment and alteration of their polymer structures under the actions of digestive fluids once ingested by organisms therefore understanding the physical and chemical weathering processes that can cause the breakdown of microplastics in the natural environment and the interactions of digestive fluids and lipids with the plastic matrices in organism bodies is critical for more accurate prediction of the releases of bfrs from the microplastics and assessment of their risk acknowledgement the authors are thankful to the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive comments on an earlier

19063,microplastics 5 mm are increasingly detected in aquatic environment and the high levels of brominated flame retardants bfrs contained in them can potentially impact water quality this study characterized the release kinetics of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe from millimeter sized microplastic pellets in water at environmentally relevant temperatures leaching rates of bfrs from the microplastic pellets made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs were found to be controlled by their diffusion within the plastic matrix and their diffusion coefficients d in the plastic matrices ranged from 10 28 30 to 10 20 84 m2 s 1 the apparent activation energies of the bfrs diffusion coefficients were estimated to be in the range of 64 1 131 8 kj mol 1 based on their temperature dependence and the arrhenius equation the diffusion coefficients of the bfrs decrease with their molecular diameters while the activation energies for diffusion increase with the molecular diameters which are indicative of significant steric hindrance for bfr diffusion within the plastic matrices a semi empirical linear relationship was observed between log10 d and the glass transition temperature t g of plastics which allows prediction of the diffusion coefficients of bfrs in other types of microplastics commonly found in marine environment the half lives of bfr leaching i e 50 depletion from the microplastic pellets would range from tens of thousands to hundreds of billions of years at ambient temperatures if their physical and chemical structures could remain intact although the release fluxes of bfrs from microplastics are extremely low under the model conditions a range of physical and chemical processes in the natural environment and the digestive systems of organisms that ingested them could potentially accelerate their leaching by causing breakdown and swelling of the plastic matrices graphical abstract image 1 keywords brominated flame retardants bfrs microplastic release kinetics diffusion coefficient activation energy aquatic environment 1 introduction with properties that can be engineered to meet the demand of almost any applications plastics have increasingly displaced wood metal and glass in a wide range of products over the past several decades the global production of plastics has exceeded 300 million tonnes in 2014 lebreton et al 2017 and the industry is expected to continue to grow up to 10 of the plastics used by the society are believed to end up in the oceans where they can last very long times because of their chemical stability andrady 2011 abundant waste plastics have been found in oceans and polar regions derraik 2002 waller et al 2017 recently microplastics which are plastic pieces of less than 5 mm in size as defined by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa have emerged as an important concern in the marine environment castillo et al 2016 microplastics are generated from the disintegration of large pieces of plastic materials such as monofilament line plastic strapping and plastic bags under the action of external forces and solar radiation andrady 2011 derraik 2002 they can be subsequently suspended in the sea water or deposit to the ocean bottom and become components of the sediments microplastics occurring in oceans pose potential risk to marine ecosystems and they have been found in organisms of different trophic levels in the marine food chain besseling et al 2012 gaylor et al 2013 once ingested by marine organisms microplastics can produce mechanical damage and block the eating organ resulting in reduction of nutrient absorption starvation injury and even death of the organisms andrady 2011 derraik 2002 spear et al 1995 in addition microplastics also act as a source of organic pollutants ingestion of microplastics by biota could lead to increased exposure to plastic additives such as brominated flame retardants bfrs gandara e silva et al 2016 narváez valderrama et al 2016 tanaka et al 2015 polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are a major class of bfrs that have been widely used in electronic and electrical products they were later discovered to have significant negative effects on human health and the use of those with high biological toxicity including penta bdes octa bdes and deca bde bde 209 were gradually phased out in the 2000s nonetheless pbdes including the banned ones continue to exist in the plastics of a wide variety of current use and discarded electrical and electronic products and are thus widely detected in environmental matrices meanwhile new bfrs such as 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe have been developed as substitutes unfortunately these alternative bfrs have also been increasingly detected in the environment yang et al 2012 as bfrs are mechanically added into the polymer blocks of plastics without formation of chemical bonds they can escape from the plastic matrix over time despite of their low volatilities and poor water solubilities gaylor et al 2013 plastics can gradually lose structural integrity during use and after being disposed of through processes such as weathering wear and tear and pulverization resulting in breakaway of small fragments from the bulk plastic body andrady 2011 teuten et al 2009 consequently releases of the additives from the plastics can be significantly accelerated due to the physical and or chemical disintegration of their matrices gaylor et al 2013 to date research on pollution of microplastics has focused mainly on their ecological effect and to a less extent on their role as a sink for hydrophobic organic chemicals hocs in the marine environment bakir et al 2014a mato et al 2001 the release of plastic additives bfrs in particular from microplastics in aquatic environment has received little attention this study was conducted to evaluate the release kinetics of bfrs from millimeter sized pellets of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs a common type of microplastic found in the environment castillo et al 2016 in water at environmentally relevant temperatures although the types of microplastics in the environment are diverse the release rates obtained and the dependence of diffusion coefficient on molecular size of the diffusant and the glass transition temperature t g of the plastic matrix observed could provide important insights for assessing the release kinetics of bfrs from other types of microplastics and thus help assess their risk in aquatic environment 2 materials and method 2 1

grinding the plastic rear covers of two computer displays and then sieving with wire meshes supplementary data their bfr contents were determined by exhaustive extraction sequential microwave assisted extraction for five times and quantitation using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms supplementary data the contents of bfrs in the microplastic pellets are summarized in table s1 low density polyethylene ldpe sheets 50 μm thick were purchased from maolu plastic changzhou china stripes of ldpe 2 cm 3 cm were successively pre cleaned by soaking in dichoromethane for 48 h methanol for 24 h and triple distilled water for 24 h the pre cleaned ldpe stripes were cleaned again in triple distilled water immediately before being used to ensure cleanness all laboratory glassware used was soaked in chromic acid mixture for 12 h then cleaned with tap water and triple distilled water successively finally oven dried at 450 c for 4 h prior to use 2 2 bfr release experiment kinetics of bfr releases from the plastic pellets was investigated in sealed glass bottles using ldpe film as the infinite sink approximately 1 00 g 0 1 mg of plastic pellets were wrapped in copper wire of 180 mesh and inserted into 100 ml wide mouth glass bottles wrapped with aluminum foil followed by three stripes of pre cleaned ldpe film the bottles were then filled with triple distilled water sealed and equilibrated in dark constant temperature chambers 10 and 30 c to avoid potential breakdown of the microplastic pellets no mechanical mixing was used during the course of leaching experiment although marine water could be a more realistic environmental medium to study the leaching behaviors of the bfrs from the plastic pieces it has been demonstrated that there was little difference in the leaching of bde 209 from high density polyethylene hdpe plates soaked in distilled water seawater and acidic pepsin solution tanaka et al 2015 triple distilled water was used in this study because the diffusion within the polymeric matrix was believed to be the rate limiting step in the overall release processes and it eliminated the need to control microbial growth during the experimental period at preset sampling time points the ldpe stripes were taken out of the sealed bottles and rinsed with triple distilled water and then extracted consecutively with 20 ml dichloromethane for 24 h and 20 ml hexane for 24 h each extract was concentrated to 5 10 ml by rotary evaporation at 30 c passed through a glass column filled with anhydrous na2so4 then further concentrated to 1 ml by nitrogen blowdown finally the extract was solvent exchanged to about 30 or 1000 μl of hexane depending on the targeted analytes the ldpe and water samples were spiked with 13c pcb 209 as a recovery standard prior to being extracted and all experiments were conducted in triplicates bfrs were analyzed by gc ms following the methods reported in our previous work sun et al 2016 the contents of bfrs in the microplastic pellets could be treated as essentially constant because only negligible fractions 5 94 10 7 1 82 10 3 of them leached out during the experimental period instrument detection limits defined as three times of the signal to noise ratios ranged from 0 01 to 0 15 ng ml for the targeted analytes table s2 all measurement results reported were the averages of triplicated samples details of the quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures are presented in the supplementary data 2 3 modeling of bfr leaching kinetics fig 1 schematically illustrates the major mass transfer processes involved in the leaching of bfrs from the microplastic matrix to the ldpe strips in a close system leaching of a given bfr molecule occurs via five consecutive steps diffusion within the plastic matrix mass transfer across the microplastic water boundary layer diffusion in water mass transfer across the ldpe water boundary layer and diffusion in ldpe matrix esquerdo et al 2015 recasens et al 1989 in the absence of strong interactions between the fluid and plastic matrix i e no swelling or plasticization of the polymers leaching of bfrs from the approximately spherical plastic pellets can be considered as governed by the fick s second law lee et al 2018 vitrac et al 2007 1 c r t t d p 2 c r t r 2 0 r r where c is the local concentration of the bfr in the plastic matrix d p is the diffusion coefficient in the plastic matrix and r is the characteristic dimension of the plastic layer and is equal to the radius of the plastic pellets the rate controlling step among the various mass transfer processes involved in the release of bfrs from microplastic pellets to water and their subsequent sorption on the ldpe film can be evaluated with the mass transfer biot number b i which represents the ratio of the rate of transport across the liquid boundary layer to the rate of diffusion within the plastic phase b i is calculated as vitrac et al 2007 2 b i k m l d where d is the diffusion coefficient in the plastic phase d p or d ldpe which could be the abs microplastic pellet or the ldpe film depending on the mass transfer process studied and l is the characteristic dimension of the plastic layer which is the radius r of the plastic pellets or half of the thickness of the ldpe film k m is the mass transfer coefficient in the plastic water boundary layer and can be estimated as booij et al 2003 crank 1975 3 k m d w k p w δ where d w is the diffusion coefficient of bfr in water k pw is its plastic water partition coefficient and δ is the thickness of the aqueous boundary layer which can be approximated as the radius of the microplastic pellets for mass transfer from the plastic pellets to water or half of the thickness of the ldpe film for mass transfer from water to the ldpe film the value of d w can be estimated from the hayduk laudie correlation hayduk and laudie 1974 4 d w 13 26 10 9 μ 1 4 v m 0 589 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s v m is the lebas molar volume cm3 mol 1 and can be calculated from the molecular structure of the diffusant using a simple additive method reid et al 1977 5 v m 7 n c n h n o n d b 31 5 n b r 7 where the subscripts c h and o stand for atoms of carbon hydrogen and oxygen respectively and db stands for double bond n is the number of these atoms and bonds and the last value is counted once for diffusants with one or more aromatic rings when both the diffusive mass transfer within the solid matrix and the external mass transfer are considered the released mass fraction m t m 0 of a substance from a spherical pellet with a radius r under the infinite sink conditions can be calculated as crank 1975 6 m t m 0 1 n 1 6 b i 2 exp β n 2 d p t r 2 β n 2 β n 2 b i b i 1 where β n are the roots of 7 β n c o t β n b i 1 0 as detailed in the supplementary data depending on the value of b i m t m 0 can be approximated as different functions of d p r and t 8 m t m 0 a d p t r 2 b i 1 n 1 d p t r 2 o r n 2 d p t r 2 1 2 1 b i 100 6 π d p t r 2 1 2 b i 100 where a n 1 and n 2 are constants with values equal to the slopes of the linear regression lines for different b i values shown on fig s3 while the fractions of bfrs released from the microplastic pellets over 150 days were in the ranges of 10 5 72 to 10 2 74 the model predicts that all the bfrs in the microplastic pellets would have been completely released by 150 days at 30 c i e m t m 0 1 for the cases of b i 1 and 1 b i 100 table s3 thus the b i values for releases of bfrs from the microplastic pellets must be greater than 100 based on fitting of the experimentally observed m t m 0 values b i ranged from 109 to 1015 for different bfrs table s4 figure s4 shows the plots of m t m 0 versus d p t r 2 1 2 for the releases of pbdes and btbpe from the two types of microplastic pellets good linearity is observed in all cases and the slopes of the fitted lines for the releases of bfrs from the pellets 30 40 mesh of plastics a 3 31 0 54 and b 3 38 0 29 are all reasonably close to the value of 6 π i e 3 38 these results consistently indicate that the release kinetics of bfrs from the microplastic pellets could be well described by the following equation for b i 100 9 m t m 0 6 π d p t r 2 1 2 as a result d p can be estimated as 10 d p π r 2 36 t m t m 0 2 the mass transfer biot number reflects the relative importance of the external mass transfer and the diffusive mass transfer within the solid matrix it has been reported that external mass transport resistance controls the mass transfer step when b i 1 for hoc desorption from spherical particles and diffusion in the plastic is the step controlling mass transfer when b i is greater than 100 while both mass transfer steps are important when b i is between 1 and 100 cho et al 2006 for desorption of water from a flat slab diffusion in the matrix has been shown to control the overall mass transfer when b i is above 30 cdrdova quiroz et al 1996 based on the typical values of the related parameters the values of b i for diffusion of bfrs from the plastic matrix to the aqueous phase are much greater than 100 109 1016 and are orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding ones for their transport from the aqueous phase onto the ldpe film table s4 that is diffusion of bfrs within the matrix of microplastics is the overall rate limiting step in the leaching system fig 1 which is also consistent with the previous findings that the diffusion rates of bfrs within the microplastic pellets were far smaller than those within the aqueous phase and the ldpe film mato et al 2001 narváez valderrama et al 2016 as a result it is reasonable to assume that the overall leaching of bfrs which are initially distributed homogeneously in the matrix of microplastic pellets is controlled solely by their diffusion within the plastic matrix accordingly the fraction of bfrs leached m t m 0 from the microplastic pellets at a given time t can be estimated as crank 1975 11 m t m 0 1 6 π 2 n 1 1 n 2 exp d p n 2 π 2 t r 2 based on the poisson s equation the above equation can be transformed and re arranged as reichenberg 1953 12 m t m 0 6 π 3 2 b t 3 π 2 b t 6 π 3 2 0 b t n 1 e n 2 π 2 b t b t d b t where b d p π 2 r 2 because only the first two terms of equation 12 are significant reichenberg 1953 it can be reduced to 13 m t m 0 6 π 3 2 b t 3 π 2 b t as the fractions of bfrs that leached out of the microplastic pellets were only in the range of 10 5 72 to 10 2 74 over the experimental period equation 13 can be further simplified as 14 m t m 0 6 π 3 2 b t 6 π 3 2 d p π 2 t r 2 6 π d p t r 2 1 2 equations 9 and 14 are identical that is after incorporation of the partition constants of bfrs between plastic pellets and the surrounding water at the interface the model is the same for the specific set of conditions in this study as that derived based on the assumption that the external resistance in the plastic water boundary layer is negligible compared to that of mass transfer within the plastic matrix 3 results 3 1 leaching rates of bfrs as shown on table s1 bde 209 which was present at 63 00 1 26 and 910 9 19 5 μg g in plastics a and b respectively accounted for 85 of the total pbdes in both plastics while di bdes to hexa bdes occurred at μg g levels btbpe a replacement for octa bde was also detected at rather high levels in them a 6 06 0 10 mg g b 660 00 2 98 μg g the leaching behaviors of pbdes and btbpe from the microplastic pellets 30 40 mesh in water are shown on fig s5 the masses of bfrs leached quantified from those accumulated on the ldpe strips increased linearly over time which indicates that the uptake capacities of the ldpe stripes for the bfrs were not saturated i e they functioned as an infinite sink during the experimental period table s5 the leaching fluxes of bfrs from microplastics a and b were 0 28 38 90 and 0 16 7 43 ng m 2 d 1 at 10 c and 2 24 116 31 and 0 86 38 16 ng m 2 d 1 at 30 c respectively as expected the most abundant bfrs in the microplastic pellets bde 209 and btbpe also had the highest leaching fluxes based on the data reported by tanaka et al 2015 the flux of bde 209 leaching from hdpe plate 2 mm 3 mm 3 mm in aqueous media distilled water seawater and pepsin solution at 20 c was up to 2 10 105 ng m 2 d 1 tanaka et al 2015 which is 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those observed for bde 209 leaching from the microplastic pellets here this may be due to the much lower t g of hdpe compared to that of abs plastics evaluated in this study as discussed later according to the results of field sorption experiment conducted by mato and co workers the combined sorption rate of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs onto polypropylene pp 0 1 0 5 cm pellets in seawater was approximately 0 1 ng g 1 d 1 at 12 c mato et al 2001 this translates to an area specific sorption rate of up to 45 5 ng m 2 d 1 which is comparable to the leaching fluxes of bfrs σ9pbdes btbpe from the microplastic pellets of 30 40 mesh at 10 c observed in this study table s6 3 2 diffusion coefficients of bfrs in plastic matrices table 1 summarizes the estimated values for diffusion coefficients d of pbdes and btbpe in the matrices of plastics a and b at 10 and 30 c the values of logd m2 s 1 for pbdes and btbpe ranged from 28 30 to 22 06 and from 26 80 to 21 04 at 10 and 30 c in the matrix of plastic a respectively while the corresponding values were 25 71 to 21 93 at 10 c and 24 42 to 20 84 at 30 c in the matrix of plastic b although both materials were made primarily of abs the manufacturing processes and the types and amounts of additives e g plasticizers and flame retardants added to the polymers probably changed over the years compared to plastic b manufactured in 2005 plastic a manufactured in 1994 had been subjected to aging for a much longer time while its polymer structure was probably more compact and thus had greater steric hindrance for the diffusing bfr molecules besides increasing the surface area of microplastics weathering introduces a variety of oxygen containing functional groups to the polymers which can slow down the diffusion rates of hydrophobic molecules within the plastic matrix due to the increased inter molecular forces satoto et al 1997 on the other hand re arrangement of the amorphous part caused by weathering of polymers can contribute to a slight increase in their crystallinity satoto et al 1997 which also reduces the diffusion rates of hydrophobic molecules within the plastic matrix polymers with low t g values have greater chain segmental mobility allowing diffusant molecules to move more easily george and thomas 2001 the diffusion coefficient of benzene in various polymers at 25 c has been shown to increase with decreases in the polymer s t g brown and park 1970 the diffusant s diffusion coefficient in plastic matrix can be predicted from the t g of the plastic based on the following relationship brown and park 1970 16 ln d c b f v where c is an empirical constant b is a constant that depends on the critical local free volume needed for diffusion and its value increases with the molecular size of the diffusant and f v is the fractional free volume of the diffusant at temperature t f v can be estimated as 17 f v f g a 1 a 2 t t g where a 1 and a 2 are the expansion coefficients in the glassy state and at the transition to the rubbery state respectively and f g is the fraction of free space in the polymer at t g reduction in the diffusivity of diffusant in polymers with increasing glass transition temperatures has long been documented van amerongen 1950 for example the diffusion coefficients of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and pcbs permeating through silicone rubbers which have some of the lowest t g values of plastics were much higher than those in ldpe rusina et al 2007 2010a based on the molecular volumes 0 18 0 34 nm3 xu et al 2007 the mean molecular diameter d of pbdes are estimated to be in the range of 0 55 0 70 nm table s7 as shown on fig 2 the log10 d values of pbdes in the matrices of microplastics a and b depend linearly on their molecular diameters and apparently follow the linear line established by berens and hopfenberg 1982 according to the fitting method reported by brown and park 1970 it is reasonable to expect that the diffusion coefficients of pbdes in abs are close to those in polystyrene ps because they have comparable t g values 100 c based on the linear relationship between log10 d and the molecular diameter of diffusant in ps at 30 c the values of log10 d m2 s 1 for pbdes in abs are about 19 bde 1 to 23 bde 209 which are higher than those of bde 209 in the matrices of plastic b 23 99 and plastic a 26 38 it is obvious that the measured diffusion coefficients of pbdes are much lower than those estimated from the linear relationship which was established from anisometric molecules e g normal alkanes compared with the anisometric molecules pbdes molecules have rigid symmetric spherical structures thus they diffuse more slowly than the more elongated molecules of same molecular masses which have greater conformational freedom berens and hopfenberg 1982 rusina et al 2010b although the bfr molecules are additives and only interact with the plastic matrix through van der waals force and hydrogen bonding the rather low diffusion coefficients probably arise from the significant steric hindrance due to the need for constant bending of certain chemical bonds during their diffusion through the tight polymer brushes 3 3 leaching half lives of bfrs from microplastics table 1 also summarizes the activation energies e a for diffusion coefficients of the bfrs estimated from their temperature dependence based on the arrhenius equation the e a values ranged from 64 1 to 131 8 and 75 3 to 120 8 kj mol 1 in the matrices of plastics a and b respectively fig 3 plots the activation energies for diffusion coefficients of bfrs in the plastic matrices as a function of their molecular diameters the e a values for diffusion of pbdes in the abs plastics roughly observe the linear trend line between e a and the molecular diameter of diffusant observed in ps plastic reported by berens and hopfenberg 1982 the activation energies for diffusion of pbdes are higher than those of anisometric molecules e g normal alkanes of comparable sizes probably because of the lower conformational freedom associated with their rigid symmetric structures the release rates of bfrs from the two plastic materials in the air were measured in our previous study sun et al 2016 and their values were found to be in the same bulk ranges with the reported rates of pbde releases from tv plastics and waste tv hirai et al 2006 kemmlein et al 2003 ortuño et al 2015 as shown in tables 1 and s8 the diffusion coefficients of bfrs and the corresponding activation energies of diffusion in the two plastic materials determined with the leaching experiment in aqueous medium are comparable to those estimated based on their releases to the air these results further corroborate that diffusion within the plastic matrix is the rate controlling step in the releases of bfrs from the abs microplastic pellets irrespective of the surrounding medium e g air or water based on the arrhenius equation the diffusion coefficients and thus leaching half lives i e time for depletion of 50 of the initial masses of bfrs from microplastic pellets can be predicted at different ambient temperatures table s9 millions to hundreds of billions of years could be required for half of the bde 206 207 208 209 and btbpe to leach out of the microplastic pellets at 10 and 30 c if their structures could remain intact due to their very slow leaching rates under ambient conditions the bfrs contained in microplastics could pose very low risk to the marine environment when only diffusion is considered nonetheless in natural environment a range of processes such as breakdown of plastic matrix by physical and chemical processes and alteration of the polymer structure e g by uv exposure and swelling of the plastic matrix brought by the presence of organic phase can significantly enhance the releases of bfrs from microplastics and thus increase their risk as discussed later the size of the microplastic pellets also plays a key role in controlling the leaching rates of bfrs mechanical abrasion and chemical processes can damage the structural integrity of the plastic matrix and increase the specific surface areas of microplastics accelerating the releases of bfrs gaylor et al 2013 fig 4 shows the leaching of pbdes from microplastics a and b of 10 20 and 50 100 mesh sizes at 10 c along with the model predictions as expected the leaching rates of bfrs increased significantly with reduction in their particle sizes these results indicate that further breakdown of microplastics in marine environment would accelerate the leaching of bfrs due to the increase in their surface area to volume ratios consequently the actual times for releases of significant portions of the bfrs out of the microplastics would be greatly reduced 4 discussion diffusion in the plastic matrix and diffusion in the plastic water boundary layer are important steps involved in the leaching or desorption of hocs from plastic materials depending on the physiochemical properties of the hoc and the environmental conditions either diffusion in the plastic matrix or diffusion in the plastic water boundary layer or both could control the overall mass transfer rate lee et al 2018 observed that the desorption of hocs with low 103 and high 104 plastic water partition coefficients from polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp sheets was controlled by diffusion in the plastic film and diffusion in the aqueous boundary layer respectively although diffusion across the plastic water boundary layer is usually a rate limiting step for hocs with kow 104 in planar passive samplers lohmann 2012 rusina et al 2007 the approximately spherical shape of the microplastic pellets in this study would result in a much steeper concentration gradient across the boundary layer schwarzenbach et al 2003 the extremely high b i values for the mass transfer of bfrs from the microplastic pellets to aqueous phase indicate that their releases were limited by the diffusion within the plastic matrix and the leaching process was independent of the boundary conditions endo et al 2013 investigated the long term 128 days desorption of pcbs from field collected marine plastic pellets that had relatively high pcb concentrations the desorption kinetics could not be described by an intra particle diffusion model but followed an aqueous boundary layer diffusion model and the diffusion coefficients of pcb congeners in pe pellets were estimated to be in the range of 10 13 10 15 m2 s 1 endo et al 2013 nonetheless it should be noted that although pcb congeners were not spiked onto these field collected pe pellets they sorbed from the environment onto them and thus were more enriched near the surface layer of the plastic pellets theoretically the greater abundance of sorbate molecules at the particle surface would render diffusion in the plastic matrix less important i e there are already enough supply of sorbate molecules on the plastic water boundary layer in contrast the additives e g bfrs and plasticizers were present uniformly in the plastic matrix and there are no excess additive molecules on the plastic water boundary layer thus diffusion in the aqueous boundary layer cannot be a rate limiting step in fact diffusion within polymers has been well argued as the rate limiting step in the transfers of hocs from microplastics to sediment dwelling organisms teuten et al 2007 2009 in the conceptual model developed to simulate the effect of plastic on bioaccumulation of hocs koelmans et al 2013 considered that transfer of contaminants from pe plastic into the lugworm arenicola marina is controlled by diffusion in the polymer only teuten et al 2009 assumed that desorption of hocs from plastic spheres is limited by diffusion through the polymer matrix and estimated that the diffusion coefficients of toluene o xylene and tetrachloroethylene in hdpe and polyvinyl chloride pvc were in the ranges of 10 14 m2 s 1 and 10 17 10 18 m2 s 1 respectively narváez valderrama et al 2016 also predicted the releases of microplastic additives in aquatic environment based on the assumption that the mass transfer is solely controlled by diffusion within the microplastic sphere according to the linear dependence of both log10 d and e a of diffusants in different types of plastics including ps polymethyl methacrylate pmma and pvc on their molecular diameters figs s6 and s7 the diffusion coefficients at 20 c of bde 7 15 118 138 153 154 206 207 208 and 209 in ps pmma and pvc could be estimated tables s10 and s11 based on the diffusion coefficients of pcb 52 66 110 118 in polytetrafluoroethylen ptfe t g 129 c polyetheretherketone peek t g 162 c pp t g 10 c hdpe t g 120 c and ldpe t g 120 c liu et al 2014 the log10 d data for these diffusants in the matrices of various plastics could be described by the simple linear functions of t g fig s8 apparently log10 d of pbdes in plastics can also be described as a linear function of t g because of the similar molecular structures of pbdes and pcbs fig 5 a as a result of their larger molecular sizes the values of log10 d for pbdes decrease faster as the t g of the plastic increases compared to pcbs brown and park 1970 similarly the predicted log10 d values of bde 209 in a range of microplastics that occur commonly in the marine environment also exhibit the trend of linear dependence on the t g values of plastics fig 5b microplastics could be a source of pbdes in aquatic environment and pose risk to aquatic organisms the typical gut retention times of microplastics are 2 5 h and 3 20 days for lugworm and north sea cod respectively booij et al 2003 koelmans et al 2014 narváez valderrama et al 2016 figs 6 and s9 depict the fractions of pbdes leached out of different types of microplastic pellets as a function of their particle sizes predicted under the assumption that their overall mass transfer is limited by diffusion within the plastic matrix for a retention time of 0 15 day only bde 7 and 15 could leach out of ldpe pa pp and ps pellets of 0 01 mm in diameter or smaller while no significant bde 209 leaching could occur within such a short time period table s12 in contrast pbdes could not leach out from pet abs pmma pvc and ca pellets in the common size range 0 01 5 mm of microplastics it should be noted that the above estimation only holds for an ideal scenario where the gut of organism is considered as an infinite sink similar to that assumed in previous modeling efforts koelmans et al 2013 narváez valderrama et al 2016 the actual leaching rates of bfrs could be reduced due to the decreased fugacity gradient in the organism gut while the presence of stomach oil and digestive fluid may enhance their leaching through modifying the plastic matrix as discussed later under the infinite sink scenario and in the absence of plastic matrix modification appreciable releases of all the pbdes from the ldpe microplastic pellets would occur when the gut retention time is increased to 11 5 days table s13 bde 7 and 15 could leach out of ps particles of less than 0 1 mm and they could also leach out of pet and abs pellets of less than 0 01 mm in diameter none of the pbdes 1 could leach out of pmma and pvc pellets larger than 0 01 mm leaching of bde 209 from all the microplastics under both body retention times is insignificant tables s12 and s13 which is consistent with the absence of significant bde 209 release from ldpe microplastics under gut retention times of 0 25 and 20 d at 20 c reported in a recent study narváez valderrama et al 2016 under the simple model scenario the leaching of bfrs from microplastics is very slow due to their extremely low diffusion coefficients in the plastic matrices bfrs contained in the microplastics can also impact seabirds it has been reported that microplastics could be retained in the ventriculus of seabirds for six months or more and worn down in the muscular structures ryan 1988 spear et al 1995 once in the bodies of seabirds bfrs in the plastic matrix could leach out slowly and become bioavailable mato et al 2001 bde 209 has been detected as the major bfrs in the liver and abdominal adipose of seabirds with bde 207 being most abundant among the nona bdes tanaka et al 2015 that is with sufficiently long body retention times significant leaching of deca and nona bdes from microplastic pellets could occur previous studies have demonstrated that microplastics could act as a vector for the assimilation of hocs into marine organisms besseling et al 2012 observed that ingestion of ps microplastics pre equilibrated with the sediment that was natively contaminated with pcbs at a low ps dose of 0 074 increased the bioaccumulation of pcbs by a factor of 1 1 3 6 in lugworm arenicola marina l chua et al 2014 observed that the tissue of marine amphipod can assimilate pbdes derived from pe pellets with the gut fluids playing an important role of preferentially removing certain adsorbed pbdes a recent study found that the microplastics ingested by european seabass could affect the liver detoxification and lipid distribution of some pcbs and pbdes sorbed to microplastics and thus exacerbate their toxic effects granby et al 2018 bakir et al 2014a b observed that salinity exhibited no significant effect on the kinetics of sorption and desorption of phenanthrene dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp on pvc or pe microplastics while their desorption rates were faster in the presence of a gut surfactant than in seawater alone it should be noted that the hocs investigated in the above studies were sorbed to the microplastics instead of distributed uniformly within the plastic matrices with diffusion of bfrs within the microplastic matrix controlling their overall release rates it is unlikely that the presence of organic constituents in the leaching medium could significantly accelerate their leaching when the structure of the plastic matrix is not affected overall leaching of bfrs from microplastics is very slow due to their extremely low diffusion coefficients in the plastic matrices thus they could only pose relatively low risk to marine organisms based on the empirical relationships between log10 d and the t g of plastics as well as the size of microplastics releases of bfrs from microplastic ingested by marine organisms can be estimated however it should be noted that the above analysis holds only when the physical and chemical structures of the microplastic pieces remain intact the gradual breakdown of micrplastics in the digestive systems of organisms could reduce their particle sizes and thus significantly enhance the releases of bfrs from their matrices furthermore the swelling of plastic matrix could loosen the polymer chains and facilitate diffusion of bfrs narváez valderrama et al 2016 observed that swelling of ldpe caused by spiking with n hexane resulted in more homogenous distribution of pbde congeners in ldpe compared to spiking with methanol water in the study of lee et al 2018 hocs were loaded onto the plastic sheets by soaking them in n hexane containing these chemicals for 24 h and good swelling of the plastic sheets was noted the diffusion coefficients of hexachlorocyclohexanes and chlorinated benzenes in the pe and pp sheets after swelling by n hexane were on the orders of 10 14 and 10 16 m2 s 1 respectively lee et al 2018 which are several orders of magnitude higher than those of bfrs in the matrices of abs microplastics determined in this study this could be caused by the facts that the steric hindrance for diffusion of hexachlorocyclohexanes and chlorinated benzenes in the swollen pe and pp matrices was significantly reduced and these molecules are much less bulky compared to bfrs tanaka et al 2015 observed that only trace amounts of bde 209 could be leached out of hdpe plates containing bde 209 when soaked in distilled water seawater and acidic pepsin solution in contrast the amounts of bde 209 leached over 15 days increased by more than 20 and 50 times when the plates were soaked in the stomach oil of seabird and fish oil tanaka et al 2015 such drastic enhancement in bde 209 leaching probably resulted from significant reduction in the steric hindrance of the ldpe matrix on diffusion of bfrs with loosening of the polymer chains after penetration of the oil components therefore the magnitude of bfr releases would be under estimated based on their diffusion coefficients in the unaltered plastic matrices future study should focus on quantifying the impact of digestive fluids and lipids on the diffusion of bfrs in plastic matrices to better evaluate the bio accessibility of bfrs in microplastics ingested by marine organisms 5 conclusions the leaching of bfrs from microplastic pellets processed from two model waste plastics in water at environmentally relevant temperatures was investigated in this study the experimental data consistently support that the release rates of bfrs from the abs microplastics evaluated in this study were limited solely by their diffusion within the plastic matrix the leaching kinetics of bfrs could be described by the fick s second law and their diffusion coefficients and the apparent activation energies were found to be in the ranges of 10 28 30 10 20 84 m2 s 1 and 64 1 to 131 8 kj mol 1 respectively based on the empirical relationships between log10 d and the t g of plastics and molecular size of diffusant the diffusion coefficients of pbdes in the matrices of microplastics that appear commonly in the marine environment including ldpe hdpe ps pa pet ca were also predicted as a result of their extremely slow diffusion within the matrices of microplastics the half lives for releases of bfrs could range from tens of thousands to hundreds of billions of years if their physical and chemical structures could remain intact on the other hand the leaching rates of bfrs could increase greatly with further breakdown of microplastics in aquatic environment and alteration of their polymer structures under the actions of digestive fluids once ingested by organisms therefore understanding the physical and chemical weathering processes that can cause the breakdown of microplastics in the natural environment and the interactions of digestive fluids and lipids with the plastic matrices in organism bodies is critical for more accurate prediction of the

increased mineralization extent in all cases if compared to dark ozonation transformation products identified in individual runs suggest that amine oxidation and further alkyl chain attack is the main route of bezafibrate ozonation hydroxylation seems to be the preferential path in cotinine abatement while h abstraction from alcoholic moieties is suggested in the case of iopamidol toxicity of

this study has been conducted to analyse the combination of solar radiation simulated and ozone as a recent technology to enhance the efficiency of the ozonolysis when contaminants recalcitrant to single ozonation are present in aqueous matrix ozone can react with a high number of organic and inorganic compounds through two different paths namely by direct molecular reaction or alternatively by decomposition into free hydroxyl radicals generation of hydroxyl radicals is recommended when molecular ozone recalcitrant compounds are to be eliminated photolysis of ozone in the uva and visible regions leads to the generation of o 1d and ultimately to ho formation moreover shifts in the o3 spectrum as a function of the environment presence of water have been reported in the literature anglada et al 2014 the efficacy of the photolytic ozonation system has been investigated by using three pharmaceutical compounds cotinine iopamidol and bezafibrate with low moderate and high molecular ozone reactivity bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides this compound has been found in the environment e g in fish sediments suspended particulate matter colloidal phase and dissolved liu et al 2018 as well this compound could be found in the ppb range in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants guedes alonso et al 2013 bezafibrate s reactivity

consequence is frequently encountered in surface waters cotinine reactivity with ozone is considered low asghar et al 2018 rosal et al 2010 accordingly alternative routes of elimination through free

body structures not containing iodine to be visualized https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov 2018 this compound is easily found in wastewaters due to its chemical and biological recalcitrance matsushita et

reactor was placed the reactant solution was homogeneously maintained by vigorous magnetic stirring the emitted simulated solar radiation was restricted to different ranges by using suitable filters capable of cutting radiation below a specified wavelength value hence sunlight 300 800 nm storelight 360 800 nm and visible sources 390 800 nm were applied ozone was generated in an anseros com ad 01 device gaseous ozone concentration was monitored in an anseros gm apparatus fig 1 depicts the absorption spectra of the model compounds used in this study and the emission spectrum of the simulated solar radiation with the different filters used absorption spectra of ozone in water can be consulted elsewhere chávez et al 2016 oxidation experiments were conducted by simultaneously applying ozone and radiation when needed for comparison purposes dark ozonation was carried out under the same temperature profile occurring in the presence of radiation hence dark ozonation was conducted by switching on the solar box but covering the glass reactor with aluminum foil previous to analysis reaction samples were conveniently quenched by dissolved ozone removal after nitrogen bubbling this methodology was validated by comparing the analytical results of similar samples quenched with nitrogen bubbling and sodium sulfite as a rule of thumb initial concentrations of pharmaceuticals were much higher than those found in real wastewaters however the goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of variables mineralization extent and intermediates identification imposing the use of unusual high initial concentrations in any case some experiments were conducted at low concentrations to confirm that results at high pharmaceutical loads could be prudently extrapolated 2 3

and after the oxidation treatments were conducted by the commercial test kit daphtoxkit f magna using the crustacean daphnia magna the procedure was the one indicated by the manufacturer which is in accordance with the oecd guidelines for acute immobilization tests oecd 2004 before analysis ph of water samples was adjusted to 7 0 1 the immobility of the d magna neonates at 24 h was registered and the results were expressed as the percentage of individuals survival 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment of individual compounds 3 1 1 bezafibrate as stated previously bezafibrate has been reported to easily react with molecular ozone hence second order rate constant values in the proximity of ko3 bzf 590 m 1s 1 at ph 7 can be found in the literature huber et al 2003 other authors report even higher values in the range 2 7 103 to 104 m 1s 1 when the ph was increased from 6 to 8 dantas et al 2007 hence a first experimental series were carried out to evaluate the evolution of bezafibrate in the absence of any applied radiation fig 2 a shows the results obtained when an aqueous solution of bezafibrate was ozonated for 2 h as observed from this figure bezafibrate is removed from water in less than 10 min corroborating its reactivity with molecular ozone and also with hydroxyl radicals razavi et al 2009 considering the moderately high value of the rate constant between bezafibrate and ozone a negligible role played by ho radicals is expected in parent compound abatement toc removal in the dark ozonation experiment was around 30 in two hours fig 3 initially generating intermediates even more toxic than bezafibrate itself sui et al 2017 taking into consideration the reported toxicity of accumulated intermediates an attempt was carried out to increase the oxidation extent and mineralization of the ozonolysis by conducting the process in the presence of radiation a series of experiments were conducted in the presence of different filtered radiations as inferred from fig 2a radiation presence did not significantly influence bezafibrate removal due to its fast oxidation by molecular ozone two opposite effects can be expected when ozone is photolyzed on one hand photolysis of ozone can lead to free radicals generation and as a consequence to a higher unselective oxidation of organics on the other hand the concentration of molecular ozone is reduced so reactions involving molecular ozone are negatively affected based on this hypothesis the use of radiation in the presence of ozone seems to compensate both effects in terms of bezafibrate removal no significant differences were experienced in toc reduction when visible light or storelight were applied if compared to dark ozonation runs see fig 3a however a notorious enhancement in mineralization was observed when sunlight and ozone were simultaneously applied reaching an outstanding 85 toc abatement if compared to dark ozonation this reduction seems to be intimately related to ho generation and likely to hydrogen peroxide production the evolution of hydrogen peroxide reveals an increase in h2o2 formation as the radiation used is more energetic fig 3a moreover after the maximum h2o2 concentration is achieved a gradual decrease in the peroxide amount is observed when radiation is present generation of radicals by ozone photolysis in the red side of hartley band 290 to 350 nm and in chappuis band 450 700 nm are increased due to electronic ozone water interactions at the sight of the ozone absorption spectrum at the water air interface radical generation is favored in the hartley band when sunlight is applied accordingly storelight and visible light the hartley band has been filtered in both cases should a priori lead to similar results anglada et al 2014 however some authors propose a non zero quantum yield in ozone photolysis to form o 1d between 325 and 375 nm that would involve a higher efficiency of storelight to generate radicals compared to visible light matsumi et al 2002 three main fatty acids were detected in solution namely formic acetic and oxalic acids see fig 3d1 3 the latter was the predominant acid that accumulated in the reaction media with the exception of the run conducted in the presence of sunlight radiation which would partially explain the mineralization achieved with this system similar behavior was also experienced in the case of acetic acid formic acid evolution profiles showed a maximum concentration gradually decreasing thereafter regardless of the radiation type applied toc contribution of these three acids to the total organic carbon analyzed in solution increased with time up to values in the range 30 40 after two hours fig 3b however when sunlight was used a maximum close to 60 was obtained around 90 min reducing the contribution to 45 at 120 min free chlorides were detected in all experiments while nitrates were only found when sunlight and storelight were applied in the presence of ozone fig 3c compares the evolution of normalized to the maximum possible amount chlorides in dark and sunlight photolytic ozonation experiments and the release of normalized nitrates in sunlight and storelight ozonation runs as observed almost 2 3 of the maximum amount of cl was released from bezafibrate molecule although the presence of this electron withdrawing group would a priori suggest the low reactivity of the ring containing the cl substituent ozone consumption was kept to a minimum and was constant regardless of the system used or contaminant removed hence as a rule of thumb differences between inlet and outlet concentrations dissolved ozone can be neglected was roughly 5 ppm i e there was an ozone uptake of 150 ppm h 1 3 1 2 cotinine fig 2b shows the evolution of cotinine when dark and photolytic ozonation were applied contrarily to bezafibrate the presence of radiation improved the conversion of this pharmaceutical especially when sunlight was applied these results suggest that the reaction with molecular ozone must be slow and hydroxyl radicals play an important role to ascertain the previous hypothesis the second order rate constants of cotinine with ozone and hydroxyl radicals were calculated in the first case experiments at different phs were conducted in the presence of 0 05 m of tert butyl alcohol as a radical scavenger under these operating conditions assuming that the slow regime applies and dissolved ozone concentration remains constant during the process as experimentally corroborated cotinine removal rate can be expressed by 1 dc cotin dt k o 3 cotin c cotin c o 3 k observed c cotin hence eq 1 can be integrated leading to 2 ln c cotin o c cotin k observed t table 1 shows the results obtained at five different phs as observed from table 1 ko3 cotin values confirm the poor reactivity of cotinine with ozone that would explain the beneficial effects of an additional source of free radicals a simple analysis of cotinine removal kinetics leads to 3 dc cotin dt k o 3 cotin c cotin c o 3 k ho cotin c cotin c ho assuming that hydroxyl radicals are proportional to dissolved ozone rosal et al 2010 4 dc cotin dt k o 3 cotin c cotin c o 3 k ho cotin c cotin r ct c o 3 equation 4 was numerically solved by euler s method hence co3 was fitted to a time dependent mathematical expression and the constant k o 3 cotin k ho cotin r ct adjusted to minimize differences between calculated and experimental cotinine concentrations solving eq 4 led to a ratio k ho cotin r ct k o 3 cotin of roughly 3 in the dark ozonation run that is the radical pathway is at least three times more important than the direct attack by molecular ozone the rate constant with ho was determined by uv c photolysis of cotinine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as radicals promoter if h2o2 is in excess the following equation applies rivas et al 2000 5 ln c cotin 0 c cotin k ho bzf 2 φ h 2 o 2 i 0 1 exp 2 303 lε h 2 o 2 c h 2 o 2 0 k ho int c int k ho c h 2 o 2 0 t since the concentration of intermediates is much lower than hydrogen peroxide concentration it follows that k ho int c int k ho c h 2 o 2 0 equation 5 can be then used to evaluate the unknown rate constant hence kho cotin had a value of 1 6 109 m 1s 1 r2 0 997 when radiation was applied storelight and sunlight radiation increased the ratio k ho cotin r ct k o 3 cotin to values of 5 and 10 respectively fig 4 a shows the beneficial effects of radiation when ozone was applied leading to a roughly 60 mineralization in 2 h when sunlight was used generation of hydrogen peroxide in this system o3 sunlight is almost three times higher than in the rest of technologies studied fig 4a no significant differences were observed when analyzing nitrates release data not shown approximately 50 of the maximum amount was found as free no3 after two hours of treatment regardless of the system applied similarly to bezafibrate oxidation in cotinine removal oxalic acid accumulated in the reaction media unless the sunlight radiation was applied in the presence of ozone see fig 4c in the latter case the oxalic acid concentration decreases after roughly 80 90 min of reaction coinciding with an increase in toc conversion rate from figs 4 and 2 is inferred that in the o3 sunlight system the decrease in toc coincides with the almost complete depletion of cotinine and maximum concentrations of formic and oxalic acids 3 1 3 iopamidol the rate constant of molecular ozone with iopamidol ko3 iopm 18 31 m 1s 1 reveals a moderate reactivity with this oxidizing agent ning and graham 2008 thus the importance of direct ozonation and abatement by hydroxyl radicals is comparable in the dark ozonation experiments with ratios k ho iopm r ct k o 3 iopm in the range 0 4 1 6 depending on the value of ko3 iopm adopted since the absorption and the emission spectra of iopamidol and sunlight partially overlap see fig 1 this pharmaceutical was the only one in this study to be removed to some extent by simple photolysis fig 2c hence sunlight radiation was capable of achieving a 70 iopamidol conversion in two hours again the presence of radiation improved the results if compared to dark ozonation thus when the sunlight o3 system was applied the contributions of the different iopamidol removal mechanisms were 12 5 and 83 corresponding to direct ozonation photolysis and attack by hydroxyl radicals these percentages remained basically constant from the very beginning of the process again this system was the most efficient in terms of mineralization 80 in two hours if compared to 30 achieved by dark ozonation see fig 5 it should also be highlighted the detection of iodide and nitrates in the water bulk indicating the attack on the aromatic rings containing these moieties 3 2 treatment of a mixture of pharmaceuticals the potential influence of the presence of pharmaceuticals simultaneously was studied at two different concentrations levels first one experiment was conducted at the concentration used in individual runs e g 10 ppm thereafter a 100 fold decrease was used to ascertain that the results obtained could be extrapolated to concentrations closer to those found in real waters experiments were conducted using dark ozonation and the most efficient system o3 sunlight as observed from fig 6 a the presence of cotinine and iopamidol does not affect the removal profiles of bezafibrate that was eliminated mainly by direct ozonation at a similar rate found in the individual experiment however the removal of cotinine and iopamidol was slowed down in ozonation experiments conducted in the mixture if compared to the dark ozonation in individual runs unexpectedly this was more evident in the case of iopamidol which has a higher direct ozonation rate than cotinine and even a higher hydroxyl radical second order constant kho iopm 3 4 109 m 1s 1 jeong et al 2010 in the case of the system sunlight o3 fig 6b differences between individual experiments and simultaneous oxidation of the three pharmaceuticals were negligible in the cases of bezafibrate and cotinine some inhibition of the process was experienced however when monitoring iopamidol treated in the mixture in any case differences were lower than those observed in dark ozonation no mineralization was observed when ozone was used in the absence of radiation use of o3 sunlight led to a toc conversion of roughly 50 the trend of this parameter indicates that a higher conversion could be achieved if time was extended above 120 min the same experimental series was thereafter carried out by using 100 ppb in each pharmaceutical fig 6c leading to similar results although as expected conversion of pharmaceuticals was faster due the higher ratio oxidizing agent target compounds 3 3 intermediates identification transformation products tps found in pharmaceuticals oxidation were similar regardless of the presence or absence of radiation differences between the oxidation systems were found in the relative concentration and time evolution of intermediates moreover the systems ozone and ozone sunlight led to similar time evolution intermediate profiles in this work eight different intermediates have been identified in the case of bezafibrate oxidation bezafibrate has been supposed to initially being transformed through five different paths leading to tp2 and tp4 to tp7 table 2 and fig 7 hydroxylation has been reported to be the main route of bezafibrate ozonation xu et al 2016 dantas et al 2007 hydroxylated tps have been identified after molecular ozone addition mainly to the aromatic rings however in this work only the first hydroxylation of bezafibrate has been found tp5 no polyhydroxylated compounds could be isolated as proposed by xu et al 2016 the evolution of tps in the presence or absence of sunlight can be found in fig 8 as inferred from fig 8a1 when bezafibrate was ozonated tp7 and tp8 showed the highest areas accumulating in the water bulk even after one hour of treatment this fact suggests that amine oxidation and further alkyl chain attack is the main route of bezafibrate ozonation aromatic ring cleavage tp2 seems to be another preferential route however when sunlight was applied practically all the initial intermediates detected disappeared in just 5 min fig 8a2 now tp7 and tp8 showed marginal peak areas being tp2 and tp3 the main products detected with a maximum concentration of around 3 min fig 7 depicts the proposed mechanism of bezafibrate oxidation in which intermediates proposed by xu et al 2016 not detected in this work are marked with an asterisk up to 7 tps were detected when cotinine was treated 9 potential structures were proposed table 3 four initial stages were suggested in cotinine abatement including demethylation pyridine loss pyrrole hydroxylation and methyl hydroxylation fig 8 b1 and b2 shows the evolution profiles of intermediates as observed when ozone was applied in the absence of radiation assuming concentrations proportional to peak area tp6 was the predominant intermediate i e hydroxylation is the preferred reaction pathway corroborating the significant role played by hydroxyl radicals as a rule of thumb tps profiles show a maximum concentration decreasing thereafter as the reaction progresses the only exception is tp2 nicotinic acid that tends to accumulate in the water bulk if sunlight is applied no significant differences in intermediates generation were observed all of them decreasing their concentrations as time light exposure increased at the sight of the structures proposed fig 9 illustrates a possible reaction mechanism in cotinine oxidation two main routes of iopamidol removal are reported in oxidative processes i e h abstraction and deiodination tian et al 2014 at the sight of intermediates detected in this work table 4 it is suggested that iopamidol was initially oxidized by h abstraction from alcoholic groups up to 11 structures were tentatively identified in this study although it is obvious that given the complexity of this compound the number of intermediates from iopamidol oxidation must be larger matsushita et al 2016 in the presence and absence of radiation tp1 and tp5 are the intermediates apparently reaching a higher concentration however in both cases after a maximum their profiles go down to complete disappearance in the case of dark ozonation tp6 partially accumulates after 60 min of treatment since tp5 is one of the intermediates showing higher concentrations it is suggested that the structure of tp6 would correspond to tp6a instead of tp6b fig 10 shows a possible reaction pathway for iopamidol abatement given the profiles of free iodide released to the water bulk it seems that deiodination occurs after the initial stages presented in fig 10 that is iodide is released after roughly 20 and 40 min from the start of the reaction when o3 sunlight and o3 were applied respectively 3 4 toxicity evolution a rough theoretical approach to intermediates toxicity was carried out by calculating the relative daphnia magna lc50 after 48 h exposure relative fathead minnow lc50 after 96 h in the case of iopamidol by means of the software test https www epa gov 2018 test software estimates toxicity based on qsar methodologies in this study the consensus method was used which relies on the average value of several qsar approaches tables 2 4 shows that a number of intermediates formed show toxicity values even higher than the parent compound in agreement with the findings reported in other studies however as the reaction progresses these toxic intermediates are replaced by harmless final end products mainly short chain carboxylic acids hence when bezafibrate was treated tp1 tp3 tp5 and tp6 intermediates according to the software used are considered more toxic than parent compound nevertheless these substances are eliminated from the reaction media at the initial period of the reaction intermediates that accumulate in the ozonation process such as tp2 tp7 and tp8 present lower apparent toxicity than bezafibrate from test estimations almost all tps identified in cotinine ozonation were less toxic than the initial parent compound while the opposite behavior was observed in the case of iopamidol that is practically all the tps generated seem to be more toxic than the original contaminant in any case almost all iopamidol identified tps disappeared from the reaction media after roughly 60 or 30 min when o3 or o3 sunlight were applied respectively toxicity of the effluent after individual treatment of pharmaceuticals was also experimentally evaluated by measuring the survival percentage of daphnia magna after 24 h fig 11 depicts the results obtained as inferred from fig 11 the toxicity of raw pharmaceuticals leads to almost 0 survival of daphnids at 24 h the harmful effect of these substances significantly decreases as the oxidative treatment applied is more energetic hence survival percentage increases to 80 90 and 95 when bezafibrate cotinine and iopamidol were treated by the o3 sunlight system for two hours 4 conclusion the results obtained in this study highlights the importance of the presence of solar like radiation in ozonolysis processes especially when substances recalcitrant to molecular ozone are treated the influence of radiation is more significant as the range of wavelengths covers a higher part of the uv b spectra although the uv a region also influences the ozonation process mainly when mineralization is monitored the visible part of the radiation seems to play a negligible role in ozonation systems at the sight of results obtained in this study the combination of ozone and solar radiation can be an interesting alternative to simple ozonolysis processes avoiding the accumulation of toxic species derived from parent compound oxidation in this sense with the caution of data extrapolation it seems clear that in most of the cases initial transformation products normally show a higher toxicity than the original parent compounds oller et al 2011 however an adequate exposure to the o3 radiation hybrid system substantially decreases toxicity to values compatible with water ecosystems declaration of interests none acknowledgements the authors are grateful to junta de extremadura project ib16022 co financed by the

increased mineralization extent in all cases if compared to dark ozonation transformation products identified in individual runs suggest that amine oxidation and further alkyl chain attack is the main

anglada et al 2014 the efficacy of the photolytic ozonation system has been investigated by using three pharmaceutical compounds cotinine iopamidol and bezafibrate with low moderate and high molecular ozone reactivity bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides this compound has been found in the environment e g in fish sediments suspended particulate matter colloidal phase and dissolved liu et al 2018 as well this compound could be found in the ppb range in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants guedes alonso et al 2013 bezafibrate s reactivity with ozone can be considered relatively high rate constant in the range 5 102 104 m 1s 1 depending on ph several works report bezafibrate abatement by ozone based processes guo et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2015 cotinine is currently being studied as a treatment for depression ptsd schizophrenia alzheimer s disease and parkinson s disease triggle 1996 cotinine is also a nicotine metabolite and as a consequence is frequently encountered in surface waters cotinine reactivity with ozone is considered low asghar et al 2018 rosal et al 2010 accordingly alternative routes of elimination through free radicals are suggested iopamidol is an organic iodine compound and used as a non ionic water soluble radiographic contrast medium iopamidol blocks x rays as they pass through the body thereby allowing body structures not containing iodine to be visualized https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov 2018 this compound is easily found in wastewaters due to its chemical and biological recalcitrance matsushita et al 2016 this compound is considered to be relatively difficult to be removed by molecular ozone ning and graham 2008 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals bezafibrate bezaf c19h20clno4 cas 41859 67 0

reactor was placed the reactant solution was homogeneously maintained by vigorous magnetic stirring the emitted simulated solar radiation was restricted to different ranges by using suitable filters capable of cutting radiation below a specified wavelength value hence sunlight 300 800 nm storelight 360 800 nm and visible sources 390 800 nm were applied ozone was generated in an anseros com ad 01 device gaseous ozone concentration was monitored in an anseros gm apparatus fig 1 depicts the absorption spectra of the model compounds used in this study and the emission spectrum of the simulated solar radiation with the different filters used absorption spectra of ozone in water can be consulted elsewhere chávez et al 2016 oxidation experiments were conducted by simultaneously applying ozone and radiation when needed for comparison purposes dark ozonation was carried out under the same temperature profile occurring in the presence of radiation hence dark ozonation was conducted by switching on the solar box but covering the glass reactor with aluminum foil previous to analysis reaction samples were conveniently quenched by dissolved ozone removal after nitrogen bubbling this methodology was validated by comparing the analytical results of similar samples quenched with nitrogen bubbling and sodium sulfite as a rule of thumb initial concentrations of pharmaceuticals were much higher than those found in real wastewaters however the goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of variables mineralization extent and intermediates identification imposing the use of unusual high initial concentrations in any case some experiments were conducted at low concentrations to confirm that results at high pharmaceutical loads could be prudently extrapolated 2 3

and after the oxidation treatments were conducted by the commercial test kit daphtoxkit f magna using the crustacean daphnia magna the procedure was the one indicated by the manufacturer which is in accordance with the oecd guidelines for acute immobilization tests oecd 2004 before analysis ph of water samples was adjusted to 7 0 1 the immobility of the d magna neonates at 24 h was registered and the results were expressed as the percentage of individuals survival 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment of individual compounds 3 1 1 bezafibrate as stated previously bezafibrate has been reported to easily react with molecular ozone hence second order rate constant values in the proximity of ko3 bzf 590 m 1s 1 at ph 7 can be found in the literature huber et al 2003 other authors report even higher values in the range 2 7 103 to 104 m 1s 1 when the ph was increased from 6 to 8 dantas et al 2007 hence a first experimental series were carried out to evaluate the evolution of bezafibrate in the absence of any applied radiation fig 2 a shows the results obtained when an aqueous solution of bezafibrate was ozonated for 2 h as observed from this figure bezafibrate is removed from water in less than 10 min corroborating its reactivity with molecular ozone and also with hydroxyl radicals razavi et al 2009 considering the moderately high value of the rate constant between bezafibrate and ozone a negligible role played by ho radicals is expected in parent compound abatement toc removal in the dark ozonation experiment was around 30 in two hours fig 3 initially generating intermediates even more toxic than bezafibrate itself sui et al 2017 taking into consideration the reported toxicity of accumulated intermediates an attempt was carried out to increase the oxidation extent and mineralization of the ozonolysis by conducting the process in the presence of radiation a series of experiments were conducted in the presence of different filtered radiations as inferred from fig 2a radiation presence did not significantly influence bezafibrate removal due to its fast oxidation by molecular ozone two opposite effects can be expected when ozone is photolyzed on one hand photolysis of ozone can lead to free radicals generation and as a consequence to a higher unselective oxidation of organics on the other hand the concentration of molecular ozone is reduced so reactions involving molecular ozone are negatively affected based on this hypothesis the use of radiation in the presence of ozone seems to compensate both effects in terms of bezafibrate removal no significant differences were experienced in toc reduction when visible light or storelight were applied if compared to dark ozonation runs see fig 3a however a notorious enhancement in mineralization was observed when sunlight and ozone were simultaneously applied reaching an outstanding 85 toc abatement if compared to dark ozonation this reduction seems to be intimately related to ho generation and likely to hydrogen peroxide production the evolution of hydrogen peroxide reveals an increase in h2o2 formation as the radiation used is more energetic fig 3a moreover after the maximum h2o2 concentration is achieved a gradual decrease in the peroxide amount is observed when radiation is present generation of radicals by ozone photolysis in the red side of hartley band 290 to 350 nm and in chappuis band 450 700 nm are increased due to electronic ozone water interactions at the sight of the ozone absorption spectrum at the water air interface radical generation is favored in the hartley band when sunlight is applied accordingly storelight and visible light the hartley band has been filtered in both cases should a priori lead to similar results anglada et al 2014 however some authors propose a non zero quantum yield in ozone photolysis to form o 1d between 325 and 375 nm that would involve a higher efficiency of storelight to generate radicals compared to visible light matsumi et al 2002 three main fatty acids were detected in solution namely formic acetic and oxalic acids see fig 3d1 3 the latter was the predominant acid that accumulated in the reaction media with the exception of the run conducted in the presence of sunlight radiation which would partially explain the mineralization achieved with this system similar behavior was also experienced in the case of acetic acid formic acid evolution profiles showed a maximum concentration gradually decreasing thereafter regardless of the radiation type applied toc contribution of these three acids to the total organic carbon analyzed in solution increased with time up to values in the range 30 40 after two hours fig 3b however when sunlight was used a maximum close to 60 was obtained around 90 min reducing the contribution to 45 at 120 min free chlorides were detected in all experiments while nitrates were only found when sunlight and storelight were applied in the presence of ozone fig 3c compares the evolution of normalized to the maximum possible amount chlorides in dark and sunlight photolytic ozonation experiments and the release of normalized nitrates in sunlight and storelight ozonation runs as observed almost 2 3 of the maximum amount of cl was released from bezafibrate molecule although the presence of this electron withdrawing group would a priori suggest the low reactivity of the ring containing the cl substituent ozone consumption was kept to a minimum and was constant regardless of the system used or contaminant removed hence as a rule of thumb differences between inlet and outlet concentrations dissolved ozone can be neglected was roughly 5 ppm i e there was an ozone uptake of 150 ppm h 1 3 1 2 cotinine fig 2b shows the evolution of cotinine when dark and photolytic ozonation were applied contrarily to bezafibrate the presence of radiation improved the conversion of this pharmaceutical especially when sunlight was applied these results suggest that the reaction with molecular ozone must be slow and hydroxyl radicals play an important role to ascertain the previous hypothesis the second order rate constants of cotinine with ozone and hydroxyl radicals were calculated in the first case experiments at different phs were conducted in the presence of 0 05 m of tert butyl alcohol as a radical scavenger under these operating conditions assuming that the slow regime applies and dissolved ozone concentration remains constant during the process as experimentally corroborated cotinine removal rate can be expressed by 1 dc cotin dt k o 3 cotin c cotin c o 3 k observed c cotin hence eq 1 can be integrated leading to 2 ln c cotin o c cotin k observed t table 1 shows the results obtained at five different phs as observed from table 1 ko3 cotin values confirm the poor reactivity of cotinine with ozone that would explain the beneficial effects of an additional source of free radicals a simple analysis of cotinine removal kinetics leads to 3 dc cotin dt k o 3 cotin c cotin c o 3 k ho cotin c cotin c ho assuming that hydroxyl radicals are proportional to dissolved ozone rosal et al 2010 4 dc cotin dt k o 3 cotin c cotin c o 3 k ho cotin c cotin r ct c o 3 equation 4 was numerically solved by euler s method hence co3 was fitted to a time dependent mathematical expression and the constant k o 3 cotin k ho cotin r ct adjusted to minimize differences between calculated and experimental cotinine concentrations solving eq 4 led to a ratio k ho cotin r ct k o 3 cotin of roughly 3 in the dark ozonation run that is the radical pathway is at least three times more important than the direct attack by molecular ozone the rate constant with ho was determined by uv c photolysis of cotinine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as radicals promoter if h2o2 is in excess the following equation applies rivas et al 2000 5 ln c cotin 0 c cotin k ho bzf 2 φ h 2 o 2 i 0 1 exp 2 303 lε h 2 o 2 c h 2 o 2 0 k ho int c int k ho c h 2 o 2 0 t since the concentration of intermediates is much lower than hydrogen peroxide concentration it follows that k ho int c int k ho c h 2 o 2 0 equation 5 can be then used to evaluate the unknown rate constant hence kho cotin had a value of 1 6 109 m 1s 1 r2 0 997 when radiation was applied storelight and sunlight radiation increased the ratio k ho cotin r ct k o 3 cotin to values of 5 and 10 respectively fig 4 a shows the beneficial effects of radiation when ozone was applied leading to a roughly 60 mineralization in 2 h when sunlight was used generation of hydrogen peroxide in this system o3 sunlight is almost three times higher than in the rest of technologies studied fig 4a no significant differences were observed when analyzing nitrates release data not shown approximately 50 of the maximum amount was found as free no3 after two hours of treatment regardless of the system applied similarly to bezafibrate oxidation in cotinine removal oxalic acid accumulated in the reaction media unless the sunlight radiation was applied in the presence of ozone see fig 4c in the latter case the oxalic acid concentration decreases after roughly 80 90 min of reaction coinciding with an increase in toc conversion rate from figs 4 and 2 is inferred that in the o3 sunlight system the decrease in toc coincides with the almost complete depletion of cotinine and maximum concentrations of formic and oxalic acids 3 1 3 iopamidol the rate constant of molecular ozone with iopamidol ko3 iopm 18 31 m 1s 1 reveals a moderate reactivity with this oxidizing agent ning and graham 2008 thus the importance of direct ozonation and abatement by hydroxyl radicals is comparable in the dark ozonation experiments with ratios k ho iopm r ct k o 3 iopm in the range 0 4 1 6 depending on the value of ko3 iopm adopted since the absorption and the emission spectra of iopamidol and sunlight partially overlap see fig 1 this pharmaceutical was the only one in this study to be removed to some extent by simple photolysis fig 2c hence sunlight radiation was capable of achieving a 70 iopamidol conversion in two hours again the presence of radiation improved the results if compared to dark ozonation thus when the sunlight o3 system was applied the contributions of the different iopamidol removal mechanisms were 12 5 and 83 corresponding to direct ozonation photolysis and attack by hydroxyl radicals these percentages remained basically constant from the very beginning of the process again this system was the most efficient in terms of mineralization 80 in two hours if compared to 30 achieved by dark ozonation see fig 5 it should also be highlighted the detection of iodide and nitrates in the water bulk indicating the attack on the aromatic rings containing these moieties 3 2 treatment of a mixture of pharmaceuticals the potential influence of the presence of pharmaceuticals simultaneously was studied at two different concentrations levels first one experiment was conducted at the concentration used in individual runs e g 10 ppm thereafter a 100 fold decrease was used to ascertain that the results obtained could be extrapolated to concentrations closer to those found in real waters experiments were conducted using dark ozonation and the most efficient system o3 sunlight as observed from fig 6 a the presence of cotinine and iopamidol does not affect the removal profiles of bezafibrate that was eliminated mainly by direct ozonation at a similar rate found in the individual experiment however the removal of cotinine and iopamidol was slowed down in ozonation experiments conducted in the mixture if compared to the dark ozonation in individual runs unexpectedly this was more evident in the case of iopamidol which has a higher direct ozonation rate than cotinine and even a higher hydroxyl radical second order constant kho iopm 3 4 109 m 1s 1 jeong et al 2010 in the case of the system sunlight o3 fig 6b differences between individual experiments and simultaneous oxidation of the three pharmaceuticals were negligible in the cases of bezafibrate and cotinine some inhibition of the process was experienced however when monitoring iopamidol treated in the mixture in any case differences were lower than those observed in dark ozonation no mineralization was observed when ozone was used in the absence of radiation use of o3 sunlight led to a toc conversion of roughly 50 the trend of this parameter indicates that a higher conversion could be achieved if time was extended above 120 min the same experimental series was thereafter carried out by using 100 ppb in each pharmaceutical fig 6c leading to similar results although as expected conversion of pharmaceuticals was faster due the higher ratio oxidizing agent target compounds 3 3 intermediates identification transformation products tps found in pharmaceuticals oxidation were similar regardless of the presence or absence of radiation differences between the oxidation systems were found in the relative concentration and time evolution of intermediates moreover the systems ozone and ozone sunlight led to similar time evolution intermediate profiles in this work eight different intermediates have been identified in the case of bezafibrate oxidation bezafibrate has been supposed to initially being transformed through five different paths leading to tp2 and tp4 to tp7 table 2 and fig 7 hydroxylation has been reported to be the main route of bezafibrate ozonation xu et al 2016 dantas et al 2007 hydroxylated tps have been identified after molecular ozone addition mainly to the aromatic rings however in this work only the first hydroxylation of bezafibrate has been found tp5 no polyhydroxylated compounds could be isolated as proposed by xu et al 2016 the evolution of tps in the presence or absence of sunlight can be found in fig 8 as inferred from fig 8a1 when bezafibrate was ozonated tp7 and tp8 showed the highest areas accumulating in the water bulk even after one hour of treatment this fact suggests that amine oxidation and further alkyl chain attack is the main route of bezafibrate ozonation aromatic ring cleavage tp2 seems to be another preferential route however when sunlight was applied practically all the initial intermediates detected disappeared in just 5 min fig 8a2 now tp7 and tp8 showed marginal peak areas being tp2 and tp3 the main products detected with a maximum concentration of around 3 min fig 7 depicts the proposed mechanism of bezafibrate oxidation in which intermediates proposed by xu et al 2016 not detected in this work are marked with an asterisk up to 7 tps were detected when cotinine was treated 9 potential structures were proposed table 3 four initial stages were suggested in cotinine abatement including demethylation pyridine loss pyrrole hydroxylation and methyl hydroxylation fig 8 b1 and b2 shows the evolution profiles of intermediates as observed when ozone was applied in the absence of radiation assuming concentrations proportional to peak area tp6 was the predominant intermediate i e hydroxylation is the preferred reaction pathway corroborating the significant role played by hydroxyl radicals as a rule of thumb tps profiles show a maximum concentration decreasing thereafter as the reaction progresses the only exception is tp2 nicotinic acid that tends to accumulate in the water bulk if sunlight is applied no significant differences in intermediates generation were observed all of them decreasing their concentrations as time light exposure increased at the sight of the structures proposed fig 9 illustrates a possible reaction mechanism in cotinine oxidation two main routes of iopamidol removal are reported in oxidative processes i e h abstraction and deiodination tian et al 2014 at the sight of intermediates detected in this work table 4 it is suggested that iopamidol was initially oxidized by h abstraction from alcoholic groups up to 11 structures were tentatively identified in this study although it is obvious that given the complexity of this compound the number of intermediates from iopamidol oxidation must be larger matsushita et al 2016 in the presence and absence of radiation tp1 and tp5 are the intermediates apparently reaching a higher concentration however in both cases after a maximum their profiles go down to complete disappearance in the case of dark ozonation tp6 partially accumulates after 60 min of treatment since tp5 is one of the intermediates showing higher concentrations it is suggested that the structure of tp6 would correspond to tp6a instead of tp6b fig 10 shows a possible reaction pathway for iopamidol abatement given the profiles of free iodide released to the water bulk it seems that deiodination occurs after the initial stages presented in fig 10 that is iodide is released after roughly 20 and 40 min from the start of the reaction when o3 sunlight and o3 were applied respectively 3 4 toxicity evolution a rough theoretical approach to intermediates toxicity was carried out by calculating the relative daphnia magna lc50 after 48 h exposure relative fathead minnow lc50 after 96 h in the case of iopamidol by means of the software test https www epa gov 2018 test software estimates toxicity based on qsar methodologies in this study the consensus method was used which relies on the average value of several qsar approaches tables 2 4 shows that a number of intermediates formed show toxicity values even higher than the parent compound in agreement with the findings reported in other studies however as the reaction progresses these toxic intermediates are replaced by harmless final end products mainly short chain carboxylic acids hence when bezafibrate was treated tp1 tp3 tp5 and tp6 intermediates according to the software used are considered more toxic than parent compound nevertheless these substances are eliminated from the reaction media at the initial period of the reaction intermediates that accumulate in the ozonation process such as tp2 tp7 and tp8 present lower apparent toxicity than bezafibrate from test estimations almost all tps identified in cotinine ozonation were less toxic than the initial parent compound while the opposite behavior was observed in the case of iopamidol that is practically all the tps generated seem to be more toxic than the original contaminant in any case almost all iopamidol identified tps disappeared from the reaction media after roughly 60 or 30 min when o3 or o3 sunlight were applied respectively toxicity of the effluent after individual treatment of pharmaceuticals was also experimentally evaluated by measuring the survival percentage of daphnia magna after 24 h fig 11 depicts the results obtained as inferred from fig 11 the toxicity of raw pharmaceuticals leads to almost 0 survival of daphnids at 24 h the harmful effect of these substances significantly decreases as the oxidative treatment applied is more energetic hence survival percentage increases to 80 90 and 95 when bezafibrate cotinine and iopamidol were treated by the o3 sunlight system for two hours 4 conclusion the results obtained in this study highlights the importance of the presence of solar like radiation in ozonolysis processes especially when substances recalcitrant to molecular ozone are treated the influence of radiation is more significant as the range of wavelengths covers a higher part of the uv b spectra although the uv a region also influences the ozonation process mainly when mineralization is monitored the visible part of the radiation seems to play a negligible role in ozonation systems at the sight of results obtained in this study the combination of ozone and solar radiation can be an interesting alternative to simple ozonolysis processes avoiding the accumulation of toxic species derived from parent compound oxidation in this sense with the caution of data extrapolation it seems clear that in most of the cases initial transformation products normally show a higher toxicity than the original parent compounds oller et al 2011 however an adequate exposure to the o3 radiation hybrid system substantially decreases toxicity to values compatible with water ecosystems declaration of interests none acknowledgements the authors are grateful to junta de extremadura project ib16022 co financed by the
