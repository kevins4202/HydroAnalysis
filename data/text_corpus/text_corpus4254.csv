21270,this study is an application of the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d to predict the subsidence of a huge rubble mound breakwater in the west part zone at yantai port the modified cambridge clay soil model and poro elastic model are adopted to describe the quasi static mechanical behavior of the seabed foundation which is consists of muddy clay clay and silt soil layers the model parameters of soil used in computation are estimated based on a great number of laboratory tests over one thousand a novel point is that the buoyancy applied on the rubble mounds under swl static water line as well as its nonlinear variation dependent on the deformation of seabed foundation are considered in computation through analytical and experimental verification as well as the comparison with observation data monitored in situ it is indicated that fssi cas 2d is reliable to numerically predict the subsidence of offshore structures and has the ability to be applied in practical engineering keywords fssi cas 2d modified cambridge clay model numerical modeling poro elastic model rubble mound breakwater subsidence yantai port 1 introduction it is well known that the geological deposition history of offshore seabed foundation soil generally is relatively short due to the rapid depositing rate in offshore environment daigle et al 2017 most of offshore seabed foundation has the characteristics of less density and relatively low bearing capacity anderson 2009 after constructed on this type of seabed foundation significant post construction subsidence wound occurred for offshore structures shen et al 2017 setan and othman 2006 meanwhile the seabed soil beneath structures will be compressed to a dense state excessive subsidence itself is not necessarily harmful for the ability of offshore structures however whether the magnitude of subsidence is accurately predicted or not would have an extremely important effect on the normal service performance of offshore structures after construction in the practice of engineering some redundant height generally will be reserved for offshore structures in design stage to counteract the effect of the post construction subsidence guaranteeing the working surfaces reaching the designed elevation in their service phase therefore the accurate prediction of the post construction subsidence of structures is considerably crucial for the structure design and the normal service performance of offshore structures the subsidence of offshore structures could be caused by the wave current induced scouring fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 2020 and by the dynamic loading e g seismic wave or ocean wave as well as the structures weight induced static loading subsidence of offshore structure caused by dynamic loading is certainly due to the liquefaction post consolidation process of seabed foundation karamitros et al 2013 konagai et al 2013 verdugo and gonzalez 2015 sumer et al 2007 ye and wang 2015 ye et al 2017 however the subsidence caused by the weight of structures will be the focus in this study the layer wise summation method proposed by a series of national codes e g chinese code for investigation of geotechnical engineering gb50021 2001 is widely adopted by engineers to predict the post construction subsidence of offshore structures it is worth to point out that this method is based on the concept of linear elasticity considering that seabed foundation soil is linear elastic material however the deformation behavior of real seabed soil is complicatedly nonlinear rather than simply linear elastic therefore layer wise summation method is a type of semi theory and semi experiences method the credibility of the results given by this method is general this is the reason why the subsidence of structures predicted by the layer wise summation method needs a second empirical correction in practical engineering even so the final predicted subsidence by this method wound frequently be significantly different with the in site monitoring results apart from semi theory semi experiences method another is the theoretical approach generally biot s consolidation equation and advanced soil constitutive models e g cambridge clay model that could describe the complicated mechanical behavior of soil foundation are taken to predict the deformation of seabed foundation and the post construction subsidence of overlying offshore structures to the author s best knowledge there are only few works are available so far ye 2012b jeng and ye 2012 shen et al 2017 and ye et al 2012 studied the post construction subsiding process of large scale offshore breakwaters and the consolidation characteristics of their seabed foundation adopting the numerical model fssi cas 2d 3d their works have improved the understanding of the subsidence problem of offshore structures however the above mentioned previous works were only performed specially for some idea conditions in which simple topography and structure configuration and pore elasticity were involved there was basically no a work has been conducted for a complicated practical engineering case in which real complex topography of seabed floor and complex nonlinear constitutive soil model were involved the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is an unique computation model it not only can be applied to the problem of fluid structure seabed foundation interaction ye et al 2013 2014 2015 and the seismic dynamics of offshore structure and its seabed foundation ye and wang 2015 2016 but also can be applied to the problem of seabed consolidation and the subsidence of offshore structures ye 2012b jeng and ye 2012 ye et al 2012 specially the hydrostatic pressure applied by seawater on seabed floor and outer surface of offshore structures as well as the buoyancy applied to structures and its variation dependent on the deformation of seabed foundation can be effectively taken into consideration in computation by fssi cas 2d detailed information please see ye et al 2012 however the above two factors are frequently difficult to be handled by other commercial or open source packages due to the fact that a wave model for the hydrostatic and hydrodynamics of seawater is generally not included in them this priority reflects that fssi cas 2d is worth to be used in the field of offshore geotechnics in this study in order to apply fssi cas 2d into engineering practice taking the rubble mound breakwater in the west port zone at yantai port as the engineering background the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted as the computation tool the weight induced post construction subsidence of a large scale rubble mound breakwater will be predicted considering the soil layers division and the mechanical parameters obtained through in situ geotechnical engineering investigation and laboratory tests comparison analysis finds that the numerically predicted result is basically anastomotic to the in situ monitoring data it is indicated that fssi cas 2d is feasible for the engineering problem of subsidence prediction of offshore breakwater this works presented in this study can provide an application case of fssi cas 2d for the purpose of referencing 2 numerical model and constitutive model dynamic biot s equation known as u p approximation proposed by zienkiewicz et al 1980 are used to govern the consolidation behavior of seabed foundation as well as the subsidence behavior of offshore structures 1 σ x x τ x z z p x ρ 2 u s t 2 2 τ x z x σ z z ρ g p z ρ 2 w s t 2 3 k 2 p s γ w n β p t k ρ f 2

applicable for the nearly saturated soil finite element method fem is utilized to solve the above governing equation 1 to 3 and generalized newmark scheme implicit scheme is adopted to calculate the time integration when solving the above governing equations chan 1988 zienkiewicz et al 1999 for the problem of fluid structure seabed interaction fssi an integrated coupled numerical model fssi cas 2d was developed by the authors ye 2012a in fssi cas 2d the wave motion and the porous flow in porous seabed is governed by varans volume average reynolds average navier stokes equation hsu et al 2002 meanwhile the dynamic behavior of offshore structure and its seabed foundation is governed by the above eqs 1 2 and 3 a coupled algorithm was developed to couple the varans equation and biot s dynamics equation together actually fssi cas 2d has been widely verified by analytical solutions a series of physical wave flume tests ye et al 2013 more detailed information about the architecture and the reliability of fssi cas 2d can be found in ye et al 2013 and ye 2012a actually comparing with other numerical model such as abaqus flac the key advantages of fssi cas 2d includes three aspects firstly u p approximation of biot s equation is taken as the governing equation in the soil model in which the acceleration term has been considered as a result fssi cas 2d is not only can be used for consolidation problems but also can be used for the problems of seismic dynamics of structures built on porous foundation in which pore water exists ye and wang 2015 however the soil modulus in abaqus is not applicable for problems of seismic dynamics of structures built on porous foundation if there is pore water to our best knowledge secondly two wave models cobras and olaflow for the hydrodynamics of all types of ocean waves have been integrated together with the soil model in fssi cas 2d as a result fssi cas 2d can be used to study the ocean waves induced dynamics of offshore structures built on porous seabed foundation ye et al 2014 so far as we know these commercial software such as abaqus flac anasis plaxis all have no this function thirdly even though there are also several integrated models developed based on openfoam li et al 2020 or comsol multiphysics liao et al 2018 so far however only poro elastic soil model can be used in them in fssi cas 2d a few elasto plastic soil models such as drucker prager model mohr coulomb model modified cambridge soil model pastor zienkcisz iii model etc have been available ye et al 2015 furthermore the program interface for soil constitutive models also has been opened in fssi cas 2d as a consequence the users can implant their own constitutive models developed by themselves through the dynamic link library technique overall there are some unique advantages in fssi cas 2d developed by ourselves void ratio e and related darcy s permeability k of soil generally is variational depending on the deformation of soil in computation the variation of void ratio of seabed soil is considered following e n 1 1 e n exp δ p q δ ϵ v s 1 which is established from the perspective of large deformation where n stands for n th time step δ p is the incremental pore pressure δ ϵ v s is the incremental volumetric strain of soil and q 1 β is the compressibility of pore water correspondingly permeability of seabed soil k variates following k c f e 3 1 e where c f k 0 1 e 0 e 0 3 is an empirical coefficient miyamoto et al 2004 in which e 0 and k 0 is the initial void ratio and permeability additionally the hydrostatic water pressure acting on marine structure and its seabed foundation as is the boundary values in fem computation is automatically variable based on the displacement of marine structures and the deformation of seabed foundation in the consolidation process the void ratio of seabed foundation must reduce accompanying the pore water is drained out leading to the subsidence of seabed foundation and its overlying marine structure as a result the hydrostatic pressure acting on structure and its seabed foundation would change significantly especially in the cases involving large deformation 3 model validation 3 1 analytical solution there have been a series of analytical solutions for the soil consolidation problem in literature among them the analytical solution proposed by terzaghi 1925 and the one proposed by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 are the most typical ones it is noted that the validation for fssi cas 2d by adopting the terzaghi s solution has been previously conducted see ye 2012b and ye et al 2012 here only the validation by adopting the analytical solution proposed by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 is presented the typical terzaghi s solution is actually a 1d solution for soil consolidation problem while the solution proposed by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 is a 2d plane strain solution as demonstrated in fig 1 a a poro elastic fully saturated medium e g soil is sandwiched by two rigid and impermeable plates and this porous medium is compressed by the two plates on which two constant uniformly distributed pressure are applied reversely the pore water in the poro elastic medium can be freely drained out through the two lateral sides resulting in the pore pressure on the lateral sides can be set as zero the pore pressure will display a non monotonic variation with consolidation time at the initial consolidation time an increase of the pore pressure will be induced near to the center of the rectangular medium subsequently the pore pressure will dissipate normally this phenomenon was firstly discovered and explained by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 and was called as mandel cryer effect the general solution to this mandel cryer problem considering the compressibility of the poro elastic medium was given by cheng and detournay 1988 the pore pressure p on the x axis is analytically expressed as 5 p x t 2 f b 1 ν u 3 a i 1 sin α i cos α i α i sin α i cos α i cos α i x a cos α i exp α i 2 c v t a 2 6 tan α i 1 ν ν u ν α i in which g is the shear modulus ν and ν u 3 ν α b 1 2 ν 3 α b 1 2 ν is the drained and undrained poisson s ratio

the biot s coefficient k f is the bulk modulus of pure water k s is the bulk modulus of the particles making up the poro elastic medium and k t is the overall bulk modulus of the poro elastic medium which is generally much less than k s resulting in α generally is very near to 1 0 c v k ρ m 1 α 2 λ 2 ν 1 is the consolidation coefficient ρ is the density of pore water λ ν e 1 ν 1 2 ν μ g e 2 1 ν are the lame s constant e is the young s modulus a and b are the half of the length and height of the rectangular porous medium 2 f is the resultant force of the uniformly distributed pressure applied on the rigid plates α i i 1 2 3 are the roots of the nonlinear eq 6 the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted to reproduce the pore pressure dissipation process at three typical position a x a 2 z 0 b x 3 a 4 z 0 and c x 7 a 8 z 0 as labeled in fig 1 a the parameters of the poro elastic medium used in this verification computation are listed in table 1 the half length a and the half height b of the rectangular computational domain is 20 m and 10 m respectively the resultant force on the rigid plates is set as f 200kn it is noted that the gravity is not considered due to the fact that it is also not considered in the analytical solution the comparison of the pore pressure dissipation process at position a b and c between the numerical results predicted by fssi cas 2d and the analytical solution proposed by cheng and detournay 1988 are shown in fig 1 b it is observed that the numerical results predicted by fssi cas 2d agree very well with the analytical solution it is indicated that fssi cas 2d is reliable for the consolidation problems 3 2 experimental test on clay soil nakai and matsuoka 1986 has performed a series of triaxial test on the normally consolidated fujinomori clay to verify the constitutive soil model proposed by them here the conventional drained triaxial test data recorded by nakai and matsuoka 1986 are utilized to validate the modified cambridge clay soil model in fssi cas 2d due to the fact that these test data given by nakai and matsuoka 1986 are very reliable and the soil parameters also have been reliably calibrated by them the soil parameters of the normally consolidation fujinomori clay for the modified cambridge model are initial void ratio e 0 0 7 poisson s ratio ν 0 3 slope of normally compression line in e ln p coordinates λ 0 08636 slope of rebound line in e ln p coordinates κ 0 01904 slope of critical state line m f 1 4183 overconsolidated ratio ocr 1 0 in fssi cas 2d axisymmetric 8 nodes element is generated to simulate the cylinder clay soil sample as illustrated in fig 2 a in computation the bottom of axisymmetric element is fixed in vertical and the axisymmetric line is fixed in horizontal the confining pressure σ 3 and axial pressure σ 1 applied on the cylinder soil sample are varied according to the expected stress path there are totally two stress paths oa and ob respectively in this verification work as shown in fig 2 b before applying axial deviatoric stress in vertical soil sample is firstly isotropically consolidated at p 0 196 kpa after fully consolidated the soil sample is sheared according to the expected stress path oa and ob in which ob is a conventional drained path while oa is a constant confining pressure path the axial strain ϵ 1 radial strain ϵ 1 volumetric stress ϵ v are recorded in computation the comparison between the test results and that predicted by fssi cas 2d for the normally consolidation fujinomori clay adopting modified cambridge soil model are demonstrated in fig 3 it is observed that the results predicted by fssi cas 2d agree very well with the test results provided by nakai and matsuoka 1986 indicating that fssi cas 2d can highly reliably describe the mechanical behavior of clay soil this verification is a solid foundation for the subsequent numerical analysis in the study 4 engineering background yantai port is located on the southwest coastal line of bohai bay and is geographically affiliated to the city of yantai shandongprovince china as illustrated in fig 4 currently yantai port includes four harbour zones they are chifu bay zone west harbour zone longkou harbour zone and penglai harbour zone respectively among them the west harbour zone is the largest one and is the core asset for the development of yantai port total length of the wharfs in the west harbour zone is 19 km the maximum water depth in front of the wharfs is 28 m the west harbour zone is divided into 8 functional zones such as container chemical liquid bulk cargo general bulk crude oil and lng etc totally 65 berths with the capacity 50 000 to 300 000 tons will be constructed the planned ultimate bearing capacities of the west harbour zone will be up to 200 million tonnes and 15 million standard containers per year in order to guarantee the safety of vessels when docking in front of the wharfs for loading and unloading a group of deep water breakwaters have been constructed to surround a harbour basin with a area about 5 km 2 as illustrated in fig 5 in the west harbour zone the whole breakwater construction project is divided into two phases the structure form of phase i is the sloping rubble mound breakwater covered by accropodes as shown in fig 6 and it is composite breakwater in phase ii currently the construction of breakwaters in phase i and phase ii have all been finished the stability of the composite breakwaters in phase ii under extreme fortified ocean waves impact has been evaluated by he et al 2018 as shown in fig 6 the width at the bottom and at the top of the rubble mound breakwater referred as rb breakwater thereafter is up to 130 m 15 52 m respectively meanwhile the height is up to 23 m it is known that this rubble mound breakwater is large in size resulting in that a great weight will be applied to its underlying seabed foundation according to the collected geological profiles in the geotechnical surveying stage the underlying seabed foundation mainly consist of muddy silty clay silty clay clay and silty soils significant compressive deformation would occurred in the seabed foundation due to the low bearing capacity of these foundation soils and would further result in the excessive subsidence of the overlying rubble mound breakwater after construction in order to provide some reserved height for the rubble mound breakwater in design stage making the top elevation of the rubble mound breakwater approach to the designed elevation after subsiding finished it is highly necessary to predict the subsidence of the large scale rubble mound breakwater built on the seabed foundation with low bearing capacity in the west harbour zone of yantai port in this study taking the rubble mound breakwaters constructed in phase i at the west harbour zone as the representative the developed numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted to predict the subsidence of the breakwaters to provide engineers with the settlement value making the reserved redundant height of the rubble mound breakwater more appropriate in design stage to implement this application the profiles and basic physical properties of the seabed soil layers which is as the foundation of the rb breakwaters at the west harbour zone were firstly collected from the consultant company in charge of the in situ geotechnical survey in the west port zone as demonstrated in fig 7 there are mainly five soil layers in the seabed foundation of the rb breakwaters they are muddy silt clay ① 1 silty clay ① 2 clay ③ 1 silty clay ③ 2 and silt ③ 4 respectively their basic physical properties of the five seabed soil layers obtained by performing a series of geotechnical tests are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the muddy silt clay ① 1 and ① 2 are weak soil layers with a thickness of 12 m to 14 m their water content is up to 39 6 and 32 3 void ratio is around 1 0 and the bearing capacity f is only 70 90 kpa respectively in engineering practice the surface layer with a thickness of 1 3 m of the first soil layer ① 1 exactly beneath the rubble mound breakwater was replaced with dense medium sand to enhance the bearing capacity of the seabed foundation furthermore a great number of plastic drainage strips with a length of 14 m were inserted into the soil layers ① 1 and ① 2 with a spacing of 1 0 m to improve their seepage permeability as illustrated in fig 6 this engineering measure can effectively to accelerate the process of consolidation of the seabed foundation as well as reduce the subsiding of overlying rubble mound breakwaters to some extent in table 2 it is also can be found that the seabed soil layers ③ 1 ③ 2 ③ 3 all have relatively excellent bearing performance with their bearing capacity is in the range of 180 kpa to 200 kpa 5 computational domain boundary condition and soil parameters according to the design diagram of the rubble mound breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port as shown in fig 6 and the profiles of seabed soil layers in fig 7 the computational domain used in this study to predict the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port is illustrated in fig 8 the total length of the computational domain is 750 m x 350 m to x 1100 m the width at bottom of the rubble mound breakwater is 130 m its distance to the left and right boundary of the seabed foundation is 400 m and 210 m respectively due to the fact the maximum depth of surveying boreholes in the seabed floor on which this rubble mound breakwater is built is only 35 5 m the thickness of the seabed foundation in the computation is set as 35 5 m correspondingly in this study the seabed surface is set as z 0 m and the left side of the seabed foundation is set as x 350 m besides the spt of ③ 4 is 28 and its bearing capacity is 200 kpa as that listed in table 2 it means the soil layer ③ 4 is very hard therefore taking the soil layer ③ 4 as the bottom of computational domain has the reasonability in computation the following boundary conditions are applied 1 the lateral sides of seabed foundation are fixed in horizontal 7 u s l e f t s i d e u s r i g h t s i d e 0 2 the bottom of seabed foundation is fixed in both horizontal and vertical and treated as a impermeable board 8 u s w s 0 a n d p z 0 a t z 35 5 m 3 on the surface of the seabed floor and the outer surfaces of the rubble mound breakwater the total hydrostatic pressure is applied according to the hydrological survey the average water depth in front of the rubble mound breakwater is 19 56 m under the condition of normal sea state therefore the hydrostatic water pressure can be determined following p ρ 19 56 z and its applying direction is perpendicular to the surface of the rubble mound breakwater and its seabed foundation this application of the hydrostatic water pressure makes the buoyancy applied on these rubble mounds can be considered in computation as we known there must be buoyancy for these rubble mounds under swl due to the fact that some water has been expelled by them as a result the pressure on the bottom of structure induced by the overlying rubble mound breakwater is much less that if the buoyancy is not taken into consideration therefore the hydrostatic water pressure must be applied otherwise the subsidence of structure will be overestimated due to the overestimation of the bottom pressure of structure additionally it is worth to point out that the hydrostatic pressure at a position is not a constant but would be changed accompanying the subsiding of structure and the deformation of seabed foundation especially in the cases large deformation or and great subsidence are involved fortunately fssi cas 2d can timely update the hydrostatic pressure on boundary nodes by checking the current position of each boundary nodes at each time step in computation this variation of hydrostatic pressure on boundaries can be effectively handled by fssi cas 2d this is one of the priorities of fssi cas 2d in solving the nonlinear interacting between seawater structure and its seabed foundation under dynamic or quasi static loading 4 finally the effective stress component perpendicular to the outer surface of structure and its seabed foundation as well as the shear stress on it must be kept as zero all the time in computation due to the fact that the rubble mound breakwater and its seabed foundation are both porous medium rather than impermeable structure or medium otherwise the stress boundary condition on the outer surface of the rubble mound breakwater and the seabed foundation is wrong as demonstrated in fig 7 there are totally seven types of material in the computational domain the seabed foundation is divided into three material zones they are m1 z 10 to 0 m for the soil layer ① 1 and ① 2 due to their similar properties m2 z 17 to 10 m for the soil layer ③ 4 and m3 z 35 5 to 17 m for the soil layer ③ 2 and ③ 4 due to their similar properties as illustrated in table 2 the replacement layer with a thickness of 1 3 m beneath the rubble mound breakwater is set as material m4 as stated above a great number plastic drainage trip have been inserted into the materials m1 and m2 to enhance the vertical permeability of the soil layers the soil in which the plastic drainage strips are inserted in the soil layer ① 1 and ③ 1 is set as material m5 m6 respectively the rubble mound breakwater is set as material m7 and is divided into fine layer based on the characteristics of its outer shape in fe computation the weight of these rubble mounds buoyancy is considered under swl 19 26 is applied in the way of layer by layer in this study the modified cambridge clay soil model is adopted to describe the mechanical behavior of the material m1 m2 m5 m6 due to the fact that m1 m2 m5 and m6 have significant compressibility caused by their relatively low bearing capacity the rubble mound breakwater m7 is described adopting poro elastic soil model because these rubble mounds mixture are very strong relative to soil m4 is a kind of dense medium sand to replace the muddy clay in engineering therefore pore elastic soil model is also used for m4 due to the fact that the material m3 for the soil layers ③ 2 and ③ 4 has a great bearing capacity f 180 200 kpa and high value of spt 13 to 28 it means the soil layer ③ 2 and ③ 4 will contribute little to the subsidence of the overlying structure based on this recognition pore elastic soil model is also used for material m3 in computation the mesh is generated according to the loading applying process of the overlying rubble mound breakwater in the way of layer by layer as shown in fig 9 once one layer of rubble mounds is built the subsidence of the breakwater is predicted until to its stable state after that the next layer of rubble mounds is built in the mesh system and the subsidence is continuously predicted by fssi cas 2d until the fifth layer is built finally the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater could be totally predicted it is an indisputable fact in the field of geomechanics that the reliability of the computation results is highly dependent on the accuracy of soil rock s physical parameters in this study the modified cambridge clay model referred as mcc model thereafter and poro elastic model are used to describe the quasi static mechanical behavior of the seabed foundation soil therefore it is necessary to determine the model parameters needed by the modified cambridge clay and pore elastic model for the seven types of material m1 to m7 actually a number of conventional laboratory and in site geotechnical testing work in the field surveying stage have been conducted by engineers according to the chinese code for investigation of geochanical engineering of ports jts 133 1 2010 and the code of design and construction of breakwater jts 154 1 2011 all the physical properties of the five soil layers measured in these tests have been listed in table 2 however the model parameters of the five soil layers for the modified cambridge clay or pore elastic model were not given by engineers involved in the laboratory testing as a result the model parameters of m1 to m7 for the mcc or pore elastic model have to be estimated according to the property parameters listed in table 2 in the mcc model there are five model parameters needed in computation they are poisson s ratio ν other slope of critical state line csl m f in p q coordinates the slope of normal consolidation line ncl λ in e ln p coordinates and the slope of the rebounding line in e ln p coordinates and finally the overconsolidation ratio ocr of soil at a position firstly m f can be estimated as following 9 m f 6 sin ϕ 3 sin ϕ where ϕ is the friction angle of soil ϕ and ν both can be measured in conventional drained triaxial test secondly λ can be estimated adopting the formulation λ c c 2 3 where c c is the compression index the value c c of the five soil layers have been given in table 2 generally κ is 1 2 1 5 of λ depending on the strength of soils for soft soil κ generally is much less than λ in this study κ is set as 1 3 of λ for m1 m4 and is set as 1 4 of λ for m2 m5 fortunately the value of ocr has been measured in the geotechnical surveying stage the distribution of ocr along the depth is demonstrated in fig 10 it is observed that the distribution of ocr in the seabed foundation in the soil layer ① 1 and ① 4 is not concentrated but scattered however the ocr in the soil layer ① 1 overall is less than that in the soil layer ① 4 the mean value of the measured ocr is 1 07 in the soil layer ① 1 and is 1 55 in the soil layer ① 4 therefore the ocr is set as 1 07 for m1 m5 1 55 for m2 m6 for the material m3 young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν is needed by the pore elastic model the e of m3 can be estimated according to 10 e 1 ν 1 2 ν 1 ν e s where e s is the deformation modulus which has been given out in table 2 ν is set as 0 3 for m3 in computation and 0 38 for m1 m2 m5 m6 m4 is dense medium sand its e is set as 100mpa ν 0 35 material m7 is composed of large rubble mounds its e is set as 10 gpa ν 0 25 finally all the model parameter and properties of m1 to m7 are listed in table 3 it must be pointed out that the permeability of foundation soils basically has no effect on the final magnitude of subsidence but the speed of consolidation process will be significantly affected by the permeability of soil layer 6 results 6 1 initial status before the rubble mound breakwater is built there is an initial state of effective stress pore pressure and displacement in the seabed foundation this initial state must be determined first for the thereafter structures subsidence computation because the current stress state must be known in advance to judge the current overconsolidation state of soil through comparing the current stress with the greatest stress in history if the modified cambridge clay model is used it is known that the vertical displacement in the seabed foundation must be very small due to the fact that there is no external loading applied on the seabed floor before the overlying offshore structure is constructed however this initial displacement has to be set as 0 in the thereafter subsidence analysis because this initial state is a natural state which has been occurred in the past geological history this natural initial vertical displacement will certainly not cause the subsidence of overlying structures the distribution of the pore pressure and effective stress in the seabed foundation before the rubble mound breakwater is constructed are illustrated in fig 11 it is found that the initial pore pressure and i 1 3 is distributed in layers there is no any excess pore pressure in the seabed foundation before the rubble mound breakwater is constructed it is interesting to observe that there are two concentrated zone of shear stress along the two interfaces between m1 m2 and m5 m6 this phenomenon is mainly attributed to that the stiffness of material m1 m2 and m5 m6 are significantly different if the physical properties of m1 m2 m5 and m6 are the same then this shear stress concentrated zone will disappear 6 2 subsidence after first layer is built taking the initial stress and pore pressure as the initial condition t 0 the subsidence process after the first layer rubble mounds is built can be numerically predicted adopting fssi cas 2d fig 12 demonstrates the variation process of the pore pressure p mean effective stress i 1 3 and void ratio at the type position a x 750 m z 6 7 m in the subsiding process of the rubble mound breakwater after the first layer is built it is observed that the pore pressure in the seabed foundation beneath the breakwater has significantly increased at the initial early stage because the loading induced by the weight of the first layer is totally undertaken only by the pore water in the seabed soil beneath the breakwater after that the pore pressure in the seabed foundation gradually dissipates until to its initial hydrostatic value accompanying the pore water is drained out of the seabed which is driven by pore pressure gradient in this process the loading undertaken by the pore water gradually is transmitted to the soil particles of seabed making the mean effective stress in the seabed foundation gradually increase until to reach its stable state meanwhile the increasing of the mean effective stress further cause the seabed foundation soil being compressed resulting in the void ratio of the seabed soil gradually reducing as illustrated in fig 12 as a result the overlying rubble mound breakwater gradually subsidence correspondingly as that demonstrated in fig 13 it is shown that the subsidence of the first layer after it is built is 16 3 cm the distribution of the vertical subsidence after the first layer is built are shown in fig 14 it is observed that the subsidence of first layer is not uniform the subsidence of the central zone in the first layer is much greater than that in the two lateral zones and only the seabed soil beneath the rubble mound breakwater is compressed there is basically no subsidence in the seabed foundation away from the rb breakwater due to the fact that there is no external loading is applied on it the distribution of pore pressure mean effective stress i 1 3 and shear stress τ x z when the consolidation process has finished after the first layer is built is demonstrated in fig 15 the mean effective stress i 1 3 in the zone beneath the rb breakwater has significantly increased due to the fact that the weight of the first layer rubble mounds has been completely undertaken by beneath seabed foundation when the consolidation process has finished it is also found that there are two shear stress concentrated zones in the seabed foundation under the two lateral parts of the rb breakwater the maximum magnitude of τ x z could be greater than 20 kpa 6 3 subsidence after second to fifth layer is built for the sake of simplicity the consolidation and subsidence process of the rb breakwater after the second layer to fifth layer is respectively built are discussed and analyzed together in this section the subsiding processes of the rm breakwater after the second layer to fifth layer is respectively built are demonstrated in fig 16 it is found the subsiding process shown in fig 16 are basically the same with that after the first layer is built the only difference is that the subsidence of the rm breakwater becoming greater and greater after the rubble mounds breakwater is built in the way of layer by layer in fig 16 d it is known that the final subsidence of the rm breakwater is predicted as 64 1 cm by the numerical model fssi cas 2d after the total five layers of rubble mounds are all constructed this magnitude of post construction subsidence is considerable a redundant height with about 0 7 m should be reserved in design for the purpose that the top elevation of the rb breakwater could reach the designed requirement otherwise the rb breakwater maybe cannot normally service after its subsidence is finished except the time history of the subsiding the distributions of the vertical subsidence of the rm breakwater and its seabed foundation after the second layer to fifth layer is respectively built are illustrated in fig 17 in fig 17 it is observed that the distribution characteristics of the subsiding in the rm breakwater and its foundation is basically similar with that after the first layer is built the subsidence of the middle part of the rm breakwater is significantly greater than that of the lateral parts and only the seabed soil beneath the rm breakwater is compressed there is basically no the vertical subsidence in the seabed foundation zone away from the rm breakwater accompanying the construction process of the rubble mounds layer by layer the magnitude of the subsidence of the rm breakwater gradually increases however it is worth to point out that the variation process of the pore pressure mean effective stress and the void ratio in the seabed foundation is not ways monotonically increased or reduced as that shown in fig 12 fig 18 illustrates the process of the pore pressure mean effective stress and the void ratio at the typical position a after the fourth layer is built as demonstrated in fig 18 the pore pressure is increased i 1 3 is reduced before the time c v t h 2 0 06 meanwhile the seabed soil at position a is dilated after the time c v t h 2 0 06 the pore pressure gradually dissipate and the mean effective stress increases correspondingly meanwhile the seabed soil at the position a is gradually compressed accompanying the pore water is drained out until to the stable state this non monotonic variation process of pore pressure and effective stress is a typical mandel cryer effect it is indicated that the subsiding of the rm breakwater and consolidation of seabed foundation is a complicated nonlinear process the distributions of the final pore pressure mean effective stress and shear stress after the rm breakwater is completely constructed are illustrated in fig 19 it is observed that the pore pressure is also distributed in layers there are will no excess pore pressure in the seabed foundation because it has been completely dissipated the effective stress in the foundation beneath the rm breakwater has significantly increased due to the gravity compression of the overlying rm breakwater there are still two shear stress concentrated zones in the seabed foundation under the two lateral parts of the rm breakwater and the area of the concentrated zones are much larger in size than that after the first layer is built it is also found that there are also two shear stress concentrated zones in the two lateral slopes in the rm breakwater the maximum magnitude of the concentrated shear stress reaches up to 70 80 kpa in the two lateral slopes this magnitude is much greater than that in the beneath seabed foundation due to the fact that the strength resisting shearing of the rubble mound layers is much greater than the maximum shear stress generated in the lateral slopes the stability against slope sliding of the rm breakwater can be guaranteed 6 4 comparison with observation data in the practice of engineering the whole rm breakwater was constructed one section by one section and was constructed layer by layer in one section a number of displacement sensors have been installed on the rubble mound breakwater at different typical cross sections once they were successfully constructed the time history of the subsidence recorded by these sensors no 1 to no 18 are shown in fig 20 it is known that the starting date to record the subsidence of the rm breakwater is different from different sensors the earliest date starting to monitor is 15th may 2013 no 1 and the latest date is 18th october 2013 no 18 correspondingly the longest period for the monitoring is 192 days and shortest period is only 60 days due to the fact that the longer the monitoring period the more reliable the monitoring data for the subsidence of structures only the monitoring data recorded for more than 100 days as shown in fig 20 a are adopted to verify the numerical result predicted by fssi cas 2d in fig 20 a it is known that the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater is in the range of 44 cm to 76 cm meanwhile the final subsidence predicted by fssi cas 2d is 64 1 cm which is exactly in the range of the monitoring data at the in site the difference to the lower and upper limit of the monitoring data is about 30 and 13 for a numerical prediction result in practical engineering this degree of derivation actually is acceptable and commendable it is indicated that the subsidence of the rm breakwater predicted by fssi cas 2d is reliable and the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is reliable to predict the consolidation subsidence of offshore structures so long as their foundation soil layers could be relatively accurately divided through the geotechnical survey as well as appropriate soil constitutive models are used and reliable model parameters for soil layers are calibrated through laboratory tests 7 conclusion in this study taking the huge rubble mound breakwater in the west part zone at yantai port as the engineering background the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted to predict the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater built on the seabed foundation composed by muddy clay clay and silty soil layers in computation the modified cambridge soil model and poro elastic model are used to describe the behavior of the seabed foundation soil layers one of priorities in this study is that the buoyancy applied on the rubble mounds and its nonlinear variation under static water level swl is taken into consideration in fssi cas 2d the computational results show that the rubble mound breakwater gradually subsides during the construction period the final subsidence is predicted as 64 1 cm which is exactly in the range of monitoring data the deviation to the lower and upper limit of the in site monitoring data is about 30 and 13 respectively this degree of deviation actually is acceptable for a numerical model when it is applied in engineering practice through the analytical and experimental verification as well as the comparison with in situ observation data it is indicated that the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is usable for the problems of consolidation and for the subsidence prediction of structures and fssi cas 2d has the potential ability to be applied in practical engineering it must be noted that there are also several limitations in the present work firstly the randomness in the soil layers distribution in the seabed foundation cannot be considered in computation definitely this randomness also cannot be clearly figured out by engineers due to the fact only limited number of drilling can be performed in the geotechnical survey therefore this limitation is inevitable in numerical modeling secondly several parameters used in computation are not directly measured in laboratory but estimated based on some other measured parameters thirdly the building process of the rubble mound breakwater cannot be modeled in fssi cas 2d the real gradual loading process during the construction period is simplified as five times of transient loading the above limitations and simplification would have some unquantifiable effect for the prediction result as a result the numerical prediction result is impossible to be exactly the same with the in site observation data fssi cas 2d cannot be applied for the problems of wave current induced scouring it only can be applicable for the problems of consolidation subsidence dynamics of structures and their foundation under self weight ocean wave loading or seismic wave loading currently there are also three aspects that could limit the application potential of fssi cas 2d firstly there is still no graphic user interface developed as a result it is a little difficult for new users to use it secondly there is no parallel computation developed resulting in that a large scale computation is impossible to be implemented for practical engineering cases thirdly the thermodynamics and the unsaturation of soil cannot be handled so far these problems can only be solved step by step in the future credit authorship

21270,this study is an application of the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d to predict the subsidence of a huge rubble mound breakwater in the west part zone at yantai port the modified cambridge clay soil model and poro elastic model are adopted to describe the quasi static mechanical behavior of the seabed foundation which is consists of muddy clay clay and silt soil layers the model parameters of soil used in computation are estimated based on a great number of laboratory tests over one thousand a novel point is that the buoyancy applied on the rubble mounds under swl static water line as well as its nonlinear variation dependent on the deformation of seabed foundation are considered in computation through analytical and experimental verification as well as the comparison with observation data monitored in situ it is indicated that fssi cas 2d is reliable to numerically predict the subsidence of offshore structures and has the ability to be applied in practical engineering keywords fssi cas 2d modified cambridge clay model numerical modeling poro elastic model rubble mound breakwater subsidence yantai port 1 introduction it is well known that the geological deposition history of offshore seabed foundation soil generally is relatively short due to the rapid depositing rate in offshore environment daigle et al 2017 most of offshore seabed foundation has the characteristics of less density and relatively low bearing capacity anderson 2009 after constructed on this type of seabed foundation significant post construction subsidence wound occurred for offshore structures shen et al 2017 setan and othman 2006 meanwhile the seabed soil beneath structures will be compressed to a dense state excessive subsidence itself is not necessarily harmful for the ability of offshore structures however whether the magnitude of subsidence is accurately predicted or not would have an extremely important effect on the normal service performance of offshore structures after construction in the practice of engineering some redundant height generally will be reserved for offshore structures in design stage to counteract the effect of the post construction subsidence guaranteeing the working surfaces reaching the designed elevation in their service phase therefore the accurate prediction of the post construction subsidence of structures is considerably crucial for the structure design and the normal service performance of offshore structures the subsidence of offshore structures could be caused by the wave current induced scouring fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 2020 and by the dynamic loading e g seismic wave or ocean wave as well as the structures weight induced static loading subsidence of offshore structure caused by dynamic loading is certainly due to the liquefaction post consolidation process of seabed foundation karamitros et al 2013 konagai et al 2013 verdugo and gonzalez 2015 sumer et al 2007 ye and wang 2015 ye et al 2017 however the subsidence caused by the weight of structures will be the focus in this study the layer wise summation method proposed by a series of national codes e g chinese code for investigation of geotechnical engineering gb50021 2001 is widely adopted by engineers to predict the post construction subsidence of offshore structures it is worth to point out that this method is based on the concept of linear elasticity considering that seabed foundation soil is linear elastic material however the deformation behavior of real seabed soil is complicatedly nonlinear rather than simply linear elastic therefore layer wise summation method is a type of semi theory and semi experiences method the credibility of the results given by this method is general this is the reason why the subsidence of structures predicted by the layer wise summation method needs a second empirical correction in practical engineering even so the final predicted subsidence by this method wound frequently be significantly different with the in site monitoring results apart from semi theory semi experiences method another is the theoretical approach generally biot s consolidation equation and advanced soil constitutive models e g cambridge clay model that could describe the complicated mechanical behavior of soil foundation are taken to predict the deformation of seabed foundation and the post construction subsidence of overlying offshore structures to the author s best knowledge there are only few works are available so far ye 2012b jeng and ye 2012 shen et al 2017 and ye et al 2012 studied the post construction subsiding process of large scale offshore breakwaters and the consolidation characteristics of their seabed foundation adopting the numerical model fssi cas 2d 3d their works have improved the understanding of the subsidence problem of offshore structures however the above mentioned previous works were only performed specially for some idea conditions in which simple topography and structure configuration and pore elasticity were involved there was basically no a work has been conducted for a complicated practical engineering case in which real complex topography of seabed floor and complex nonlinear constitutive soil model were involved the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is an unique computation model it not only can be applied to the problem of fluid structure seabed foundation interaction ye et al 2013 2014 2015 and the seismic dynamics of offshore structure and its seabed foundation ye and wang 2015 2016 but also can be applied to the problem of seabed consolidation and the subsidence of offshore structures ye 2012b jeng and ye 2012 ye et al 2012 specially the hydrostatic pressure applied by seawater on seabed floor and outer surface of offshore structures as well as the buoyancy applied to structures and its variation dependent on the deformation of seabed foundation can be effectively taken into consideration in computation by fssi cas 2d detailed information please see ye et al 2012 however the above two factors are frequently difficult to be handled by other commercial or open source packages due to the fact that a wave model for the hydrostatic and hydrodynamics of seawater is generally not included in them this priority reflects that fssi cas 2d is worth to be used in the field of offshore geotechnics in this study in order to apply fssi cas 2d into engineering practice taking the rubble mound breakwater in the west port zone at yantai port as the engineering background the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted as the computation tool the weight induced post construction subsidence of a large scale rubble mound breakwater will be predicted considering the soil layers division and the mechanical parameters obtained through in situ geotechnical engineering investigation and laboratory tests comparison analysis finds that the numerically predicted result is basically anastomotic to the in situ monitoring data it is indicated that fssi cas 2d is feasible for the engineering problem of subsidence prediction of offshore breakwater this works presented in this study can provide an application case of fssi cas 2d for the purpose of referencing 2 numerical model and constitutive model dynamic biot s equation known as u p approximation proposed by zienkiewicz et al 1980 are used to govern the consolidation behavior of seabed foundation as well as the subsidence behavior of offshore structures 1 σ x x τ x z z p x ρ 2 u s t 2 2 τ x z x σ z z ρ g p z ρ 2 w s t 2 3 k 2 p s γ w n β p t k ρ f 2 ϵ v t 2 γ w ϵ v t where u s w s are the soil displacements in horizontal and vertical direction respectively n is soil porosity σ x and σ z is effective normal stresses in the horizontal and vertical

applicable for the nearly saturated soil finite element method fem is utilized to solve the above governing equation 1 to 3 and generalized newmark scheme implicit scheme is adopted to calculate the time integration when solving the above governing equations chan 1988 zienkiewicz et al 1999 for the problem of fluid structure seabed interaction fssi an integrated coupled numerical model fssi cas 2d was developed by the authors ye 2012a in fssi cas 2d the wave motion and the porous flow in porous seabed is governed by varans volume average reynolds average navier stokes equation hsu et al 2002 meanwhile the dynamic behavior of offshore structure and its seabed foundation is governed by the above eqs 1 2 and 3 a coupled algorithm was developed to couple the varans equation and biot s dynamics equation together actually fssi cas 2d has been widely verified by analytical solutions a series of physical wave flume tests ye et al 2013 more detailed information about the architecture and the reliability of fssi cas 2d can be found in ye et al 2013 and ye 2012a actually comparing with other numerical model such as abaqus flac the key advantages of fssi cas 2d includes three aspects firstly u p approximation of biot s equation is taken as the governing equation in the soil model in which the acceleration term has been considered as a result fssi cas 2d is not only can be used for consolidation problems but also can be used for the problems of seismic dynamics of structures built on porous foundation in which pore water exists ye and wang 2015 however the soil modulus in abaqus is not applicable for problems of seismic dynamics of structures built on porous foundation if there is pore water to our best knowledge secondly two wave models cobras and olaflow for the hydrodynamics of all types of ocean waves have been integrated together with the soil model in fssi cas 2d as a result fssi cas 2d can be used to study the ocean waves induced dynamics of offshore structures built on porous seabed foundation ye et al 2014 so far as we know these commercial software such as abaqus flac anasis plaxis all have no this function thirdly even though there are also several integrated models developed based on openfoam li et al 2020 or comsol multiphysics liao et al 2018 so far however only poro elastic soil model can be used in them in fssi cas 2d a few elasto plastic soil models such as drucker prager model mohr coulomb model modified cambridge soil model pastor zienkcisz iii model etc have been available ye et al 2015 furthermore the program interface for soil constitutive models also has been opened in fssi cas 2d as a consequence the users can implant their own constitutive models developed by themselves through the dynamic link library technique overall there are some unique advantages in fssi cas 2d developed by ourselves void ratio e and related darcy s permeability k of soil generally is variational depending on the deformation of soil in computation the variation of void ratio of seabed soil is considered following e n 1 1 e n exp δ p q δ ϵ v s 1 which is established from the perspective of large deformation where n stands for n th time step δ p is the incremental pore pressure δ ϵ v s is the incremental volumetric strain of soil and q 1 β is the compressibility of pore water correspondingly permeability of seabed soil k variates following k c f e 3 1 e where c f k 0 1 e 0 e 0 3 is an empirical coefficient miyamoto et al 2004 in which e 0 and k 0 is the initial void ratio and permeability additionally the hydrostatic water pressure acting on marine structure and its seabed foundation as is the boundary values in fem computation is automatically variable based on the displacement of marine structures and the deformation of seabed foundation in the consolidation process the void ratio of seabed foundation must reduce accompanying the pore water is drained out leading to the subsidence of seabed foundation and its overlying marine structure as a result the hydrostatic pressure acting on structure and its seabed foundation would change significantly especially in the cases involving large deformation 3 model validation 3 1 analytical solution there have been a series of analytical solutions for the soil consolidation problem in literature among them the analytical solution proposed by terzaghi 1925 and the one proposed by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 are the most typical ones it is noted that the validation for fssi cas 2d by adopting the terzaghi s solution has been previously conducted see ye 2012b and ye et al 2012 here only the validation by adopting the analytical solution proposed by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 is presented the typical terzaghi s solution is actually a 1d solution for soil consolidation problem while the solution proposed by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 is a 2d plane strain solution as demonstrated in fig 1 a a poro elastic fully saturated medium e g soil is sandwiched by two rigid and impermeable plates and this porous medium is compressed by the two plates on which two constant uniformly distributed pressure are applied reversely the pore water in the poro elastic medium can be freely drained out through the two lateral sides resulting in the pore pressure on the lateral sides can be set as zero the pore pressure will display a non monotonic variation with consolidation time at the initial consolidation time an increase of the pore pressure will be induced near to the center of the rectangular medium subsequently the pore pressure will dissipate normally this phenomenon was firstly discovered and explained by mandel 1953 and cryer 1963 and was called as mandel cryer effect the general solution to this mandel cryer problem considering the compressibility of the poro elastic medium was given by cheng and detournay 1988 the pore pressure p on the x axis is analytically expressed as 5 p x t 2 f b 1 ν u 3 a i 1 sin α i cos α i α i sin α i cos α i cos α i x a cos α i exp α i 2 c v t a 2 6 tan α i 1 ν ν u ν α i in which g is the shear modulus ν and ν u 3 ν α b 1 2 ν 3 α b 1 2 ν is the drained and undrained poisson s ratio

the biot s coefficient k f is the bulk modulus of pure water k s is the bulk modulus of the particles making up the poro elastic medium and k t is the overall bulk modulus of the poro elastic medium which is generally much less than k s resulting in α generally is very near to 1 0 c v k ρ m 1 α 2 λ 2 ν 1 is the consolidation coefficient ρ is the density of pore water λ ν e 1 ν 1 2 ν μ g e 2 1 ν are the lame s constant e is the young s modulus a and b are the half of the length and height of the rectangular porous medium 2 f is the resultant force of the uniformly distributed pressure applied on the rigid plates α i i 1 2 3 are the roots of the nonlinear eq 6 the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted to reproduce the pore pressure dissipation process at three typical position a x a 2 z 0 b x 3 a 4 z 0 and c x 7 a 8 z 0 as labeled in fig 1 a the parameters of the poro elastic medium used in this verification computation are listed in table 1 the half length a and the half height b of the rectangular computational domain is 20 m and 10 m respectively the resultant force on the rigid plates is set as f 200kn it is noted that the gravity is not considered due to the fact that it is also not considered in the analytical solution the comparison of the pore pressure dissipation process at position a b and c between the numerical results predicted by fssi cas 2d and the analytical solution proposed by cheng and detournay 1988 are shown in fig 1 b it is observed that the numerical results predicted by fssi cas 2d agree very well with the analytical solution it is indicated that fssi cas 2d is reliable for the consolidation problems 3 2 experimental test on clay soil nakai and matsuoka 1986 has performed a series of triaxial test on the normally consolidated fujinomori clay to verify the constitutive soil model proposed by them here the conventional drained triaxial test data recorded by nakai and matsuoka 1986 are utilized to validate the modified cambridge clay soil model in fssi cas 2d due to the fact that these test data given by nakai and matsuoka 1986 are very reliable and the soil parameters also have been reliably calibrated by them the soil parameters of the normally consolidation fujinomori clay for the modified cambridge model are initial void ratio e 0 0 7 poisson s ratio ν 0 3 slope of normally compression line in e ln p coordinates λ 0 08636 slope of rebound line in e ln p coordinates κ 0 01904 slope of critical state line m f 1 4183 overconsolidated ratio ocr 1 0 in fssi cas 2d axisymmetric 8 nodes element is generated to simulate the cylinder clay soil sample as illustrated in fig 2 a in computation the bottom of axisymmetric element is fixed in vertical and the axisymmetric line is fixed in horizontal the confining pressure σ 3 and axial pressure σ 1 applied on the cylinder soil sample are varied according to the expected stress path there are totally two stress paths oa and ob respectively in this verification work as shown in fig 2 b before applying axial deviatoric stress in vertical soil sample is firstly isotropically consolidated at p 0 196 kpa after fully consolidated the soil sample is sheared according to the expected stress path oa and ob in which ob is a conventional drained path while oa is a constant confining pressure path the axial strain ϵ 1 radial strain ϵ 1 volumetric stress ϵ v are recorded in computation the comparison between the test results and that predicted by fssi cas 2d for the normally consolidation fujinomori clay adopting modified cambridge soil model are demonstrated in fig 3 it is observed that the results predicted by fssi cas 2d agree very well with the test results provided by nakai and matsuoka 1986 indicating that fssi cas 2d can highly reliably describe the mechanical behavior of clay soil this verification is a solid foundation for the subsequent numerical analysis in the study 4 engineering background yantai port is located on the southwest coastal line of bohai bay and is geographically affiliated to the city of yantai shandongprovince china as illustrated in fig 4 currently yantai port includes four harbour zones they are chifu bay zone west harbour zone longkou harbour zone and penglai harbour zone respectively among them the west harbour zone is the largest one and is the core asset for the development of yantai port total length of the wharfs in the west harbour zone is 19 km the maximum water depth in front of the wharfs is 28 m the west harbour zone is divided into 8 functional zones such as container chemical liquid bulk cargo general bulk crude oil and lng etc totally 65 berths with the capacity 50 000 to 300 000 tons will be constructed the planned ultimate bearing capacities of the west harbour zone will be up to 200 million tonnes and 15 million standard containers per year in order to guarantee the safety of vessels when docking in front of the wharfs for loading and unloading a group of deep water breakwaters have been constructed to surround a harbour basin with a area about 5 km 2 as illustrated in fig 5 in the west harbour zone the whole breakwater construction project is divided into two phases the structure form of phase i is the sloping rubble mound breakwater covered by accropodes as shown in fig 6 and it is composite breakwater in phase ii currently the construction of breakwaters in phase i and phase ii have all been finished the stability of the composite breakwaters in phase ii under extreme fortified ocean waves impact has been evaluated by he et al 2018 as shown in fig 6 the width at the bottom and at the top of the rubble mound breakwater referred as rb breakwater thereafter is up to 130 m 15 52 m respectively meanwhile the height is up to 23 m it is known that this rubble mound breakwater is large in size resulting in that a great weight will be applied to its underlying seabed foundation according to the collected geological profiles in the geotechnical surveying stage the underlying seabed foundation mainly consist of muddy silty clay silty clay clay and silty soils significant compressive deformation would occurred in the seabed foundation due to the low bearing capacity of these foundation soils and would further result in the excessive subsidence of the overlying rubble mound breakwater after construction in order to provide some reserved height for the rubble mound breakwater in design stage making the top elevation of the rubble mound breakwater approach to the designed elevation after subsiding finished it is highly necessary to predict the subsidence of the large scale rubble mound breakwater built on the seabed foundation with low bearing capacity in the west harbour zone of yantai port in this study taking the rubble mound breakwaters constructed in phase i at the west harbour zone as the representative the developed numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted to predict the subsidence of the breakwaters to provide engineers with the settlement value making the reserved redundant height of the rubble mound breakwater more appropriate in design stage to implement this application the profiles and basic physical properties of the seabed soil layers which is as the foundation of the rb breakwaters at the west harbour zone were firstly collected from the consultant company in charge of the in situ geotechnical survey in the west port zone as demonstrated in fig 7 there are mainly five soil layers in the seabed foundation of the rb breakwaters they are muddy silt clay ① 1 silty clay ① 2 clay ③ 1 silty clay ③ 2 and silt ③ 4 respectively their basic physical properties of the five seabed soil layers obtained by performing a series of geotechnical tests are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the muddy silt clay ① 1 and ① 2 are weak soil layers with a thickness of 12 m to 14 m their water content is up to 39 6 and 32 3 void ratio is around 1 0 and the bearing capacity f is only 70 90 kpa respectively in engineering practice the surface layer with a thickness of 1 3 m of the first soil layer ① 1 exactly beneath the rubble mound breakwater was replaced with dense medium sand to enhance the bearing capacity of the seabed foundation furthermore a great number of plastic drainage strips with a length of 14 m were inserted into the soil layers ① 1 and ① 2 with a spacing of 1 0 m to improve their seepage permeability as illustrated in fig 6 this engineering measure can effectively to accelerate the process of consolidation of the seabed foundation as well as reduce the subsiding of overlying rubble mound breakwaters to some extent in table 2 it is also can be found that the seabed soil layers ③ 1 ③ 2 ③ 3 all have relatively excellent bearing performance with their bearing capacity is in the range of 180 kpa to 200 kpa 5 computational domain boundary condition and soil parameters according to the design diagram of the rubble mound breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port as shown in fig 6 and the profiles of seabed soil layers in fig 7 the computational domain used in this study to predict the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port is illustrated in fig 8 the total length of the computational domain is 750 m x 350 m to x 1100 m the width at bottom of the rubble mound breakwater is 130 m its distance to the left and right boundary of the seabed foundation is 400 m and 210 m respectively due to the fact the maximum depth of surveying boreholes in the seabed floor on which this rubble mound breakwater is built is only 35 5 m the thickness of the seabed foundation in the computation is set as 35 5 m correspondingly in this study the seabed surface is set as z 0 m and the left side of the seabed foundation is set as x 350 m besides the spt of ③ 4 is 28 and its bearing capacity is 200 kpa as that listed in table 2 it means the soil layer ③ 4 is very hard therefore taking the soil layer ③ 4 as the bottom of computational domain has the reasonability in computation the following boundary conditions are applied 1 the lateral sides of seabed foundation are fixed in horizontal 7 u s l e f t s i d e u s r i g h t s i d e 0 2 the bottom of seabed foundation is fixed in both horizontal and vertical and treated as a impermeable board 8 u s w s 0 a n d p z 0 a t z 35 5 m 3 on the surface of the seabed floor and the outer surfaces of the rubble mound breakwater the total hydrostatic pressure is applied according to the hydrological survey the average water depth in front of the rubble mound breakwater is 19 56 m under the condition of normal sea state therefore the hydrostatic water pressure can be determined following p ρ 19 56 z and its applying direction is perpendicular to the surface of the rubble mound breakwater and its seabed foundation this application of the hydrostatic water pressure makes the buoyancy applied on these rubble mounds can be considered in computation as we known there must be buoyancy for these rubble mounds under swl due to the fact that some water has been expelled by them as a result the pressure on the bottom of structure induced by the overlying rubble mound breakwater is much less that if the buoyancy is not taken into consideration therefore the hydrostatic water pressure must be applied otherwise the subsidence of structure will be overestimated due to the overestimation of the bottom pressure of structure additionally it is worth to point out that the hydrostatic pressure at a position is not a constant but would be changed accompanying the subsiding of structure and the deformation of seabed foundation especially in the cases large deformation or and great subsidence are involved fortunately fssi cas 2d can timely update the hydrostatic pressure on boundary nodes by checking the current position of each boundary nodes at each time step in computation this variation of hydrostatic pressure on boundaries can be effectively handled by fssi cas 2d this is one of the priorities of fssi cas 2d in solving the nonlinear interacting between seawater structure and its seabed foundation under dynamic or quasi static loading 4 finally the effective stress component perpendicular to the outer surface of structure and its seabed foundation as well as the shear stress on it must be kept as zero all the time in computation due to the fact that the rubble mound breakwater and its seabed foundation are both porous medium rather than impermeable structure or medium otherwise the stress boundary condition on the outer surface of the rubble mound breakwater and the seabed foundation is wrong as demonstrated in fig 7 there are totally seven types of material in the computational domain the seabed foundation is divided into three material zones they are m1 z 10 to 0 m for the soil layer ① 1 and ① 2 due to their similar properties m2 z 17 to 10 m for the soil layer ③ 4 and m3 z 35 5 to 17 m for the soil layer ③ 2 and ③ 4 due to their similar properties as illustrated in table 2 the replacement layer with a thickness of 1 3 m beneath the rubble mound breakwater is set as material m4 as stated above a great number plastic drainage trip have been inserted into the materials m1 and m2 to enhance the vertical permeability of the soil layers the soil in which the plastic drainage strips are inserted in the soil layer ① 1 and ③ 1 is set as material m5 m6 respectively the rubble mound breakwater is set as material m7 and is divided into fine layer based on the characteristics of its outer shape in fe computation the weight of these rubble mounds buoyancy is considered under swl 19 26 is applied in the way of layer by layer in this study the modified cambridge clay soil model is adopted to describe the mechanical behavior of the material m1 m2 m5 m6 due to the fact that m1 m2 m5 and m6 have significant compressibility caused by their relatively low bearing capacity the rubble mound breakwater m7 is described adopting poro elastic soil model because these rubble mounds mixture are very strong relative to soil m4 is a kind of dense medium sand to replace the muddy clay in engineering therefore pore elastic soil model is also used for m4 due to the fact that the material m3 for the soil layers ③ 2 and ③ 4 has a great bearing capacity f 180 200 kpa and high value of spt 13 to 28 it means the soil layer ③ 2 and ③ 4 will contribute little to the subsidence of the overlying structure based on this recognition pore elastic soil model is also used for material m3 in computation the mesh is generated according to the loading applying process of the overlying rubble mound breakwater in the way of layer by layer as shown in fig 9 once one layer of rubble mounds is built the subsidence of the breakwater is predicted until to its stable state after that the next layer of rubble mounds is built in the mesh system and the subsidence is continuously predicted by fssi cas 2d until the fifth layer is built finally the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater could be totally predicted it is an indisputable fact in the field of geomechanics that the reliability of the computation results is highly dependent on the accuracy of soil rock s physical parameters in this study the modified cambridge clay model referred as mcc model thereafter and poro elastic model are used to describe the quasi static mechanical behavior of the seabed foundation soil therefore it is necessary to determine the model parameters needed by the modified cambridge clay and pore elastic model for the seven types of material m1 to m7 actually a number of conventional laboratory and in site geotechnical testing work in the field surveying stage have been conducted by engineers according to the chinese code for investigation of geochanical engineering of ports jts 133 1 2010 and the code of design and construction of breakwater jts 154 1 2011 all the physical properties of the five soil layers measured in these tests have been listed in table 2 however the model parameters of the five soil layers for the modified cambridge clay or pore elastic model were not given by engineers involved in the laboratory testing as a result the model parameters of m1 to m7 for the mcc or pore elastic model have to be estimated according to the property parameters listed in table 2 in the mcc model there are five model parameters needed in computation they are poisson s ratio ν other slope of critical state line csl m f in p q coordinates the slope of normal consolidation line ncl λ in e ln p coordinates and the slope of the rebounding line in e ln p coordinates and finally the overconsolidation ratio ocr of soil at a position firstly m f can be estimated as following 9 m f 6 sin ϕ 3 sin ϕ where ϕ is the friction angle of soil ϕ and ν both can be measured in conventional drained triaxial test secondly λ can be estimated adopting the formulation λ c c 2 3 where c c is the compression index the value c c of the five soil layers have been given in table 2 generally κ is 1 2 1 5 of λ depending on the strength of soils for soft soil κ generally is much less than λ in this study κ is set as 1 3 of λ for m1 m4 and is set as 1 4 of λ for m2 m5 fortunately the value of ocr has been measured in the geotechnical surveying stage the distribution of ocr along the depth is demonstrated in fig 10 it is observed that the distribution of ocr in the seabed foundation in the soil layer ① 1 and ① 4 is not concentrated but scattered however the ocr in the soil layer ① 1 overall is less than that in the soil layer ① 4 the mean value of the measured ocr is 1 07 in the soil layer ① 1 and is 1 55 in the soil layer ① 4 therefore the ocr is set as 1 07 for m1 m5 1 55 for m2 m6 for the material m3 young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν is needed by the pore elastic model the e of m3 can be estimated according to 10 e 1 ν 1 2 ν 1 ν e s where e s is the deformation modulus which has been given out in table 2 ν is set as 0 3 for m3 in computation and 0 38 for m1 m2 m5 m6 m4 is dense medium sand its e is set as 100mpa ν 0 35 material m7 is composed of large rubble mounds its e is set as 10 gpa ν 0 25 finally all the model parameter and properties of m1 to m7 are listed in table 3 it must be pointed out that the permeability of foundation soils basically has no effect on the final magnitude of subsidence but the speed of consolidation process will be significantly affected by the permeability of soil layer 6 results 6 1 initial status before the rubble mound breakwater is built there is an initial state of effective stress pore pressure and displacement in the seabed foundation this initial state must be determined first for the thereafter structures subsidence computation because the current stress state must be known in advance to judge the current overconsolidation state of soil through comparing the current stress with the greatest stress in history if the modified cambridge clay model is used it is known that the vertical displacement in the seabed foundation must be very small due to the fact that there is no external loading applied on the seabed floor before the overlying offshore structure is constructed however this initial displacement has to be set as 0 in the thereafter subsidence analysis because this initial state is a natural state which has been occurred in the past geological history this natural initial vertical displacement will certainly not cause the subsidence of overlying structures the distribution of the pore pressure and effective stress in the seabed foundation before the rubble mound breakwater is constructed are illustrated in fig 11 it is found that the initial pore pressure and i 1 3 is distributed in layers there is no any excess pore pressure in the seabed foundation before the rubble mound breakwater is constructed it is interesting to observe that there are two concentrated zone of shear stress along the two interfaces between m1 m2 and m5 m6 this phenomenon is mainly attributed to that the stiffness of material m1 m2 and m5 m6 are significantly different if the physical properties of m1 m2 m5 and m6 are the same then this shear stress concentrated zone will disappear 6 2 subsidence after first layer is built taking the initial stress and pore pressure as the initial condition t 0 the subsidence process after the first layer rubble mounds is built can be numerically predicted adopting fssi cas 2d fig 12 demonstrates the variation process of the pore pressure p mean effective stress i 1 3 and void ratio at the type position a x 750 m z 6 7 m in the subsiding process of the rubble mound breakwater after the first layer is built it is observed that the pore pressure in the seabed foundation beneath the breakwater has significantly increased at the initial early stage because the loading induced by the weight of the first layer is totally undertaken only by the pore water in the seabed soil beneath the breakwater after that the pore pressure in the seabed foundation gradually dissipates until to its initial hydrostatic value accompanying the pore water is drained out of the seabed which is driven by pore pressure gradient in this process the loading undertaken by the pore water gradually is transmitted to the soil particles of seabed making the mean effective stress in the seabed foundation gradually increase until to reach its stable state meanwhile the increasing of the mean effective stress further cause the seabed foundation soil being compressed resulting in the void ratio of the seabed soil gradually reducing as illustrated in fig 12 as a result the overlying rubble mound breakwater gradually subsidence correspondingly as that demonstrated in fig 13 it is shown that the subsidence of the first layer after it is built is 16 3 cm the distribution of the vertical subsidence after the first layer is built are shown in fig 14 it is observed that the subsidence of first layer is not uniform the subsidence of the central zone in the first layer is much greater than that in the two lateral zones and only the seabed soil beneath the rubble mound breakwater is compressed there is basically no subsidence in the seabed foundation away from the rb breakwater due to the fact that there is no external loading is applied on it the distribution of pore pressure mean effective stress i 1 3 and shear stress τ x z when the consolidation process has finished after the first layer is built is demonstrated in fig 15 the mean effective stress i 1 3 in the zone beneath the rb breakwater has significantly increased due to the fact that the weight of the first layer rubble mounds has been completely undertaken by beneath seabed foundation when the consolidation process has finished it is also found that there are two shear stress concentrated zones in the seabed foundation under the two lateral parts of the rb breakwater the maximum magnitude of τ x z could be greater than 20 kpa 6 3 subsidence after second to fifth layer is built for the sake of simplicity the consolidation and subsidence process of the rb breakwater after the second layer to fifth layer is respectively built are discussed and analyzed together in this section the subsiding processes of the rm breakwater after the second layer to fifth layer is respectively built are demonstrated in fig 16 it is found the subsiding process shown in fig 16 are basically the same with that after the first layer is built the only difference is that the subsidence of the rm breakwater becoming greater and greater after the rubble mounds breakwater is built in the way of layer by layer in fig 16 d it is known that the final subsidence of the rm breakwater is predicted as 64 1 cm by the numerical model fssi cas 2d after the total five layers of rubble mounds are all constructed this magnitude of post construction subsidence is considerable a redundant height with about 0 7 m should be reserved in design for the purpose that the top elevation of the rb breakwater could reach the designed requirement otherwise the rb breakwater maybe cannot normally service after its subsidence is finished except the time history of the subsiding the distributions of the vertical subsidence of the rm breakwater and its seabed foundation after the second layer to fifth layer is respectively built are illustrated in fig 17 in fig 17 it is observed that the distribution characteristics of the subsiding in the rm breakwater and its foundation is basically similar with that after the first layer is built the subsidence of the middle part of the rm breakwater is significantly greater than that of the lateral parts and only the seabed soil beneath the rm breakwater is compressed there is basically no the vertical subsidence in the seabed foundation zone away from the rm breakwater accompanying the construction process of the rubble mounds layer by layer the magnitude of the subsidence of the rm breakwater gradually increases however it is worth to point out that the variation process of the pore pressure mean effective stress and the void ratio in the seabed foundation is not ways monotonically increased or reduced as that shown in fig 12 fig 18 illustrates the process of the pore pressure mean effective stress and the void ratio at the typical position a after the fourth layer is built as demonstrated in fig 18 the pore pressure is increased i 1 3 is reduced before the time c v t h 2 0 06 meanwhile the seabed soil at position a is dilated after the time c v t h 2 0 06 the pore pressure gradually dissipate and the mean effective stress increases correspondingly meanwhile the seabed soil at the position a is gradually compressed accompanying the pore water is drained out until to the stable state this non monotonic variation process of pore pressure and effective stress is a typical mandel cryer effect it is indicated that the subsiding of the rm breakwater and consolidation of seabed foundation is a complicated nonlinear process the distributions of the final pore pressure mean effective stress and shear stress after the rm breakwater is completely constructed are illustrated in fig 19 it is observed that the pore pressure is also distributed in layers there are will no excess pore pressure in the seabed foundation because it has been completely dissipated the effective stress in the foundation beneath the rm breakwater has significantly increased due to the gravity compression of the overlying rm breakwater there are still two shear stress concentrated zones in the seabed foundation under the two lateral parts of the rm breakwater and the area of the concentrated zones are much larger in size than that after the first layer is built it is also found that there are also two shear stress concentrated zones in the two lateral slopes in the rm breakwater the maximum magnitude of the concentrated shear stress reaches up to 70 80 kpa in the two lateral slopes this magnitude is much greater than that in the beneath seabed foundation due to the fact that the strength resisting shearing of the rubble mound layers is much greater than the maximum shear stress generated in the lateral slopes the stability against slope sliding of the rm breakwater can be guaranteed 6 4 comparison with observation data in the practice of engineering the whole rm breakwater was constructed one section by one section and was constructed layer by layer in one section a number of displacement sensors have been installed on the rubble mound breakwater at different typical cross sections once they were successfully constructed the time history of the subsidence recorded by these sensors no 1 to no 18 are shown in fig 20 it is known that the starting date to record the subsidence of the rm breakwater is different from different sensors the earliest date starting to monitor is 15th may 2013 no 1 and the latest date is 18th october 2013 no 18 correspondingly the longest period for the monitoring is 192 days and shortest period is only 60 days due to the fact that the longer the monitoring period the more reliable the monitoring data for the subsidence of structures only the monitoring data recorded for more than 100 days as shown in fig 20 a are adopted to verify the numerical result predicted by fssi cas 2d in fig 20 a it is known that the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater is in the range of 44 cm to 76 cm meanwhile the final subsidence predicted by fssi cas 2d is 64 1 cm which is exactly in the range of the monitoring data at the in site the difference to the lower and upper limit of the monitoring data is about 30 and 13 for a numerical prediction result in practical engineering this degree of derivation actually is acceptable and commendable it is indicated that the subsidence of the rm breakwater predicted by fssi cas 2d is reliable and the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is reliable to predict the consolidation subsidence of offshore structures so long as their foundation soil layers could be relatively accurately divided through the geotechnical survey as well as appropriate soil constitutive models are used and reliable model parameters for soil layers are calibrated through laboratory tests 7 conclusion in this study taking the huge rubble mound breakwater in the west part zone at yantai port as the engineering background the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is adopted to predict the subsidence of the rubble mound breakwater built on the seabed foundation composed by muddy clay clay and silty soil layers in computation the modified cambridge soil model and poro elastic model are used to describe the behavior of the seabed foundation soil layers one of priorities in this study is that the buoyancy applied on the rubble mounds and its nonlinear variation under static water level swl is taken into consideration in fssi cas 2d the computational results show that the rubble mound breakwater gradually subsides during the construction period the final subsidence is predicted as 64 1 cm which is exactly in the range of monitoring data the deviation to the lower and upper limit of the in site monitoring data is about 30 and 13 respectively this degree of deviation actually is acceptable for a numerical model when it is applied in engineering practice through the analytical and experimental verification as well as the comparison with in situ observation data it is indicated that the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is usable for the problems of consolidation and for the subsidence prediction of structures and fssi cas 2d has the potential ability to be applied in practical engineering it must be noted that there are also several limitations in the present work firstly the randomness in the soil layers distribution in the seabed foundation cannot be considered in computation definitely this randomness also cannot be clearly figured out by engineers due to the fact only limited number of drilling can be performed in the geotechnical survey therefore this limitation is inevitable in numerical modeling secondly several parameters used in computation are not directly measured in laboratory but estimated based on some other measured parameters thirdly the building process of the rubble mound breakwater cannot be modeled in fssi cas 2d the real gradual loading process during the construction period is simplified as five times of transient loading the above limitations and simplification would have some unquantifiable effect for the prediction result as a result the numerical prediction result is impossible to be exactly the same with the in site observation data fssi cas 2d cannot be applied for the problems of wave current induced scouring it only can be applicable for the problems of consolidation subsidence dynamics of structures and their foundation under self weight ocean wave loading or seismic wave loading currently there are also three aspects that could limit the application potential of fssi cas 2d firstly there is still no graphic user interface developed as a result it is a little difficult for new users to use it secondly there is no parallel computation developed resulting in that a large scale computation is impossible to be implemented for practical engineering cases thirdly the thermodynamics and the unsaturation of soil cannot be handled so far these problems can only be solved step by step in the future credit authorship

21271,tracking control of marine vessels in the presence of parametric uncertainty and additive periodic disturbances is considered for optimal estimation of environmental forces periodic disturbance estimation method inspired from fourier series expansion have been applied stability of the closed loop system and the convergence of the tracking error under the closed loop operation are established via lyapunov based arguments simulation studies are provided to support the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords marine vessels tracking control adaptive control periodic disturbance estimation 1 introduction in an effort to utilize the environmental resources of oceans in a more effective way research on dynamical positioning of marine systems used in offshore operations have gained momentum in recent years significant amount of those operations are for offshore oil and gas drilling underwater pipeline and cable laying offshore wind farm constructing turbines and also for marine rescue and wreck investigation automatic control of marine vessels to our best knowledge has started with the invention of electrically driven gyroscopes in early marine control systems fossen 2002 these early controllers were followed by linear controller approaches applied onto the simplified system model of marine vessels obtained from the linearization about pre specified yaw angles fossen and grovlen 1998 proportional integral derivative pid type controller balchen et al 1980 and linear optimal control laws balchen et al 1976 grimble et al 1980 sorensen et al 1996 are some examples of the linear controller approaches sliding mode controllers as in agostinho et al 2009 tannuri et al 2010 and h control katebi et al 2001 were also presented as a feasible solution for the control of the linearized system model problems inherited by linearization motivated researchers to apply nonlinear control techniques for the accurate control of marine vehicles singular perturbation theory supported robust nonlinear control law was proposed for the control of an underwater vehicle in de wit et al 1998 in fjellstad and fossen 2014 position regulation of underwater vehicles was provided via nonlinear proportional derivative pd type controller while higher order sliding mode controller was proposed for the similar purpose in marine vessel control in tannuri and agostinho 2010 a full state feedback nonlinear robust control design was used to provide position tracking control of marine vessels in bidikli et al 2017a in zhang et al 2017 a novel robust model predictive control method was proposed for the path following control of underactuated marine vessels interpolation of the riccati equation solution based robust h control design was realized for the control of underwater vehicles in zhang et al 2018 in chen et al 2013 positioning of a marine vessel was provided via a robust adaptive control design having dynamic control allocation trajectory tracking control of fully actuated marine vessels was provided via a robust adaptive finite time tracking control design in wang et al 2016 in du et al 2015 a high gain observer based robust adaptive output feedback controller was designed to ensure dynamic positioning of ships while an observer based robust adaptive nonlinear control design was realized to ensure the position tracking control of marine vessels in bidikli et al 2017b path following of an underactuated marine vessel was provided via a fuzzy unknown observer based robust adaptive controller in the presence of unmodeled dynamics uncertainties and disturbances in wang et al 2019 in zhang et al 2019 dynamic positioning system of marine vessels was designed by utilizing a lyapunov based robust adaptive control approach as highlighted in many studies on control of marine vehicles parametric uncertainty and environmental disturbances are crucial cases that have to be taken into account in some of the control studies about these type of systems it was observed that designing a robust controller may not cope with external disturbances and parametric uncertainty together in these type of situations the designed robust controller can be supported with an extra tool as it was preferred in some of the aforementioned robust control designs in balchen et al 1980 pid controller was cascaded with a low pass filter in balchen et al 1976 grimble et al 1980 and sorensen et al 1996 linear optimal control laws were used in conjunction with kalman filtering techniques in fjellstad and fossen 2014 nonlinear pd type controller was supported with an extended kalman filter to reach the mentioned aim disturbance observer zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 and fuzzy unknown observer wang et al 2019 are among the preferred tools to cope with the effects of external disturbances in marine control systems from the examination of these studies one may conclude that using extra tools to estimate external disturbances usually provide increased control performance compared to the classical robust controllers however the use of the aforementioned extra tools generally increase the complexity of controller s structure it is clear that proposing a novel control approach that can cope with the external disturbances and parametric uncertainty without needing additional tools is a valid contribution for this research area to address this open research problem by compensating for external disturbances and parametric uncertainties recently in du et al 2018 external disturbances of a marine vehicle dynamics were modeled as periodic disturbances and a robust adaptive controller was designed that yielded a globally uniformly ultimately bounded tracking result inspired mainly from the idea of modeling low frequency disturbances of the ocean environment as summation of a series of sinusoidal components having different frequencies amplitudes and phases in du et al 2018 in this study we have designed a robust controller that ensures the position tracking of marine vessel in the presence of parametric uncertainty and unknown but periodic external disturbances in contrast to the widely used repetitive learning controller where the period of periodic signal is required to be known exactly in this work by using a fourier series expansion like method the external disturbance is modeled without needing additional information then backstepping control technique is utilized to design a robust control structure supported with a periodic disturbance estimation method at this point it should be noted that disturbance estimation is not made available by the use of an extra tool but is constructed as a part of the controller designed to the authors best knowledge a robust control structure that efficiently provides the position tracking control of marine vessels subject to periodic disturbance without using additional information about the type of the disturbance which also does not utilize additional tools for disturbance estimation has been designed for the first time while the concept of representing disturbances and noise terms using a fourier series expansion like method is firstly applied to marine vessel control in this work this method was previously applied to robotic systems in delibasi et al cansever delibasi et al 2006 the robotic systems are commonly represented with similar dynamical equations to that of marine vehicles however the periodic disturbances affecting the robotic systems are commonly modeled with known periods which allows the use of repetitive learning techniques however the use of this method on marine vehicles where the main source of external disturbance terms being oceanic waves is to our best knowledge is limited to the proposed work when compared with du et al 2018 in this work asymptotic convergence of the error signals is achieved without requiring an initial bound or projection type bounding requirements on the parameter estimation signals the remaining parts of the paper is organized as follows section 2 represents a dynamic model of the 3 degree of freedom marine vessel while section 3 shows the error system and the control objective stability analysis and numerical results are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively section 6 contains concluding remarks 2 system model the mathematical model for the dynamically positioned ship has the following form fossen 2002 1 η j ν 2 m ν d ν d τ where η t ν t r 3 represent the position and the velocity vectors of the ship respectively d t r 3 is the vector that contains uncertain periodic disturbances τ t r 3 denotes the vector of control inputs m r 3 3 is the constant positive definite symmetric uncertain mass inertia matrix d r 3 3 is the

contains translational velocities denoted by u t v t r and the rotational velocity about yaw angle denoted by r t r after taking the time derivative of 1 and using the orthogonality property of the

estimation method inspired from fourier series expansion have been applied stability of the closed loop system and the convergence of the tracking error under the closed loop operation are established via lyapunov based arguments simulation studies are provided to support the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords marine vessels tracking control adaptive control periodic disturbance estimation 1 introduction in an effort to utilize the environmental resources of oceans in a more effective way research on dynamical positioning of marine systems used in offshore operations have gained momentum in recent years significant amount of those operations are for offshore oil and gas drilling underwater pipeline and cable laying offshore wind farm constructing turbines and also for marine rescue and wreck investigation automatic control of marine vessels to our best knowledge has started with the invention of electrically driven gyroscopes in early marine control systems fossen 2002 these early controllers were followed by linear controller approaches applied onto the simplified system model of marine vessels obtained from the linearization about pre specified yaw angles fossen and grovlen 1998 proportional integral derivative pid type controller balchen et al 1980 and linear optimal control laws balchen et al 1976 grimble et al 1980 sorensen et al 1996 are some examples of the linear controller approaches sliding mode controllers as in agostinho et al 2009 tannuri et al 2010 and h control katebi et al 2001 were also presented as a feasible solution for the control of the linearized system model problems inherited by linearization motivated researchers to apply nonlinear control techniques for the accurate control of marine vehicles singular perturbation theory supported robust nonlinear control law was proposed for the control of an underwater vehicle in de wit et al 1998 in fjellstad and fossen 2014 position regulation of underwater vehicles was provided via nonlinear proportional derivative pd type controller while higher order sliding mode controller was proposed for the similar purpose in marine vessel control in tannuri and agostinho 2010 a full state feedback nonlinear robust control design was used to provide position tracking control of marine vessels in bidikli et al 2017a in zhang et al 2017 a novel robust model predictive control method was proposed for the path following control of underactuated marine vessels interpolation of the riccati equation solution based robust h control design was realized for the control of underwater vehicles in zhang et al 2018 in chen et al 2013 positioning of a marine vessel was provided via a robust adaptive control design having dynamic control allocation trajectory tracking control of fully actuated marine vessels was provided via a robust adaptive finite time tracking control design in wang et al 2016 in du et al 2015 a high gain observer based robust adaptive output feedback controller was designed to ensure dynamic positioning of ships while an observer based robust adaptive nonlinear control design was realized to ensure the position tracking control of marine vessels in bidikli et al 2017b path following of an underactuated marine vessel was provided via a fuzzy unknown observer based robust adaptive controller in the presence of unmodeled dynamics uncertainties and disturbances in wang et al 2019 in zhang et al 2019 dynamic positioning system of marine vessels was designed by utilizing a lyapunov based robust adaptive control approach as highlighted in many studies on control of marine vehicles parametric uncertainty and environmental disturbances are crucial cases that have to be taken into account in some of the control studies about these type of systems it was observed that designing a robust controller may not cope with external disturbances and parametric uncertainty together in these type of situations the designed robust controller can be supported with an extra tool as it was preferred in some of the aforementioned robust control designs in balchen et al 1980 pid controller was cascaded with a low pass filter in balchen et al 1976 grimble et al 1980 and sorensen et al 1996 linear optimal control laws were used in conjunction with kalman filtering techniques in fjellstad and fossen 2014 nonlinear pd type controller was supported with an extended kalman filter to reach the mentioned aim disturbance observer zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 and fuzzy unknown observer wang et al 2019 are among the preferred tools to cope with the effects of external disturbances in marine control systems from the examination of these studies one may conclude that using extra tools to estimate external disturbances usually provide increased control performance compared to the classical robust controllers however the use of the aforementioned extra tools generally increase the complexity of controller s structure it is clear that proposing a novel control approach that can cope with the external disturbances and parametric uncertainty without needing additional tools is a valid contribution for this research area to address this open research problem by compensating for external disturbances and parametric uncertainties recently in du et al 2018 external disturbances of a marine vehicle dynamics were modeled as periodic disturbances and a robust adaptive controller was designed that yielded a globally uniformly ultimately bounded tracking result inspired mainly from the idea of modeling low frequency disturbances of the ocean environment as summation of a series of sinusoidal components having different frequencies amplitudes and phases in du et al 2018 in this study we have designed a robust controller that ensures the position tracking of marine vessel in the presence of parametric uncertainty and unknown but periodic external disturbances in contrast to the widely used repetitive learning controller where the period of periodic signal is required to be known exactly in this work by using a fourier series expansion like method the external disturbance is modeled without needing additional information then backstepping control technique is utilized to design a robust control structure supported with a periodic disturbance estimation method at this point it should be noted that disturbance estimation is not made available by the use of an extra tool but is constructed as a part of the controller designed to the authors best knowledge a robust control structure that efficiently provides the position tracking control of marine vessels subject to periodic disturbance without using additional information about the type of the disturbance which also does not utilize additional tools for disturbance estimation has been designed for the first time while the concept of representing disturbances and noise terms using a fourier series expansion like method is firstly applied to marine vessel control in this work this method was previously applied to robotic systems in delibasi et al cansever delibasi et al 2006 the robotic systems are commonly represented with similar dynamical equations to that of marine vehicles however the periodic disturbances affecting the robotic systems are commonly modeled with known periods which allows the use of repetitive learning techniques however the use of this method on marine vehicles where the main source of external disturbance terms being oceanic waves is to our best knowledge is limited to the proposed work when compared with du et al 2018 in this work asymptotic convergence of the error signals is achieved without requiring an initial bound or projection type bounding requirements on the parameter estimation signals the remaining parts of the paper is organized as follows section 2 represents a dynamic model of the 3 degree of freedom marine vessel while section 3 shows the error system and the control objective stability analysis and numerical results are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively section 6 contains concluding remarks 2 system model the mathematical

al 2008 sousa et al 2010 hasanpour et al 2012 do et al 2014 the underwater shallow tunneling may cause more severe engineering problems and has not been highlighted besides the groundwater level variation is an extensive challenge that engineers will face in the operation and maintenance of tunnel construction lu et al 2020a which is also a concerned parameter influencing the stress or displacement distribution and not fully highlighted the analytical method yu et al 2016 2019 is an efficient and convenient method for predicting ground stress and displacement field distribution caused by the underwater tunneling therefore the motivation of this paper is to analytically obtain the stress and displacement of the ground for an underwater shallow tunnel the mechanical model of a shallow tunnel is a semi infinite domain model owing to the influences of the ground surface some studies are carried out to present the seepage field of the shallow tunnel on the basis of the darcy law lei 1999 el tani 2003 the analytical solution of the seepage field usually considers the influences of the constant or positional hydraulic head or the constant water pressure of the tunnel perimeter kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 these proposed analytical solutions of the seepage field can only obtain the pore water pressure distribution however cannot determine the total stress the ground displacement and the time effect of ground displacement four methods are applied to determine the elastic or viscoelastic analytical solution of ground stress and displacement namely the airy stress function method bobet 2001 stochastic medium method yang et al 2004 virtual image method sagaseta 1987 and complex variable method verruijt 1997 in particular based on the complex variable method verruijt 1998 fu et al 2015 lu et al 2019a the ground stress and displacement for a shallow tunnel are simultaneously determined by an infinite power series in the complex plane where all concerning geometrical and mechanical parameters are included different from the cauchy integral used in the mechanical model of the deep tunnel lei et al 2001 exadaktylos and stavropoulou 2002 zhang et al 2003 the laurent series and conformal mapping function zhang et al 2018 lu et al 2019a are applied in the elastic solution of a shallow tunnel the reasonable boundary condition is a key factor for obtaining elastic or viscoelastic analytical solutions of a shallow tunnel a uniform convergence owing to ground loss verruijt 1997 fu et al 2015 a nonuniform deformation mode that is nonsymmetrical with respect to the horizontal center line zhang et al 2018 2020 and a unified displacement function that is nonsymmetrical with respect to the horizontal and vertical center line kong et al 2019a b lu et al 2019a are used as the displacement boundary of the tunnel perimeter to obtain the elastic analytical solution of ground displacement and stress however the rheological properties of ground and the influence of groundwater are not considered in these works few works are conducted on the viscoelastic analytical solution for shallow tunnels at present based on classical viscoelastic constitutive model vcm wang et al 2018 obtained the viscoelastic analytical solution considering the influence of the surface surcharge load the newton viscous element expressed by integer order differential is used in the classical vcms where series or parallel connections of the newton viscous elements and spring elements reflect the rheological characteristic of the exponential relation of the surrounding rock however the creep and relaxation responses of geotechnical materials present a power law alotta et al 2014 2017 the fractional vcm consisting fractional viscous elements koeller 1984 kempfle et al 2002 and spring elements can reflect a power law of surrounding rock rheological in particular when the fractional order is equal to 1 the fractional vcm is reduced to the classical vcm lu et al 2020b obtained the viscoelastic analytical solution of ground displacement based on a unified displacement function and fractional vcm however the influence of the groundwater are not considered in the works of wang et al 2018 and lu et al 2020b fang et al 2015 and lu et al 2019b obtained the elastic analytical solution of the stress and displacement of the underwater shallow tunnel the uniform support pressure and support pressure related to vertical position are respectively used as the sbctp in the works of fang et al 2015 and lu et al 2019b in these two works the sbctp cannot reflect nonsymmetrical stress with respect to the vertical center line besides the time effect of ground deformation of the underwater shallow tunnel cannot also be obtained a unified stress function corresponding to a first order fourier series is proposed as the sbctp which can reflect the complex stress state of tunnel perimeter owing to the interaction of water soil supporting structure the complex geological conditions and the bias loads the mechanical analysis model of an underwater shallow tunnel is established by dividing the mechanical analysis model into two parts the elastic analytical solution is obtained for an underwater shallow tunnel the obtained elastic solution is developed into the fractional viscoelastic analytical solution on the basis of the correspondence principle the time effect of the ground displacement and the ground stress are investigated for different sbctps 2 unified stress function of the tunnel perimeter the complex stress state is formed at the tunnel perimeter owing to the interaction of water soil supporting structure the influence of the bias load at the ground surface or the underground and the irregular geological contours for the plane strain condition there are three stress components on the any point p of the tunnel perimeter as shown in fig 1 i e σ x σ y and σ x y σ x y σ y x point o and r 0 are respectively the center point and radius of the tunnel the angle between the line o p and the positive direction of the x axis is θ the tunnel profile is a 2π periodic function and the fourier series can express any periodic function by the trigonometric series expansions here the fourier series is adopted to express three stress components in eq 1 1 σ x θ a x 0 n 1 a x n sin n θ b x n cos n θ σ y θ a y 0 n 1 a y n sin n θ b y n cos n θ σ x y θ a x y 0 n 1 a x y n sin n θ b x y n cos n θ where a x 0 a x n b x n a y 0 a y n b y n a x y 0 a x y n and b x y n are

the coefficients of first order fourier series when eq 3 is reduced to 4 t x t y p cos θ p sin θ eq 4 is the uniform radial stress namely that the radial stress at any point of tunnel perimeter is equal to p and the stress direction points to the circle center t x and t y are symmetrical with respect to the horizontal and vertical centerlines eq 4 is used as the sbcts in some works verruijt 1998 fang et al 2015 when eq 3 is simplified to 5 t x t y p w r 0 γ w cos θ r 0 γ w sin 2 θ 2 r 0 γ w 2 p w r 0 γ w sin θ r 0 γ w cos 2 θ 2 where p w and γ w respectively are the initial water stress and water weight t x and t y are symmetrical with respect to vertical centerline and nonsymmetrical with respect to horizontal centerline due to the terms a x 1 and a y 1 eq 5 is used as the sbctp to obtain the elastic solution in the lu et al work 2019b the influences of b x 1 b y 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 and b x y 1 on the t x and t y are not discussed in the previous analytical works the influences of b x 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 and b x y 1 on the t x are shown in fig 2 the influences of b y 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 and b x y 1 on the t y are shown in fig 3 the tensile stress is positive and the compressive stress is negative in this work for t x the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the y axis can be reflected by b x 1 a x y 0 and a x y 1 and the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the x axis are described by a x y 0 and b x y 1 for t y b y 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 reflect the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the y axis a x y 0 and b x y 1 reflect the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the x axis the stress state of tunnel perimeter is described more accurately when the value of the order n of the fourier series is larger however corresponding to a larger value of n the derivation of the analytical solution of the stress and displacement field also becomes more complex eq 3 corresponding to that unified stress function order n equals 1 can capture complex stress states of the tunnel perimeter including the nonsymmetrical stress condition with respect to the horizontal center line owing to the buoyancy effect verruijt and strack 2008 and the diving tendency of the shield fu et al 2015 and nonsymmetrical stress condition with respect to the vertical center line owing to the coupling effects of the water soil supporting structure the influence of irregular geological conditions slightly over excavation or insufficient grouting and bias load 3 fractional viscoelastic analytical solution of an underwater shallow tunnel when eq 3 is used as the sbctp combining the complex variable method the elastic analytical solutions of the total stress and displacement for the underwater shallow tunnel are obtained based on the correspondence principle and fractional vcm the obtained elastic solution is developed into fractional viscoelastic analytical solution of an underwater shallow tunnel 3 1 problem description the mechanical model of

used in mechanical analyses in the past several years the space fractional operators are used to model media with porosity and layered structure carpinteri et al 2011 patnaik and semperlotti 2020 in this work the time fractional operators are focused on to describe the rheological properties of the ground the generalized kelvin fractional vcm is considered in the viscoelastic analytical solution combining the correspondence principle the viscoelastic analytical solution of a shallow tunnel is presented on the basis of the obtained elastic analytical solution in this section the volumetric modulus is considered as the infinity and the value of poisson s ratio remains constant with time and is equal to 0 5 which corresponds to the undrained conditions a similar consideration also appears in these works wang et al 2018 lu et al 2020b the laplace transforms and inverse transforms for shear modulus are expressed as follows the fractional viscous element used in this work is expressed as 37 σ η k d μ ε d t μ where μ is fractional order and the constant order fractional operator is used in this paper which is a special case of variable order fractional operator atangana and botha 2013 patnaik et al 2020 di paola et al 2020 η k is the viscous coefficient σ ε and t are respectively stress strain and time the range of fractional order μ is 0 μ 1 in this work when μ is equal to 1 the fractional viscous element is reduced to classical newton integer order viscous element when μ is equal to 0 the fractional viscous element is reduced to spring element when 0 μ 1 the value of μ reflects rheological behavior of different materials the generalized kelvin fractional model is shown in fig 9 where e m e k are the material parameters of the generalized kelvin fractional model for the element vcm when the elements are in parallel the total stress is equal to the sum of the stresses per element and the strain of each element is equal when the elements are in series the total strain is equal to the sum of the strains per element and the stress of each element is equal therefore for the generalized kelvin fractional model the following expression can be determined 38 ε m e m σ η k d μ ε k d t μ e k ε k σ ε m ε k ε ε m and ε k are respectively strains of two spring elements ε m and ε k are removed in eq 38 the generalized kelvin fractional vcm is expressed as follows 39 d μ ε d t μ e k η k ε 1 e m d μ σ d t μ e m e k η k e m σ the full memory sumelka and voyiadjis 2017 voyiadjis and sumelka 2019 and the fractional integral of riemann liouville are adopted in this work the laplace computation is done for eq 39 to obtain the relaxation modulus 40 e s t e m 1 e m e k e m n 0 1 n e k e m η k n 1 t n 1 μ γ n 1 μ 1 when μ equals 1 eq 40 is simplified to 41 e s t e m e k e m e k e m 2 e m e k e e m e k η k t e s t in eq 40 and eq 41 are respectively the power function and the exponential function compared with exponential function the power function could well describe the rheological properties of materials alotta et al 2017 therefore the viscoelastic analytical solution considering the fractional vcm can reasonably reflect the time effect of the ground movement the three dimensional constitutive relation of the rheological models is determined by generalizing the constitutive relation of the uniaxial stress state as expressed in eq 42 42 1 η k g m g k s μ s i j 2 g m g k g m g k s μ g m η k g m g k e i j where g m g k η k are the material parameters of the three dimensional constitutive relation s ij and e ij are the stress deviator and the strain deviator respectively and i j 1 2 3 s is the laplace operator based on the obtained elastic analytical solution the laplace transformation and inverse transformation are carried out for eq 14 the ground displacement of the viscoelasticity analytical solution is obtained 43 u x 2 i u y 2 κ ϕ z z ϕ z ψ z 2 j t where j t 1 g m 1 η k n 0 g k η k n t n 1 μ γ n 1 μ 1 the influences of fractional orders on the j t are shown in fig 10 the values of g m g k and η k are considered as follows g m 20 mpa g k 10 mpa η k 100 mpa day μ j t rapidly increases and then gradually tends to be stable with the increase of t when t is small the values of j t are almost the same for different values of μ as the time increases the value of j t is larger corresponding to a larger value of μ as shown in fig 10 for the problem of the constant sbctp the stress expressions are the same for the elastic and viscoelastic cases wang et al 2014 2018 and the time effect of ground displacement is analytically expressed in eq 43 4 parameter analysis the geometrical parameters of the tunnel are considered as r 0 3 m h 10 m mechanical parameters of surrounding rock are considered as g m 20 mpa g k 10 mpa η k 100 mpa day μ and ν is equal to 0 5 to reflect the consolidated undrained condition the weight of water γ w is considered as 10 kn m3 in this section the rigid body displacement term a 0 is determined when u x and u y are equal to 0 at the position 0 10h the influences of the stress release b x 1 b y 1 and a x y 0 on the ground displacement and stress are discussed in particular the stress unit is kpa 4 1 influences of stress release when the sbctp is considered as eq 44 the time effect of displacement and the influences of h w and γ on the ground stress are analyzed when the value of s r is equal to 0 σ x σ y and σ x y in eq 44 are equal to initial weight stress as expressed in eq 7 9 it corresponds to that the stress of the tunnel perimeter is not released and the ground displacement is equal to 0 when the value of s r is equal to 1 σ x σ y and σ x y in eq 44 are equal to 0 which indicates that the tunnel is not supported and the stress is completely released here the value of s r is considered as 0 2 to analyze the influence of sbctp on the ground displacement and stress 44 σ x γ w h w k 0 γ γ w y 1 s r σ y γ w h w γ γ w y 1 s r σ x y 0 when h w 10 m γ 10 kn m3 and μ equals 0 75 the time effect of the displacement of two points on the surface i e o 0 0 and a 0 5h 0 are discussed as shown in fig 11 the settlement value gradually increases and tends to be stable with time for two positions the settlement value of point o is always larger than that of point a for any time for point o the settlement of day 0 is about 0 74 mm and the settlement increases to 2 11 mm when t is equal to 150 for point a the settlements at day 0 and day 150 are 0 39 mm and 1 11 mm respectively the influences of the fractional order on the settlement of the point o with time are provided in fig 12 the settlement of point o tends to different stable values for different fractional orders in particular when t equals 0 day the shear modulus corresponding to different fractional orders are the same as expressed in eq 43 therefore the settlement of point o is also the same as shown in fig 12 the larger μ is the larger the displacement is the displacement corresponding to μ 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 are 1 67 mm 2 11 mm and 2 23 mm at day 150 respectively the horizontal displacement of the surface for different times are shown in fig 13 when μ is equal to 0 75 for different times the value of u x always equals 0 at x 0 m as shown in fig 13 which is determined by the symmetrical sbctp with respect to the vertical center line when x is more than 0 m the value of u x is always less than 0 meaning that the ground moves to the left side when x is less than 0 m the ground at the surface moves to the right side for the same position the value of u x rapidly increases and tends to a constant value with time as shown in fig 13 the curves of u x are close for day 100 and day 150 the influence of the fractional order on the horizontal displacement for day 10 is shown in fig 14 the absolute value of horizontal displacement becomes larger when the fractional order increases for the same position the vertical and horizontal stress distributions above the tunnel crown are analyzed due to the influences of the depth of the water h w as shown in fig 15 σ y 0 is the initial vertical self weight stress at different depths as shown in fig 15 a σ y is equal to the vertical self weight stress at the surface for different h w σ y gradually approaches σ y 0 from the tunnel crown to the surface which indicates that the degree of ground disturbance caused by tunneling decreases when it is far from the tunnel perimeter the horizontal stress distributions above the tunnel crown is shown in fig 15 b σ x gradually increases for different h w as the depth increases for the same depth the value of σ x is lager corresponding to a larger value of h w the influences of the uniform effective volumetric weight γ on the σ y from the tunnel crown to the surface are shown in fig 16 a the value of σ y is the same for different γ at the surface which is determined by γ w h w σ y first increases and then decreases with the increase of depth at the tunnel crown the larger value of σ y corresponds to a larger value of γ the influence of γ on the σ x is shown in fig 16 b the values of σ x at the ground surface are close for different values of γ the absolute value of σ x increases with the increase of the depth the increase rates of σ x along the depth becomes larger when the value of γ is larger 4 2 influences of b x 1 when the sbctp is considered as eq 45 the ground vertical and horizontal stresses are discussed due to the influence of b x 1 h w γ μ and s r are considered as follows h w 10 m γ 10 kn m3 μ 0 75 and s r 0 2 the vertical and horizontal stresses along the depth at x 0 5h are shown in fig 17 a b 45 σ x γ w h w k 0 γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r b x 1 cos θ σ y γ w h w γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r σ x y 0 when the value of b x 1 is equal to 50 the vertical stress along the depth closes to the σ y 0 at x 0 5h which is determined by the sbctp in eq 45 for the same depth the larger value of σ y corresponds to a smaller value of b x 1 as shown in fig 17 a when the depth is small the larger the value of b x 1 is the larger the value of σ x is with the increase of depth the value of σ x becomes larger when the value of b x 1 is smaller as shown in fig 17 b 4 3 influences of b y 1 when the sbctp is considered as eq 46 the influence of b y 1 on the ground vertical and horizontal stresses is analyzed 46 σ x γ w h w k 0 γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r σ y γ w h w γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r b

5h 0 and 0 5h respectively as shown in fig 18 a the value of σ y along the depth at x 0 5h closes the σ y 0 line which indicates that the degree of ground disturbance is small for x 0 5h and x 0 5h the value of σ y increases with the increase of depth for x 0 σ y first increases and then decreases with the increase of depth as shown in fig 18 a the value of σ x increases as the depth increases

correspondence principle the time dependent ground displacement are investigated considering the effect of stress release a series of parameter analyses are carried out to discuss the ground vertical and horizontal stress distributions under the influences of sbctps keywords underwater shallow tunnel unified stress function complex variable method fractional viscoelastic analytical solution stress and displacement field 1 introduction the underwater shallow tunnels have been widely used to cross the rivers and seas owing to its advantages in the being unaffected by bad weather land resources saving in tunnel projects li et al 2018 considerable studies have been performed to discuss the stress or displacement distribution caused by tunneling in the sand or clay ground condition funatsu et al 2008 sousa et al 2010 hasanpour et al 2012 do et al 2014 the underwater shallow tunneling may cause more severe engineering problems and has not been highlighted besides the groundwater level variation is an extensive challenge that engineers will face in the operation and maintenance of tunnel construction lu et al 2020a which is also a concerned parameter influencing the stress or displacement distribution and not fully highlighted the analytical method yu et al 2016 2019 is an efficient and convenient method for predicting ground stress and displacement field distribution caused by the underwater tunneling therefore the motivation of this paper is to analytically obtain the stress and displacement of the ground for an underwater shallow tunnel the mechanical model of a shallow tunnel is a semi infinite domain model owing to the influences of the ground surface some studies are carried out to present the seepage field of the shallow tunnel on the basis of the darcy law lei 1999 el tani 2003 the analytical solution of the seepage field usually considers the influences of the constant or positional hydraulic head or the constant water pressure of the tunnel perimeter kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 these proposed analytical solutions of the seepage field can only obtain the pore water pressure distribution however cannot determine the total stress the ground displacement and the time effect of ground displacement four methods are applied to determine the elastic or viscoelastic analytical solution of ground stress and displacement namely the airy stress function method bobet 2001 stochastic medium method yang et al 2004 virtual image method sagaseta 1987 and complex variable method verruijt 1997 in particular based on the complex variable method verruijt 1998 fu et al 2015 lu et al 2019a the ground stress and displacement for a shallow tunnel are simultaneously determined by an infinite power series in the complex plane where all concerning geometrical and mechanical parameters are included different from the cauchy integral used in the mechanical model of the deep tunnel lei et al 2001 exadaktylos and stavropoulou 2002 zhang et al 2003 the laurent series and conformal mapping function zhang et al 2018 lu et al 2019a are applied in the elastic solution of a shallow tunnel the reasonable boundary condition is a key factor for obtaining elastic or viscoelastic analytical solutions of a shallow tunnel a uniform convergence owing to ground loss verruijt 1997 fu et al 2015 a nonuniform deformation mode that is nonsymmetrical with respect to the horizontal center line zhang et al 2018 2020 and a unified displacement function that is nonsymmetrical with respect to the horizontal and vertical center line kong et al 2019a b lu et al 2019a are used as the displacement boundary of the tunnel perimeter to obtain the elastic analytical solution of ground displacement and stress however the rheological properties of ground and the influence of groundwater are not considered in these works few works are conducted on the viscoelastic analytical solution for shallow tunnels at present based on classical viscoelastic constitutive model vcm wang et al 2018 obtained the viscoelastic analytical solution considering the influence of the surface surcharge load the newton viscous element expressed by integer order differential is used in the classical vcms where series or parallel connections of the newton viscous elements and spring elements reflect the rheological characteristic of the exponential relation of the surrounding rock however the creep and relaxation responses of geotechnical materials present a power law alotta et al 2014 2017 the fractional vcm consisting fractional viscous elements koeller 1984 kempfle et al 2002 and spring elements can reflect a power law of surrounding rock rheological in particular when the fractional order is equal to 1 the fractional vcm is reduced to the classical vcm lu et al 2020b obtained the viscoelastic analytical solution of ground displacement based on a unified displacement function and fractional vcm however the influence of the groundwater are not considered in the works of wang et al 2018 and lu et al 2020b fang et al 2015 and lu et al 2019b obtained the elastic analytical solution of the stress and displacement of the underwater shallow tunnel the uniform support pressure and support pressure related to vertical position are respectively used as the sbctp in the works of fang et al 2015 and lu et al 2019b in these two works the sbctp cannot reflect nonsymmetrical stress with respect to the vertical center line besides the time effect of ground deformation of the underwater shallow tunnel cannot also be obtained a unified stress function corresponding to a first order fourier series is proposed as the sbctp which can reflect the complex stress state of tunnel perimeter owing to the interaction of water soil supporting structure the complex geological conditions and the bias loads the mechanical analysis model of an underwater shallow tunnel is established by dividing the mechanical analysis model into two parts the elastic analytical solution is obtained for an underwater shallow tunnel the obtained elastic solution is developed into the fractional viscoelastic analytical solution on the basis of the correspondence principle the time effect of the ground displacement and the ground stress are investigated for different sbctps 2 unified stress function of the tunnel perimeter the complex stress state is formed at the tunnel perimeter owing to the interaction of water soil supporting structure the influence of the bias load at the ground surface or the underground and the irregular geological contours for the plane strain condition there are three stress components on the any point p of the tunnel perimeter as shown in fig 1 i e σ x σ y and σ x y σ x y σ y x point o and r 0 are respectively the center point and radius of the tunnel the angle between the line o p and the positive direction of the x axis is θ the tunnel profile is a 2π periodic

the coefficients of first order fourier series when eq 3 is reduced to 4 t x t y p cos θ p sin θ eq 4 is the uniform radial stress namely that the radial stress at any point of tunnel perimeter is equal to p and the stress direction points to the circle center t x and t y are symmetrical with respect to the horizontal and vertical centerlines eq 4 is used as the sbcts in some works verruijt

and water weight t x and t y are symmetrical with respect to vertical centerline and nonsymmetrical with respect to horizontal centerline due to the terms a x 1 and a y 1 eq 5 is used as the sbctp to obtain the elastic solution in the lu et al work 2019b the influences of b x 1 b y 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 and b x y 1 on the t x and t y are not discussed in the previous analytical works the influences of b x 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 and b x y 1 on the t x are shown in fig 2 the influences of b y 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 and b x y 1 on the t y are shown in fig 3 the tensile stress is positive and the compressive stress is negative in this work for t x the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the y axis can be reflected by b x 1 a x y 0 and a x y 1 and the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the x axis are described by a x y 0 and b x y 1 for t y b y 1 a x y 0 a x y 1 reflect the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the y axis a x y 0 and b x y 1 reflect the nonsymmetrical stress boundary with respect to the x axis the stress state of tunnel perimeter is described more accurately when the value of the order n of the fourier series is larger however corresponding to a larger value of n the derivation of the analytical solution of the stress and displacement field also becomes more complex eq 3 corresponding to that unified stress function order n equals 1 can capture complex stress states of the tunnel perimeter including the nonsymmetrical stress condition with respect to the horizontal center line owing to the buoyancy effect verruijt and strack 2008 and the diving tendency of the shield fu et al 2015 and nonsymmetrical stress condition with respect to the vertical center line owing to the coupling effects of the water soil supporting structure the influence of irregular geological conditions slightly over excavation or insufficient grouting and bias load 3 fractional viscoelastic analytical solution of an underwater shallow tunnel when eq 3 is used as the sbctp combining the complex variable method the elastic analytical solutions of the total stress and displacement for the underwater shallow tunnel are obtained based on the correspondence principle and fractional vcm the obtained elastic solution is developed into fractional viscoelastic analytical solution of an underwater shallow tunnel 3 1 problem description the mechanical model of

used in mechanical analyses in the past several years the space fractional operators are used to model media with porosity and layered structure carpinteri et al 2011 patnaik and semperlotti 2020 in this work the time fractional operators are focused on to describe the rheological properties of the ground the generalized kelvin fractional vcm is considered in the viscoelastic analytical solution combining the correspondence principle the viscoelastic analytical solution of a shallow tunnel is presented on the basis of the obtained elastic analytical solution in this section the volumetric modulus is considered as the infinity and the value of poisson s ratio remains constant with time and is equal to 0 5 which corresponds to the undrained conditions a similar consideration also appears in these works wang et al 2018 lu et al 2020b the laplace transforms and inverse transforms for shear modulus are expressed as follows the fractional viscous element used in this work is expressed as 37 σ η k d μ ε d t μ where μ is fractional order and the constant order fractional operator is used in this paper which is a special case of variable order fractional operator atangana and botha 2013 patnaik et al 2020 di paola et al 2020 η k is the viscous coefficient σ ε and t are respectively stress strain and time the range of fractional order μ is 0 μ 1 in this work when μ is equal to 1 the fractional viscous element is reduced to classical newton integer order viscous element when μ is equal to 0 the fractional viscous element is reduced to spring element when 0 μ 1 the value of μ reflects rheological behavior of different materials the generalized kelvin fractional model is shown in fig 9 where e m e k are the material parameters of the generalized kelvin fractional model for the element vcm when the elements are in parallel the total stress is equal to the sum of the stresses per element and the strain of each element is equal when the elements are in series the total strain is equal to the sum of the strains per element and the stress of each element is equal therefore for the generalized kelvin fractional model the following expression can be determined 38 ε m e

work the laplace computation is done for eq 39 to obtain the relaxation modulus 40 e s t e m 1 e m e k e m n 0 1 n e k e m η k n 1 t n 1 μ γ n 1 μ 1 when μ equals 1 eq 40 is simplified to 41 e s t e m e k e m e k e m 2 e m e k e e m e k η k t e s t in eq 40 and eq 41 are respectively the power function and the exponential function compared with exponential function the power function could well describe the rheological properties of materials alotta et al 2017 therefore the viscoelastic analytical solution considering the fractional vcm can reasonably reflect the time effect of the ground movement the three dimensional constitutive relation of the rheological models is determined by generalizing the constitutive relation of the uniaxial stress state as expressed in eq 42 42 1 η k g m g

the increase of t when t is small the values of j t are almost the same for different values of μ as the time increases the value of j t is larger corresponding to a larger value of μ as shown in fig 10 for the problem of the constant sbctp the stress expressions are the same for the elastic and viscoelastic cases wang et al 2014 2018 and the time effect of ground displacement is analytically expressed in eq 43 4 parameter analysis the geometrical parameters of the tunnel are considered as r 0 3 m h 10 m mechanical parameters of surrounding rock are considered as g m 20 mpa g k 10 mpa η k 100 mpa day μ and ν is equal to 0 5 to reflect the consolidated undrained condition the weight of water γ w is considered as 10 kn m3 in this section the rigid body displacement term a 0 is determined when u x and u y are equal to 0 at the position 0 10h the influences of the stress release b x 1 b y 1 and a x y 0 on the ground displacement and stress are discussed in particular the stress unit is kpa 4 1 influences of stress release when the sbctp is considered as eq 44 the time effect of displacement and the influences of h w and γ on the ground stress are analyzed when the value of s r is equal to 0 σ x σ y and σ x y in eq 44 are equal to initial weight stress as expressed in eq 7 9 it corresponds to that the stress of the tunnel perimeter is not released and the ground displacement is equal to 0 when the value of s r is equal to 1 σ x σ y and σ x y in eq 44 are equal to 0 which indicates that the tunnel is not supported and the stress is completely released here the value of s r is considered as 0 2 to analyze the influence of sbctp on the ground displacement and stress 44 σ x γ w h w k 0 γ γ w y 1 s r σ y γ w h w γ γ w y 1 s r σ x y 0 when h w 10 m γ 10 kn m3 and μ equals 0 75 the time effect of the displacement of two points on the surface i e o 0 0 and a 0 5h 0 are discussed as shown in fig 11 the settlement value gradually increases and tends to be stable with time for two positions the settlement value of point o is always larger than that of point a for any time for point o the settlement of day 0 is about 0 74 mm and the settlement increases to 2 11 mm when t is equal to 150 for point a the settlements at day 0 and day 150 are 0 39 mm and 1 11 mm respectively the influences of the fractional order on the settlement of the point o with time are provided in fig 12 the settlement of point o tends to different stable values for different fractional orders in particular when t equals 0 day the shear modulus corresponding to different fractional orders are the same as expressed in eq 43 therefore the settlement of point o is also the same as shown in fig 12 the larger μ is the larger the displacement is the displacement corresponding to μ 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 are 1 67 mm 2 11 mm and 2 23 mm at day 150 respectively the horizontal displacement of the surface for different times are shown in fig 13 when μ is equal to 0 75 for different times the value of u x always equals 0 at x 0 m as shown in fig 13 which is determined by the symmetrical sbctp with respect to the vertical center line when x is more than 0 m the value of u x is always less than 0 meaning that the ground moves to the left side when x is less than 0 m the ground at the surface moves to the right side for the same position the value of u x rapidly increases and tends to a constant value with time as shown in fig 13 the curves of u x are close for day 100 and day 150 the influence of the fractional order on the horizontal displacement for day 10 is shown in fig 14 the absolute value of horizontal displacement becomes larger when the fractional order increases for the same position the vertical and horizontal stress distributions above the tunnel crown are analyzed due to the influences of the depth of the water h w as shown in fig 15 σ y 0 is the initial vertical self weight stress at different depths as shown in fig 15 a σ y is equal to the vertical self weight stress at the surface for different h w σ y gradually approaches σ y 0 from the tunnel crown to the surface which indicates that the degree of ground disturbance caused by tunneling decreases when it is far from the tunnel perimeter the horizontal stress distributions above the tunnel crown is shown in fig 15 b σ x gradually increases for different h w as the depth increases for the same depth the value of σ x is lager corresponding to a larger value of h w the influences of the uniform effective volumetric weight γ on the σ y from the tunnel crown to the surface are shown in fig 16 a the value of σ y is the same for different γ at the surface which is determined by γ w h w σ y first increases and then decreases with the increase of depth at the tunnel crown the larger value of σ y corresponds to a larger value of γ the influence of γ on the σ x is shown in fig 16 b the values of σ x at the ground surface are close for different values of γ the absolute value of σ x increases with the increase of the depth the increase rates of σ x along the depth becomes larger when the value of γ is larger 4 2 influences of b x 1 when the sbctp is considered as eq 45 the ground vertical and horizontal stresses are discussed due to the influence of b x 1 h w γ μ and s r are considered as follows h w 10 m γ 10 kn m3 μ 0 75 and s r 0 2 the vertical and horizontal stresses along the depth at x 0 5h are shown in fig 17 a b 45 σ x γ w h w k 0 γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r b x 1 cos θ σ y γ w h w γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r σ x y 0 when the value of b x 1 is equal to 50 the vertical stress along the depth closes to the σ y 0 at x 0 5h which is determined by the sbctp in eq 45 for the same depth the larger value of σ y corresponds to a smaller value of b x 1 as shown in fig 17 a when the depth is small the larger the value of b x 1 is the larger the value of σ x is with the increase of depth the value of σ x becomes larger when the value of b x 1 is smaller as shown in fig 17 b 4 3 influences of b y 1 when the sbctp is considered as eq 46 the influence of b y 1 on the ground vertical and horizontal stresses is analyzed 46 σ x γ w h w k 0 γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r σ y γ w h w γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r b

5h 0 and 0 5h respectively as shown in fig 18 a the value of σ y along the depth at x 0 5h closes the σ y 0 line which indicates that the degree of ground disturbance is small for x 0 5h and x 0 5h the value of σ y increases with the increase of depth for x 0 σ y first increases and then decreases with the increase of depth as shown in fig 18 a the value of σ x increases as the depth increases for x 0 5h 0 and 0 5h the value of σ x is always the largest at any depth for x 0 as shown in fig 18 b 4 4 influences of a x y 0 when the sbctp is considered as eq 47 the influence of a x y 0 on the vertical and horizontal stress nephograms are analyzed 47 σ x γ w h w k 0 γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r σ y γ w h w γ γ w h r 0 sin θ 1 s r σ x y a x y 0 30 sin θ 30 cos θ as shown in fig 19 a the horizontal stress is nonsymmetrical with respect to the tunnel vertical center line due to that a x y 1 and b x y 1 are not equal to 0 with the increase of a x y 0 the asymmetry of stress distribution is increasing in fig 19 b and c when a x y 0 is equal to 100 as shown in fig 19 c the tensile stress area is concentrated in the upper left side of the tunnel which is determined by the sbctp in fig 20 with the increase of depth the vertical stress gradually approaches to the initial vertical stress field which indicates that the ground is little disturbed when the ground is far from the tunnel similarly the asymmetry of vertical stress distribution with respect to the vertical center line of tunnel is increasing as the value of a x y 0 increases in fig 20 a b and 20 c 5 conclusion the first order unified stress function is presented to reflect the complex stress state of the tunnel perimeter for an underwater shallow tunnel the nonsymmetrical stress boundary conditions with respect to the vertical center line are described by b x 1 b y 1 a x y 0 and a x y 1 a x 1 a y 1 a x y 0 and b x y 1 cause the nonsymmetrical stress boundary conditions with the horizontal center line the elastic solution of the stress and displacement is determined by combining the first order unified stress function with the complex variable method a fem model of an underwater tunnel is established and the comparison between the fem and the proposed elastic analytical solution with respect to the vertical stresses above the tunnel crown is provided the rationality of the proposed method is confirmed the viscous element expressed by the fractional differential is considered in the vcm and the fractional order reflects the rheological behavior of different materials considering the correspondence principle the laplace transform and inverse transform are done to develop the obtained elastic solution into the fractional viscoelastic solution after all concerned geometrical and geological parameters are determined these parameters are substituted into the proposed method of this work and finally the stress and displacement of ground are analytical presented the surface settlement rapidly increases and gradually tends to be stable with time the settlement of surface center becomes larger as the fractional order increases the depth of the water and the uniform effective volumetric weight have great influences on the ground horizontal and vertical stresses the ground vertical and horizontal stresses are analyzed due to the influences of the stress release b x 1 b y 1 and a x y 0 when the ground is far from the tunnel perimeter the ground stress is little disturbed and the vertical stress is close to the self weight vertical stress the proposed method can provide guidance for predicting ground displacement and stress field of an underwater shallow tunnel credit authorship contribution statement fanchao kong conceptualization methodology validation

21273,seaweeds spores need to pass through the boundary layer on the surface of artificial algal reef before they can contact with the attaching substrate and start the process of attachment germination and growth however the performance of the boundary layer is affected by the roughness of reef surface but the mechanism is not clear in this article the cable tie was selected as the attaching substrate of seaweed spores to facilitate the analysis of the relationship between the reef surface structure and its boundary layer the comparison results of flume experiment and numerical simulation in different magnification dimensions verified that the numerical simulation method can be directly applied to analyze the boundary layer on the reef surface the numerical results showed that the roughness of reef surface had a significant effect on velocity profiles boundary layer thickness turbulence intensity and bottom shear stress the flow in the boundary layer on the reef surface is a highly turbulent case and the flow in the grooves belongs to a medium turbulent case this may be one of the reasons that affect whether algal spores can finally attach to the reef surface after passing through the boundary layer this work supplies a scientific evidence for research of the boundary layer on the reef surface keywords artificial reef surface boundary layer roughness turbulence intensity bottom shear stress 1 introduction the seaweed beds are the spawning and feeding grounds for many marine organisms especially for fishery resources in general algal spores in nature need a hard substrate to attach and grow up however the seaweed beds in coastal areas of many countries have been severely degraded due to the environmental pollution caused by the overexploitation of coastal marine biological resources and development of economy falcão et al 2007 macreadie et al 2011 lima et al 2019 hu et al 2019 kim et al 2019 which contributed to the shortage of substrate essential for the spores to attach on the deposition of artificial reef just solves this problem after the artificial reef is deposited the seaweed spores will gradually attach to the reef surface and grow up on it therefore the use of artificial reefs has become the main way to repair and restore coastal seaweed beds for many fishery developed countries in the world glenn et al 2020 babcock et al 2020 the process of algal spores contacting adhering germinating and growing on the surface of artificial reefs is affected by many factors for example different reef structures will produce different flow field effects liu et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 2020 li et al 2017 kim et al 2019 which will affect the contact probability of the spores with the surface of artificial reefs and there will be a boundary layer formed on the artificial reef surface according to the theory of fluid mechanics and the flow in this layer will determine whether the algal spores can remain on the reef surface or not after contacting the reef surface the attachment effect of algal spore is closely related to the material or shape of reef and the reef with rough surface is generally more conducive to the growth of seaweed shi et al 2014 2016 but the reason for this effect was unknown if only from the perspective of hydrodynamic analysis the inflow velocity and the roughness of reef surface are the main factors that affect these processes therefore the parameters of the boundary layer on reef surface such as velocity profile turbulence intensity and bottom shear stress should have a very important influence on the movement and attachment of algal spores the dimension of conventional artificial reefs is generally larger than 1 m and that of some special reef structures is even more than 10 m the hydrodynamic performance of artificial reef can be measured in the flume tank by the method of model experiments and the dimension of the research object is generally from 10 to 20 cm based on the similarity criterion the initial researches mainly adopted the acoustic doppler velocimetry adv to measure the velocity qualitatively jiang et al 2010 then the particle image velocimetry piv technology was used to measure the flow field structure of the reef model quantitatively which can verified with the numerical simulation method jiang et al 2013 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 on the one hand the experimental results can verify the feasibility of the numerical simulation method on the other hand it can deduce the hydrodynamic performance of the actual artificial reef finally based on these theoretical bases the numerical simulation method was gradually used to directly analyze the hydrodynamics of the actual artificial reef such as the structure optimization of artificial reef jiang et al 2016 2019 2020 wang et al 2018 and the influence of the layout mode of artificial reef on the flow field structure kim et al 2014 2019 in these numerical simulation researches the fluid was assumed to be incompressible viscous and newtonian regardless of the heat exchange and temperature variation the k ε turbulence model was mainly used to solve reynolds averaged navier stokes equations which considers the effects of convection and turbulent energy diffusion the reynolds number is usually used to distinguish the flow around the artificial reef as laminar or turbulent liu et al 2007 ozdemir et al 2010 chang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 the surface of artificial reef is a tiny and irregular structure and its dimension is generally millimeter different from the whole reef block the reynolds number of boundary layer flow on reef surface is relatively lower than that of the whole reef at a normal speed but higher than those conventional flows with low reynolds number how to define the reynolds number of boundary layer flow on the reef surface has not been determined yet and the numerical simulation of such small dimension structure of reef surface is rarely involved at present the results of interaction between flow field and reef structure are the focus of numerical analysis which were used to explain the principle of fish aggregation around the reef and the environmental effect caused by artificial reef in these studies the reef surface is generally assumed to be smooth but in fact in addition to the structure of reef block the structure of reef surface will also cause the difference of flow field especially the boundary layer it is called the roughness of reef surface does it affect the attaching probability of seaweed spores there are few relevant researches at present the adv can measure the boundary layer on the object surface but it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of the measurement of the internal boundary layer on the micro dimensional structure ruju et al 2016 wu et al 2019 and it is also difficult to guarantee the accuracy of piv results of flow field in dimension like the roughness of artificial reef surface due to the viscosity of fluid in the flume tank and the principle of piv technology such as the focus distance of ccd camera yuan and madsen 2014 2015 yuan and dash 2017 similarly although the numerical simulation method is widely used in the hydrodynamic research of artificial reef model about 10 25 cm and actual object larger than 2 m the roughness dimension of reef surface is millimeter level or even lower zhu et al 2014 it is unknown whether the same applies to structure of reef surface with millimeter dimension according to the reynolds similarity criterion it can be considered that the flows around the model and actual reefs are similar under the action of viscous force when their reynolds numbers are equal this is one of the basic principles of model experiment in flume the actual reef is too large to measure its hydrodynamic performance in the flume directly the common method is usually to reduce the dimension of the artificial reef 10 times or 20 times to make a model for the hydrodynamic experiments and the experimental results are adopted to verify the feasibility of the numerical simulation method or to deduce the hydrodynamic performance of an actual reef with similarity criterion and theoretical calculation similarly we assume that the structure of reef surface is magnified by 10 times or 20 times to make the models that is from the millimeter dimension to the centimeter dimension and the model experimental results at this magnified dimension are used to verify the numerical simulation results at the same dimension then the feasibility of numerical simulation method in the study of hydrodynamic performance of reef surface structure can be deduced by comparing the numerical results with the experimental results under the conditions of different dimensions at present there are still few related reports in this study the method of enlarging the model and reducing the flow velocity was used to ensure that the reynolds numbers of flows on the reef surfaces and the models are the same the reynolds number of flows on the model of reef surface was close to that of the reef models previously studied so the k ε turbulence model and other numerical methods were still used to simulate the performance of boundary layer on the reef surface in this article based on the reynolds similarity criterion the feasibility of the application of numerical simulation method in the study of boundary layer on reef surface was gradually verified through the method of enlarging the dimension of model 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental model the spore diameter of sea algae is very small about 50 3 μm such as grateloupia livida polysiphonia urceolata and other common species in the coastal area of shandong province china which means that these spores cannot be observed directly with the naked eye generally the stereoscope can be used to count seaweed spores on light colored carrier with good light transmittance in the laboratory according to its imaging principle but the spores on artificial reef surface are hard to count because artificial reef is usually made of stone or concrete which surface is dark and opaque therefore it is necessary to choose a kind of attaching substrate that is transparent and easy for the algae to attach in order to study the effect of surface roughness of artificial reef on the attachment of seaweed spore shi et al 2014 2016 chose the white cable tie as the attaching substrate defined its roughness by the groove width on the cable tie and studied the influence of the surface roughness on the density of attached spores the cable tie with regular grooves on its surface is made of translucent plastic which is used to bind somethings the surface structure dimension of cable tie is generally millimeter especially in the experiment of collecting seaweed spores with the white cable tie as attaching substrate the number of spores on its surface can be easily count by the stereoscope although the research of cable tie can not be fully used to discuss the surface roughness of artificial reef in the actual marine environment it is a very suitable attaching substrate with a transparent and regular surface roughness it has been used to carry out the algae attaching experiment in the actual marine environment which is also a rare experiment that can reflect the difference in surface roughness therefore the boundary layer of cable tie surface was studied in this article so as to carry out the preliminary study on the boundary layer of artificial reef surface structure the width of cable tie can represent the different grades of in groove sizes in this study we selected four types of cable tie and used the groove number gro on their surface per unit area to represent their surface roughness the roughness of these four types of cable ties are 75 43 18 and 11 gro cm 2 respectively which are indicated respectively as no 1 to 4 in this article the average depth of the groove is 0 4 0 03 mm according to the condition of flume tank the surface structure of the cable tie is magnified by 10 times and 20 times respectively and engraved on the surface of a slabstone with the thickness of 2 cm the width of 14 5 cm and the length of 28 cm which can avoid the end effect on flow measurement at the same time the stone surface was polished to avoid the effect on experimental results 2 2 experimental flume and design 2 2 1 experimental flume the experiments in this article were completed in tokyo university of marine science and technology the flume tank is 4 m in length 15 cm in width and 28 cm in depth the inflow of flume tank was generated by a water pump power 100 w lift 4 3 m the water was drawn from the reservoir injected at one end of the tank and then flowed to the other side a fairing screen composed of sponge and honeycomb shaped metal grid was installed for wave elimination and flow stability the distance between the screen and the experimental section is 1 5 m which is far enough for the uniformity of the inflow fig 1 moreover the calibration experiment of piv was carried out before the model experiments and the result of piv measurement showed that the flow field in the experimental section was uniform the two inflow velocities of 0 03 and 0 06 m s were realized when the pump was working at half load and full load when the inflow velocity was 0 03 m s the water depth in the flume tank was 15 3 cm and when the inflow velocity was 0 06 m s the water depth was 17 0 cm this article focuses on the hydrodynamic performance of boundary layer on reef surface so the water depth difference of about 2 cm can be negligible moreover a 4 cm high u shaped bracket made of 0 5 mm thick stainless steel plate was placed between the slatestone model and the bottom of the flume tank to support the reef model in this way it could not only remove side effects caused by flume bottom but also imitate the actual state of cable tie in water it should be noted that there are flows at other incident angles in the actual marine environment however an uni directional inflow was selected in this study in order to facilitate the comparison between the experimental and numerical results liu et al 2013 kim et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 which is conducive to the preliminary study on the boundary layer of artificial reef 2 2 2 experimental design the theoretical basis of experimental design in this article is that the reynolds number of the model experiment is the same as that of the actual reef surface in order to verify whether the method of enlarging the model dimension affects the feasibility of the numerical simulation method two magnifications of 10 and 20 times were designed in this article so when the four structures of reef surface were magnified by 10 times to make models the piv experiments of the performance of boundary layer were carried out at an inflow speed of 0 06 m s and when the surface structures were magnified by 20 times the piv experiments were carried out at the speed of 0 03 m s in this way the actual velocity corresponding to the above two model experiments is 0 6 m s which is basically within the range of common velocity along the coast of shandong province jiang et al 2016 many researches have confirmed that the hydrodynamic performance of artificial reef will not change greatly within a certain range of reynolds numbers jiang et al 2016 kim et al 2019 therefore in order to compare the numerical and experimental results of different dimensions and analyze the boundary layer performances of surface structure with actual dimension a single inflow velocity is adopted in this article the details of experimental cases are shown in table 1 it was found that the dimension of no 4 surface structure and its setting parameters of piv measurement were greatly different from the other three surface models after magnifying 20 times in the preliminary experiment therefore the piv measurement of no 4 surface structure magnifying 20 times was not carried out in this article 2 3 piv system a 2 dimensional piv system was used to obtain velocity measurement the flow was seeded with glass hollow sphere seeding particles with diameter of 10 μm which is supplied by the lavison corporation a laser system with a wavelength of 532 nm and an energy output of 1 w was installed on the top center of flume which produces a light sheet thickness of 1 mm downward to the model surface and the laser sheet illuminated the longitudinal central section of model the velocities near the grooves of model surface were measured by a ccd camera detect has 500 with 2000 fps 1 4000 s shutter speed 1024 992 pixels field of view fov and the pc image acquisition software was used to acquire the images the camera was set on the side 82 mm away from the side of flume tank and the center of camera is 85 mm from the bottom of flume tank in this way the flow field on the model surface could be observed to the greatest extent and the influence of end effect could be reduced this article focused on the boundary layer performance of reef surface and the bottom shear stress on local structure of reef surface is considered to be an important feature of boundary layer so in order to increase the accuracy of piv measurement the background of the experimental section was covered with black cloth to reduce the brightness of background and the surface of model was painted black to facilitate the ccd camera photo collection and reduce the negative impact of the environment on the measurement of boundary layer on the model surface liu et al 2007 as shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b shows a sample of raw piv image which can clearly show the distribution of seeding particles on the surface structure the insight 4g software was used to analyze and process the captured pictures which is a professional piv data processing software of tsi company it is an image acquisition analysis and display software platform which has parallel processing functions including distributed 2d piv image acquisition analysis and data processing jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 combined with the analysis results of all the piv images bad vectors only account for about 0 5 of all the vectors 3 numerical simulation in this article the methods of numerical simulation used in all cases were all same and the results of numerical simulation were compared with the results of model experiments to verify the feasibility of numerical method in analyzing the boundary layer performance of reef surface 3 1 governing equations numerical simulation in this article was conducted by fluent 17 0 ansys inc 2016 to analyze boundary layer on the surface of reef model the flow was assumed to be newtonian i e the fluid was incompressible and viscous the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in cartesian coordinates were solved using the finite volume method the governing equations are shown as follows continuity equation 1 u i x i 0 momentum equation 2 u i t u j u i x j p x i x j μ u i x j u i u j where p is the static pressure u i is the averaged velocity component i 1 2 3 indexes are the three cartesian coordinates μ is the kinetic viscosity and u i u j is the unknown reynolds stress considering the dimension and structure of the model of reef surface and experimental velocity the rng k ε turbulence model was adapted to solve turbulence closure pope 2000 it can enable the effects of swirl or rotation to the studied by modifying the turbulent viscosity appropriately the turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are shown as follow 3 k t u i k x i x i σ k μ e f f k x i μ

012 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the research objects of this article were the surface structures of four roughnesses gambit software was used to establish models and construct a computational domain with 54 cm 20 cm 16 cm for the reef surface structure magnified by 10 times and the model and calculation domain are magnified twice by fluent software for that of the models magnified by 20 times the finite volume method was used to solve the governing equations in the computational domain the front side was assigned as velocity inlet the back side was assigned as the fluid outlet where pressure was uniform and all variables had a gradient of zero the surface of model was assumed to be smooth wall the upper boundary was defined as the moving wall with the same velocity as that of the inflow the other sides were assigned as the symmetric boundaries fig 3 the standard wall function was used to determine the boundary values for k and ε the quadratic upwind interpolation of interpolation of convective kinematics quick approximation was selected for spatial discretization the equations were iterated to the steady state by means of simplec for the velocity pressure correction the solution was assumed to have converged when the sum of the normalized residuals for velocities pressure turbulent energy and dissipation rate fell below 10 5 the unstructured grids were used to mesh the computational domain for its irregular surface structure the minimum mesh size on the model surface is 0 04 cm to encrypt the local grids and the other regions were meshed sparsely to reduce the computational load the standard wall function in fluent ansys inc 2016 was used for the near wall turbulence treatment in this study which is based on the assumptions of launder and spalding 1974 the condition of this method in fluent is that the y value is greater than 11 63 which is the intersection of the logarithmic and linear near wall profiles the computational y value near the wall is not allowed to be less than this limit consequently all mesh nodes are outside the viscous sublayer and all fine grid inconsistencies are avoided the distributions of the grid in the near wall zone are shown in fig 4 the physical quantities at the nodes near the wall cannot be solved which is fixed according to the above theory as shown as

discussion for the convenience of comparison we chose a groove from each surface structure as the research object for display and comparison 4 1 magnification of 10 times the surface structures of four roughnesses were magnified by 10 times and piv measurement and numerical simulation were carried out with inflow velocity of 0 06 m s first as shown in fig 5 a weak boundary layer forms on the model surface and vortex generates in the groove due to the influence of the roughness of model surface the performances of boundary layer are different for each surface structure see fig 6 when the flow passes over the surface part of the fluid enters the groove to form a vortex and part of the fluid is affected by the groove structure slightly increasing the speed yuan and madsen 2014 these flow structures are also the primary research objectives of experiment and simulation fig 5 shows the comparison results of horizontal velocity along the vertical axis of vortex center in the surface groove between the piv and simulated results a conventional definition of boundary layer thickness is the elevation where the velocity reaches 99 of the inflow velocity when the horizontal velocity was close to 0 06 m s it can be considered as the boundary layer points where the horizontal velocity is close to zero occur at the center of vortex and on the model surface as shown in fig 5 the simulated results of vortex location and boundary layer thickness are in good agreement with the piv results the formation process and center of the vortex of four roughnesses in the groove are relatively stable and the errors mainly occur on the wall of surface structure this may be related to the reflection of the seeding particles at the wall and the boundary processing of piv measurement above the surface structure the positions where the flow velocities are close to the inflow velocities that is the boundary layer thickness approximately occurs at the same height from both the numerical simulation and the piv measurements in general the numerical results are in good agreement with the piv data after magnifying the surface structure of four roughnesses 10 times 4 2 magnification of 20 times when the three roughness models were magnified by 20 times the inflow velocity was reduced to 0 03 m s which can guarantee that the reynolds numbers of the two comparison experiments are equal the streamline patterns of the boundary layer on model surface and vortex in the groove are shown in fig 7 which are similar to the results in fig 5 fig 8 show the comparison results of horizontal velocity along the vertical axis of vortex center in the surface groove between the piv and simulated results when the horizontal velocity was close to 0 03 m s it was considered as the position of boundary layer the change of values of horizontal velocities from negative to positive indicates that a vortex forms in the groove and the position where the horizontal velocity is close to zero represents the height center of vortex the errors mainly also occur on the wall of surface structure the experimental model for piv measurement was made of opaque stone although the background of the experimental section was covered with black cloth and the model surface was painted black it can be seen from fig 2 that the surface of the model still reflects light this might disturb the trajectory capture of seeding particles near the wall by ccd camera and cause unavoidable deviations due to light refraction at the model surface this effect was even more pronounced when the model was magnified by 20 times over all the numerical results still agree well with the piv measurement after magnifying the surface structures of three roughnesses by 20 times 4 3 brief conclusions the comparison results show that when the surface structure is enlarged by 10 times and 20 times the results of the numerical simulation all agree well with the experimental results these show that the numerical simulation method can be used to analyze the boundary layer hydrodynamics of reef surface structure in these two dimensions so it can be deduced that the numerical simulation method can be directly applied to numerical analysis of the boundary layer on reef surface with millimeter dimension these validation results provide powerful support for the next numerical analysis of boundary layer performance of reef surface with different roughnesses the difference between the numerical and the experimental results is likely to be caused by a variety of factors such as the selection of discretization schemes and turbulence models just like the numerical simulation of the whole artificial reef there is currently no general turbulence model to solve all kinds of problems but a respective model can provide certain advantages over the others depending on the type and nature of flow field intended for simulation as well as the desired accuracy of the results liu et al 2013 the same is true for the study of reef surface roughness in this paper in addition whether the comparison method in this article has differences under other incident angles remains to be studied in the subsequent study by using the models that are easy to measure in other incident angles 5 characteristics of the boundary layer based on the verification between the numerical and piv results the method of numerical simulation was adopted to analyze the boundary layer on surface structures with different roughness according to the reynolds similarity criterion the inflow velocity was adopted as 0 6 m s which can ensure that the reynolds number of flow on the reef surface structure in the simulation is consistent with that in the two experiments of model magnification and the performances of boundary layer on four surface structures are discussed as follows 5 1 velocity profiles and vortex structure the velocity profiles of boundary layer were simulated to reveal the flow field structure of reef surface fig 9 the numerical results show that there is a boundary layer above the groove of reef surface and vortex generates in the groove although the dimension of vortexes is smaller than that of the experiments of magnifying 10 and 20 times the vertical vortex structures are highly consistent with the results of flume experiments the scale and velocity vector of vortex in the groove of no 1 model are smaller than that of other surface structures and the velocity vector at the bottom of groove is also less it indicates that the flow in this position is slower than other surface structures as the roughness of surface structure gradually decreases the size of vortex structure in the groove gradually becomes larger and its range of influence gradually extends to the whole groove this indicates that the roughness of reef surface structure affects the formation and distribution of vortex in the groove 5 2 boundary layer thickness fig 10 shows that the boundary layers form on the model surface of each roughness the boundary layer thickness and the average depth of groove are shown in table 2 considering that the groove depth of different roughness surfaces is different the ratio of boundary layer thickness to average depth of groove t b d g is used to represent the difference between each surface structure it can be seen from fig 11 that there is a significant logarithmic relationship between the roughness of reef surface and boundary layer the greater the roughness the thinner the boundary layer and the average depth of surface grooves does not have a significant effect on the boundary layer thickness note t b boundary layer thickness d g the average depth of groove r s roughness of reef surface 5 3 turbulence intensity turbulence intensity is defined as the ratio of standard deviation of fluctuating flow velocity to the mean flow speed and it represents the intensity of flow velocity fluctuation pipinato 2016 when the turbulence intensity is less than 1 the flow belongs to low turbulence intensity and when the turbulence intensity is more than 10 it is high turbulence intensity gu et al 1993 pope 2000 the activity of sea algal spores on the reef surface after passing through the boundary layer is mainly affected by the turbulence as shown in fig 12 the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer on each reef surface is within 14 which belongs to the high turbulence case when the flow enters the grooves the turbulence intensity gradually decreases to a medium turbulence case in addition the turbulence intensity at the groove bottom surface opposite to the inflow is the lowest gradually increases from the groove bottom along the surface against the inflow and the turbulence intensity at the top of groove is the largest as the flow approaches to the top edge of boundary layer the turbulence intensity gradually decreases tends to be steady and be same to the boundary layer finally the variation range of turbulence intensity of boundary layer on each surface structure is small the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer on no 2 reef surface reaches 14 and that of no 4 reaches 12 the turbulence intensity in the grooves of four surface structures is almost less than 10 which affect most of the area in the groove in particular the turbulence intensity at the bottom of no 1 reef surface is less than 2 and its influence range is larger than that of other surface structures these may also be related to the roughness of reef surface the researches of shi et al 2014 2016 showed that there was a positive correlation between the attachment density of immobile spores and the roughness of reef surface that is the roughness of reef surface significantly affected sporeling densities of the immotile propagules species the amount of immobilized spores attached increases with the increase of the roughness of the reef surface the analysis of turbulence density in this part also verifies those results 5 4 bottom shear stress the distributions of bottom shear stress on the grooves of surface structure are shown in fig 13 the results show that the bottom shear stresses on the groove surface with different roughness are different shear stresses near the top of grooves are all positive except the no 1 surface structure the bottom shear stresses of other surface structures are negative this result is basically consistent with that of the velocity profiles that is a weak vortex forms in the groove the influence range of the vortex in the groove of no 1 surface is smaller than other surface structures and its bottom shear stress is positive for the other three roughness surfaces the results of bottom shear stress show that the flows in the groove bottom are all affected by the vortexes which may have a certain impact on the algal spores staying at the groove bottom maybe that is the main reason why sea algal spores can have more opportunity to stay in the grooves of no 1 surface 6 conclusions in general the spores released from the seaweed need a solid attaching substrate to complete a series of processes such as attachment germination growth and so on therefore whether the spores can contact with the surface of attaching substrate is crucial link in the process of algal proliferation and kelp bed formation and the key is whether the algal spores can pass through the boundary layer on the reef surface and stay with the surface structure in order to facilitate the analysis of the relationship between the structure of reef surface and its boundary layer this article used the cable tie as the research object the conventional research method is to shrink the dimension of the actual object for model experiment while this research is to enlarge the actual object piv technology is applied to capture the boundary layer on the reef model surface and the vortices in the groove the position where the horizontal velocity above the surface structure is close to the incoming flow velocity is the thickness of the boundary layer and the position close to zero is the height center of vortex in the surface groove through the comparison of the results of flume experiment and numerical simulation in different magnification dimensions the numerical simulation method was verified and can be applied to study the boundary layer performance of artificial reef surface based on the analysis of this numerical simulation method it is found that the roughness of reef surface has a significant effect on velocity profiles boundary layer thickness turbulence intensity and bottom shear stress compared with other models the flow at the groove bottom of no 1 model is slower the velocity vector of vortex is less the boundary layer is thinner and the scale and velocity vector of vortex are smaller there is a negative correlation between the surface roughness and the boundary layer thickness these indicate that the roughness of reef surface affects the vortex size and the distribution of velocity vector in the groove due to the roughness of reef surface the flow in the boundary layer is a highly turbulent case and the flow in the grooves belongs to a medium turbulent case this may be one of the reasons that affect whether sea algal spores can finally attach to the reef surface after passing through the boundary layer in addition only the bottom shear stress on the groove of no 1 model is positive affected by the surface roughness which may have a certain impact on the algal spores staying at the groove bottom therefore the reef surface roughness may be the main reason for the largest number of algal spores in the grooves of no 1 model shi et al 2014 2016 this study is only a preliminary exploration of the hydrodynamics of reef surface structure and has many limitations in experimental design and methods therefore more experiments are needed to be expanded in subsequent research such as the study of boundary layer performance of other flow velocities and directions two phase flow of sea algal spores in the boundary layer boundary layer performance of other surface structures etc in addition the deposition process of other types of particles in the ocean will also be affected by the boundary layer on reef surface the interaction and movement mechanism between these particles and seaweed

21273,seaweeds spores need to pass through the boundary layer on the surface of artificial algal reef before they can contact with the attaching substrate and start the process of attachment germination and growth however the performance of the boundary layer is affected by the roughness of reef surface but the mechanism is not clear in this article the cable tie was selected as the attaching substrate of seaweed spores to facilitate the analysis of the relationship between the reef surface structure and its boundary layer the comparison results of flume experiment and numerical simulation in different magnification dimensions verified that the numerical simulation method can be directly applied to analyze the boundary layer on the reef surface the numerical results showed that the roughness of reef surface had a significant effect on velocity profiles boundary layer thickness turbulence intensity and bottom shear stress the flow in the boundary layer on the reef surface is a highly turbulent case and the flow in the grooves belongs to a medium turbulent case this may be one of the reasons that affect whether algal spores can finally attach to the reef surface after passing through the boundary layer this work supplies a scientific evidence for research of the boundary layer on the reef surface keywords artificial reef surface boundary layer roughness turbulence intensity bottom shear stress 1 introduction the seaweed beds are the spawning and feeding grounds for many marine organisms especially for fishery resources in general algal spores in nature need a hard substrate to attach and grow up however the seaweed beds in coastal areas of many countries have been severely degraded due to the environmental pollution caused by the overexploitation of coastal marine biological resources and development of economy falcão et al 2007 macreadie et al 2011 lima et al 2019 hu et al 2019 kim et al 2019 which contributed to the shortage of substrate essential for the spores to attach on the deposition of artificial reef just solves this problem after the artificial reef is deposited the seaweed spores will gradually attach to the reef surface and grow up on it therefore the use of artificial reefs has become the main way to repair and restore coastal seaweed beds for many fishery developed countries in the world glenn et al 2020 babcock et al 2020 the process of algal spores contacting adhering germinating and growing on the surface of artificial reefs is affected by many factors for example different reef structures will produce different flow field effects liu et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 2020 li et al 2017 kim et al 2019 which will affect the contact probability of the spores with the surface of artificial reefs and there will be a boundary layer formed on the artificial reef surface according to the theory of fluid mechanics and the flow in this layer will determine whether the algal spores can remain on the reef surface or not after contacting the reef surface the attachment effect of algal spore is closely related to the material or shape of reef and the reef with rough surface is generally more conducive to the growth of seaweed shi et al 2014 2016 but the reason for this effect was unknown if only from the perspective of hydrodynamic analysis the inflow velocity and the roughness of reef surface are the main factors that affect these processes therefore the parameters of the boundary layer on reef surface such as velocity profile turbulence intensity and bottom shear stress should have a very important influence on the movement and attachment of algal spores the dimension of conventional artificial reefs is generally larger than 1 m and that of some special reef structures is even more than 10 m the hydrodynamic performance of artificial reef can be measured in the flume tank by the method of model experiments and the dimension of the research object is generally from 10 to 20 cm based on the similarity criterion the initial researches mainly adopted the acoustic doppler velocimetry adv to measure the velocity qualitatively jiang et al 2010 then the particle image velocimetry piv technology was used to measure the flow field structure of the reef model quantitatively which can verified with the numerical simulation method jiang et al 2013 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 on the one hand the experimental results can verify the feasibility of the numerical simulation method on the other hand it can deduce the hydrodynamic performance of the actual artificial reef finally based on these theoretical bases the numerical simulation method was gradually used to directly analyze the hydrodynamics of the actual artificial reef such as the structure optimization of artificial reef jiang et al 2016 2019 2020 wang et al 2018 and the influence of the layout mode of artificial reef on the flow field structure kim et al 2014 2019 in these numerical simulation researches the fluid was assumed to be incompressible viscous and newtonian regardless of the heat exchange and temperature variation the k ε turbulence model was mainly used to solve reynolds averaged navier stokes equations which considers the effects of convection and turbulent energy diffusion the reynolds number is usually used to distinguish the flow around the artificial reef as laminar or turbulent liu et al 2007 ozdemir et al 2010 chang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 the surface of artificial reef is a tiny and irregular structure and its dimension is generally millimeter different from the whole reef block the reynolds number of boundary layer flow on reef surface is relatively lower than that of the whole reef at a normal speed but higher than those conventional flows with low reynolds number how to define the reynolds number of boundary layer flow on the reef surface has not been determined yet and the numerical simulation of such small dimension structure of reef surface is rarely involved at present the results of interaction between flow field and reef structure are the focus of numerical analysis which were used to explain the principle of fish aggregation around the reef and the environmental effect caused by artificial reef in these studies the reef surface is generally assumed to be smooth but in fact in addition to the structure of reef block the structure of reef surface will also cause the difference of flow field especially the boundary layer it is called the roughness of reef surface does it affect the attaching probability of seaweed spores there are few relevant researches at present the adv can measure the boundary layer on the object surface but it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of the measurement of the internal boundary layer on the micro dimensional structure ruju et al 2016 wu et al 2019 and it is also difficult to guarantee the accuracy of piv results of flow field in dimension like the roughness of artificial reef surface due to the viscosity of fluid in the flume tank and the principle of piv technology such as the focus distance of ccd camera yuan and madsen 2014 2015 yuan and dash 2017 similarly although the numerical simulation method is widely used in the hydrodynamic research of artificial reef model about 10 25 cm and actual object larger than 2 m the roughness dimension of reef surface is millimeter level or even lower zhu et al 2014 it is unknown whether the same applies to structure of reef surface with millimeter dimension according to the reynolds similarity criterion it can be considered that the flows around the model and actual reefs are similar under the action of viscous force when their reynolds numbers are equal this is one of the basic principles of model experiment in flume the actual reef is too large to measure its hydrodynamic performance in the flume directly the common method is usually to reduce the dimension of the artificial reef 10 times or 20 times to make a model for the hydrodynamic experiments and the experimental results are adopted to verify the feasibility of the numerical simulation method or to deduce the hydrodynamic performance of an actual reef with similarity criterion and theoretical calculation similarly we assume that the structure of reef surface is magnified by 10 times or 20 times to make the models that is from the millimeter dimension to the centimeter dimension and the model experimental results at this magnified dimension are used to verify the numerical simulation results at the same dimension then the feasibility of numerical simulation method in the study of hydrodynamic performance of reef surface structure can be deduced by comparing the numerical results with the experimental results under the conditions of different dimensions at present there are still few related reports in this study the method of enlarging the model and reducing the flow velocity was used to ensure that the reynolds numbers of flows on the reef surfaces and the models are the same the reynolds number of flows on the model of reef surface was close to that of the reef models previously studied so the k ε turbulence model and other numerical methods were still used to simulate the performance of boundary layer on the reef surface in this article based on the reynolds similarity criterion the feasibility of the application of numerical simulation method in the study of boundary layer on reef surface was gradually verified through the method of enlarging the dimension of model 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental model the spore diameter of sea algae is very small about 50 3 μm such as grateloupia livida polysiphonia urceolata and other common species in the coastal area of shandong province china which means that these spores cannot be observed directly with the naked eye generally the stereoscope can be used to count seaweed spores on light colored carrier with good light transmittance in the laboratory according to its imaging principle but the spores on artificial reef surface are hard to count because artificial reef is usually made of stone or concrete which surface is dark and opaque therefore it is necessary to choose a kind of attaching substrate that is transparent and easy for the algae to attach in order to study the effect of surface roughness of artificial reef on the attachment of seaweed spore shi et al 2014 2016 chose the white cable tie as the attaching substrate defined its roughness by the groove width on the cable tie and studied the influence of the surface roughness on the density of attached spores the cable tie with regular grooves on its surface is made of translucent plastic which is used to bind somethings the surface structure dimension of cable tie is generally millimeter especially in the experiment of collecting seaweed spores with the white cable tie as attaching substrate the number of spores on its surface can be easily count by the stereoscope although the research of cable tie can not be fully used to discuss the surface roughness of artificial reef in the actual marine environment it is a very suitable attaching substrate with a transparent and regular surface roughness it has been used to carry out the algae attaching experiment in the actual marine environment which is also a rare experiment that can reflect the difference in surface roughness therefore the boundary layer of cable tie surface was studied in this article so as to carry out the preliminary study on the boundary layer of artificial reef surface structure the width of cable tie can represent the different grades of in groove sizes in this study we selected four types of cable tie and used the groove number gro on their surface per unit area to represent their surface roughness the roughness of these four types of cable ties are 75 43 18 and 11 gro cm 2 respectively which are indicated respectively as no 1 to 4 in this article the average depth of the groove is 0 4 0 03 mm according to the condition of flume tank the surface structure of the cable tie is magnified by 10 times and 20 times respectively and engraved on the surface of a slabstone with the thickness of 2 cm the width of 14 5 cm and the length of 28 cm which can avoid the end effect on flow measurement at the same time the stone surface was polished to avoid the effect on experimental results 2 2 experimental flume and design 2 2 1 experimental flume the experiments in this article were completed in tokyo university of marine science and technology the flume tank is 4 m in length 15 cm in width and 28 cm in depth the inflow of flume tank was generated by a water pump power 100 w lift 4 3 m the water was drawn from the reservoir injected at one end of the tank and then flowed to the other side a fairing screen composed of sponge and honeycomb shaped metal grid was installed for wave elimination and flow stability the distance between the screen and the experimental section is 1 5 m which is far enough for the uniformity of the inflow fig 1 moreover the calibration experiment of piv was carried out before the model experiments and the result of piv measurement showed that the flow field in the experimental section was uniform the two inflow velocities of 0 03 and 0 06 m s were realized when the pump was working at half load and full load when the inflow velocity was 0 03 m s the water depth in the flume tank was 15 3 cm and when the inflow velocity was 0 06 m s the water depth was 17 0 cm this article focuses on the hydrodynamic performance of boundary layer on reef surface so the water depth difference of about 2 cm can be negligible moreover a 4 cm high u shaped bracket made of 0 5 mm thick stainless steel plate was placed between the slatestone model and the bottom of the flume tank to support the reef model in this way it could not only remove side effects caused by flume bottom but also imitate the actual state of cable tie in water it should be noted that there are flows at other incident angles in the actual marine environment however an uni directional inflow was selected in this study in order to facilitate the comparison between the experimental and numerical results liu et al 2013 kim et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 which is conducive to the preliminary study on the boundary layer of artificial reef 2 2 2 experimental design the theoretical basis of experimental design in this article is that the reynolds number of the model experiment is the same as that of the actual reef surface in order to verify whether the method of enlarging the model dimension affects the feasibility of the numerical simulation method two magnifications of 10 and 20 times were designed in this article so when the four structures of reef surface were magnified by 10 times to make models the piv experiments of the performance of boundary layer were carried out at an inflow speed of 0 06 m s and when the surface structures were magnified by 20 times the piv experiments were carried out at the speed of 0 03 m s in this way the actual velocity corresponding to the above two model experiments is 0 6 m s which is basically within the range of common velocity along the coast of shandong province jiang et al 2016 many researches have confirmed that the hydrodynamic performance of artificial reef will not change greatly within a certain range of reynolds numbers jiang et al 2016 kim et al 2019 therefore in order to compare the numerical and experimental results of different dimensions and analyze the boundary layer performances of surface structure with actual dimension a single inflow velocity is adopted in this article the details of experimental cases are shown in table 1 it was found that the dimension of no 4 surface structure and its setting parameters of piv measurement were greatly different from the other three surface models after magnifying 20 times in the preliminary experiment therefore the piv measurement of no 4 surface structure magnifying 20 times was not carried out in this article 2 3 piv system a 2 dimensional piv system was used to obtain velocity measurement the flow was seeded with glass hollow sphere seeding particles with diameter of 10 μm which is supplied by the lavison corporation a laser system with a wavelength of 532 nm and an energy output of 1 w was installed on the top center of flume which produces a light sheet thickness of 1 mm downward to the model surface and the laser sheet illuminated the longitudinal central section of model the velocities near the grooves of model surface were measured by a ccd camera detect has 500 with 2000 fps 1 4000 s shutter speed 1024 992 pixels field of view fov and the pc image acquisition software was used to acquire the images the camera was set on the side 82 mm away from the side of flume tank and the center of camera is 85 mm from the bottom of flume tank in this way the flow field on the model surface could be observed to the greatest extent and the influence of end effect could be reduced this article focused on the boundary layer performance of reef surface and the bottom shear stress on local structure of reef surface is considered to be an important feature of boundary layer so in order to increase the accuracy of piv measurement the background of the experimental section was covered with black cloth to reduce the brightness of background and the surface of model was painted black to facilitate the ccd camera photo collection and reduce the negative impact of the environment on the measurement of boundary layer on the model surface liu et al 2007 as shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b shows a sample of raw piv image which can clearly show the distribution of seeding particles on the surface structure the insight 4g software was used to analyze and process the captured pictures which is a professional piv data processing software of tsi company it is an image acquisition analysis and display software platform which has parallel processing functions including distributed 2d piv image acquisition analysis and data processing jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 combined with the analysis results of all the piv images bad vectors only account for about 0 5 of all the vectors 3 numerical simulation in this article the methods of numerical simulation used in all cases were all same and the results of numerical simulation were compared with the results of model experiments to verify the feasibility of numerical method in analyzing the boundary layer performance of reef surface 3 1 governing equations numerical simulation in this article was conducted by fluent 17 0 ansys inc 2016 to analyze boundary layer on the surface of reef model the flow was assumed to be newtonian i e the fluid was incompressible and viscous the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in cartesian coordinates were solved using the finite volume method the governing equations are shown as follows continuity equation 1 u i x i 0 momentum equation 2 u i t u j u i x j p x i x j μ u i x j u i u j where p is the static pressure u i is the averaged velocity component i 1 2 3 indexes are the three cartesian coordinates μ is the kinetic viscosity and u i u j is the unknown reynolds stress considering the dimension and structure of the model of reef surface and experimental velocity the rng k ε turbulence model was adapted to solve turbulence closure pope 2000 it can enable the effects of swirl or rotation to the studied by modifying the turbulent viscosity appropriately the turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are shown as follow 3 k t u i k x i x i σ k μ e f f k x i μ

012 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the research objects of this article were the surface structures of four roughnesses gambit software was used to establish models and construct a computational domain with 54 cm 20 cm 16 cm for the reef surface structure magnified by 10 times and the model and calculation domain are magnified twice by fluent software for that of the models magnified by 20 times the finite volume method was used to solve the governing equations in the computational domain the front side was assigned as velocity inlet the back side was assigned as the fluid outlet where pressure was uniform and all variables had a gradient of zero the surface of model was assumed to be smooth wall the upper boundary was defined as the moving wall with the same velocity as that of the inflow the other sides were assigned as the symmetric boundaries fig 3 the standard wall function was used to determine the boundary values for k and ε the quadratic upwind interpolation of interpolation of convective kinematics quick approximation was selected for spatial discretization the equations were iterated to the steady state by means of simplec for the velocity pressure correction the solution was assumed to have converged when the sum of the normalized residuals for velocities pressure turbulent energy and dissipation rate fell below 10 5 the unstructured grids were used to mesh the computational domain for its irregular surface structure the minimum mesh size on the model surface is 0 04 cm to encrypt the local grids and the other regions were meshed sparsely to reduce the computational load the standard wall function in fluent ansys inc 2016 was used for the near wall turbulence treatment in this study which is based on the assumptions of launder and spalding 1974 the condition of this method in fluent is that the y value is greater than 11 63 which is the intersection of the logarithmic and linear near wall profiles the computational y value near the wall is not allowed to be less than this limit consequently all mesh nodes are outside the viscous sublayer and all fine grid inconsistencies are avoided the distributions of the grid in the near wall zone are shown in fig 4 the physical quantities at the nodes near the wall cannot be solved which is fixed according to the above theory as shown as

discussion for the convenience of comparison we chose a groove from each surface structure as the research object for display and comparison 4 1 magnification of 10 times the surface structures of four roughnesses were magnified by 10 times and piv measurement and numerical simulation were carried out with inflow velocity of 0 06 m s first as shown in fig 5 a weak boundary layer forms on the model surface and vortex generates in the groove due to the influence of the roughness of model surface the performances of boundary layer are different for each surface structure see fig 6 when the flow passes over the surface part of the fluid enters the groove to form a vortex and part of the fluid is affected by the groove structure slightly increasing the speed yuan and madsen 2014 these flow structures are also the primary research objectives of experiment and simulation fig 5 shows the comparison results of horizontal velocity along the vertical axis of vortex center in the surface groove between the piv and simulated results a conventional definition of boundary layer thickness is the elevation where the velocity reaches 99 of the inflow velocity when the horizontal velocity was close to 0 06 m s it can be considered as the boundary layer points where the horizontal velocity is close to zero occur at the center of vortex and on the model surface as shown in fig 5 the simulated results of vortex location and boundary layer thickness are in good agreement with the piv results the formation process and center of the vortex of four roughnesses in the groove are relatively stable and the errors mainly occur on the wall of surface structure this may be related to the reflection of the seeding particles at the wall and the boundary processing of piv measurement above the surface structure the positions where the flow velocities are close to the inflow velocities that is the boundary layer thickness approximately occurs at the same height from both the numerical simulation and the piv measurements in general the numerical results are in good agreement with the piv data after magnifying the surface structure of four roughnesses 10 times 4 2 magnification of 20 times when the three roughness models were magnified by 20 times the inflow velocity was reduced to 0 03 m s which can guarantee that the reynolds numbers of the two comparison experiments are equal the streamline patterns of the boundary layer on model surface and vortex in the groove are shown in fig 7 which are similar to the results in fig 5 fig 8 show the comparison results of horizontal velocity along the vertical axis of vortex center in the surface groove between the piv and simulated results when the horizontal velocity was close to 0 03 m s it was considered as the position of boundary layer the change of values of horizontal velocities from negative to positive indicates that a vortex forms in the groove and the position where the horizontal velocity is close to zero represents the height center of vortex the errors mainly also occur on the wall of surface structure the experimental model for piv measurement was made of opaque stone although the background of the experimental section was covered with black cloth and the model surface was painted black it can be seen from fig 2 that the surface of the model still reflects light this might disturb the trajectory capture of seeding particles near the wall by ccd camera and cause unavoidable deviations due to light refraction at the model surface this effect was even more pronounced when the model was magnified by 20 times over all the numerical results still agree well with the piv measurement after magnifying the surface structures of three roughnesses by 20 times 4 3 brief conclusions the comparison results show that when the surface structure is enlarged by 10 times and 20 times the results of the numerical simulation all agree well with the experimental results these show that the numerical simulation method can be used to analyze the boundary layer hydrodynamics of reef surface structure in these two dimensions so it can be deduced that the numerical simulation method can be directly applied to numerical analysis of the boundary layer on reef surface with millimeter dimension these validation results provide powerful support for the next numerical analysis of boundary layer performance of reef surface with different roughnesses the difference between the numerical and the experimental results is likely to be caused by a variety of factors such as the selection of discretization schemes and turbulence models just like the numerical simulation of the whole artificial reef there is currently no general turbulence model to solve all kinds of problems but a respective model can provide certain advantages over the others depending on the type and nature of flow field intended for simulation as well as the desired accuracy of the results liu et al 2013 the same is true for the study of reef surface roughness in this paper in addition whether the comparison method in this article has differences under other incident angles remains to be studied in the subsequent study by using the models that are easy to measure in other incident angles 5 characteristics of the boundary layer based on the verification between the numerical and piv results the method of numerical simulation was adopted to analyze the boundary layer on surface structures with different roughness according to the reynolds similarity criterion the inflow velocity was adopted as 0 6 m s which can ensure that the reynolds number of flow on the reef surface structure in the simulation is consistent with that in the two experiments of model magnification and the performances of boundary layer on four surface structures are discussed as follows 5 1 velocity profiles and vortex structure the velocity profiles of boundary layer were simulated to reveal the flow field structure of reef surface fig 9 the numerical results show that there is a boundary layer above the groove of reef surface and vortex generates in the groove although the dimension of vortexes is smaller than that of the experiments of magnifying 10 and 20 times the vertical vortex structures are highly consistent with the results of flume experiments the scale and velocity vector of vortex in the groove of no 1 model are smaller than that of other surface structures and the velocity vector at the bottom of groove is also less it indicates that the flow in this position is slower than other surface structures as the roughness of surface structure gradually decreases the size of vortex structure in the groove gradually becomes larger and its range of influence gradually extends to the whole groove this indicates that the roughness of reef surface structure affects the formation and distribution of vortex in the groove 5 2 boundary layer thickness fig 10 shows that the boundary layers form on the model surface of each roughness the boundary layer thickness and the average depth of groove are shown in table 2 considering that the groove depth of different roughness surfaces is different the ratio of boundary layer thickness to average depth of groove t b d g is used to represent the difference between each surface structure it can be seen from fig 11 that there is a significant logarithmic relationship between the roughness of reef surface and boundary layer the greater the roughness the thinner the boundary layer and the average depth of surface grooves does not have a significant effect on the boundary layer thickness note t b boundary layer thickness d g the average depth of groove r s roughness of reef surface 5 3 turbulence intensity turbulence intensity is defined as the ratio of standard deviation of fluctuating flow velocity to the mean flow speed and it represents the intensity of flow velocity fluctuation pipinato 2016 when the turbulence intensity is less than 1 the flow belongs to low turbulence intensity and when the turbulence intensity is more than 10 it is high turbulence intensity gu et al 1993 pope 2000 the activity of sea algal spores on the reef surface after passing through the boundary layer is mainly affected by the turbulence as shown in fig 12 the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer on each reef surface is within 14 which belongs to the high turbulence case when the flow enters the grooves the turbulence intensity gradually decreases to a medium turbulence case in addition the turbulence intensity at the groove bottom surface opposite to the inflow is the lowest gradually increases from the groove bottom along the surface against the inflow and the turbulence intensity at the top of groove is the largest as the flow approaches to the top edge of boundary layer the turbulence intensity gradually decreases tends to be steady and be same to the boundary layer finally the variation range of turbulence intensity of boundary layer on each surface structure is small the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer on no 2 reef surface reaches 14 and that of no 4 reaches 12 the turbulence intensity in the grooves of four surface structures is almost less than 10 which affect most of the area in the groove in particular the turbulence intensity at the bottom of no 1 reef surface is less than 2 and its influence range is larger than that of other surface structures these may also be related to the roughness of reef surface the researches of shi et al 2014 2016 showed that there was a positive correlation between the attachment density of immobile spores and the roughness of reef surface that is the roughness of reef surface significantly affected sporeling densities of the immotile propagules species the amount of immobilized spores attached increases with the increase of the roughness of the reef surface the analysis of turbulence density in this part also verifies those results 5 4 bottom shear stress the distributions of bottom shear stress on the grooves of surface structure are shown in fig 13 the results show that the bottom shear stresses on the groove surface with different roughness are different shear stresses near the top of grooves are all positive except the no 1 surface structure the bottom shear stresses of other surface structures are negative this result is basically consistent with that of the velocity profiles that is a weak vortex forms in the groove the influence range of the vortex in the groove of no 1 surface is smaller than other surface structures and its bottom shear stress is positive for the other three roughness surfaces the results of bottom shear stress show that the flows in the groove bottom are all affected by the vortexes which may have a certain impact on the algal spores staying at the groove bottom maybe that is the main reason why sea algal spores can have more opportunity to stay in the grooves of no 1 surface 6 conclusions in general the spores released from the seaweed need a solid attaching substrate to complete a series of processes such as attachment germination growth and so on therefore whether the spores can contact with the surface of attaching substrate is crucial link in the process of algal proliferation and kelp bed formation and the key is whether the algal spores can pass through the boundary layer on the reef surface and stay with the surface structure in order to facilitate the analysis of the relationship between the structure of reef surface and its boundary layer this article used the cable tie as the research object the conventional research method is to shrink the dimension of the actual object for model experiment while this research is to enlarge the actual object piv technology is applied to capture the boundary layer on the reef model surface and the vortices in the groove the position where the horizontal velocity above the surface structure is close to the incoming flow velocity is the thickness of the boundary layer and the position close to zero is the height center of vortex in the surface groove through the comparison of the results of flume experiment and numerical simulation in different magnification dimensions the numerical simulation method was verified and can be applied to study the boundary layer performance of artificial reef surface based on the analysis of this numerical simulation method it is found that the roughness of reef surface has a significant effect on velocity profiles boundary layer thickness turbulence intensity and bottom shear stress compared with other models the flow at the groove bottom of no 1 model is slower the velocity vector of vortex is less the boundary layer is thinner and the scale and velocity vector of vortex are smaller there is a negative correlation between the surface roughness and the boundary layer thickness these indicate that the roughness of reef surface affects the vortex size and the distribution of velocity vector in the groove due to the roughness of reef surface the flow in the boundary layer is a highly turbulent case and the flow in the grooves belongs to a medium turbulent case this may be one of the reasons that affect whether sea algal spores can finally attach to the reef surface after passing through the boundary layer in addition only the bottom shear stress on the groove of no 1 model is positive affected by the surface roughness which may have a certain impact on the algal spores staying at the groove bottom therefore the reef surface roughness may be the main reason for the largest number of algal spores in the grooves of no 1 model shi et al 2014 2016 this study is only a preliminary exploration of the hydrodynamics of reef surface structure and has many limitations in experimental design and methods therefore more experiments are needed to be expanded in subsequent research such as the study of boundary layer performance of other flow velocities and directions two phase flow of sea algal spores in the boundary layer boundary layer performance of other surface structures etc in addition the deposition process of other types of particles in the ocean will also be affected by the boundary layer on reef surface the interaction and movement mechanism between these particles and seaweed

energy demand tamil nadu faces frequent power shortages this is expected to further rise in the coming years due to industrial consumption and soaring temperatures increasing the load on the electrical grid the concept behind the electric grid is to ensure supply and demand to stabilize the grid and prevent power failures power consumed must be equal to the power produced this ever increasing energy demand is met by thermal stations operating at 80 plant load capacity along with hydropower stations wind stations and solar power as renewable energy wind energy is the fastest growing energy sector in tamil nadu contributing 23 of the total installed wind capacity of 32877 mw as on january 30 2018 in india to meet the future electricity demand a solution is to develop large scale offshore wind farms the state coastlines are expected to have a favorable environment to harness offshore wind energy with an estimated potential capacity of 60000 mw per year qrius 2017 coastal wind projects can contribute to increasing the installation capacity as they ensure frequent and powerful winds which help to mitigate the gap between energy supply and demand the assessment of offshore wind energy potential has to be examined before the large scale offshore development at any location the feasibility of offshore wind energy farms depends not only on wind climate but also on economic criteria like distance from the coastline technical criteria such as water depth and social measures like fishing rights all of which have to be considered and several scenarios compared

typically includes coastal ports sea beaches sand ridges and lagoons it stretches from pazhverkadu in district thiruvallur to ezhudesam in district kanyakumari wikipedia 2009 these eastern coasts have a short continental shelf range and vary in topography bathymetry and climatic conditions from the west coast sunil deshpande and vilas b joshi 2015 tamil nadu s coastline was chosen due to the ever present wind as explained in the indian wind atlas the flatness of the topography with regular surfaces such as water bodies often offers comparatively less airflow resistance also the sites are easy to access the research study area of tamil nadu india is situated between 11 7 37 6428 n and 78 39 24 8076 e gps coordinates latlong 2020 for this study the seven locations along the tamil nadu coast were chosen and the location coordinates above mean sea level amsl are shown in fig 1 2 2 data acquisition and data description data were obtained from the meteorological mast installed alone at various times in the coastal area these masts were erected at each of the wind study terrains and recorded wind data characteristics the met tower had wind speed direction pressure and temperature sensors and a logger to capture the measured data the entire research is formulated on the analysis of the given data the masts were installed for heights of approximately 20 100 m in table 1 the geographical coordinates showing the location of meteorological stations where wind speed data collected these data were processed to obtain average annual wind speeds and associated parameters based on the heights measured 2 3 theoretical models wind speed data gathered from the meteorological masts were measured for a timestamp of 10 min average for the dhanushkodi and ennore sites and on an hourly basis for the rest of the sites namely muttom kanyakumari rameshwaram kaliyanagari and poompuhar these results are evaluated and estimated monthly and annual mean wind speed values since the advanced wind turbines hub heights are typically between 80m and 120m in height the measured wind speeds are below the hub height of the wtg the data were extrapolated to the wind turbines hub height 100 m when wind speed data is available from above the ground level for two different heights a simple empirical power law equation 1 is used to calculate the wind speed at the hub height of the wind turbine the power law describes the relationship between mean wind speeds at two different heights and the hub height of the turbine 1 v 2 v 1 h 2 h 1 where v2 is the mean wind speed at height h2 v1 is the mean wind speed at height h1 and α is the co efficient wind shear exponent power law wind shear exponent coefficient of friction is a function of the terrain where the wind flows and is thus influenced by the height at which the wind speed is measured the value of α is specific for each location and should be evaluated the one seventh power law will measure the vertical extrapolation of wind speed for flat terrain with small foliage i e α 0 14 chandel et al 2014 the station muttom rameshwaram and poompuhar used this power law exponent due to the lack of additional height details the mean average wind speed can be explicitly determined from the complete time series data evaluation of the site s wind power density wpd decides the location s wind capacity the decisive factors for wpd are the distribution of wind speed the cube of wind speed and the air intensity of the region as a consequence wpd is a strong measure of the output of wind power at the site relative to the normal wind speed the following equation used for estimating wpd equation 2 2 p a 1 2 ρ v 3 where p a is the wind power density or the electric power per unit area w m2 ρ the mean air density kg m3 and v the mean wind speed m s the average intensity of wind power is estimated for all sites the turbulence reported in the wind data is nothing but the fluctuations in wind speed and direction a steady flow of wind would have low turbulence whereas a rapid flow of wind would have higher turbulence wind turbulence intensity ti is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation in the wind to the average wind speed equation 3 is the method for determining the importance of ti 3 ti σ v where σ the standard deviation of wind speed and v mean wind speed the wind frequency distribution is used to estimate the potential for wind power and it is essential to consider the availability of wind power at the site weibull distribution is a generalized method used to describe the distribution of wind speed this helps to model the occurrence and probability numerous techniques are available to determine the parameters of scale and shape either of these methods includes the mean wind speed approach the standard deviation method mean wind speed and the fastest mile method the least squares fit approach the maximum likelihood method the median and quartile fit strategy and the k versus mean wind speed mechanism wind speed frequency distribution is determined by industry standard windographer software where c is the weibull scale factor m s and k is the weibull shape factor unitless 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean wind speed mws and wind power density wpd analysis based on the data collected from the met mast at heights of 10 20 50 and 100 m wind power potential assessment was carried out at all seven sites the mean monthly wind speed shows the peak months from which the maximum generation is anticipated longer duration data would also help to assess the inter annual variation of wind speed and thereby help to better understanding the characteristics of the site to interpret monthly wind variations the average monthly mean is depicted in table 2 based on the data evaluation kanyakumari was observed to have an overall mean wind speed of 9 11 m s and a wind power density of 684 20 w m2 while the second highest wind speed was detected at dhanushkodi with a wind speed of 8 45 m s and a wind power density of 521 70 w m2 the lowest mean wind speed at poompuhar was 6 081 m s and an overall wind power density of 232 46 w m2 other sites i e muttom rameshwaram kaliyanagari and ennore registered both wind speed and wind power density of 6 11 m s and 208 64 w m2 8 73 m s and 592 40 w m2 6 61 m s and 262 51 w m2 and 6 77 m s and 267 52 w m2 respectively the average wind speed and power density metric is a measure of its ability for wind turbines and is shown in table 4 baloch et al 2017 based on table 4 the exceptional wind speed of dhanushkodi is 7 60 m s at 10 m preceded by rameshwaram and kanyakumari with 5 76 m s and 5 63 m s respectively poompuhar 4 60 m s has moderate wind resources while ennore 4 18 m s and kalia nagari 4 10 m s have low wind resources at 10 m height excellent wind resources at higher elevations sites with a wind power density of greater than 200 w m2 are deemed outstanding and productive for the development of wind farms at 100 m all sites have strong wind potential with wind power intensity varying from 208 64 w m2 in muttom to the highest 684 2 w m2 in kanyakumari along with 226 87 w m2 in ennore 232 46 w m2 at poompuhar 259 43 w m2 at kalia nagari 521 7 w m2 at dhanushkodi and 592 40 w m2 at rameshwaram respectively figs 2 and 3 are schematic representations of the mean wind speed and the mean wind power density of the locations respectively 3 2 diurnal pattern analysis the diurnal cycle represents the shifting behaviour of wind patterns in the morning and evening diurnal cycles are triggered by changing temperatures throughout the day and night this influence is distinct and noticeable in coastal regions in the morning the sun heats both land and sea however the land absorbs heat faster than the sea this makes the atmosphere warmer over the ground than over the sea this growth persists during the day lapworth a 2005 the diurnal pattern of wind speed is shown in fig 4 a g higher wind speed in the morning and evening hours is favorable as peak demand is higher at this time although wind speed seemed to increase in the mornings at sites like muttom and kanyakumari it decreased in the evenings at dhanushkodi wind speed decreased in the mornings but continued to increase in the evenings sites such as rameshwaram kaliya nagai poompuhar and ennore on the other hand reported a slow and gradual rise from dawn to dusk and showed excellent potential in order to investigate the diurnal cycle of wind the distribution of wind at each site was divided into three durations per hour depending on the rate of the shift in temperature initially from 00 00 to 08 00 in the morning from 08 00 to 16 00 in the afternoon and from 16 00 to 24 00 in the night three patterns are primarily focused on fragmented durations with a linear drop in wind speed at night a rapid rise in wind speed at 8 00 a m reasonably stable wind speeds in the afternoon supplemented by a late afternoon peak because much of the peak demand in the state is during the mornings and evenings the establishment of wind farms in these regions would help to satisfy the needed demand 3 3 wind direction analysis the wind direction in all locations was determined by drawing up the wind rose on the basis of available data the various color bands of the wind rose to indicate the amount of time the wind blows in certain speed ranges and the way the wind speed is distributed the duration of each petal across the globe indicates the frequency that the wind blows from a particular direction the wind roses shown in the figures here are the percentages of time that winds blow from a particular direction at a certain speed for example the dhanushkodi rose demonstrates that the wind sweeping in the southwest zone encompasses 23 of all hourly wind directions and 17 of the hourly wind direction in the northeast all wind roses shown here are divided into 16 sectors such as north n north east nne north east ne etc fig 5 a d are the wind direction of sites situated on the coast the predominant wind direction is southwest to the sites of rameshwaram dhanushkodi poompuhar and ennore due to missing wind direction data for the sites of muttom kaliya nagari and poompuhar the wind rose is not generated but the wind direction is west south and south respectively based on the wind energy resources survey in india reported by the niwe 3 4 wind shear analysis wind speed was extrapolated to 100 m with the guidance of the 1 7th law on wind power for muttom rameshwaram and poompuhar and the standard power law for the remaining sites this coefficient is site specific for the location of measurement this precise knowledge of the wind shear coefficient is crucial for better assessment of wind power ayodele tr ogunjuyigbe aso 2016 vertical wind shear is the second most significant factor in assessing wind potential strong vertical wind shear is associated with enhancing energy production however the extreme wind shear will have a detrimental effect on the load control and to improve rotor fatigue e dokur and m kurban 2015 in the wind shear analysis the wind characteristics for the seven sites are assessed using equations 1 and 3 for 20 m 50 m and 100 m using the power law with available data at 10 m and corresponding data on the height of the hub the mean wind speed for muttom kanyakumari rameshwaram dhanushkodi kaliya nagari poompuhar and ennore varies from 3 645 to 6 11 m s 5 636 9 11 m s 5 791 8 73 m s 7 606 8 45 m s 4 12 6 61 m s 4 61 6 08 m s and 4 71 6 77 m s at 10 m 100 m respectively the comparative variability in wind shear for these sites can be seen in fig 6 3 5 turbulence intensity ti turbulence intensity is a fundamental measure of wind turbulence typically 10 of ti is desired for preventing deterioration of wind turbine components graphs linked to turbulence intensity are visualized in fig 7 based on the assessment all location turbulence intensities were found to be less than 10 at 15 m s as per iec 61400 12 1 3 6 weibull distribution weibull distribution is used to fit the distribution of measured wind speed the statistical assessment of wind speed was carried out by establishing the frequency distribution a k azad et al 2011 on all sites the monthly shape and scale parameters of the weibull distribution were evaluated the annual scale and shape parameters were also calculated at a hub height of 100 m this could be used to estimate the energy production and capacity utilization factors the distribution of weibull can vary considerably depending on the values of its parameters the shape and scale parameters of the seven sites are shown in table 5 a higher value of c indicates that the mean wind speed is stronger where the value of k implies wind stability murthy and rahi 2016 fig 8 demonstrates the fitting of the weibull probability density function as the weibull curve for measured 100 m data the shape parameter is between 2 26 and 2 85 and the scale parameter is around 11 to 13 percent higher than the corresponding mean speed the weibull shape parameters showing the characteristics of the wind waves are regular and consistent 4 conclusion the primary objective of this paper is to present a preliminary assessment of wind power potential for the tamil nadu coastal region using the available wind data from the meteorological masts at seven sites such as muttom kanyakumari rameshwaram dhanushkodi kaliya nagari poompuhar and ennore according to the data gathered the measured data were confined to a limited height i e rameshwaram poompuhar and ennore had the highest observed height of 20 and thus all data were extrapolated to a height of 100 m using the power law index the mean wind speed for all sites was estimated and reported to vary from 3 65 m s to 7 60 m s at 10 m 4 43 m s to 7 98 m s at 20m 5 41 m s to 8 28 m s at 50m and 6 08 m s to 9 11 m s at 100 m the trend of the transition in wind speed on a monthly basis is well estimated from the monthly mean wind speed profile in further analysis the density of wind power was evaluated as a key factor in the installation of wind turbines at all seven stations the average wind power density determined was found to comply with the minimum criteria for the establishment of a wind farm for the production of electricity sites like kanyakumari dhanushkodi and rameshwaram have outstanding values of 684 2 w m2 521 7 w m2 and 592 40 w m2 and 592 40 w m2 at 100 m above ground level the trend of the wind speed variation on a monthly basis can be well assessed from the monthly mean wind speed profile in the further course of the study the wind power density an essential factor in wind turbine siting was calculated at all seven stations the average wind power density calculated was found to comply with the minimum requirements to set up a wind farm for electricity generation sites including kanyakumari dhanushkodi and rameshwaram have outstanding values of 684 2 w m2 521 7 w m2 and 592 40 w m2 at the height of 100 m from ground level respectively the wind direction of all sites was determined by drawing the wind rose based on the basis of data available the predominant wind direction is from the southwest to the sites of rameshwaram dhanushkodi poompuhar and ennore in muttom kaliya nagari and poompuhar the wind direction is found to be west south and south based on the reference from the resource survey of india diurnal patterns reflect changing wind patterns in the mornings and evenings and are mainly caused by varying temperatures in the day and night the location chosen is situated in the coastal area and is pursuing a similar pattern in this article the turbulence strength as the specific measure of wind turbulence usually required below 10 is observed for the minimum wear of wind turbine components on all the locations the monthly shape and scale parameters of the weibull distribution were estimated the annual scale and shape parameters were also computed at a hub height of 100 m this will be used to estimate the electricity production and capacity utilization factors the findings can be used for the early strategic planning of wind power which should be supplemented by a thorough analysis relating to the high moderate wind power density of 100 m and other important factors both stations may be suitable for the construction of wind turbines thus providing a cost free renewable energy source the introduction of emerging renewable energy technologies decreases the reliance on fossil fuels which is of primary concern these analyzed results are preliminary characteristics which can be helpful in converting wind power which is also useful in identifying the actual wind potential to demonstrate the best possible sites within a 10 km range from the coast geographic information system gis tool will be adopted a significant contribution would be made to the planning of the offshore wind potential area offshore wind resource maps will be validated using estimated wind speeds obtained from the meteorological towers established along the tamil nadu coast and error levels in terms of mean absolute error and correlation coefficient with re analyzed data from the public domain the findings of the analysis would indicate the suitability of the development of wind turbines along the south eastern part of the tamil nadu coast these findings will contribute to the future selection of the wind turbine location credit authorship contribution statement k boopathi conceptualization

21274,tamil nadu is among india s most developed and industrialized states onshore wind is the fastest growing with tamil nadu contributing 23 percent of the total wind capacity installed in india at 37 505 mw this paper aims to present a preliminary assessment of the potential for wind power to the tamil nadu coastal region as estimating the wind characteristics is the first essential step in evaluating a wind energy project therefore it is important to have a thorough understanding of the wind resource to assess the wind resource ground based meteorological masts measurement data from

because of its nearness to a few normal assets therefore the vitality necessity has been expanded to a few folds with the depletion of petroleum products and expanding mindfulness on ecological issues saddling vitality from accessible assets has become a prime concentration in developing nations surisetty v v arun kumar et al 2020 in indian states tamil nadu southern india is one of the most industrialized and more populated states its electricity demand was 15689 mw as of april 2016 which was considerably higher than the previous year s the hindu india 2016 growth in demand is expected to be 7 and peak demand to reach 17651 mw by the beginning of 2021 tamil nadu has a higher number of household electrification at 93 4 compared to the national average of 67 2 ministry of power india 2012 this demand is met by conventional energy sources with a capacity of 13231 44 mw as on 31 03 15 including hydropower 2288 40 mw thermal power 4660 mw and gas stations 515 88 mw from central generating stations 4809 00 mw with another 958 16 mw from private players however with modernization and huge scope urbanization the interest for power expanded at a fast rate due to an increase in energy demand tamil nadu faces frequent power shortages this is expected to further rise in the coming years due to industrial consumption and soaring temperatures increasing the load on the electrical grid the concept behind the electric grid is to ensure supply and demand to stabilize the grid and prevent power failures power consumed must be equal to the power produced this ever increasing energy demand is met by thermal stations operating at 80 plant load capacity along with hydropower stations wind stations and solar power as renewable energy wind energy is the fastest growing energy sector in tamil nadu contributing 23 of the total installed wind capacity of 32877 mw as on january 30 2018 in india to meet the future electricity demand a solution is to develop large scale offshore wind farms the state coastlines are expected to have a favorable environment to harness offshore wind energy with an estimated potential capacity of 60000 mw per year qrius 2017 coastal wind projects can contribute to increasing the installation capacity as they ensure frequent and powerful winds which help to mitigate the gap between energy supply and demand the assessment of offshore wind energy potential has to be examined before the large scale offshore development at any location the feasibility of offshore wind energy farms depends not only on wind climate but also on economic criteria like distance from the coastline technical criteria such as water depth and social measures like fishing rights all of which have to be considered and several scenarios compared atsushi yamaguchi takeshi ishihara 2014 in an earlier preliminary assessment it was found that wind power densities were about 250 300 w m2 by the arabian sea with 6 6 4 m s wind speed 250 600 w m2

potential estimation 2 methodology this section presents the methodology followed in the study explaining the definition of the location data collection information data type and interpretation of the wind data furthermore the findings are described in terms of graphical representation 2 1 description of meteorological sites tamil nadu s coastline along india s eastern coast is 1076 km long and typically includes coastal ports sea beaches sand ridges and lagoons it stretches from pazhverkadu in district thiruvallur to ezhudesam in district kanyakumari wikipedia 2009 these eastern coasts have a short continental shelf range and vary in topography bathymetry and climatic conditions from the west coast sunil deshpande and vilas b joshi 2015 tamil nadu s coastline was chosen due to the ever present wind as explained in the indian wind atlas the flatness of the topography with regular surfaces such as water bodies often offers comparatively less airflow resistance also the sites are easy to access the research study area of tamil nadu india is situated between 11 7 37 6428 n and 78 39 24 8076 e gps coordinates latlong 2020 for this study the seven locations along the tamil nadu coast were chosen and the location coordinates above mean sea level amsl are shown in fig 1 2 2 data acquisition and data description data were obtained from the meteorological mast installed alone at various times in the coastal area these masts were erected at each of the wind study terrains and recorded wind data characteristics the met tower had wind speed direction pressure and temperature sensors and a logger to capture the measured data the entire research is formulated on the analysis of the given data the masts were installed for heights of approximately 20 100 m in table 1 the geographical coordinates showing the location of meteorological stations where wind speed data collected these data were processed to obtain average annual wind speeds and associated parameters based on the heights measured 2 3 theoretical models wind speed data gathered from the meteorological masts were measured for a timestamp of 10 min average for the dhanushkodi and ennore sites and on an hourly basis for the rest of the sites namely muttom kanyakumari rameshwaram kaliyanagari and poompuhar these results are evaluated and estimated monthly and annual mean wind speed values since the advanced wind turbines hub heights are typically between 80m and 120m in height the measured wind speeds are below the hub height of the wtg the data were extrapolated to the wind turbines hub height 100 m when wind speed data is available from above the ground level for two different heights a simple empirical power law equation 1 is used to calculate the wind speed at the hub height of the wind turbine the power law describes the relationship between mean wind speeds at two different heights and the hub height of the turbine 1 v 2 v 1 h 2 h 1 where v2 is the mean wind speed at height h2 v1 is the mean wind speed at height h1 and α is the co efficient wind shear exponent power law wind shear exponent coefficient of friction is a function of the terrain where the wind flows and is thus influenced by the height at which the wind speed is measured the value of α is specific for each location and should be evaluated the one seventh power law will measure the vertical extrapolation of wind speed for flat terrain with small foliage i e α 0 14 chandel et al 2014 the station muttom rameshwaram and poompuhar used this power law exponent due to the lack of additional height details the mean average wind speed can be explicitly determined from the complete time series data evaluation of the site s wind power density wpd decides the location s wind capacity the decisive factors for wpd are the distribution of wind speed the cube of wind speed and the air intensity of the region as a consequence wpd is a strong measure of the output of wind power at the site relative to the normal wind speed the following equation used for estimating wpd equation 2 2 p a 1 2 ρ v 3 where p a is the wind power density or the electric power per unit area w m2 ρ the mean air density kg m3 and v the mean wind speed m s the average intensity of wind power is estimated for all sites the turbulence reported in the wind data is nothing but the fluctuations in wind speed and direction a steady flow of wind would have low turbulence whereas a rapid flow of wind would have higher turbulence wind turbulence intensity ti is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation in the wind to the average wind speed equation 3 is the method for determining the importance of ti 3 ti σ v where σ the standard deviation of wind speed and v mean wind speed the wind frequency distribution is used to estimate the potential for wind power and it is essential to consider the availability of wind power at the site weibull distribution is a generalized method used to describe the distribution of wind speed this helps to model the occurrence and probability numerous techniques are available to determine the parameters of scale and shape either of these methods includes the mean wind speed approach the standard deviation method mean wind speed and the fastest mile method the least squares fit approach the maximum likelihood method the median and quartile fit strategy and the k versus mean wind speed mechanism wind speed frequency distribution is determined by industry standard windographer software where c is the weibull scale factor m s and k is the weibull shape factor unitless 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean wind speed mws and wind power density wpd analysis based on the data collected from the met mast at heights of 10 20 50 and 100 m wind power potential assessment was carried out at all seven sites the mean monthly wind speed shows the peak months from which the maximum generation is anticipated longer duration data would also help to assess the inter annual variation of wind speed and thereby help to better understanding the characteristics of the site to interpret monthly wind variations the average monthly mean is depicted in table 2 based on the data evaluation kanyakumari was observed to have an overall mean wind speed of 9 11 m s and a wind power density of 684 20 w m2 while the second highest wind speed was detected at dhanushkodi with a wind speed of 8 45 m s and a wind power density of 521 70 w m2 the lowest mean wind speed at poompuhar was 6 081 m s and an overall wind power density of 232 46 w m2 other sites i e muttom rameshwaram kaliyanagari and ennore registered both wind speed and wind power density of 6 11 m s and 208 64 w m2 8 73 m s and 592 40 w m2 6 61 m s and 262 51 w m2 and 6 77 m s and 267 52 w m2 respectively the average wind speed and power density metric is a measure of its ability for wind turbines and is shown in table 4 baloch et al 2017 based on table 4 the exceptional wind speed of dhanushkodi is 7 60 m s at 10 m preceded by rameshwaram and kanyakumari with 5 76 m s and 5 63 m s respectively poompuhar 4 60 m s has moderate wind resources while ennore 4 18 m s and kalia nagari 4 10 m s have low wind resources at 10 m height excellent wind resources at higher elevations sites with a wind power density of greater than 200 w m2 are deemed outstanding and productive for the development of wind farms at 100 m all sites have strong wind potential with wind power intensity varying from 208 64 w m2 in muttom to the highest 684 2 w m2 in kanyakumari along with 226 87 w m2 in ennore 232 46 w m2 at poompuhar 259 43 w m2 at kalia nagari 521 7 w m2 at dhanushkodi and 592 40 w m2 at rameshwaram respectively figs 2 and 3 are schematic representations of the mean wind speed and the mean wind power density of the locations respectively 3 2 diurnal pattern analysis the diurnal cycle represents the shifting behaviour of wind patterns in the morning and evening diurnal cycles are triggered by changing temperatures throughout the day and night this influence is distinct and noticeable in coastal regions in the morning the sun heats both land and sea however the land absorbs heat faster than the sea this makes the atmosphere warmer over the ground than over the sea this growth persists during the day lapworth a 2005 the diurnal pattern of wind speed is shown in fig 4 a g higher wind speed in the morning and evening hours is favorable as peak demand is higher at this time although wind speed seemed to increase in the mornings at sites like muttom and kanyakumari it decreased in the evenings at dhanushkodi wind speed decreased in the mornings but continued to increase in the evenings sites such as rameshwaram kaliya nagai poompuhar and ennore on the other hand reported a slow and gradual rise from dawn to dusk and showed excellent potential in order to investigate the diurnal cycle of wind the distribution of wind at each site was divided into three durations per hour depending on the rate of the shift in temperature initially from 00 00 to 08 00 in the morning from 08 00 to 16 00 in the afternoon and from 16 00 to 24 00 in the night three patterns are primarily focused on fragmented durations with a linear drop in wind speed at night a rapid rise in wind speed at 8 00 a m reasonably stable wind speeds in the afternoon supplemented by a late afternoon peak because much of the peak demand in the state is during the mornings and evenings the establishment of wind farms in these regions would help to satisfy the needed demand 3 3 wind direction analysis the wind direction in all locations was determined by drawing up the wind rose on the basis of available data the various color bands of the wind rose to indicate the amount of time the wind blows in certain speed ranges and the way the wind speed is distributed the duration of each petal across the globe indicates the frequency that the wind blows from a particular direction the wind roses shown in the figures here are the percentages of time that winds blow from a particular direction at a certain speed for example the dhanushkodi rose demonstrates that the wind sweeping in the southwest zone encompasses 23 of all hourly wind directions and 17 of the hourly wind direction in the northeast all wind roses shown here are divided into 16 sectors such as north n north east nne north east ne etc fig 5 a d are the wind direction of sites situated on the coast the predominant wind direction is southwest to the sites of rameshwaram dhanushkodi poompuhar and ennore due to missing wind direction data for the sites of muttom kaliya nagari and poompuhar the wind rose is not generated but the wind direction is west south and south respectively based on the wind energy resources survey in india reported by the niwe 3 4 wind shear analysis wind speed was extrapolated to 100 m with the guidance of the 1 7th law on wind power for muttom rameshwaram and poompuhar and the standard power law for the remaining sites this coefficient is site specific for the location of measurement this precise knowledge of the wind shear coefficient is crucial for better assessment of wind power ayodele tr ogunjuyigbe aso 2016 vertical wind shear is the second most significant factor in assessing wind potential strong vertical wind shear is associated with enhancing energy production however the extreme wind shear will have a detrimental effect on the load control and to improve rotor fatigue e dokur and m kurban 2015 in the wind shear analysis the wind characteristics for the seven sites are assessed using equations 1 and 3 for 20 m 50 m and 100 m using the power law with available data at 10 m and corresponding data on the height of the hub the mean wind speed for muttom kanyakumari rameshwaram dhanushkodi kaliya nagari poompuhar and ennore varies from 3 645 to 6 11 m s 5 636 9 11 m s 5 791 8 73 m s 7 606 8 45 m s 4 12 6 61 m s 4 61 6 08 m s and 4 71 6 77 m s at 10 m 100 m respectively the comparative variability in wind shear for these sites can be seen in fig 6 3 5 turbulence intensity ti turbulence intensity is a fundamental measure of wind turbulence typically 10 of ti is desired for preventing deterioration of wind turbine components graphs linked to turbulence intensity are visualized in fig 7 based on the assessment all location turbulence intensities were found to be less than 10 at 15 m s as per iec 61400 12 1 3 6 weibull distribution weibull distribution is used to fit the distribution of measured wind speed the statistical assessment of wind speed was carried out by establishing the frequency distribution a k azad et al 2011 on all sites the monthly shape and scale parameters of the weibull distribution were evaluated the annual scale and shape parameters were also calculated at a hub height of 100 m this could be used to estimate the energy production and capacity utilization factors the distribution of weibull can vary considerably depending on the values of its parameters the shape and scale parameters of the seven sites are shown in table 5 a higher value of c indicates that the mean wind speed is stronger where the value of k implies wind stability murthy and rahi 2016 fig 8 demonstrates the fitting of the weibull probability density function as the weibull curve for measured 100 m data the shape parameter is between 2 26 and 2 85 and the scale parameter is around 11 to 13 percent higher than the corresponding mean speed the weibull shape parameters showing the characteristics of the wind waves are regular and consistent 4 conclusion the primary objective of this paper is to present a preliminary assessment of wind power potential for the tamil nadu coastal region using the available wind data from the meteorological masts at seven sites such as muttom kanyakumari rameshwaram dhanushkodi kaliya nagari poompuhar and ennore according to the data gathered the measured data were confined to a limited height i e rameshwaram poompuhar and ennore had the highest observed height of 20 and thus all data were extrapolated to a height of 100 m using the power law index the mean wind speed for all sites was estimated and reported to vary from 3 65 m s to 7 60 m s at 10 m 4 43 m s to 7 98 m s at 20m 5 41 m s to 8 28 m s at 50m and 6 08 m s to 9 11 m s at 100 m the trend of the transition in wind speed on a monthly basis is well estimated from the monthly mean wind speed profile in further analysis the density of wind power was evaluated as a key factor in the installation of wind turbines at all seven stations the average wind power density determined was found to comply with the minimum criteria for the establishment of a wind farm for the production of electricity sites like kanyakumari dhanushkodi and rameshwaram have outstanding values of 684 2 w m2 521 7 w m2 and 592 40 w m2 and 592 40 w m2 at 100 m above ground level the trend of the wind speed variation on a monthly basis can be well assessed from the monthly mean wind speed profile in the further course of the study the wind power density an essential factor in wind turbine siting was calculated at all seven stations the average wind power density calculated was found to comply with the minimum requirements to set up a wind farm for electricity generation sites including kanyakumari dhanushkodi and rameshwaram have outstanding values of 684 2 w m2 521 7 w m2 and 592 40 w m2 at the height of 100 m from ground level respectively the wind direction of all sites was determined by drawing the wind rose based on the basis of data available the predominant wind direction is from the southwest to the sites of rameshwaram dhanushkodi poompuhar and ennore in muttom kaliya nagari and poompuhar the wind direction is found to be west south and south based on the reference from the resource survey of india diurnal patterns reflect changing wind patterns in the mornings and evenings and are mainly caused by varying temperatures in the day and night the location chosen is situated in the coastal area and is pursuing a similar pattern in this article the turbulence strength as the specific measure of wind turbulence usually required below 10 is observed for the minimum wear of wind turbine components on all the locations the monthly shape and scale parameters of the weibull distribution were estimated the annual scale and shape parameters were also computed at a hub height of 100 m this will be used to estimate the electricity production and capacity utilization factors the findings can be used for the early strategic planning of wind power which should be supplemented by a thorough analysis relating to the high moderate wind power density of 100 m and other important factors both stations may be suitable for the construction of wind turbines thus providing a cost free renewable energy source the introduction of emerging renewable energy technologies decreases the reliance on fossil fuels which is of primary concern these analyzed results are preliminary characteristics which can be helpful in converting wind power which is also useful in identifying the actual wind potential to demonstrate the best possible sites within a 10 km range from the coast geographic information system gis tool will be adopted a significant contribution would be made to the planning of the offshore wind potential area offshore wind resource maps will be validated using estimated wind speeds obtained from the meteorological towers established along the tamil nadu coast and error levels in terms of mean absolute error and correlation coefficient with re analyzed data from the public domain the findings of the analysis would indicate the suitability of the development of wind turbines along the south eastern part of the tamil nadu coast these findings will contribute to the future selection of the wind turbine location credit authorship contribution statement k boopathi conceptualization
