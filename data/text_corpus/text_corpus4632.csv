the underwater manipulator is an important equipment of underwater vehicle performing the tasks such as underwater salvage sample collection pipeline assembly cable cutting and so on gao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 however with the reason of poor operation hazardous environment uncertain operation object and lack of scene force perception it has caused over operation or miss operation problems and complex situation of great water pressure and poor sightline brings psychological anxiety for the underwater operator the rotation of the propeller causes the plankton to be disperse and suspension in the working area mohan and kim 2012 chen et al 2016 which causes visual ambiguity and limiting the efficiency of work and the bilateral teleoperation system is a universal concerned direction teleoperation systems have significant influence on some common applications including handling of hazardous maneuvering mobile robots and microsurgery atashzar et al 2015 sharifi et al 2017a blank et al 2014 a teleoperation system is composed of a human operator a master manipulator a communication channel a remote slave manipulator and a remote environment ganjefar et al 2017 the main objective of such a scheme is to extend the human manipulation capabilities to a remote environment in the underwater manipulator teleoperation systems the master manipulator is generally located in the surface vessel or the manned submersibles and the slave manipulator is mounted on the remote operated vehicle rov or autonomous underwater vehicle auv directing interaction with the environment londhe et al 2017 esfahani et al 2015 the typical application schematic representation of underwater teleoperation is shown as fig 1 the master manipulator and slave manipulator are connected with umbilical cord mohan and kim 2015 which achieves power supply and data communication of rov in the application the slave manipulator tracks the master manipulator s position at the same time the master manipulator force applied by the operator asymptotically approximates to the slave manipulator s force applying to the environment and the master and slave manipulators exchange control signals through the communication channel and the slave force interaction is feedback to the operator which makes the operator feels the direct operation of the remote object many scholars have proposed different schemes to improve the teleoperation system stability and transparency aziminejad et al 2008 the stability of bilateral teleoperation system independent of constant time delay is guaranteed using the passivity and scattering theories anderson and spong 1989 in order to guarantee passivity and velocity tracking the wave transformation idea is proposed to transmit the wave variable instead of the power variable to deal with the time delay sun et al 2014 a proportional derivative pd like controller applied to the delayed bilateral teleoperation system is proposed in face of position and force coordination with communication varying time delays slawiñski et al 2016 slawiñski and mut 2015 the four channel architecture is employed to achieve simultaneous position and force coordination in nonlinear teleoperation systems in mohammadi et al 2016 in the previous approaches the controllers for bilateral teleoperation systems are designed with the hypothesis that all the parameters of the master and the slave robots are known however it does not always hold because there exist modeling uncertainties and external disturbance in the application in addition the object parameters can not be accurately obtained during the interaction of the slave robot with the environment the adaptive control can handle these problems by adjusting the parameters in various systems liu et al 1999 several approaches for adaptive control of robot manipulators have been proposed in the presence of parameter uncertainties the indirect adaptive controllers based on tracking error are designed with sliding mode control in slotine and li gonzalez et al 1995 on the other hand the direct adaptive controllers based on prediction error for robot manipulators are designed using least squares estimation in middletone and goodwin 1986 for the teleoperation system with communication constant delay taking into account the uncertainty of the robot s kinetic parameters chopra proposed a passive adaptive control method to ensure the master slave robot position speed synchronization in free space chopra et al 2008 kim proposed a passive control algorithm for the networked robot system of uncertainties of model parameters and motion parameters and realized position tracking synchronization through adaptive control in kim and ahn 2013 however the variable time delay would cause disturbances to the control system xia liu designed a kind of adaptive controller based on peb position error based and stability was proved by lyapunov function and position of the convergence of the tracking error liu and tavakoli 2012 however it ignored the influence of joint friction changchun hua proposed neural network based adaptive position tracking controller for the bilateral teleoperation system with time delay hua et al 2013 but the outside uncertain disturbance would bring unstable of the control system yuanyuan proposed disturbance observer design yuan et al 2017a and optimal controller design yuan et al 2017b for the system matched disturbance and he put forward to a force reflection control scheme based on dynamic gain force observer with wave variable method for the time varying delayed teleoperation to achieve force position coordination yuan et al in some special application environment such as nuclear radiation teleoperation yu et al 2017 underwater teleoperation hirabayashi et al 2006 and clearance of mines teleoperation ryu et al 2005 the distance between the master and slave robot is short so that the communication time delay is not the dominant influence to the stability and transparency and can be ignored as a result the master and slave robots can be considered as two independent equipments the master robot can be regarded as a force feedback equipment to achieve force signal reproduction fang et al 2018 the common controller of force reproduction or called force tracking are impedance controller akdoğan et al 2018 and force position hybrid control wu et al 2017 whose essence is to adjust the robot displacement to achieve contact force adjustment dutta et al 2017 when the operator s tactile force on the master robot is less than the standard force the controller adjusts the position of the master robot to generate the motion of the opposite direction of the operator force thereby squeezing the operator s fingertip to increase force on the contrary if the operator s force is greater than the standard force signal the controller will make the robot generate the motion the same direction of the operator s force so as to release the operator s force to balance the standard force signal zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2017 osafo yeboah et al 2013 the slave robot can be considered as motion constraint position tracking robot of which the common controllers are fuzzy control zhou et al sliding mode control zhao et al 2018 and adaptive neural network control asl and janabi sharifi 2017 in order to achieve the master manipulator force tracking and slave manipulator position tracking with the problems of model uncertainty and external disturbance this paper proposes a method of adaptive bilateral control in the master controller a new nonlinear model reference adaptive impedance controller with bgf composite adaptive law is proposed for the master manipulator force tracking the reference position in task space is obtained from the linear second order impedance model whose input is the error of the master operator force and the slave an adaptive terminal sliding mode control based on adaptive uncertain model approximation is proposed to achieve the master position tracking of the reference position the asymptotic tracking performance and global stability of the master system are proved using lyapunov stability theorem for the slave manipulator s position tracking a novel adaptive terminal sliding mode control based on rbfnn local approximation method is proposed the rbfnn with gl matrix is adopted to directly approximate all parts of the manipulator dynamic model ge and hang 1996 the robust term with a proper update law is designed to suppress the error between the estimate model and the real model as well as the external disturbance so there is no need to obtain the slave manipulator dynamic true parameters the stability and asymptotic convergence of the closed loop system are established by the lyapunov theory at last the simulation results of two link manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effector of the proposed control method the teleoperation system has a good ability of force and position tracking this paper is inspired from mojtaba sharifi s work sharifi et al 2014 and the main advantage of the proposed control scheme is expressed as follows 1 the force error impedance model is employed for the force tracking in the master controller 2 in order to avoid the acceleration term measurement in the master dynamic a first order filter is applied for the adaptive law design in the master controller 3 the bgf composite adaptation with exponentially forgetting least squares gain update is proposed for the master controller 4 the rbfnn with parameter adaptive law is proposed to approximate individual elements of the inertia matrix centripetal matrix and gravitation vector respectively in the slave controller 5 an adaptive controller law with an approximate update law is designed to drive the system states to reach the sliding surface and converge to zero with the slave controller this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents some

parameterized in terms of the manipulator system parameters as follows 2 m i q i φ 1 c i q i q i φ 2 g i q i d i q i y i φ 1 φ 2 q i q i θ i where the subscript i m s stands for the master and slave respectively and θ i contains the unknown parameters of the manipulator and regressor matrix y i φ 1 φ 2 q i q i contains known functions φ 1 r n 1 φ 2 r n 1 are represented as any vectors not necessary acceleration and velocity vectors of manipulator furthermore we assume for the controller design and stability analysis in later section as follows assumption 1 the viscous friction and coulomb friction are considered at the master and slave manipulators in addition the slave manipulator s dynamic equation contains external disturbance terms due to the underwater complex task environment assumption 2 the communication time delay between the master and slave manipulator is ignored with the result of short distance assumption 3 the human operator and the environment are be modeled as passive systems and have upper bound respectively 2 2 kinematics of master and slave the manipulator velocity x i r n 1 in the task space is related to the velocity q i r n 1 in the joint space that is expressed as 3 x i j i q i q i i m s suppose the dual manipulators are non redundant and the jacobian matrix j i q i is nonsingular matrix differentiating eq 3 with respect to time yields 4 x i j i q i q i j i q i q i i m s where x i r n 1 is the end effector acceleration vector and substituting eqs 3 and 4 into eq 1 the dynamics in task space of master and slave manipulators can be described as 5 m x m q m x m c x m q m q m x m g x m q m d x m q m τ x m f h m x s q s x s c x s q s q s x s g x s q s d x s q s d x w τ x s f e where the relations between the coefficient

in fig 2 according to the manipulator dynamic with parameters uncertainty and external disturbance the adaptive impedance control for master manipulator force tracking and the terminal adaptive sliding mode neural network control for slave manipulator position tracking are designed in details and demonstrated at the next subsections 3 1 master controller with adaptive law in order to achieve the master manipulator force tracking in the task space a second order desired impedance model is designed according to the force error of the master and slave manipulators which is expressed as 7 m d x m r b d x m r f h f e where m d and b d are positive definite diagonal matrices representing the end effector of master manipulator desired inertia damp respectively f h is the operator to exert force on the manipulator and f e is the contact force between slave manipulator and environment x m r is the output of the desired impedance model standing for the desired trajectory in the task space the reference trajectory x m r is the desired equilibrium trajectory to be tracked by the master manipulator end effector in the presence of operator force f h the model reference adaptive controller must asymptotically track the desired impedance model eq 7 by making the closed loop dynamics of the master system similar to the desired impedance model in order to achieve the position tracking of the manipulator end effector x m to the reference modeled desired trajectory response x m r the sliding mode variable is given as 8 s m x m λ 1 x m where x m x m x m r is the position tracking error of the master manipulator with respect to the trajectory response of the impedance model and λ 1 is positive definite diagonal matrix which provides the stability of the sliding mode variable the reference velocity for master manipulator is defined based on eq 8 as 9 x r x m r λ 1 x m from eqs 8 and 9 we can rewrite the sliding mode variable expressed as s m x m x r in the task space taking the time derivative of the sliding mode variable s m x m λ 1 x m and left multiply by m x m q m we can obtain that 10 m x m q m s m m x m q m x m m x m q m x m r λ 1 m x m q m x m substituting the master manipulator equation in task space eq 5 into eq 10 and eliminating the term m x m q m x m by eq 9 yields 11 m x m q m s m λ 1 m x m q m s m c x m q m q m s m τ x m m x m q m x r λ 1 s m c x m q m q m x r g x m q m d x m q m f h if the nonlinear manipulator dynamics m x m q m c x m q m q m g x m q m d x m q m are clearly known then the equivalent control can be defined as 12 τ x m e m x m q m x r λ 1 s m c x m q m q m x r g x m q m d x m q m f h theorem 1 suppose the n link master manipulator dynamics in eq 1 are known if the terminal sliding mode variable is chosen as eq 8 the controller is designed as eq 12 the master closed loop system is global stability and the master manipulator trajectory tracking convergence to the sliding surface s m 0 and the end effector position convergence to the reference position x m x m r as t proof substituting the master manipulator controller τ x m e into the dynamic we obtain 13 m x m q m s m λ 1 m x m q m s m c x m q m q m s m consider a lyapunov function candidate as follows 14 v 0 1 2 s m t m x m q m s m take the derivative of time for v 0 and apply the skew symmetric property we can obtain 15 v 0 1 2 s m t m x m q m s m s m t m x m q m s m 1 2 s m t m x m q m s m s m t λ 1 m x m q m s m c x m q m q m s m λ 1 s m t m x m q m s m 0 the stability of the close loop system eq 13 is easily proved by lyapunov function above if the dynamic of master manipulator is known however model parameters of master manipulator can not be completely known m ˆ x m q m c ˆ x m q m q m g ˆ x m q m and d ˆ x m q m are corresponding estimates of the manipulator robot parameters respectively the master manipulator s rotation angle joint length is known that is to say the jacobian matrix j m is a known quantity the master controller τ x m in task space can be designed as follows 16 τ x m m ˆ x m q m x r λ 1 s m c ˆ x m q m q m x r g ˆ x m q m d ˆ x m q m f h j m t m ˆ m q m j m 1 x r λ 1 s m j m t c ˆ m q m q m m ˆ m q m j m 1 j m j m 1 x r j m t g ˆ m q m j m t d ˆ m q m f h according to the term τ m j m t τ x m can be expressed as 17 τ m m ˆ m q m η 1 c ˆ m q m q m η 2 g ˆ m q m d ˆ m q m j m t f h where η 1 and η 2 are known vectors which don t contain any estimated parameters of the system dynamics and can be expressed as follows 18 η 1 j m 1 x r λ 1 s m j m j m 1 x r η 2 j m 1 x r with the property 4 the control law eq 17 can be rewritten as 19 τ m y m η 1 η 2 q m q m θ ˆ m j m t f h where y m θ ˆ m is the parameterizations of the first four terms of eq 17 y m is the regressor matrix and θ ˆ m is the vector of estimated parameters of the system in the joint space the adaptation law is designed as composite adaptation method with the tracking error s m and prediction error e m s m is expressed as eq 8 and the prediction error e m is the error between the physical dynamics m m q m q m c m q m q m q m g m q m d m q m and the estimated physical dynamics m ˆ m q m q m c ˆ m q m q m q m g ˆ m q m d ˆ m q m however the term m m q m q m includes acceleration term q m that is unmeasurable a filtering dynamics can be used to eliminate the acceleration term let ω s be the impulse response that stabilizes the proper filter as shown in eq 20 20 ω s a s a where a is the bandwidth of the filter ω t a e a t is the impulse response of ω s convolving both sides of master dynamic in eq 1 by ω s yields to 21 0 t w

μ c m q m q m q m μ g m q m μ d m q m μ d μ consequently without acceleration term m m q m q m the left hand side of eq 21 can be rewritten in a new regressor performance as follows 23 y m t w m w q m q m θ m the above equation is a linear parameterization of the filtered manipulator dynamics where y m t is the filtered torque which can be obtained as 24 y m t 0 t ω t μ τ m μ j m t q m μ f h μ d μ moreover w m w t in eq 23 is the filter performance of regressor matrix y m which is defined in property 4 and can be expressed that w m w q m q m 0 t ω t μ y m μ d μ as a result we can conclude that w m w q m q m can be determined using available measurements of q m and q m and the acceleration q m is not required this is the main reason of using the first order filter for both sides of manipulator dynamics the parameter θ ˆ m is the estimated value of θ m and the estimated dynamics y ˆ m t of y m t can be written as 25 y ˆ m t w m w q m q m θ ˆ m as a result the filter performance of the prediction error e m t is defined as 26 e m t y ˆ m t y m t with the new regressor matrix w m w t the prediction error can be rewritten as 27 e m t w m w q m q m θ m consequently with the adaptation law bgf composite adaptation in the literature slotine liet al 1991 the adaptation law is defined as 28 θ ˆ m p m t t y m t t j m 1 s m w m w t r m t e m t where r m t is a uniformly positive definite weighting matrix indicating how much attention the adaptation law pays to the parameters information in the prediction error e m t and the adaptation gain p m t is a uniformly positive definite gain matrix determined by the techniques to be described below for simplicity r m t in eq 28 is defined as 29 r m t a 0 i m where a 0 is a positive constant and i m is the unity matrix the adaptation law employs an exponentially forgetting least squares gain update for p m t as 30 d d t p m 1 t β t p m 1 t w m w t w m w the variable forgetting factor β t is set as 31 β t β 0 1 p m t k 0 where β 0 and k 0 are respectively positive numbers respectively representing the maximum forgetting rate and the predetermined bounds of the gain matrix norm p m t the forgetting factor in eq 30 implies forgetting the data with a factor p m t is small reducing the forgetting speed if β 0 if p m t becomes larger and suspends forgetting if p m t reaches the specified upper bound the gain update in eq 30 guarantees that t 0 β t 0 and p m t k 0 i for any signal of w m w moreover β 1 0 such that t 0 β t β 1 if w m w is positive definite slotine liet al 1991 because when the tracking error converges to zero the persistent excitation of w m w implies the positive definite of w m w which is proved in slotine liet al 1991 eq 30 can be rewritten as 32 d d t p m t β t p m t p m t w m w t w m w p m t theorem 2 consider the n link master manipulator dynamics in eq 1 with unknown dynamics if the terminal sliding mode is chosen as eq 8 the controller is designed as eq 19 the adaptation law is designed as eq 28 with update law eq 30 or 32 the master manipulator trajectory tracking convergence to the sliding surface s m 0 and the end effector position convergence to the reference position x m x m r as t proof consider a lyapunov function candidate as follows 33 v 1 1 2 s m t m x m q m s m θ m t p m 1 t θ m taking the time derivative of v 1 using the skew symmetric property we can obtain 34 v 1 λ 1 s m t m x m q m s m s m t j m t y m θ m θ ˆ m t p m 1 t θ m 1 2 θ m t d d t p m 1 t θ m λ 1 s m t m x m q m s m e m t r m t t w m w θ m 1 2 θ m t d d t p m 1 t θ m substituting the adaptive law formula eq 30 and the variable forgetting factor eq 31 into eq 3 1 yields 35 v 1 λ 1 s m t m x m q m s m e m t t r m t t w m w θ m 1 2 β t θ m t p m 1 t θ m 1 2 θ m t w m w t w m w θ

positive define v 1 0 and its derivative eq 34 is negative define v 1 0 by selecting a 0 1 2 and noting that p m t is positive define and undate rule property t 0 β t 0 according to lyapunov stability theorem the above expression guarantees global stability and the global tracking convergence in the system using the proposed controller s m 0 a s t thus the tracking error converges to the surface of s m 0 the tracking error also converges to zero on the surface of s m 0 x m 0 and x m 0 as t therefore the master manipulator convergences to zero in the position tracking error under the desired impedance model 3 2 the slave control scheme the underwater manipulator as the slave manipulator directly operates the task object with the position tracking of the master and the end effector force transmitting to the master however the controller is difficult to design due to coupled nonlinearities parameter uncertainties resulting from the lack of knowledge of hydrodynamic coefficients self joint friction and external disturbance such as waves and currents for the slave manipulator s trajectory tracking the rbfnn are adopted to directly approximate all parts of the dynamic parameters through gl matrix and robust slide mode control with adaptation law is employed to suppress the approximation error of neural network and the external disturbances the structure of the rbfnn under consideration is shown in fig 3 it is a fixed three layer network whose output is determined by specified hidden units in certain local respective fields it is well known that any sufficiently smooth function can be approximated by a suitably large network using various activation functions the basis functions in the hidden layer are typically chosen as gaussian function and can be expressed as 37 σ i x e x p x c i 2 b i 2 i 1 2 n where x is an n dimension input vector c i is the center vector with the same dimension as x b i is the variance of the basic function n is the number of hidden units in the hidden layer and denotes the euclidean norm the output of the rbfnn can be computed by the weighted sum method and given by 38 y i 1 n w i σ i x ε where w i is the weight connecting hidden

multiplication of a square matrix with a gl matrix of compatible dimension note that their products are all normal matrices shuzhi et al 1997 according to gl matrix characteristic it is observed that both m s q s and g s q s are functions of q s only and rbfnn are sufficient to model them the neural network approximations for the elements m i j q s of m s q s and g i q s of g s q s can be written

manipulator realizes the output of reference position x m r through the designed adaptive controller the tracking error of master manipulator position and reference position x m r convergence to be zero meanwhile the slave manipulator can track the location of the master manipulator at the same time the slave manipulator is initially located in a free position and when the slave manipulator moves to 1 5 m the tactile force signals are generated at 3s when the slave manipulator contacts with the target the slave manipulator still implements location tracking for the master manipulator and satisfies the equal force information between the master manipulator and the slave manipulator so that the position and force information of the master manipulator and the slave manipulator exactly have the same of the position and force the error of force tracking and position tracking is less than 1 and have no overshoot at the same time it can be seen that the convergence of the online tuning algorithms can be achieved fast enough from figss 10 11 we can conclude that the output parameter of the master adaptive law is bounded and the initial estimation value is not needed to be set which ensures the effective performance of the estimation and realizes stable control of the system the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively control the unknown

on the master manipulator in the x direction f h is set as square wave signal with 20 n amplitude and 20s period the simulation time is set as 40s and the simulation force position tracking curve controller curve uncertain approximation curve are shown in figss 12 18 respectively from the simulation curve the master slave manipulator can still meet the force position tracking effect after release of the master manipulator force at 20s the master and slave manipulators finally rest in the critical contact with the environment at a location of 1 5 m the slave manipulator can still guarantee the position tracking in the third simulation considering the complex task environment of the slave manipulator adding the perturbation in the mass of slave manipulator two joints to verify

concluded that the proposed slave controller can guarantee to make the slave manipulator joint position track the master manipulator very well the slave manipulator controller can effectively control the unknown nonlinear dynamic system of slave with robustness to parameter uncertainties and model changes it s concluded that the slave controller is suitable for underwater complex environment in order to verify the seniority and superiority of the designed controller new controller the model reference adaptive impedance control mraic proposed in literature sharifi et al 2017b and the pd like

and the force tracking and displacement tracking curves of the three controllers are illustrated in figs 23 and 24 as can be seen from figs 23 and 24 the proposed controller has the characteristics of rapidity and no static error for force tracking and position tracking which avoids oscillation result from external disturbances and superior to the other two controllers 5 experiment according to the sinusoidal signal square wave signal input force position tracking simulation and the comparison study of different control laws the proposed control law displays a good performance of force and position coordination consequently for the sake of brevity a single dof teleoperation experiment is achieved with the designed controller the whole structure connection diagram of teleoperation system with real time control is illustrated in fig 25 which is similar to teleoperation simulation model in fig 4 the single joint linkage is driven by the stepper motor to realize rotation and the angle sensor and the linkage are coaxially connected to achieve the rotation angle measurement a piezoelectric film type tactile force sensor is installed at the end of the linkage to realize the tactile force measurement the master controller realizes measurement of angle signals and tactile force signals through a d conversion at the same time realizes the slave manipulator environment force data reception through serial communication 0 sent by slave controller and sends the master joint position signal as the slave position tracking target through the serial communication 0 additionally the master controller sends the master tactile force the slave force and master joint position to the master computer matlab simulink environment via serial communication 1 to implement the master adaptive impedance control law calculation and the matlab simulink environment sends the calculated control law to the master controller through serial communication 1 so that the master controller receives the controller value and converts to pwm pulse to achieve master stepper motor control the transmission and reception of the serial communication whose baud rate 115200 includes communication protocol to achieve data recognition the slave controller obtains the master position signal through the serial communication 0 simultaneously sends the slave force to the master controller and realizes the measurement of the angle signal and the environmental force signal through a d conversion the slave controller sends the master position signal the slave position signal and the slave environment force signal to the slave computer matlab simulink environment through serial communication 2 to achieve slave controller law calculation and the slave controller law value is sent to the slave controller by slave matlab simulink environment through serial communication 2 to control slave stepper motor with pwm pulse performance because of the controller microcontroller unit mcu internal ram space limitation and the difficulty of control law transplantation the master and slave controllers only realize the data collection and transmission without the control law calculation and transmit the required data to the respective computer s matlab simulink environment to implement the control law calculation the matlab simulink has multi thread running conditions and has instrument control toolsbox to establish the serial communication model to realize data receiving and sending and then realize the interaction with the external environment completing the control law calculation and sending the control law value to the master and slave controller the matlab simulink environment does not require excessive operations for the serial data dealing it is only necessary to read the data in the receiving buffer and send the data to the sending buffer to complete the serial port communication operation since the speed and acceleration signals are not measured it is achieved directly through the matlab simulink environment calculation the components of the single joint teleoperation experiment are shown in fig 26 the master and slave manipulator controller boarder selection is of the same and the chip msp430f149 is used as mcu which has multiple a d conversion ports two serial communication model and the timer and pwm generation functions to support the experiment control the fsr402 piezoelectric thin film sensor is chosen as the tactile force sensor which is negatively correlated with the tactile force applying and through the experiment the resistance range of the finger force is 200 ω 2 kω and the force signal acquisition is realized by the series circuit pressure performance consider the a d conversion reference voltage of 2 5 v and the supply voltage of 3 3 v and 6 1 k ω resistor is selected to construct serial circuit and tactile force signal acquisition is achieved to collect the 6 1 k ω resistor of voltage value the precision conductive potentiometer is used to achieve joint angle measurement which is equivalent to a sliding rheostat to achieve 360 angle measurement the angle sensor s output precision is 0 1 the maximum resistance is 2 kω through 3 3 v power supply to achieve signal acquisition a d conversion achieves force and position signal acquisition as shown in fig 27 the ldx 335mg digital servo is selected as stepper motor to drive the linkage whose maximum output torque is 1 67n m and the output rotation joint range is 0 270 the stepper motor is powered by a lithium battery with 1500 ma capacity the stepper motor realizes the angle control by the pwm pulse generated by the microcontroller and the pwm pulse period is 20 ms with the pulse width range 0 5 ms 2 5 m s in order to gain a more direct sense of the soft or hard degree of slave manipulator grasping target during the experiment the acquisition of slave manipulator tactile force can be obtained by calculating the virtual force instead of the tactile force sensor measurement which avoids the problem of inaccurate measurement due to insufficient contact of piezoelectric thin film sensor in slave manipulator the slave manipulator tactile force f e is expressed as a function of angular displacement as shown in eq 83 where the number 200 is the reference surface angle with rotation angle reduction direction and k e is the virtual spring coefficient the displacement and tactile force of slave manipulator are of linear function relationship the larger the displacement the greater the tactile force similar to grasping a spring set different elasticity coefficients to achieve different rigid material objects and the operator can feel the soft of hard degree of slave manipulator grasping target 83 f e k e 200 q s q s 200 0 q s 200 the external uncertainty disturbance is given by carrying the blocks on the linkage the master and slave force can be denoted as f h and f e and f h and f e in the master impedance model eq 7 are respectively expressed as f h f h cos q m f h sinq m t and f e f e cos q s f e sinq s t in matlab simulink the experiment is set up according to fig 25 and apply the force on the master linkage force sensor recording the master and slave force and position dates and the curves are illustrated in figss 28 30 with different slave virtual spring elasticity coefficient set as k e 3 2 7 2 and 9 2 from figss 28 30 it can be concluded that the slave manipulator under the condition of tactile force still guarantees the position tracking of master manipulator which has the characteristics of fast response small overshoot the operator tactile force on the master manipulator ensures the coordination of the slave tactile force and ensures direct force perception of the operator finger when the force on master manipulator is released the force position coordination of master and slave manipulator is consistent and stays in the critical position of the grasping target as shown in figss 28 30 when the maximum tactile force signal 2500 mv is applied on the master manipulator the angle rotation range is from 197 118 at elasticity coefficient k e 3 2 to 197 164 at elasticity coefficient k e 9 2 and the reduction of the rotation angle range indicates that the hardness of the target change to be great therefore the whole system can realize the stiffness of the grasping target while realizing the force position coordination and it has the immersion feeling under the remote operation 6 conclusion this paper proposes a novel controller for the underwater manipulator

through the communication channel and the slave force interaction is feedback to the operator which makes the operator feels the direct operation of the remote object many scholars have proposed different schemes to improve the teleoperation system stability and transparency aziminejad et al 2008 the stability of bilateral teleoperation system independent of constant time delay is guaranteed using the passivity and scattering theories anderson and spong 1989 in order to guarantee passivity and velocity tracking the wave transformation idea is proposed to transmit the wave variable instead of the power variable to deal with the time delay sun et al 2014 a proportional derivative pd like controller applied to the delayed bilateral teleoperation system is proposed in face of position and force coordination with communication varying time delays slawiñski et al 2016 slawiñski and mut 2015 the four channel architecture is employed to achieve simultaneous position and force coordination in nonlinear teleoperation systems in mohammadi et al 2016 in the previous approaches the controllers for bilateral teleoperation systems are designed with the hypothesis that all the parameters of the master and the slave robots are known however it does not always hold because there exist modeling uncertainties and external disturbance in the application in addition the object parameters can not be accurately obtained during the interaction of the slave robot with the environment the adaptive control can handle these problems by adjusting the parameters in various systems liu et al 1999 several approaches for adaptive control of robot manipulators have been proposed in the presence of parameter uncertainties the indirect adaptive controllers based on tracking error are designed with sliding mode control in slotine and li gonzalez et al 1995 on the other hand the direct adaptive controllers based on prediction error for robot manipulators are designed using least squares estimation in middletone and goodwin 1986 for the teleoperation system with communication constant delay taking into account the uncertainty of the robot s kinetic parameters chopra proposed a passive adaptive control method to ensure the master slave robot position speed synchronization in free space chopra et al 2008 kim proposed a passive control algorithm for the networked robot system of uncertainties of model parameters and motion parameters and realized position tracking synchronization through adaptive control in kim and ahn 2013 however the variable time delay would cause disturbances to the control system xia liu designed a kind of adaptive controller based on peb position error based and stability was proved by lyapunov function and position of the convergence of the tracking error liu and tavakoli 2012 however it ignored the influence of joint friction changchun hua proposed neural network based adaptive position tracking controller for the bilateral teleoperation system with time delay hua et al 2013 but the outside uncertain disturbance would bring unstable of the control system yuanyuan proposed disturbance observer design yuan et al 2017a and optimal controller design yuan et al 2017b for the system matched disturbance and he put forward to a force reflection control scheme based on dynamic gain force observer with wave variable method for the time varying delayed teleoperation to achieve force position coordination yuan et al in some special application environment such as nuclear radiation teleoperation yu et al 2017 underwater teleoperation hirabayashi et al 2006 and clearance of mines teleoperation ryu et al 2005 the distance between the master and slave robot is short so that the communication time delay is not the dominant influence to the stability and transparency and can be ignored as a result the master and slave robots can be considered as two independent equipments the master robot can be regarded as a force feedback equipment to achieve force signal reproduction fang et al 2018 the common controller of force reproduction or called force tracking are impedance controller akdoğan et al 2018 and force position hybrid control wu et al 2017 whose essence is to adjust the robot displacement to achieve contact force adjustment dutta et al 2017 when the operator s tactile force on the master robot is less than the standard force the controller adjusts the position of the master robot to generate the motion of the opposite direction of the operator force thereby squeezing the operator s fingertip to increase force on the contrary if the operator s force is greater than the standard force signal the controller will make the robot generate the motion the same direction of the operator s force so as to release the operator s force to balance the standard force signal zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2017 osafo yeboah et al 2013 the slave robot can be considered as motion constraint position tracking robot of which the common controllers are fuzzy control zhou et al sliding mode control zhao et al 2018 and adaptive neural network control asl and janabi sharifi 2017 in order to achieve the

is adopted to directly approximate all parts of the manipulator dynamic model ge and hang 1996 the robust term with a proper update law is designed to suppress the error between the estimate model and the real model as well as the external disturbance so there is no need to obtain the slave manipulator dynamic true parameters the stability and asymptotic convergence of the closed loop system are established by the lyapunov theory at last the simulation results of two link manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effector of the proposed control method the teleoperation system has a good ability of force and position tracking this paper is inspired from mojtaba sharifi s work sharifi et al 2014 and the main advantage of the proposed control scheme is expressed as follows 1 the force

the reference trajectory x m r is the desired equilibrium trajectory to be tracked by the master manipulator end effector in the presence of operator force f h the model reference adaptive controller must asymptotically track the desired impedance model eq 7 by making the closed loop dynamics of the master system similar to the desired impedance model in order to achieve the position tracking of the manipulator end effector x m to the reference modeled desired trajectory response x m r the sliding mode variable is given as 8 s m x m λ 1 x m where x m x m x m r is the position tracking error

dynamic of master manipulator is known however model parameters of master manipulator can not be completely known m ˆ x m q m c ˆ x m q m q m g ˆ x m q m and d ˆ x m q m are corresponding estimates of the manipulator robot parameters respectively the master manipulator s rotation angle joint length is known that is to say the jacobian matrix j m is a known quantity the master controller τ x m in task space can be designed as follows 16 τ x m m ˆ x m q m x r λ 1 s m c ˆ x m q m q m x r g ˆ x m q m d ˆ x m q m f h j m t m ˆ m q m j m 1 x r λ 1 s m j m t c ˆ m q m q m m ˆ m q m j m 1 j m j m 1 x

be rewritten as 19 τ m y m η 1 η 2 q m q m θ ˆ m j m t f h where y m θ ˆ m is the parameterizations of the first four terms of eq 17 y m is the regressor matrix and θ ˆ m is the vector of estimated parameters of the system in the joint space the adaptation law is designed as composite adaptation method with the tracking error s m and prediction error e m s m is expressed as eq 8 and the prediction error e m is the error between the physical dynamics m m q m q m c m q m q m q m g m q m d m q m and the estimated physical dynamics m ˆ m q m q m c ˆ m q m q m q m g ˆ m q m d ˆ m q m however the term m m q m q m includes acceleration term q m that is unmeasurable a filtering dynamics can be used to eliminate the acceleration term let ω s be the impulse response that stabilizes the proper filter as shown in eq 20 20 ω s a s a where a is the bandwidth of the filter ω t a e a t is the impulse response of ω s convolving both sides of master dynamic in eq 1 by ω s yields to 21 0 t w

μ c m q m q m q m μ g m q m μ d m q m μ d μ consequently without acceleration term m m q m q m the left hand side of eq 21 can be rewritten in a new regressor performance as follows 23 y m t w m w q m q m θ m the above equation is a linear parameterization of the filtered manipulator dynamics where y m t is the filtered torque which can be obtained as 24 y m t 0 t ω t μ τ m μ j m t q m μ f h μ d μ moreover w m w t in eq 23 is the filter performance of regressor matrix y m which is defined in property 4 and can be expressed that w m w q m q m 0 t ω t μ y m μ d μ as a result we can conclude that w m w q m q m can be determined using available measurements of q m and q m and the acceleration q m is not required this is the main reason of using the first order filter for both sides of manipulator dynamics the parameter θ ˆ m is the estimated value of θ m and the estimated dynamics y ˆ m t of y m t can be written as 25 y ˆ m t w m w q m q m θ ˆ m as a result the filter performance of the prediction error e m t is defined as 26 e m t y ˆ m t y m t with the new regressor matrix w m w t the prediction error can be rewritten as 27 e m t w m w q m q m θ m consequently with the adaptation law bgf composite adaptation in the literature slotine liet al 1991 the adaptation law is defined as 28 θ ˆ m p m t t y m t t j m 1 s m w m w t r m t e m t where r m t is a uniformly positive definite weighting matrix indicating how much attention the adaptation law pays to the parameters information in the prediction error e m t and the adaptation gain p m t is a uniformly positive definite gain matrix determined by the techniques to be described below for simplicity r m t in eq 28 is defined as 29 r m t a 0 i m where a 0 is a positive constant and i m is the unity matrix the adaptation law employs an exponentially forgetting least squares gain update for p m t as 30 d d t p m 1 t β t p m 1 t w m w t w m w the variable forgetting factor β t is set as 31 β t β 0 1 p m t k 0 where β 0 and k 0 are respectively positive numbers respectively representing the maximum forgetting rate and the predetermined bounds of the gain matrix norm p m t the forgetting factor in eq 30 implies forgetting the data with a factor p m t is small reducing the forgetting speed if β 0 if p m t becomes larger and suspends forgetting if p m t reaches the specified upper bound the gain update in eq 30 guarantees that t 0 β t 0 and p m t k 0 i for any signal of w m w moreover β 1 0 such that t 0 β t β 1 if w m w is positive definite slotine liet al 1991 because when the tracking

positive define v 1 0 and its derivative eq 34 is negative define v 1 0 by selecting a 0 1 2 and noting that p m t is positive define and undate rule property t 0 β t 0 according to lyapunov stability theorem the above expression guarantees global stability and the global tracking convergence in the system using the proposed controller s m 0 a s t thus the tracking error converges to the surface of s m 0 the tracking error also converges to zero on the surface of s m 0 x m 0 and x m 0 as t therefore the master manipulator convergences to zero in the position tracking error under the desired impedance model 3 2 the slave control scheme the underwater manipulator as the slave manipulator directly operates the task object with the position tracking of the master and the end effector force transmitting to the master however the controller is difficult to design due to coupled nonlinearities parameter uncertainties resulting from the lack of knowledge of hydrodynamic coefficients self joint friction and external disturbance such as waves and currents for the slave manipulator s trajectory tracking the rbfnn are adopted to directly approximate all parts of the dynamic parameters through gl matrix and robust slide mode control with adaptation law is employed to suppress the approximation error of neural network and the external disturbances the structure of the rbfnn under

direction and f h is set as f h 10 1 sin 0 1 t the simulation time is set as 100s and the simulation results are shown in figss 5 11 figss 5 6 show the force and position curves in cartesian coordinate and figss 7 8 show the joint position and velocity curves fig 9 shows the control input curves of master and slave manipulator and figss 10 11 show the adaptive estimate value of uncertainty norm of master and slave manipulator as shown in figss 5 7 in the movement of free space and after contact with the target the slave manipulator can guarantee the position tracking of the master manipulator and the master manipulator satisfies the force tracking of the slave manipulator which guarantees force and position synchronization the desired impedance model of master manipulator realizes the output of reference position x m r through the designed adaptive controller the tracking error of master manipulator position and reference position x m r convergence to be zero meanwhile the slave manipulator can track the location of the master manipulator at the same time the slave manipulator is initially located in a free position and when the slave manipulator moves to 1 5 m the tactile force signals are generated at 3s when the slave manipulator contacts with the target the slave manipulator still implements location tracking for the master manipulator and satisfies the equal force information between the master manipulator and the slave manipulator so that the position and force information of the master manipulator and the slave manipulator exactly have the same of the position and force the error of force tracking and position tracking is less than 1 and have no overshoot at the same time it can be seen that the convergence of the online tuning algorithms can be achieved fast enough from figss 10 11 we can conclude that the output parameter of the master adaptive law is bounded and the initial estimation value is not needed to be set which ensures the effective performance of the estimation and realizes stable control of the system the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively control the unknown nonlinear dynamic system with robustness to parameter uncertainty and model changeness the norms of m s q s and m ˆ s q s c s q s q s and c ˆ s q s q s g s q s and g ˆ s q s are shown in fig 11 as can be seen they are all bounded which are attractive properties of the proposed controller in summary the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively control the unknown nonlinear dynamic system achieve small tracking errors and does not need to know the upper bound of any uncertainties and external disturbances in the second simulation applying the force signal f h on the master manipulator in the x direction f h is set as square wave signal with 20 n amplitude and 20s period the simulation time is set as 40s and the simulation force position tracking curve controller curve uncertain approximation curve are shown in figss 12 18 respectively from the simulation curve the master slave manipulator can still meet the force position tracking effect after release of the master manipulator force at 20s the master and slave manipulators finally rest in the critical contact with the environment at a location of 1 5 m the slave manipulator can still guarantee the position tracking in the third simulation considering the complex task environment of the slave manipulator adding the perturbation in the mass of slave manipulator two joints to verify the ability of the controller s robust set the joint manipulator as a function of time as m 1 1 0 1 sin t m 2 1 0 1 cos t the simulation curves are illustrated as figss 19 22 it can be obviously concluded that the proposed slave controller can guarantee to make the slave manipulator joint position track the master manipulator very well the slave manipulator controller can effectively control the unknown nonlinear dynamic system of slave with robustness to parameter uncertainties and model changes it s concluded that the slave controller is suitable for underwater complex environment in order to verify the seniority and superiority of the designed controller new controller the model reference adaptive impedance control mraic proposed in literature sharifi et al 2017b and the pd like controller proposed in literature liu et al 2017 are compared for the manipulator dynamic of eq 1 containing the joint friction and external disturbances applying 10 n force signal in the x direction and the force tracking and displacement tracking curves of the three controllers are illustrated in figs 23 and 24 as can be seen from figs 23 and 24 the proposed controller has the characteristics of rapidity and no static error for force tracking and position tracking which avoids oscillation result from external disturbances and superior to the other two controllers 5 experiment according to the sinusoidal signal square wave signal input force position tracking simulation and the comparison study of different control laws the proposed control law displays a good performance of force and position coordination consequently for the sake of brevity a single dof teleoperation experiment is achieved with the designed controller the whole structure connection diagram of teleoperation system with real time control is illustrated in fig 25 which is similar to teleoperation simulation model in fig 4 the single joint linkage is driven by the stepper motor to realize rotation and the angle sensor and the linkage are coaxially connected to achieve the rotation angle measurement a piezoelectric film type tactile force sensor is installed at the end of the linkage to realize the tactile force measurement the master controller realizes measurement of angle signals and tactile force signals through a d conversion at the same time realizes the slave manipulator environment force data reception through serial communication 0 sent by slave controller and sends the master joint position signal as the slave position tracking target through the serial communication 0 additionally the master controller sends the master tactile force the slave force and master joint position to the master computer matlab simulink environment via serial communication 1 to implement the master adaptive impedance control law calculation and the matlab simulink environment sends the calculated control law to the master controller through serial communication 1 so that the master controller receives the controller value and converts to pwm pulse to achieve master stepper motor control the transmission and reception of the serial communication whose baud rate 115200 includes communication protocol to achieve data recognition the slave controller obtains the master position signal through the serial communication 0 simultaneously sends the slave force to the master controller and realizes the measurement of the angle signal and the environmental force signal through a d conversion the slave controller sends the master position signal the slave position signal and the slave environment force signal to the slave computer matlab simulink environment through serial communication 2 to achieve slave controller law calculation and the slave controller law value is sent to the slave controller by slave matlab simulink environment through serial communication 2 to control slave stepper motor with pwm pulse performance because of the controller microcontroller unit mcu internal ram space limitation and the difficulty of control law transplantation the master and slave controllers only realize the data collection and transmission without the control law calculation and transmit the required data to the respective computer s matlab simulink environment to implement the control law calculation the matlab simulink has multi thread running conditions and has instrument control toolsbox to establish the serial communication model to realize data receiving and sending and then realize the interaction with the external environment completing the control law calculation and sending the control law value to the master and slave controller the matlab simulink environment does not require excessive operations for the serial data dealing it is only necessary to read the data in the receiving buffer and send the data to the sending buffer to complete the serial port communication operation since the speed and acceleration signals are not measured it is achieved directly through the matlab simulink environment calculation the components of the single joint teleoperation experiment are shown in fig 26 the master and slave manipulator controller boarder selection is of the same and the chip msp430f149 is used as mcu which has multiple a d conversion ports two serial communication model and the timer and pwm generation functions to support the experiment control the fsr402 piezoelectric thin film sensor is chosen as the tactile force sensor which is negatively correlated with the tactile force applying and through the experiment the resistance range of the finger force is 200 ω 2 kω and the force signal acquisition is realized by the series circuit pressure performance consider the a d conversion reference voltage of 2 5 v and the supply voltage of 3 3 v and 6 1 k ω resistor is selected to construct serial circuit and tactile force signal acquisition is achieved to collect the 6 1 k ω resistor of voltage value the precision conductive potentiometer is used to achieve joint angle measurement which is equivalent to a sliding rheostat to achieve 360 angle measurement the angle sensor s output precision is 0 1 the maximum resistance is 2 kω through 3 3 v power supply to achieve signal acquisition a d conversion achieves force and position signal acquisition as shown in fig 27 the ldx 335mg digital servo is selected as stepper motor to drive the linkage whose maximum output torque is 1 67n m and the output rotation joint range is 0 270 the stepper motor is powered by a lithium battery with 1500 ma capacity the stepper motor realizes the angle control by the pwm pulse generated by the microcontroller and the pwm pulse period is 20 ms with the pulse width range 0 5 ms 2 5 m s in order to gain a more direct sense of the soft or hard degree of slave manipulator grasping target during the experiment the acquisition of slave manipulator tactile force can be obtained by calculating the virtual force instead of the tactile force sensor measurement which avoids the problem of inaccurate measurement due to insufficient contact of piezoelectric thin film sensor in slave manipulator the slave manipulator tactile force f e is expressed as a function of angular displacement as shown in eq 83 where the number 200 is the reference surface angle with rotation angle reduction direction and k e is the virtual spring coefficient the displacement and tactile force of slave manipulator are of linear function relationship the larger the displacement the greater the tactile force similar to grasping a spring set different elasticity coefficients to achieve different rigid material objects and the operator can feel the soft of hard degree of slave manipulator grasping target 83 f e k e 200 q s q s 200 0 q s 200 the external uncertainty disturbance is given by carrying the blocks on the linkage the master and slave force can be denoted as f h and f e and f h and f e in the master impedance model eq 7 are respectively expressed as f h f h cos q m f h sinq m t and f e f e cos q s f e sinq s t in matlab simulink the experiment is set up according to fig 25 and apply the force on the master linkage force sensor recording the master and slave force and position dates and the curves are illustrated in figss 28 30 with different slave virtual spring elasticity coefficient set as k e 3 2 7 2 and 9 2 from figss 28 30 it can be concluded that the slave manipulator under the condition of tactile force still guarantees the position tracking of master manipulator which has the characteristics of fast response small overshoot the operator tactile force on the master manipulator ensures the coordination of the slave tactile force and ensures direct force perception of the operator finger when the force on master manipulator is released the force position coordination of master and slave manipulator is consistent and stays in the critical position of the grasping target as shown in figss 28 30 when the maximum tactile force signal 2500 mv is applied on the master manipulator the angle rotation range is from 197 118 at elasticity coefficient k e 3 2 to 197 164 at elasticity coefficient k e 9 2 and the reduction of the rotation angle range indicates that the hardness of the target change to be great therefore the whole system can realize the stiffness of the grasping target while realizing the force position coordination and it has the immersion feeling under the remote operation 6 conclusion this paper proposes a novel controller for the underwater manipulator teleoperation with model uncertainty and external disturbance in the master controller a new nonlinear model reference adaptive impedance controller with bgf composite adaptive law is designed for the master manipulator force tracking of the slave manipulator force the reference position in task space is obtained from the linear second order impedance model whose input is the error of the master

position the asymptotic tracking performance and global stability of the master system are proved using lyapunov stability theorem for the slave manipulator s position tracking a novel adaptive terminal sliding mode control based on rbfnn local approximation method is proposed the rbf network is adopted to directly approximate all parts of the manipulator dynamic model the adaptive control law with a proper update law is designed to suppress the error between the estimate model and the real model and the external disturbance and the stability and the stability and asymptotic convergence of the closed loop system are established by the lyapunov theory at last the simulation results of two link manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effector of the proposed control method additionally the single joint teleoperation experiment is done to verify the force position coordination performance the results show that the teleoperation system has a good ability of force and

23161,computational fluid dynamics cfd as early used in the design stage helps engineers to come up with the optimum design of a sail in a reasonable timeframe however traditional cfd tools are approximate and need to be validated when it comes to predicting the dynamic behaviour of non developable shape with high camber and massively detached flow around thin and flexible membranes some of these approximations are related to the implementation of the constitutive material characteristics and assumption of their isotropic properties while the sail aerodynamic performance is strongly influenced by the arrangement of sail panels as well as the orientation of the fibres in the composite structure the present paper offers a methodology that enhances the understanding of the influence of panel arrangement and fibre orientation on sail performance fluid structure interaction fsi in a symmetric spinnaker was studied through an integrated cfd csm computational structural mechanics

introduction it is of common knowledge that sail performance especially in terms of speed mainly depends on the boat the sails are designed for although hull design is considered as fundamentally important a further and equally important consideration must be attributed to sail optimization as playing a key role to improve sailboats dynamic performance the selection of a high performance and lightweight material with an effective arrangement of sail panels and distribution of fibres might considerably improve the dynamic performance of a sail and the entire boat clauss and heisen 2005 braun and imas 2008 beyond the sailor s contribution as a result of the improvement in the production technology synthetic fibres have been developed for manufacturing different types of sails polyester is considered to be the best all around fibre for most woven and laminated fabrics as it is durable strong and supremely formable however after the introduction of polyester pet many new and performant fibres have become available including aramid carbon certran dyneema kevlar pen pentex spectra technora twaron vectran and zylon pbo the strength of these fibres can create a far superior composite fabric and progressively stronger and lighter sails mallick 2007 manikandan and rajkumar 2016 yan 2016 along with new high performance cloths nowadays sail designers and researchers use cfd optimization criteria by taking advantage of the direction of the greatest fibre tension pearson 2015 viola et al 2015 cella et al 2017 computational technique such as reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations rans has been used as early as 1996 to evaluate the forces in fluid structure interaction fsi hedges et al 1996 richter et al 2003 demonstrated the necessity to couple a rans solver with a structural program to solve the interaction between the sail and the flow field creating a virtual wind tunnel the main hurdle when applying rans solvers for practical analysis of sail performance is the fact that the sail s flying shape is not known á priori while the sail designer generates the design shape of the sail using cad like sail lofting programs this design shape markedly differs from the sail s flying shape the flow forces of which shall be predicted the manner in which the sail stretches and deforms in various directions appears to be greatly influenced by the material anisotropy and fiber orientation spalatelu lazar et al 2008 this is especially true for large sails i e a spinnaker whose surfaces easily reach and exceed 5 of area deformation motta et al 2014 in sail design the specific strength ss which is defined as the strength to specific weight ratio is often used to compare various woven fabrics and laminates generally at a pre set geometry the higher the ss value the better the considered performance of the sail moreover a fair comparison of sail performance between different sails cannot be drawn disregarding the arrangement of sail panels and distribution of fibres thus it is important that along the weft or bias threads at a 45 angle the sail stretches accordingly and maintains its shape in recent years many experimental characterization methods and numerical models were developed aimed at establishing the constitutive characteristics of woven fabrics and laminates in particular a significant amount of attention has been paid to investigating bias extension with experimental tests badel et al 2008 lee et al 2008 and numerical models cuomo et al 2016 dell isola et al 2016 due to its non linear behaviour only a realistic sail s flying shape evaluation can provide the information necessary to compare different design shapes arrangement of panels and materials thus lately different tools and methods have been employed to evaluate sail s flying shape performance during navigation or in real and virtual wind tunnel some of the examples include coordinate measuring machine ranzenbach and kleene 2002 the optical profilometry technique

aerodynamic force deduction using pressure and shape measurement le pelley et al 2012 motta et al 2014 turbulence evaluation with detached eddy simulations viola et al 2014 in literature however there is no shared method to evaluate the influence of fibre orientation and panel arrangement on sail performance the available literature lacks mechanical characterization of nowadays most commonly used sailcloths except for a few distinct types of cloth and effects of their surface treatment benfratello et al 2013 zouari 2014 the present study proposes a replicable procedure in order to enhance the understanding of the influence of panel arrangement and fibre distribution on sail performance fluid structure interaction fsi was studied through an integrated cfd csm analysis the case study of a symmetric tri radial spinnaker in nylon superkote 75 sk75 and standing rigging of an elan 31 cruiser racer offered tangible results to support the methodology by validating it with experimental data

stress transport sst turbulence model digital photogrammetry was used to experimentally validate flying shape obtained in cfd csm analysis the paper is divided into 4 sections excluding introduction the first section is devoted to the experimental mechanical characterization of the nylon sk75 the second section deals with cfd csm model construction and fsi aeroelastic analysis in the third section the simulated flying shape is validated with digital photogrammetry acquisition and the performance of the spinnaker in terms of drive and side force is studied for different fibre orientation and panel arrangement final considerations and conclusions are drawn in section four 2 sailcloth characterization the evaluation of sailcloths anisotropic mechanical behaviour was carried out experimentally evaluating the 4 engineering elastic constants ewe ewa gwe wa and νwe wa byström et al 2000 renzsch et al 2008 elastic moduli e and g poisson s ratio ν proof stress ss and damping factor d eq of nylon sk75 were evaluated by means of experimental static and cyclic tensile test and analytical analyses no deterioration of cloth due to weathering or flogging was taken into account table 1 outlines the main properties and geometric characteristics of the synthetic nylon sk75 at normal ambient conditions temperature of 20 c and absolute pressure of 1 atm the third column shows the mass of a square meter of cloth the fourth and fifth columns in brackets report the density of the matrix and the density of cloth composite ρ cloth respectively this last was measured as a mass volume ratio by using an electro optical single pan precision balance gibertini mod 704 n with sensibility of 0 1 mg fig 1 a for mass measurement and a graduated cylinder with distilled water fig 1b for volume measurement the sixth and seventh columns report the measured thickness t mea and the equivalent thickness t eq respectively in fact in order to perform an accurate stress experimental it is important to determine the real cloth density and the corresponding equivalent thickness these two parameters are related by the following equation 1 t e q 10 w c l o t h a s ρ c l o t h where w c l o t h is the weight of the fabric measured in grams and a is its area measured in cm2 fig 2 2 1 experimental set up static tensile tests were carried out on the nylon sk75 samples in weft and warp directions as well as in bias direction at 45 to the weft using a zwickroell z100 twin column tensile testing machine and testxpert v11 02 software fig 3 a cyclic tensile test was performed on the sailcloth samples in weft direction using instron 8501 servohydraulic dynamic testing machine and fasttrack 2 software fig 3b both types of tests were conducted at normal ambient conditions according to uni en iso 13934 1 2000 a sufficient lateral pressure was applied through rubber coated grip surfaces to prevent specimen slippage tab length l t fig 3c was properly evaluated according to the tightening pressure as reported below 2 l t σ u t e q 2 τ c where teq represents the equivalent thickness σ u is the ultimate tensile strength of the material and τ c represents the ultimate shear strength of the adhesive cyanoacrylate loxeal 43s substituting the corresponding values to the materials used an l t 50 mm is obtained the adopted value is l t 70 mm five samples were tested in each fibre direction warp weft and bias the tests were performed at different testing rates v1 0 2 mm min v2 2 mm min v3 20 mm min the samples were preloaded at 20 n and load and displacement were recorded with a sampling points 2000 pts in all the tests thus nominal engineering stress load divided by the equivalent cross sectional area and nominal strain were evaluated all the tests were performed until failure as a result ultimate tensile strength and maximum strain were assessed too in order to consider negligible the effect of the off axis tensile response strain was evaluated in the central area of the specimen fig 3d and 3e report the sailcloth samples oriented in weft and bias direction respectively 2 2 constitutive characteristics of sailcloths each curve which interpolates the tests carried out on five samples is obtained by discretizing within the same number of sampling points 2000 pts the tests carried out and calculating at each nominal strain value the mean value m and standard deviation σ of stress the standard deviationσ provides information concerning dispersion of the results as well as variability of curve characteristics the area under the curve of distribution of m 3σ and m 3σ in fact statistically contains 99 73 of the data independent of the number of tests conducted fig 4 a shows nominal stress values of the five tests at 12 sampling points the curves m 3σ m 3σ and the interpolation curve of the mean values in weft direction fig 4b outlines the stress values of the five tests at 13 sampling points the curves m 3σ m 3σ and the interpolation curve of the mean values in bias direction the samples with the fibers oriented in this direction shows an highest dispersion of the results with a standard deviation of less than 2 5 table 2 highlights the σ deviation mean values and σ deviation maximum values for the sailcloth in weft warp and bias tests in fig 5 the tensile test mean value results are reported in terms of nominal engineering stress versus nominal strain curves consist of three evident different zones an initial linear elastic region followed by the second elastic plastic region with a downward concavity and the third zone after which the cloth yielded the elastic zone was used to evaluate elastic constants the lower elastic range limit was set at the starting point of the curves preloaded at 20 n the upper limit proof stress was taken in stress strain curve in correspondence to a value of stress equal to 10 of ultimate tensile strength through cyclic tests fig 8 it was found that under this load the values of the cloth remain within elastic range the sailcloth young s moduli e we was evaluated as the gradients of linear regression straight line in this elastic regions fig 6 the simple regression straight line 3 σ α ε β was calculated minimizing the expression 4 e i 1 n α ε i β σ i where ε i σ i are the n pair of sampling points 200 pts in the elastic region using testing rates lower than 20 mm min nylon showed a brittle fibre fracture an angled gage middle agm failure occurred with a well evident edge separation in the central part of the specimen fig 7 the behaviour in bias direction was distinctly different from that in warp and weft direction confirming little sailcloth orthotropy even in this case after the identification of the effective linear elastic zone the curve gradient supplies the young s modulus in the hypothesis that deformations remain in the field the other two elastic constants ν wa we and g we wa necessary for the complete characterization of the anisotropic mechanical behaviour of sailcloths have been calculated from the definition of poisson s ratio 5 and from the timoshenko theory timoshenko et al 1951 6 5 ν w a w e ε w e ε w a 6 g w

warp directions respectively the shear modulus g wewa was calculated from the elastic properties obtained in tensile tests performed in weft and bias directions equation 6 provide an approach to the calculation of the shear moduli based on stiffness tensor transformations tests agarwal and broutman 1990 table 3 shows values of the maximum tensile strength poisson s ratio young s modulus in weft warp and bias direction and shear modulus for the nylon sk75 under analysis young s modulus values in bias direction are used as reference values in numerical analyses and to calculate the shear modulus g wewa the specific strength and the maximum strain are reported in table 4 due to its limited thickness nylon presented high specific strength the stiffness of the fabric regardless of the thickness used in the sail was calculated with the formula 7 k x e x 100 a s 200 w i t h x w e w a o r b i where 200 is the sailcloth sample length in mm and 100 is a s conversion factor in table 4 the sailcloth stiffness in weft direction is shown dissipated energy per cycle w d and equivalent damping factor coefficient d eq was evaluated by cyclic tensile tests cyclic tests were performed using instron 8501 testing machine and specimens with the same geometry of those utilized for static tensile tests elongations and strain were measured by means of strain gauges length 15 mm placed in the central area of the specimen the cyclic behaviour of sailcloths is governed by the adopted maximum load and frequency in cycles with small maximum loads and low frequency deformations are insignificant in order to obtain evaluable deformations specimens have been subjected to fluctuating loads δ f m a x of 20 of ultimate tensile load and a displacement rate equal to 50 mm min benfratello et al 2013 under these conditions the behaviour was quite variable during the first cycles and was regularly repeated only after about thirty cycles in fig 8a cyclic test in weft direction with δ f m a x 45 n preload 20 n and displacement rate equal to 50 mm min 0 7 hz is outlined in the areas where the cycles are regularly repeated the dissipated energy per cycle w d j cycle and the equivalent elastic energy w s j cycle green and blue areas respectively in fig 8b have been determined these two values allow determining the equivalent damping factor coefficient d eq by using the following formula otaghsara et al 2009 baghaei et al 2010 nyoni and brook 2010 8 d e q w d 4 πw s the equivalent damping factor coefficient decreases with frequency f and is proportional to the square of the maximum elongation δ l m a x just like the deformation energy as described in calì et al 2017a b after thirty cycles a slightly different young s modulus e we cyclic was measured fourth column of table 5 3 setup of aeroelastic analysis the setup of cfd csm aeroelastic analysis is illustrated below referring to a tri radial symmetric spinnaker accurately described in section 4 the selection of such a sail with a large surface area few and simple constraints and almost unlimited number of degrees of freedom is considered to be particularly suitable for the study of the flexibility of the sailcloth in downwind conditions the spinnaker operates in an aerodynamic polar region behind the stall in conditions in which the orders of magnitude of drag begin to be comparable to the maximum lift capability of the sail 3 1 sail structural model the sail is discretized by triangular membrane elements their structural deformation calculation according to the method of arcaro arcaro 2004 renzsch et al 2008 assumes homogeneous and orthotropic linear elastic material the geometry of a triangular element is defined by the nodes i 1 2 3 the angles at the nodes αi and the sides l i opposite the nodes see fig 9 at each computational step during the interaction process nodes are subjected to the air flow forces the structural deformation calculation adopted enables the insertion of the linear effects of young s modulus in weft and warp directions calculated in paragraph 2 as well as the equivalent damping factor d eq calculated with 8 in the following explanation it is assumed that the side l 3 of the triangular element is oriented in the x axis direction of the reference system using the green strain definition the strain on the edge i is 9 ε i l i δ l i 2 l i 2 2 l i 2 the strain ε in an arbitrary direction forming an angle θ with x axis is calculated from 10 ε c 2 ε x x s 2 ε y y 2 c s ε x y with c cos θ and s sin θ and the strain vector along the arbitrary direction equals 11 ε ˆ t ε where 12 ε ˆ ε 11 ε 22 2 ε 13 ε ε x x ε y y 2 ε x y t c 2 s 2 2 c s s 2 c 2 2 c s 2 c s 2 c s c 2 s 2 in particular the strain vector along the three edge of the triangular

configuration of the sail is calculated from the minimum condition of the total potential energy for the vector of the nodal displacements x and the vector of the flow forces acting on the nodes f the total potential energy is 18 e t o t e l e m e n t s ϕ x f t x and thus the equilibrium condition is 19 e l e m e n t s ϕ x f 0 this non linear system of equations is solved by a quasi newton iterative procedure embedded into the global ranse iteration giving the displacements x of all nodes the maximum number of iterations is set to 1000 and the accuracy for force convergence is set to 0 001 without discretizing panels individually the spinnaker was divided into four parts in each part element orientation approximates the arrangement of sail panels fig 10 in parts 1 and 2 the x axis of triangular elements has been oriented longitudinally whereas in parts 3 and 4 the x axis has been oriented 45 o 45 with respect to the longitudinal axis of the sail according to the tri radial direction of the panel fig 16a on the entire sail surface 1150 triangular elements are used higher stiffness values proportional to the thickness have been attributed at the head and clews of the sail to take into account the reinforcements 3 2 fluid dynamic configuration a 70 m tall structured multiblock hexahedral mesh was generated the domain was extended about 100 m in front and on the sides of the isolated sail a flat inlet boundary was located 70 m behind the sail fig 11 the grid was generated with the view of being adopted unchanged in all flow conditions considered in this study the outlet boundary was dimensioned and positioned in order to include the sail wake in a wide range of angles to be investigated the vertical distribution of the cell layers from the ground was defined in order to better represent the wind boundary layer profile which was modelled according to the following formula larsson and eliansson 1997 20 v t z v t z r e f z z r e f α where v t z is the wind speed and z r e f is the reference eight usually 10 m the parameter α ranges between 1 14 and 1 7 the angle between the wind and the sail is varied in the computations updating the components of the wind velocity vectors at the inlet boundary according to the scheme reported in fig 12 three levels of meshes named for simplicity coarse medium and fine were generated in order to perform a sensitivity analysis on the grid dimension the sizes were approximately little more than half million of cells for the coarse 4 5 million for the medium and 15 million for the fine one the height of the first layer of cells on the wall was dimensioned in order to adopt wall function formulations maintain a range of y between 30 and 100 in the attached regions on the second level of mesh and for a wind speed ranging from 7 to 20 knots a more accurate technique would suggest solving the boundary layer by maintaining y lower than unity in the view of the authors however the grid cells saving the opportunity this strategy allows justifies the choice according to the following considerations a leading edge separation with a potential reattachment at low angle of incidences is always expected even if a deeper verification might be beneficial solving the boundary layer should not be decisive in guaranteeing the accuracy of the fluid dynamic solution in these conditions the accurate estimation of high lift performances is still a challenging task for numerical models it appears then more useful in the economy of the computations to invest in increasing the grid cells clustering on the wall surface respect to rise its layering to solve the boundary layer spinnaker exhibits large separated regions which involve unsteadiness in the flow the solver convergence histories are then affected by this unsteadiness or in general by irregularities the only extraction of the last value could then provide misleading information a routine able to perform a more critical evaluation of the solutions was applied it consists in extracting a linearized interpolation of a selected portion of the convergence history in evaluating its slope and in extracting a value applying opportune constraints in order to reject unacceptable solutions fig 13 reports an example of how this filter works the grid sensitivity analysis was performed with a wind speed equal to 20 knots at a height of 10 m and an angle of 135 with respect to the symmetry plane of the sail the geometry is assumed to be rigid no elastic model was activated the computations consisted in steady fully turbulent rans analyses in which the sail drag and lift forces are extracted referring to the freestream direction as formerly described drag and lift forces are used in csm analysis to calculate sail deflection cfd simulation is repeated with deflected geometry in turn with structural calculation until force convergence is reached the analyses do not model a real sailing condition the boat is not moving and the sail is assumed to be fixed to be coherent with the experimental measurements performed with the boat moored in the harbor reported in the next section apparent and true wind speed apparent and true wind angle then coincide these will be further simply referred to as wind and angle in this condition no twist is present in the inlet velocity profile so there is no ambiguity in the definition of a reference velocity direction for aerodynamic forces fig 18c the reference for wind angle is the symmetry plane of a non deformed spinnaker the two equation k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model of menter 1994 was used wall functions were applied to model the wall boundary layer the three contour plots of fig 14 highlight the evolution of the flow around the rigid sail estimated adopting the three levels of grid the streamlines on the surface evidence the shear stress direction on the sail all numerical configurations estimated a complete stalled condition a small region of attached flow is estimated adopting finer grids and its extension increases with the grid dimension this effect contributes to justify the slightly lower drag and higher lift evaluated adopting the fine grid table 6 reports the numerical solutions of the analysis the third and the fifth columns indicate the difference in percentage between the first two levels of mesh with respect to the finest the force values are extracted according to the filter described above figs 15 and 16 plot the drag convergence histories and the solution of the grid sensitivity analysis respectively the maximum evaluated difference between the solutions is the order of 2 6 the medium grid provided a solution only around half percent different from the solution obtained adopting a mesh three times larger according to the unsteady nature of the separated flow and observing the entity of the oscillations in the convergence histories the choice of the medium grid seems to be the most reasonable compromise to generate averaged forces by a steady analysis the high robustness and the very low computational effort required adopting the coarse grid suggest however considering the uncertainty entities it provides in the estimation of the forces of a completed stalled sail as acceptable for preliminary analyses and if a large number of computations have to be performed the use of finer meshes can be demanded in a final verification stage in cases where high accuracy level is required or can be limited to cases in which deep analyses of local phenomena have to be carried out furthermore the qualitative evaluation of the flow field computed by the three numerical configurations fully justify in the view of the authors its adoption if a fully separated flow condition is expected the use of finer meshes can be demanded in the final verification stage in cases where high accuracy level is required or can be limited to cases in which deep analyses of local phenomena have to be carried out 3 3 solvers coupling for fsi analysis the structural finite element fe model was implemented in the commercial code ansys mechanical apdl the fluid dynamic solution was provided by fluent the solvers coupling for fsi analysis was implemented in ansys workbench environment ansys inc 2013 user s manual the procedure consisted in iterating between the two solutions in the so called two way coupling method the computation began with the cfd analysis on the undeformed shape of the sail the pressure distribution on the surface is used as load for the structural model adopting a mapping procedure implemented in the fluent solver to transfer the solutions from cfd to the fem grid the interpolation algorithm adopted was based on 0 order interpolation skim the static computations continues adapting the cfd domain according to deformation estimated by the structural solver the cfd mesh deformation was performed by the internal algorithm mesh morphing method the iterations progress until a stationary condition of forces and deformations sail flying shape was reached fig 17 shows the scheme of the two way fsi analysis procedure 4 results and discussion the described aeroelastic numerical model was adopted to evaluate the impact that two typical panels arrangement layouts commonly utilized in spinnaker manufacturing have on the flying shape of the sail the activity is performed in two steps the capability of the fsi model to properly evaluate the sail flying shape is validated against experimental measurements a set of numerical aeroelastic analyses is then performed setting up the structural numerical models according to the studied panel arrangement the aim is to verify if and how the two structural solutions affect the aerodynamic performance of the sail 4 1 assessment of flying shape estimation the experimental setup consisted in measuring the flying shape of nylon sk75 tri radial symmetric spinnaker by a digital photogrammetry technique the spinnaker type heavy runner s4 is an integral part of elan 31 a 9 m long cruiser racer produced by the sail maker banks sails naples with a surface area of 60 m2 subject of previous studies conducted by the authors of the present paper martorelli et al 2014 calì et al 2017a b the sail is fixed to the yacht only by the head the tack and by two sheets length of about 6 m connecting sail s clews to the boat fig 18 the procedure consisted in capturing the 3d position of markers located on the sail surface and on the rig they are placed in rows at different heights on the sail so that the various form lines can be reconstructed and thus the interpolated surface that describes the actual flying shape can be calculated fig 19 a fig 19c offers a schematic representation of the acquisition s experimental setup three digital cameras go pro hero 3 black with a resolution of 12 mpixels placed on the wharf were used to completely include the luff or leech and half of the foot in the picture in this way the three photographs had more points in common and each point of the grid was captured in at least 2 photographic images during the simultaneously triggered acquisition the wind velocity measured at an height of 10 m was 7 0 0 3 knots and the wind angle estimated was 185 0 5 for major details on acquisition phase and calibration of the cameras refer to müller and graf 2009 and deparday et al 2016a b respectively the acquired photos were processed with software photomodeller pro by eos systems inc from the detected accurate cloud points a 3d polygonal mesh surface of the spinnaker was constructed the final mesh was optimized border regularization using the automatic fixing tool as described by baronio baronio et al 2016 the overlap between the reconstructed surface and the sail s flying shape surface obtained by fsi simulation was evaluated by measuring the variations in normal direction to the surfaces connecting the two digital surfaces with the closest point algorithm kraus 2000 eos systems 2015 the distance between them was minimized a deviation average distance of 13 mm a standard deviation of 20 mm and a max absolute deviation of 28 mm were obtained fig 20 table 7 shows the main geometrical parameters of the acquired and simulated sail s surface flying shape in particular the characteristic geometric values girth rope and arrow are compared in correspondence with four key cross sections base ¼ ½ ¾ fig 21 4 2 evaluation of panels arrangements performance the following results are obtained by analyzing the sail s flying shapes using experimentally measured mechanical characteristics of nylon cf section 2 the spinnaker s flying shapes were examined at full scale for the boat on a run angle 180 and for the boat on a broad reach angle 165 angle 150 and angle 135 at three wind longitudinal velocities 7 knots 3 6 m s the same of the photogrammetry acquisition 15 knots 7 72 m s and 20 knots 10 29 m s this corresponds to a reynolds number based on the square root of the sail surface area variable between 2 1 e 05 and 2 1 e 06 in the simulations has been set a value of maximum wind turbulence of 2 and a turbulence length scale to 0 1 the profile of the freestream wind boundary layer was defined according to equation 20 as an initial investigation a simulation of spinnaker s flying shapes were replicated under the same wind and angle conditions of the photogrammetry acquisition for both the full tri radial original design panel arrangement from now named opa and a modified panel arrangement mpa in the mpa structural model the radial head arrangement of sail panels was setup in order to have a radial distribution of the panels in the upper part of the sail and a cross cut in the lower part of the sail fig 22 this panel arrangement even being structurally less efficient still presents undeniable advantages in manufacturing in this way two different sail membrane models with different stiffness matrices 16 were taken into account during the fsi simulations table 8 contrasts the main geometric parameters and drive f r and side f lat forces on sail s flying shapes with opa and mpa for the boat on a run angle 180 and wind 7 knots in fig 23 are reported however the maximum principal stress and elastic strain in opa and mpa still for wind 7 knots and angle 180 the results confirmed that tri radial opa is quite close in the middle and lower part girth rope and arrow at ¼ and half height appear smaller than in the mpa the maximum principal stresses and the principal elastic strain in the central zone of the sail are higher in the mpa fig 23b and d in opa the sail panels and fibre orientation is in accordance with the load lines as long as the spinnaker is running f r and f lat forces appear to be similar for the sails with the two different arrangement also in the simulation up to wind 20 knots there seem to be very few apparent differences seem to emerge fig 24 a neglecting the minor local instability phenomena the main generated force is the drag which completely converts into f r comparing the simulation of opa to mpa for the boat on a broad reach angle 165 angle 150 and angle 135 however more interesting results are obtained and the influence of fibre orientation and panel arrangement on sail performance becomes evident in figs 24b and 25a the opa and mpa sail s flying shapes in terms of geometric characteristic values girth rope and arrow and f r and f lat forces were compared for wind 20 knots angle 165 and wind 20 knots angle 150 respectively in fig 25b the opa and mpa sail s flying shapes in terms of geometric characteristic values girth rope and arrow and f r and f lat forces were compared for wind 20 knots angle 135 also a qualitative streamline flow around the spinnaker s flying shape in ¼ horizontal plane is presented in the same figures figs 24 and 25 the figures show that the separated flow generates a gradually increasing lift force moving from angle 165 to angle 135 thus significantly contributing to the formation of the complete f r analysing the characteristic geometric values in the key cross sections moving from angle 165 to angle 135 as expected it quickly becomes evident that during the deformation the spinnaker loses its characteristic symmetry and the luff side extends more than the one that acts as a leech especially at half height and for angle 150 such phenomena appear increasingly evident in both sail with opa and mpa sail in fig 26 the f r and f lat for opa and mpa sail were compared the differences between opa and mpa grow along with the increase in wind speed at every wind speed the wind angle which provides the best performance in terms of drive force is 150 the comparison of f r and f lat for opa and mpa sail with wind 20 knots in polar diagram is shown in fig 27 the aerodynamic performance of the sails with different panel arrangement can be immediately compared by plotting them in the form of f r f lat ratio at each point as shown in fig 28 shear stress indicates clearly a non optimum fibre alignment in mpa fig 29 in mpa in fact there is greater stress and wrinkle and drape are more visible these plots provide important information about the quality of the panelling alignment with loadlines the results outlined below allow making a comparison of sail performance the results are in agreement with the data recorded in literature deparday et al 2016a b motta et al 2014 and with the experimental tabular data for the forces as well as the flying shapes made available on www yru kiel de or www fluidengsol com renzsch and graf 2013 in particular the values of shear stress drive and side force show off only irrelevant difference with renzsch tabular data with the aim to evaluate the influence of orthotropic characteristics on sail performance a comparison between nylon and a hypothetical sailcloth material with evident orthotropic characteristics e we 3910 mpa e wa 2800 mpa for wind 20 knots and angle 150 is performed the comparison was studied for the tri radial opa fig 30 shows streamlines in correspondence of spinnaker half height for nylon and the sail with orthotropic material table 9 shows characteristic geometric values girth rope and arrow in correspondence with the four key cross sections base ¼ ½ ¾ for nylon and the sail with orthotropic material such a comparison allows evincing that the sail made of sailcloth with major different mechanical characteristics in warp and weft directions did not retain the designed shape and delivered inconsistent performance depending on wind velocity the f r has lower average value and at different wind speed the flying shape is very variable it can be concluded that the effects of the mechanical characteristics in warp and weft directions deform the sail differently in particular the sail is smaller in the upper area girth rope and arrow at half and ¾ height appear shorter than in the sail made of nylon also the vortex growth around the sail exhibits differences 5 conclusions the paper presents a methodology that enhances the understanding of fibre orientation and panel arrangement on flying shapes and sail performance through a triangular membrane element formulation the aeroelastic effects on the sail were numerically investigated coupling fluid dynamic and structural analysis a

23161,computational fluid dynamics cfd as early used in the design stage helps engineers to come up with the optimum design of a sail in a reasonable timeframe however traditional cfd tools are approximate and need to be validated when it comes to predicting the dynamic behaviour of non developable shape with high camber and massively detached flow around thin and flexible membranes some of these approximations are related to the implementation of the constitutive material characteristics and assumption of their isotropic properties while the sail aerodynamic performance is strongly influenced by the arrangement of sail panels as well as the orientation of the fibres in the composite structure the present paper offers a methodology that enhances the understanding of the influence of panel arrangement and fibre orientation on sail performance fluid structure interaction fsi in a symmetric spinnaker was studied through an integrated cfd csm computational structural mechanics

introduction it is of common knowledge that sail performance especially in terms of speed mainly depends on the boat the sails are designed for although hull design is considered as fundamentally important a further and equally important consideration must be attributed to sail optimization as playing a key role to improve sailboats dynamic performance the selection of a high performance and lightweight material with an effective arrangement of sail panels and distribution of fibres might considerably improve the dynamic performance of a sail and the entire boat clauss and heisen 2005 braun and imas 2008 beyond the sailor s contribution as a result of the improvement in the production technology synthetic fibres have been developed for manufacturing different types of sails polyester is considered to be the best all around fibre for most woven and laminated fabrics as it is durable strong and supremely formable however after the introduction of polyester pet many new and performant fibres have become available including aramid carbon certran dyneema kevlar pen pentex spectra technora twaron vectran and zylon pbo the strength of these fibres can create a far superior composite fabric and progressively stronger and lighter sails mallick 2007 manikandan and rajkumar 2016 yan 2016 along with new high performance cloths nowadays sail designers and researchers use cfd optimization criteria by taking advantage of the direction of the greatest fibre tension pearson 2015 viola et al 2015 cella et al 2017 computational technique such as reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations rans has been used as early as 1996 to evaluate the forces in fluid structure interaction fsi hedges et al 1996 richter et al 2003 demonstrated the necessity to couple a rans solver with a structural program to solve the interaction between the sail and the flow field creating a virtual wind tunnel the main hurdle when applying rans solvers for practical analysis of sail performance is the fact that the sail s flying shape is not known á priori while the sail designer generates the design shape of the sail using cad like sail lofting programs this design shape markedly differs from the sail s flying shape the flow forces of which shall be predicted the manner in which the sail stretches and deforms in various directions appears to be greatly influenced by the material anisotropy and fiber orientation spalatelu lazar et al 2008 this is especially true for large sails i e a spinnaker whose surfaces easily reach and exceed 5 of area deformation motta et al 2014 in sail design the specific strength ss which is defined as the strength to specific weight ratio is often used to compare various woven fabrics and laminates generally at a pre set geometry the higher the ss value the better the considered performance of the sail moreover a fair comparison of sail performance between different sails cannot be drawn disregarding the arrangement of sail panels and distribution of fibres thus it is important that along the weft or bias threads at a 45 angle the sail stretches accordingly and maintains its shape in recent years many experimental characterization methods and numerical models were developed aimed at establishing the constitutive characteristics of woven fabrics and laminates in particular a significant amount of attention has been paid to investigating bias extension with experimental tests badel et al 2008 lee et al 2008 and numerical models cuomo et al 2016 dell isola et al 2016 due to its non linear behaviour only a realistic sail s flying shape evaluation can provide the information necessary to compare different design shapes arrangement of panels and materials thus lately different tools and methods have been employed to evaluate sail s flying shape performance during navigation or in real and virtual wind tunnel some of the examples include coordinate measuring machine ranzenbach and kleene 2002 the optical profilometry technique that measures free surface deformations using fringe pattern projection cobelli et al 2009 cameras in wind tunnel tests renzsch and graf 2013 laser measuring tools like lidar a time of flight radar to detect flying shapes fossati et al 2015a b strain measurements ferreira et al 2017 other papers however study sail performance by recording pressure and stress measurements total aerodynamic forces and loads by means of sailing dynamometers hochkirch 2000 masuyama and fukasawa 2009 combined sail and rig shape recognition system using imaging techniques vspars le pelley and modral 2008 determination of the pressure distributions on the sails graves et al 2008 augier et al 2012 real time velocity prediction program le pelley and richards 2011 influence of rigging bergsma et al 2012 aerodynamic force deduction using pressure and shape measurement le pelley et al 2012 motta et al 2014 turbulence evaluation with detached eddy simulations viola et al 2014 in literature however there is no shared method to evaluate the influence of fibre orientation and panel arrangement on sail performance the available literature lacks mechanical characterization of nowadays most commonly used sailcloths except for a few distinct types of cloth and effects of their surface treatment benfratello et al 2013 zouari 2014 the present study proposes a replicable procedure in order to enhance the understanding of the influence of panel arrangement and fibre distribution on sail performance fluid structure interaction fsi was studied through an integrated cfd csm analysis the case study of a symmetric tri radial spinnaker in nylon superkote 75 sk75 and standing rigging of an elan 31 cruiser racer offered tangible results to support the methodology by validating it with experimental data the constitutive behaviour elasticity and damping and ss for nylon sk75 was experimentally measured a suitable triangular membrane element formulation allowed implementing the anisotropic material behaviour and panel arrangement without recourse to particularly complex mathematical sail formulations containing multilayer elements and significant computational resources using both rans and shear stress transport sst turbulence model digital photogrammetry was used to experimentally validate flying shape obtained in cfd csm analysis the paper is divided into 4 sections excluding introduction the first section is devoted to the experimental mechanical characterization of the nylon sk75 the second section deals with cfd csm model construction and fsi aeroelastic analysis in the third section the simulated flying shape is validated with digital photogrammetry acquisition and the performance of the spinnaker in terms of drive and side force is studied for different fibre orientation and panel arrangement final considerations and conclusions are drawn in section four 2 sailcloth characterization the evaluation of sailcloths anisotropic mechanical behaviour was carried out experimentally evaluating the 4 engineering elastic constants ewe ewa gwe wa and νwe wa byström et al 2000 renzsch et al 2008 elastic moduli e and g poisson s ratio ν proof stress ss and damping factor d eq of nylon sk75 were evaluated by means of experimental static and cyclic tensile test and analytical analyses no deterioration of cloth due to weathering or flogging was taken into account table 1 outlines the main properties and geometric characteristics of the synthetic nylon sk75 at normal ambient conditions temperature of 20 c and absolute pressure of 1 atm the third column shows the mass of a square meter of cloth the fourth and fifth columns in brackets report the density of the matrix and the density of cloth composite ρ cloth respectively this last was measured as a mass volume ratio by using an electro optical single pan precision balance gibertini mod 704 n with sensibility of 0 1 mg fig 1 a for mass measurement and a graduated cylinder with distilled water fig 1b for volume measurement the sixth and seventh columns report the measured thickness t mea and the equivalent thickness t eq respectively in fact in order to perform an accurate stress experimental it is important to determine the real cloth density and the corresponding equivalent thickness these two parameters are related by the following equation 1 t e q 10 w c l o t h a s ρ c l o t h where w c l o t h is the weight of the fabric measured in grams and a is its area measured in cm2 fig 2 2 1 experimental set up static tensile tests were carried out on the nylon sk75 samples in weft and warp directions as well as in bias direction at 45 to the weft using a zwickroell z100 twin column tensile testing machine and testxpert v11 02 software fig 3 a cyclic tensile test was performed on the sailcloth samples in weft direction using instron 8501 servohydraulic dynamic testing machine and fasttrack 2 software fig 3b both types of tests were conducted at normal ambient conditions according to uni en iso 13934 1 2000 a sufficient lateral pressure was applied through rubber coated grip surfaces to prevent specimen slippage tab length l t fig 3c was properly evaluated according to the tightening pressure as reported below 2 l t σ u t e q 2 τ c where teq represents the equivalent thickness σ u is the ultimate tensile strength of the material and τ c represents the ultimate shear strength of the adhesive cyanoacrylate loxeal 43s substituting the corresponding values to the materials used an l t 50 mm is obtained the adopted value is l t 70 mm five samples were tested in each fibre direction warp weft and bias the tests were performed at different testing rates v1 0 2 mm min v2 2 mm min v3 20 mm min the samples were preloaded at 20 n and load and displacement were recorded with a sampling points 2000 pts in all the tests thus nominal engineering stress load divided by the equivalent cross sectional area and nominal strain were evaluated all the tests were performed until failure as a result ultimate tensile strength and maximum strain were assessed too in order to consider negligible the effect of the off axis tensile response strain was evaluated in the central area of the specimen fig 3d and 3e report the sailcloth samples oriented in weft and bias direction respectively 2 2 constitutive characteristics of sailcloths each curve which interpolates the tests carried out on five samples is obtained by discretizing within the same number of sampling points 2000 pts the tests carried out and calculating at each nominal strain value the mean value m and standard deviation σ of stress the standard deviationσ provides information concerning dispersion of the results as well as variability of curve characteristics the area under the curve of distribution of m 3σ and m 3σ in fact statistically contains 99 73 of the data independent of the number of tests conducted fig 4 a shows nominal stress values of the five tests at 12 sampling points the curves m 3σ m 3σ and the interpolation curve of the mean values in weft direction fig 4b outlines the stress values of the five tests at 13 sampling points the curves m 3σ m 3σ and the interpolation curve of the mean values in bias direction the samples with the fibers oriented in this direction shows an highest dispersion of the results with a standard deviation of less than 2 5 table 2 highlights the σ deviation mean values and σ deviation maximum values for the sailcloth in weft warp and bias tests in fig 5 the tensile test mean value results are reported in terms of nominal engineering stress versus nominal strain curves consist of three evident different zones an initial linear elastic region followed by the second elastic plastic region with a downward concavity and the third zone after which the cloth yielded the elastic zone was used to evaluate elastic constants the lower elastic range limit was set at the starting point of the curves preloaded at 20 n the upper limit proof stress was taken in stress strain curve in correspondence to a value of stress equal to 10 of ultimate tensile strength through cyclic tests fig 8 it was found that under this load the values of the cloth remain within elastic range the sailcloth young s moduli e we was evaluated as the gradients of linear regression straight line in this elastic regions fig 6 the simple regression straight line 3 σ α ε β was calculated minimizing the expression 4 e i 1 n α ε i β σ i where ε i σ i are the n pair of sampling points 200 pts in the elastic region using testing rates lower than 20 mm min nylon showed a brittle fibre fracture an angled gage middle agm failure occurred with a well evident edge separation in the central part of the specimen fig 7 the behaviour in bias direction was distinctly different from that in warp and weft direction confirming little sailcloth orthotropy even in this case after the identification of the effective linear elastic zone the curve gradient supplies the young s modulus in the hypothesis that deformations remain in the field the other two elastic constants ν wa we and g we wa necessary for the complete characterization of the anisotropic mechanical behaviour of sailcloths have been calculated from the definition of poisson s ratio 5 and from the timoshenko theory timoshenko et al 1951 6 5 ν w a w e ε w e ε w a 6 g w

warp directions respectively the shear modulus g wewa was calculated from the elastic properties obtained in tensile tests performed in weft and bias directions equation 6 provide an approach to the calculation of the shear moduli based on stiffness tensor transformations tests agarwal and broutman 1990 table 3 shows values of the maximum tensile strength poisson s ratio young s modulus in weft warp and bias direction and shear modulus for the nylon sk75 under analysis young s modulus values in bias direction are used as reference values in numerical analyses and to calculate the shear modulus g wewa the specific strength and the maximum strain are reported in table 4 due to its limited thickness nylon presented high specific strength the stiffness of the fabric regardless of the thickness used in the sail was calculated with the formula 7 k x e x 100 a s 200 w i t h x w e w a o r b i where 200 is the sailcloth sample length in mm and 100 is a s conversion factor in table 4 the sailcloth stiffness in weft direction is shown dissipated energy per cycle w d and equivalent damping factor coefficient d eq was evaluated by cyclic tensile tests cyclic tests were performed using instron 8501 testing machine and specimens with the same geometry of those utilized for static tensile tests elongations and strain were measured by means of strain gauges length 15 mm placed in the central area of the specimen the cyclic behaviour of sailcloths is governed by the adopted maximum load and frequency in cycles with small maximum loads and low frequency deformations are insignificant in order to obtain evaluable deformations specimens have been subjected to fluctuating loads δ f m a x of 20 of ultimate tensile load and a displacement rate equal to 50 mm min benfratello et al 2013 under these conditions the behaviour was quite variable during the first cycles and was regularly repeated only after about thirty cycles in fig 8a cyclic test in weft direction with δ f m a x 45 n preload 20 n and displacement rate equal to 50 mm min 0 7 hz is outlined in the areas where the cycles are regularly repeated the dissipated energy per cycle w d j cycle and the equivalent elastic energy w s j cycle green and blue areas respectively in fig 8b have been determined these two values allow determining the equivalent damping factor coefficient d eq by using the following formula otaghsara et al 2009 baghaei et al 2010 nyoni and brook 2010 8 d e q w d 4 πw s the equivalent damping factor coefficient decreases with frequency f and is proportional to the square of the maximum elongation δ l m a x just like the deformation energy as described in calì et al 2017a b after thirty cycles a slightly different young s modulus e we cyclic was measured fourth column of table 5 3 setup of aeroelastic analysis the setup of cfd csm aeroelastic analysis is illustrated below referring to a tri radial symmetric spinnaker accurately described in section 4 the selection of such a sail with a large surface area few and simple constraints and almost unlimited number of degrees of freedom is considered to be particularly suitable for the study of the flexibility of the sailcloth in downwind conditions the spinnaker operates in an aerodynamic polar region behind the stall in conditions in which the orders of magnitude of drag begin to be comparable to the maximum lift capability of the sail 3 1 sail structural model the sail is discretized by triangular membrane elements their structural deformation calculation according to the method of arcaro arcaro 2004 renzsch et al 2008 assumes homogeneous and orthotropic linear elastic material the geometry of a triangular element is defined by the nodes i 1 2 3 the angles at the nodes αi and the sides l i opposite the nodes see fig 9 at each computational step during the interaction process nodes are subjected to the air flow forces the structural deformation calculation adopted enables the insertion of the linear effects of young s modulus in weft and warp directions calculated in paragraph 2 as well as the equivalent damping factor d eq calculated with 8 in the following explanation it is assumed that the side l 3 of the triangular element is oriented in the x axis direction of the reference system using the green strain definition the strain on the edge i is 9 ε i l i δ l i 2 l i 2 2 l i 2 the strain ε in an arbitrary direction forming an angle θ with x axis is calculated from 10 ε c 2 ε x x s 2 ε y y 2 c s ε x y with c cos θ and s sin θ and the strain vector along the arbitrary direction equals 11 ε ˆ t ε where 12 ε ˆ ε 11 ε 22 2 ε 13 ε ε x x ε y y 2 ε x y t c 2 s 2 2 c s s 2 c 2 2 c s 2 c s 2 c s c 2 s 2 in particular the strain vector along the three edge of the triangular element ε is equal to 13 ε c ε where 14 ε ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 ε ε x x ε y y 2 ε x y c c o s 2 α 2 s i n 2 α 2 2 c o s α 2 s i n α 2 c o s 2 α 1 s i n 2 α 1 2 c o s α 1 s i n α 1 1 0 0 the stress strain linear

configuration of the sail is calculated from the minimum condition of the total potential energy for the vector of the nodal displacements x and the vector of the flow forces acting on the nodes f the total potential energy is 18 e t o t e l e m e n t s ϕ x f t x and thus the equilibrium condition is 19 e l e m e n t s ϕ x f 0 this non linear system of equations is solved by a quasi newton iterative procedure embedded into the global ranse iteration giving the displacements x of all nodes the maximum number of iterations is set to 1000 and the accuracy for force convergence is set to 0 001 without discretizing panels individually the spinnaker was divided into four parts in each part element orientation approximates the arrangement of sail panels fig 10 in parts 1 and 2 the x axis of triangular elements has been oriented longitudinally whereas in parts 3 and 4 the x axis has been oriented 45 o 45 with respect to the longitudinal axis of the sail according to the tri radial direction of the panel fig 16a on the entire sail surface 1150 triangular elements are used higher stiffness values proportional to the thickness have been attributed at the head and clews of the sail to take into account the reinforcements 3 2 fluid dynamic configuration a 70 m tall structured multiblock hexahedral mesh was generated the domain was extended about 100 m in front and on the sides of the isolated sail a flat inlet boundary was located 70 m behind the sail fig 11 the grid was generated with the view of being adopted unchanged in all flow conditions considered in this study the outlet boundary was dimensioned and positioned in order to include the sail wake in a wide range of angles to be investigated the vertical distribution of the cell layers from the ground was defined in order to better represent the wind boundary layer profile which was modelled according to the following formula larsson and eliansson 1997 20 v t z v t z r e f z z r e f α where v t z is the wind speed and z r e f is the reference eight usually 10 m the parameter α ranges between 1 14 and 1 7 the angle between the wind and the sail is varied in the computations updating the components of the wind velocity vectors at the inlet boundary according to the scheme reported in fig 12 three levels of meshes named for simplicity coarse medium and fine were generated in order to perform a sensitivity analysis on the grid dimension the sizes were approximately little more than half million of cells for the coarse 4 5 million for the medium and 15 million for the fine one the height of the first layer of cells on the wall was dimensioned in order to adopt wall function formulations maintain a range of y between 30 and 100 in the attached regions on the second level of mesh and for a wind speed ranging from 7 to 20 knots a more accurate technique would suggest solving the boundary layer by maintaining y lower than unity in the view of the authors however the grid cells saving the opportunity this strategy allows justifies the choice according to the following considerations a leading edge separation with a potential reattachment at low angle of incidences is always expected even if a deeper verification might be beneficial solving the boundary layer should not be decisive in guaranteeing the accuracy of the fluid dynamic solution in these conditions the accurate estimation of high lift performances is still a challenging task for numerical models it appears then more useful in the economy of the computations to invest in increasing the grid cells clustering on the wall surface respect to rise its layering to solve the boundary layer spinnaker exhibits large separated regions which involve unsteadiness in the flow the solver convergence histories are then affected by this unsteadiness or in general by irregularities the only extraction of the last value could then provide misleading information a routine able to perform a more critical evaluation of the solutions was applied it consists in extracting a linearized interpolation of a selected portion of the convergence history in evaluating its slope and in extracting a value applying opportune constraints in order to reject unacceptable solutions fig 13 reports an example of how this filter works the grid sensitivity analysis was performed with a wind speed equal to 20 knots at a height of 10 m and an angle of 135 with respect to the symmetry plane of the sail the geometry is assumed to be rigid no elastic model was activated the computations consisted in steady fully turbulent rans analyses in which the sail drag and lift forces are extracted referring to the freestream direction as formerly described drag and lift forces are used in csm analysis to calculate sail deflection cfd simulation is repeated with deflected geometry in turn with structural calculation until force convergence is reached the analyses do not model a real sailing condition the boat is not moving and the sail is assumed to be fixed to be coherent with the experimental measurements performed with the boat moored in the harbor reported in the next section apparent and true wind speed apparent and true wind angle then coincide these will be further simply referred to as wind and angle in this condition no twist is present in the inlet velocity profile so there is no ambiguity in the definition of a reference velocity direction for aerodynamic forces fig 18c the reference for wind angle is the symmetry plane of a non deformed spinnaker the two equation k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model of menter 1994 was used wall functions were applied to model the wall boundary layer the three contour plots of fig 14 highlight the evolution of the flow around the rigid sail estimated adopting the three levels of grid the streamlines on the surface evidence the shear stress direction on the sail all numerical configurations estimated a complete stalled condition a small region of attached flow is estimated adopting finer grids and its extension increases with the grid dimension this effect contributes to justify the slightly lower drag and higher lift evaluated adopting the fine grid table 6 reports the numerical solutions of the analysis the third and the fifth columns indicate the difference in percentage between the first two levels of mesh with respect to the finest the force values are extracted according to the filter described above figs 15 and 16 plot the drag convergence histories and the solution of the grid sensitivity analysis respectively the maximum evaluated difference between the solutions is the order of 2 6 the medium grid provided a solution only around half percent different from the solution obtained adopting a mesh three times larger according to the unsteady nature of the separated flow and observing the entity of the oscillations in the convergence histories the choice of the medium grid seems to be the most reasonable compromise to generate averaged forces by a steady analysis the high robustness and the very low computational effort required adopting the coarse grid suggest however considering the uncertainty entities it provides in the estimation of the forces of a completed stalled sail as acceptable for preliminary analyses and if a large number of computations have to be performed the use of finer meshes can be demanded in a final verification stage in cases where high accuracy level is required or can be limited to cases in which deep analyses of local phenomena have to be carried out furthermore the qualitative evaluation of the flow field computed by the three numerical configurations fully justify in the view of the authors its adoption if a fully separated flow condition is expected the use of finer meshes can be demanded in the final verification stage in cases where high accuracy level is required or can be limited to cases in which deep analyses of local phenomena have to be carried out 3 3 solvers coupling for fsi analysis the structural finite element fe model was implemented in the commercial code ansys mechanical apdl the fluid dynamic solution was provided by fluent the solvers coupling for fsi analysis was implemented in ansys workbench environment ansys inc 2013 user s manual the procedure consisted in iterating between the two solutions in the so called two way coupling method the computation began with the cfd analysis on the undeformed shape of the sail the pressure distribution on the surface is used as load for the structural model adopting a mapping procedure implemented in the fluent solver to transfer the solutions from cfd to the fem grid the interpolation algorithm adopted was based on 0 order interpolation skim the static computations continues adapting the cfd domain according to deformation estimated by the structural solver the cfd mesh deformation was performed by the internal algorithm mesh morphing method the iterations progress until a stationary condition of forces and deformations sail flying shape was reached fig 17 shows the scheme of the two way fsi analysis procedure 4 results and discussion the described aeroelastic numerical model was adopted to evaluate the impact that two typical panels arrangement layouts commonly utilized in spinnaker manufacturing have on the flying shape of the sail the activity is performed in two steps the capability of the fsi model to properly evaluate the sail flying shape is validated against experimental measurements a set of numerical aeroelastic analyses is then performed setting up the structural numerical models according to the studied panel arrangement the aim is to verify if and how the two structural solutions affect the aerodynamic performance of the sail 4 1 assessment of flying shape estimation the experimental setup consisted in measuring the flying shape of nylon sk75 tri radial symmetric spinnaker by a digital photogrammetry technique the spinnaker type heavy runner s4 is an integral part of elan 31 a 9 m long cruiser racer produced by the sail maker banks sails naples with a surface area of 60 m2 subject of previous studies conducted by the authors of the present paper martorelli et al 2014 calì et al 2017a b the sail is fixed to the yacht only by the head the tack and by two sheets length of about 6 m connecting sail s clews to the boat fig 18 the procedure consisted in capturing the 3d position of markers located on the sail surface and on the rig they are placed in rows at different heights on the sail so that the various form lines can be reconstructed and thus the interpolated surface that describes the actual flying shape can be calculated fig 19 a fig 19c offers a schematic representation of the acquisition s experimental setup three digital cameras go pro hero 3 black with a resolution of 12 mpixels placed on the wharf were used to completely include the luff or leech and half of the foot in the picture in this way the three photographs had more points in common and each point of the grid was captured in at least 2 photographic images during the simultaneously triggered acquisition the wind velocity measured at an height of 10 m was 7 0 0 3 knots and the wind angle estimated was 185 0 5 for major details on acquisition phase and calibration of the cameras refer to müller and graf 2009 and deparday et al 2016a b respectively the acquired photos were processed with software photomodeller pro by eos systems inc from the detected accurate cloud points a 3d polygonal mesh surface of the spinnaker was constructed the final mesh was optimized border regularization using the automatic fixing tool as described by baronio baronio et al 2016 the overlap between the reconstructed surface and the sail s flying shape surface obtained by fsi simulation was evaluated by measuring the variations in normal direction to the surfaces connecting the two digital surfaces with the closest point algorithm kraus 2000 eos systems 2015 the distance between them was minimized a deviation average distance of 13 mm a standard deviation of 20 mm and a max absolute deviation of 28 mm were obtained fig 20 table 7 shows the main geometrical parameters of the acquired and simulated sail s surface flying shape in particular the characteristic geometric values girth rope and arrow are compared in correspondence with four key cross sections base ¼ ½ ¾ fig 21 4 2 evaluation of panels arrangements performance the following results are obtained by analyzing the sail s flying shapes using experimentally measured mechanical characteristics of nylon cf section 2 the spinnaker s flying shapes were examined at full scale for the boat on a run angle 180 and for the boat on a broad reach angle 165 angle 150 and angle 135 at three wind longitudinal velocities 7 knots 3 6 m s the same of the photogrammetry acquisition 15 knots 7 72 m s and 20 knots 10 29 m s this corresponds to a reynolds number based on the square root of the sail surface area variable between 2 1 e 05 and 2 1 e 06 in the simulations has been set a value of maximum wind turbulence of 2 and a turbulence length scale to 0 1 the profile of the freestream wind boundary layer was defined according to equation 20 as an initial investigation a simulation of spinnaker s flying shapes were replicated under the same wind and angle conditions of the photogrammetry acquisition for both the full tri radial original design panel arrangement from now named opa and a modified panel arrangement mpa in the mpa structural model the radial head arrangement of sail panels was setup in order to have a radial distribution of the panels in the upper part of the sail and a cross cut in the lower part of the sail fig 22 this panel arrangement even being structurally less efficient still presents undeniable advantages in manufacturing in this way two different sail membrane models with different stiffness matrices 16 were taken into account during the fsi simulations table 8 contrasts the main geometric parameters and drive f r and side f lat forces on sail s flying shapes with opa and mpa for the boat on a run angle 180 and wind 7 knots in fig 23 are reported however the maximum principal stress and elastic strain in opa and mpa still for wind 7 knots and angle 180 the results confirmed that tri radial opa is quite close in the middle and lower part girth rope and arrow at ¼ and half height appear smaller than in the mpa the maximum principal stresses and the principal elastic strain in the central zone of the sail are higher in the mpa fig 23b and d in opa the sail panels and fibre orientation is in accordance with the load lines as long as the spinnaker is running f r and f lat forces appear to be similar for the sails with the two different arrangement also in the simulation up to wind 20 knots there seem to be very few apparent differences seem to emerge fig 24 a neglecting the minor local instability phenomena the main generated force is the drag which completely converts into f r comparing the simulation of opa to mpa for the boat on a broad reach angle 165 angle 150 and angle 135 however more interesting results are obtained and the influence of fibre orientation and panel arrangement on sail performance becomes evident in figs 24b and 25a the opa and mpa sail s flying shapes in terms of geometric characteristic values girth rope and arrow and f r and f lat forces were compared for wind 20 knots angle 165 and wind 20 knots angle 150 respectively in fig 25b the opa and mpa sail s flying shapes in terms of geometric characteristic values girth rope and arrow and f r and f lat forces were compared for wind 20 knots angle 135 also a qualitative streamline flow around the spinnaker s flying shape in ¼ horizontal plane is presented in the same figures figs 24 and 25 the figures show that the separated flow generates a gradually increasing lift force moving from angle 165 to angle 135 thus significantly contributing to the formation of the complete f r analysing the characteristic geometric values in the key cross sections moving from angle 165 to angle 135 as expected it quickly becomes evident that during the deformation the spinnaker loses its characteristic symmetry and the luff side extends more than the one that acts as a leech especially at half height and for angle 150 such phenomena appear increasingly evident in both sail with opa and mpa sail in fig 26 the f r and f lat for opa and mpa sail were compared the differences between opa and mpa grow along with the increase in wind speed at every wind speed the wind angle which provides the best performance in terms of drive force is 150 the comparison of f r and f lat for opa and mpa sail with wind 20 knots in polar diagram is shown in fig 27 the aerodynamic performance of the sails with different panel arrangement can be immediately compared by plotting them in the form of f r f lat ratio at each point as shown in fig 28 shear stress indicates clearly a non optimum fibre alignment in mpa fig 29 in mpa in fact there is greater stress and wrinkle and drape are more visible these plots provide important information about the quality of the panelling alignment with loadlines the results outlined below allow making a comparison of sail performance the results are in agreement with the data recorded in literature deparday et al 2016a b motta et al 2014 and with the experimental tabular data for the forces as well as the flying shapes made available on www yru kiel de or www fluidengsol com renzsch and graf 2013 in particular the values of shear stress drive and side force show off only irrelevant difference with renzsch tabular data with the aim to evaluate the influence of orthotropic characteristics on sail performance a comparison between nylon and a hypothetical sailcloth material with evident orthotropic characteristics e we 3910 mpa e wa 2800 mpa for wind 20 knots and angle 150 is performed the comparison was studied for the tri radial opa fig 30 shows streamlines in correspondence of spinnaker half height for nylon and the sail with orthotropic material table 9 shows characteristic geometric values girth rope and arrow in correspondence with the four key cross sections base ¼ ½ ¾ for nylon and the sail with orthotropic material such a comparison allows evincing that the sail made of sailcloth with major different mechanical characteristics in warp and weft directions did not retain the designed shape and delivered inconsistent performance depending on wind velocity the f r has lower average value and at different wind speed the flying shape is very variable it can be concluded that the effects of the mechanical characteristics in warp and weft directions deform the sail differently in particular the sail is smaller in the upper area girth rope and arrow at half and ¾ height appear shorter than in the sail made of nylon also the vortex growth around the sail exhibits differences 5 conclusions the paper presents a methodology that enhances the understanding of fibre orientation and panel arrangement on flying shapes and sail performance through a triangular membrane element formulation the aeroelastic effects on the sail were numerically investigated coupling fluid dynamic and structural analysis a

23162,the effectiveness of partial vertical permeable barriers of three different configurations located at a finite distance from a very large floating structure is analyzed for mitigating the wave induced response of the structure the eigenfunction expansion method is employed to obtain solution in case of normal incidence and the study is extended to the case of oblique incident waves in case of normalized incident waves a detailed analysis of the results on various physical quantities such as the reflection and transmission coefficients wave force on the barrier free surface elevation plate deflection shear force and surface strain on the floating structure are presented for the case of oblique incidence results on reflection coefficient for various structural parameters are presented using green s identity energy balance relations are derived in both the cases of normally and obliquely incident surface waves and certain results for normally incident waves are compared for accuracy the study reveals that wave reflection follows an oscillatory pattern and the minima in the oscillatory pattern increase with an increase in structural porosity wave reflection and dissipation attain their optima for the same wave number irrespective of barrier configurations occurrences of wave diffraction are observed in case of long waves for barriers of varied configurations with a narrow gap which decreases with the introduction of barrier permeability moreover when the distance between the barrier and the very large floating structure is close to an integer multiple of half of the wavelength both the wave reflected by the barrier as well as wave forces acting on the barrier attains their optima keywords water wave scattering vertical porous barrier eigenfunction matching reflection coefficient transmission coefficient and dissipation coefficient 1 introduction in recent decades there is a significant interest to analyse interaction of surface gravity waves with very large floating structure vlfs for the utilization of ocean space this interest is due to urban development which is expanding continuously due to increasing population in the countries where land scarcity exists and in the countries which have long coastlines such nations resort to land reclamation from the sea in order to avoid congestion in the used land space so engineers and researchers have proposed the use of vlfs for habitation industrial space airports and storage facilities in response to the above problems vlfs has the advantage that it is an artificially created land which floats on water body and at the same time has a minimal effect on aquatic habitats tidal current flows the vlfs is assumed to behave elastically as the localized deflection vibration of the long structure becomes significant due to the continuous excitation of small amplitude waves although the motion of the whole body is small as compared to its length see sahoo et al 2001 thus a floating elastic plate renders a simple model for practical structures such as vlfs recent developments on vlfs can be found in wang and tay 2011 lamas pardo et al 2015 and the literature cited therein a parallel branch of study is the wave ice interaction problems in which the floating ice sheet is modeled as an elastic plate and squire 2011 reviewed the state of the art research and future challenges of the hydroelastic problems on wave ice interaction in the polar and subpolar seas mandal et al 2017 discussed the characteristics of the eigensystems associated with the gravity wave interaction with very large floating structures and studied the flexural gravity wave scattering due to multiple articulations in the presence of compression in both the cases of homogeneous and two layer fluid systems it is observed that due to high wave impact on the floating structure the amplitude of wave induced structural responses becomes very high which may damage the floating structure hence it is important to mitigate the structural responses of vlfs that demands convincing and tough serviceability requirements during the last two decades several techniques have been introduced to minimize the wave induced structural responses on vlfs an extensive review of the methods can be found in wang et al 2010 and tavana and khanjani 2013 for instance conventional methods such as the bottom founded type or floating type breakwaters are used to attenuate the wave forces impacting on the vlfs ohmatsu 2000 presented an effective scheme for calculating the wave induced hydroelastic response of a pontoon type very large floating structure vlfs when it is near a breakwater often floating box like breakwaters can be used for reducing structural responses of vlfs in this context headland 1995 revealed that floating box like breakwater is effective in reducing the wave forces for waves with periods ranging from 4 to 6 s hong et al 2002 employed boundary element method in performing hydroelastic analysis on vlfs in the presence of floating breakwater yang 2017 recently developed a hybrid active and passive control method to reduce structural vibration such that the resulting controlled vlfs will enhance serviceability besides the above method an innovative method namely pressurized air cushions are used to reduce the drift forces of the vlfs in this technique the bottom hulls of vlfs are raised above the water surface in order to reduce the surface interference water drag and wave making thereby reducing the hull resistance against waves and current flow at the same time the entrapped air is compressed and this creates an air cushion to eliminate the friction between the bottom hull and the water surface see lee and newman 2000 thiagarajan and morris thomas 2006 ikoma et al 2009 performed extensive studies on the effect of a different number of air cushion units for attenuating motions of vlfs recently hong and lee 2016 analyzed the hydroelastic responses of pneumatically supported vlfs vlfs supported by air cushion below structural bottom using coupled boundary element method and finite element method another technique for reduction of hydroelastic response on vlfs involves the use of anti motion devices that are connected to vlfs lee et al 2003 used composite grid method to analyse hydrodynamic interactions of anti motion device and vlfs and concluded that the submerged plate generates vortex which reduces the structural response by increasing the added mass and damping force of vlfs ohta et al 1999 investigated the effect of submerged vertical as well as a horizontal plate attached at the fore end of the vlfs watanabe et al 2003 examined the effect of attached horizontal plates to vlfs cheng et al 2014 experimentally analyzed vlfs edged with submerged horizontal plates recently cheng et al 2016 studied the fluid structure interaction of irregular waves with vlfs edged with dual inclined perforated plates in context of time domain theory by employing hybrid finite element boundary element method and eigenfunction matching method mohapatra and sahoo 2014 studied the effect of submerged flexible structure in reducing the structural responses of a flexible floating structure mondal and banerjea 2016 presented results of dissipation of wave energy by inclined porous plate submerged beneath the ice cover oscillating water column owc devices because of their effectiveness in absorbing the wave energy finds an application in mitigating structural responses of vlfs owc floating breakwater was considered for reducing the structural response of vlfs by ikoma et al 2002 it can be used as an anti motion device as suggested in maeda et al 2001 the effectiveness of various hybrid techniques known as hybrid anti motion devices is discussed in shigemitsu et al 2001 wang et al 2012 developed a novel hybrid system for reducing the hydroelastic response of very large floating structures moreover gao et al 2013 employed boundary element method and finite element method to study the effect of flexible connector and gill cells in reducing the hydroelastic response of pontoon type very large floating structures recently yoon et al 2014 performed hydroelastic analysis of floating plates with multiple hinge connections in regular waves on the other hand in the last three decades there is a significant progress on wave interaction with porous structures which helps in dissipating a major part of wave energy sahoo et al 2000 investigated the trapping of surface gravity waves by vertical partial barriers located near a rigid wall in a two dimensional channel of uniform depth and reveals that in the presence of partial porous barriers of three different configurations all the incident waves are reflected back when the distance between the end wall and the barrier is an integer multiple of half of the wavelength moreover it was demonstrated that for moderate values of structural permeability wave reflection attends certain minimum when the distance between the end wall and the barrier is equal to a quarter wavelength plus an integer multiple of the half wavelength of the incident wave all the waves are absorbed within the confined zone behera et al 2015 analyzed the trapping of obliquely incident gravity waves by porous barrier located near a rigid wall in the presence of a step type bottom bed using mild slope approximation method koley and sahoo 2017 studied oblique wave trapping by permeable vertical flexible membrane barriers located near a rigid wall in water of uniform depth under the assumption of linear water wave theory and small amplitude membrane response in the aforementioned studies the emphasis was given on the creation of tranquility zone with the help of a vertical porous structure located near a wall moreover all these studies reveal that the maxima in wave reflection by the porous structure was associated with the minimum wave force on the vertical wall moreover the aforementioned studies on wave trapping reveals that because of their ability to absorb and dissipate wave energy porous barriers can be used as breakwaters for mitigating the structural responses in the present study effects of three different configurations of permeable barrier namely surface piercing barrier bottom standing barrier and a barrier with a gap are analyzed for mitigating hydroelastic response of a very large floating structure here the emphasis is on the use of partial porous barriers for reducing wave induced structural responses on a very large floating structures when kept at a finite distance from the structure the problem is studied for normally incident waves in the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system under the assumption of linearized water wave theory and small amplitude structure response and the results are generalized to deal with obliquely incident waves in three dimensions wave past the porous barrier is modeled based on darcy s law for wave past thin porous plate the mathematical problem is handled for a solution using suitable application of eigenfunctions expansion method for both normal incidence and oblique incidence the study aims at finding the optimum distance between the porous plate and the floating structure for obtaining maximum wave reflection by the porous barrier which in turn will reduce the wave loads on the very large floating structure various hydrodynamic characteristics are analyzed from the computed results of the reflection and transmission coefficients plate deflection and forces acting on the barriers and the floating plate for different wave and structural parameters the energy balance relation is derived and used to check the accuracy of the computational results and to obtain quantitative information about wave energy dissipation 2 mathematical formulation under the assumption of the linearized theory of water waves the wave structure interaction problem is formulated in a two dimensional channel of finite water depth the physical problem is studied in the cartesian co ordinate system with x axis being in the horizontal direction and y axis being positive in the vertically downward direction the fluid occupies the region x 0 y h except the barrier and the floating structure in the fluid region the notations l b and l g represent the regions of the barrier and gap respectively the very large floating structure of length 2 l is floating on the mean free surface and occupies the region l x l and the barrier occupies the region x a 1 y l b as shown in fig 1 the length of the barrier is a for surface piercing barrier b for bottom standing barrier and c d for barrier with a gap where c and d are the lengths of the upper part and the submerged part of the barrier the fluid domain under consideration is divided into four regions region 1 x a 1 0 y h region 2 a 1 x l 0 y h region 3 l x l 0 y h region 4 l x 0 y h the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and the fluid motion is assumed to be irrotational and simple harmonic in time t with angular frequency ω thus in region j there exists a velocity potential φ j x y t of the form φ j x y t re ϕ j x y e i ω t j 1 4 with ϕ j x y being the spatial component of the velocity potential which satisfies 2 1 2 ϕ j x 2 2 ϕ j y 2 0 in region j the linearized free surface boundary condition on the mean free surface is given by 2 2 ϕ j y k ϕ j 0 on y 0 j 1 2 4 with k ω 2 g g being the acceleration due to gravity and subscript y denoting the partial derivative with respect to y the no flow condition on the bottom boundary yields 2 3 ϕ j y 0 on y h j 1 4 the boundary condition on the floating plate is given by as in mandal et al 2017 2 4 d x 4 1 ε k ϕ 3 y k ϕ 3 0

s h 0 ρ with h 0 as the thickness of the plate and ρ s is the density of the elastic plate it may be noted that in the absence of floating elastic plate i e when d 0 ε 0 the relation 2 4 reduces to the free surface condition as in eq 2 2 the boundary condition on the porous barrier is given by as in yu and chwang 1994 2 5 ϕ j x a 1 y i k 0 g ϕ 1 a 1 y ϕ 2 a 1 y y l b j 1 2 where g g r i g i ε f i s k 0 d f 2 s 2 with ε being the porosity of the barrier f the resistance force coefficient s the inertial force coefficient and d the thickness of the porous barrier further the real part g r represents the resistance effect of the porous material against the seepage flow while the imaginary part g i denotes the inertia effect of the fluid inside the porous material assuming that the elastic plate is freely floating shear force and bending moment are assumed to vanish at the plate edges which yield 2 6 3 ϕ 3 x 2 y 0 4 ϕ 3 x 3 y 0 at l 0 the continuity of pressure and velocity in the gap at x a 1 along the barrier and the plate interfaces at x l yield 2 7 ϕ 1 a 1 y ϕ 2 a 1 y ϕ 1 x a 1 y ϕ 2 x a 1 y y l g 2 8 ϕ 2 l y ϕ 3 l y ϕ 2 x l y ϕ 3 x l y 0 y h 2 9 ϕ 3 l y ϕ 4 l y ϕ 3 x l

considering eqs 3 9 3 11a and 3 11b 3 12a 3 12d for m 0 1 n along with eqs 3 13a 3 13d a linear system of 6 n 10 equations for 6 n 10 unknowns are derived 4 obliquely incident waves in case of obliquely incident waves the physical fluid domain is assumed to be three dimensional in nature with the y axis being vertically downward the physical fluid domain being similar to that discussed in case of section 2 except that the fluid domain is extended along the z axis in the horizontal direction with the x z plane being the horizontal plane with θ being the angle made with x axis as shown in fig 2 whilst the schematic diagram for other barrier configurations will be similar to that of fig 1 here the velocity potentials φ j and the free surface elevations η j are assumed to be of the forms φ j x y z t re ϕ j x y e i ν 0 z i ω t and η j x z t re η j x e i ν 0 z i ω t for j 1 4 and ν 0 k 0 sin θ thus the governing equation in eq 2 1 will be replaced by 4 1 2 ϕ j x 2 2 ϕ j y 2 ν 0 2 ϕ j 0 in region j the free surface condition eq 2 2 the rigid bed condition eq 2 3 and condition across the porous barrier eq 2 5 will remain the same and the condition across the elastic plate eq 2 4 transforms to 4 2 d 2 x 2 ν 0 2 2 1 ε k ϕ 3 y k ϕ 3 0 on y 0 the free edge conditions in eq 2 6 near the edges of the elastic plate are replaced by 4 3 2 x 2 ν ν 0 2 ϕ 3 y 0 at l 0 x 2 x 2 2 ν ν 0 2 ϕ

of continuity of mass flux and pressure in eqs 2 7 2 9 remaining the same following the same procedure as in section 3 using eigenfunction matching method expansions for velocity potentials in the respective regions are given as 4 5 ϕ 1 i g ω i 0 e i μ 0 x a 1 ψ 0 m 0 r m e i μ m x a 1 ψ m x a 1 4 6 ϕ 2 i g ω m 0 a m e i μ m x a 1 b m e i μ m x l ψ m x a 1 l 4 7 ϕ 3 i g ω n 2 c n e i ν n x l d

across the interfaces as in eqs 2 7 2 9 along with the edge conditions in eq 4 3 a system of linear equations can be obtained for the determination of the unknown coefficients whose details are deferred here to avoid repetition 5 numerical results and discussion various results associated with normalized and obliquely incident waves are analyzed in the subsequent subsections separately 5 1 results for normalized incident waves in this section matlab programs are developed to investigate the effects of various wave and structural parameters on the reflection and transmission coefficients plate deflection and hydrodynamic forces on the porous barrier here the non dimensionalized parameters are k h flexural rigidity d h 4 thickness of the plate ε h the barrier length a h b h the upper barrier and lower barrier lengths c h d h for barrier having a gap position of the barrier a 1 h and plate length l h in the numerical computations incident wave time period and water depth are kept fixed as t 3 5 π sec and h 10 m respectively which yield k h 0 33 and k 0 h 0 61 also other parameters are taken as d h 4 10 ε h 0 01 g 0 2 0 2 i a h 0 3 b h 0 3 c h 0 2 d h 0 1 l λ 0 5 and l h 25 unless otherwise stated with λ 2 π k 0 being the wavelength of the incoming wave the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients are computed using the formulae 5 1 k r r 0 i 0 k t t 0 i 0 and k d k 1 hereafter in all the computations i 0 1 is assumed to be kept fixed the elastic plate deflection is obtained from the linearized dynamic boundary condition at y 0 as 5 2 η i ω g ϕ 3 y 0 the free surface elevation in the respective open water region is obtained using the formula 5 3 η j i ω g ϕ j y 0 j 1 2 and 4 the non dimensional wave force f x on the porous barrier is given by 5 4 f x ω g h 2 l b ϕ 1 a 1 y ϕ 2 a 1 y d y the non dimensional surface strain s t and shear force s f on the plate surface are given by 5 5 s t ε 2 ω 3 ϕ 3 x 2 y y 0 5 6 s f d h ω 4 ϕ 3 x 3 y y 0 table 1 demonstrates the values of the reflection coefficient k r and transmission coefficient k t for the bottom standing and surface piercing barriers as well as for barrier with a gap respectively of moderate barrier length for different values of n against a fixed value of k 0 h to find the value of n in various infinite series in the previous section it is concluded that for n 60 the values of k r and k t converge up to three decimal places thus n 60 is considered in the subsequent numerical calculations however it is observed that in long wave regime k 0 h close to zero when the gap length diminishes i e as the barrier length approaches to unity the value n increases considerably this is due to fact that the horizontal velocity distribution in the vertical direction is not well reproduced around the gap of the barrier by the eigenfunction expansion method because the method uses superposition of hyperbolic and trigonometric functions in such situation one has to consider the convergence by considering higher values of n and in the present study the solution converges for n 150 upto three decimal places the corresponding data is presented in table 2 it may be noted that when there is no barrier and the rigidity of the floating elastic plate is very high the present problem reduces to wave scattering by a floating dock studied by linton 2001 table 3 illustrates the values of k r and k t obtained by the present method when the barrier length is zero and the same obtained using the modified residue calculus technique of linton 2001 for normal incidence with l h 1 fig 3 a demonstrates that the present solution matches exactly with the results of linton 2001 which can be considered as a check for the correctness of the computed results moreover the present work reduces to the problem by andrianov and hermans 2003 for b h 0 in the case of bottom standing barrier fig 3b demonstrates the results of the present problem with ε h 0 d h 4 10 3 which matches exactly with the results of andrianov and hermans 2003 which can be considered as another check of validation of the present computational result the physical quantities associated with the energy identity as in appendix are computed and presented in tables 4 6 for different values of k 0 h in case of barriers of different configurations these results demonstrate the accuracy of the present numerical computations and also provide quantitative information about the amount of wave energy loss due to the porosity of the vertical barrier fig 4 demonstrates the variations of k r k t and k d versus non dimensional wave number k 0 h for different values of the porous effect parameter g for surface piercing barrier fig 4a for k r exhibits an oscillatory pattern which is due to the mutual interactions of the incident and reflected waves as well as the interaction of waves between the barrier and the plate moreover the span width of the oscillatory pattern and maxima in wave reflection increases with an increase in wave number k 0 h which may be due to the predominant role of wave energy concentration near the free surface for higher values of wave number k 0 h corresponding to waves in deep water in general wave reflection is more for an impermeable breakwater as compared to that of a permeable barrier moreover the minima in wave reflection is very high in case of a impermeable barrier compared to that of a permeable barrier further maxima in reflection occurs for moderate absolute values of the complex porous effect parameter g in the presence of permeable barrier a comparison with fig 4b reveals that wave transmission follows an opposite trend to that of wave reflection on the other hand fig 4c reveals that with an increase in the absolute value of the complex porous effect parameter g the dissipation coefficient increases which is due to the fact that a major amount of energy concentrating near the free surface is dissipated by the barrier for higher values of the wave number k 0 h when absolute g becomes very large like for g 5 5 i the barrier becomes more transparent to the fluid which allows more energy to transmit by the barrier on the other hand smaller value of wave number which corresponds to shallow water region maximum energy dissipation takes place by the vertical barrier which predominantly propagate in the horizontal direction a comparison of fig 4a c reveals that certain bending in the oscillatory patterns are observed this may be due to the change in argument of the complex porous effect parameter which in turn changes the phase of the incoming and outgoing waves in the presence of the barrier and floating plate further fig 4a c depicts that the energy identity k r 2 k t 2 k 1 1 as in appendix is satisfied further a comparison between fig 4a and c reveals that the minima in wave reflection is associated with the minima in wave energy dissipation which is due to the negligible role of the barrier on wave motion under such condition fig 5 shows the variation of reflection coefficient k r transmission coefficient k t and dissipation coefficient k d versus non dimensional wave number k 0 h for different values of porous effect parameter g in case of bottom standing barrier fig 5a reveals that the reflection coefficient k r increases and the transmission coefficient k t decreases in an oscillatory pattern which is similar to that of fig 4 moreover fig 5c reveals that a very small amount of wave energy is dissipated in case of a bottom standing barrier compared to the surface piercing barrier in fig 4c further fig 5a b depicts that the minima in wave reflection are very close to zero whilst the maxima in wave transmission is very close to one with an increase in wave number k 0 h in case of the bottom standing barrier which is not the case in case of the surface piercing barrier this is due to the fact that energy dissipation by a bottom standing barrier is much less compared to that of a surface piercing barrier the variations of k r k t and k d versus the dimensionless wave number k 0 h with c h 0 2 and d h 0 1 are plotted in fig 6 the general shape of the plots of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients are similar to that of a surface piercing and bottom standing barriers as in figs 4 and 5 however the optima in reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients in case of barrier having a gap lies between that of the bottom standing and surface piercing barriers moreover a comparison with figs 4 and 5 reveals that optima in the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients occur for the same wave numbers which demonstrates that wave energy reflection transmission and dissipation are independent of barrier configurations and the structural configurations of the barriers provide a quantitative behavior on the wave energy reflection transmission and dissipation hereafter to avoid repetition results associated with the reflection coefficient are plotted for various physical parameters for understanding the scattering characteristics of wave transformation as the transmission and dissipation coefficients will follow the energy identity fig 7 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for various barrier lengths in case of various barrier configurations for an impermeable barrier where g 0 fig 7 reveals that the reflection coefficient changes from zero towards unity for very small gap length as k 0 h approaches to zero which corresponds to the case of long waves irrespective of impermeable barrier configurations this is due to the diffraction of water waves by the narrow gap of the impermeable barrier the pattern is similar to that of wave diffraction by a flexible porous plate having a narrow gap as observed in koley et al 2015 and wave diffraction by a barrier having a gap in tuck 1971 fig 7a reveals that wave reflection increases with an increase in barrier length in case of surface piercing barrier it is observed that for smaller values of k 0 h with an increase in barrier length k r approaches towards unity whilst full reflection occurs for larger values of k 0 h this is due to the reflection of the wave energy concentrating near the free surface fig 7b reveals that the reflection pattern of the bottom standing barrier is similar to that of the surface piercing barrier for smaller values of k 0 h whilst for larger values of k 0 h minima in wave reflection decreases in an oscillatory pattern with an increase in wave number k 0 h as the barrier length increases in case of bottom standing barrier a major part of wave energy being reflected whilst in case of the surface piercing barrier due to the negligible role of wave energy near the sea bed almost full reflection is observed in the narrow gap of the surface piercing barrier with an increase in barrier length for larger values of k 0 h fig 7c demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficient k r versus wave number k 0 h for various values of gap length assuming that the length of upper barrier is fixed whilst that of lower barrier is changing a comparison of fig 7c with figs 7a and 7b reveals that for larger gap almost full reflection occurs in case of barrier having a gap for higher values of k 0 h however the amplitude in the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection is moderately higher than that of the surface piercing barrier and lower than that of the bottom standing barrier however for finite gap length irrespective of the position of the gap and barrier configurations value of the reflection coefficient is almost same for smaller values of k 0 h which is due to the fact that wave energy propagation is uniform across the water depth fig 8 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for permeable barriers of different configurations having narrow gap with g 0 1 0 1 i a comparison with fig 7 reveals that although the general pattern in wave reflection is almost similar to that of the non permeable barriers wave reflection decreases with the introduction of structural permeability irrespective of the wave number k 0 h the decrease in the amplitude of oscillation in wave reflection is due to the predominant role of the porous barrier in dampening the resonating pattern in wave motion fig 9 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for different barrier lengths of varied configurations with g 0 2 0 2 i a comparison of figs 8 and 9 reveals that except for a narrow gap nearly zero reflection occurs for long waves corresponding to smaller k 0 h even for permeable barrier of any configurations while wave energy dissipation takes place in case of water of intermediate depth and deep water fig 10 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for various values of the porous effect parameter g in case of various barrier configurations having very small gap length all the figures reveal that with an increase in the absolute values of the porous effect parameter g wave reflection decreases significantly for smaller values of k 0 h which demonstrates that there is a significant reduction in the amount of energy diffraction and reflection in case of long waves with the increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter this is mainly due to the dissipation and transmission of wave energy by the porous barrier fig 11 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of the porous effect parameter g in case of barriers of varied configurations it is observed that irrespective of barrier configurations the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter of the barriers which is due to the dissipation and transmission of wave energy by the porous barrier further fig 11 reveals that wave reflection increases in an uniformly oscillatory pattern with an increase in the gap length l λ moreover the optima in wave reflection occur when the distance between the barrier and the plate is close to an integer multiple of half of the wavelength which is irrespective of barrier configurations however optima in wave reflection are more for a surface piercing barrier see fig 11a compared to that of the other barrier configurations the maxima minima in wave reflection are due to the constructive destructive interference of the incident and reflected waves in the presence of the porous barrier the observation is similar to wave trapping by porous barriers located near a wall as discussed in koley and sahoo 2017 and the literature cited therein fig 12 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of the porous effect parameter g with k 0 h 0 3 in case of barriers of varied configurations a comparison with fig 11 reveals that the number of optima in wave reflection reduces with an increase in the time period moreover a comparison with fig 11 depicts that as the barrier gap length is small there is a significant reduction in the reflection coefficient as major part of the wave energy is dissipated instead of being diffracted further all subfigures of fig 12 reveal that the reflection coefficient is almost independent of barrier configuration in case of long waves corresponding to k 0 h 0 3 in case of barrier having a narrow gap the similarity in the wave reflection is due to the fact that the wave motion is almost uniform along the water depth for long waves and the diffraction pattern remains almost similar in nature the minor variation in wave reflection is due to the variation in the dissipation of wave energy by the porous structures of varied configurations fig 13 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of the barrier length in case of barriers of varied configurations in general the pattern in wave reflection is similar to that of fig 11 although the optima in wave reflection depend on the barrier length the location of the optima is not affected due to change in barrier length fig 14 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the plate length 2 l λ for different values of barrier length in the case of barriers of varied configurations the general pattern of k r curves is similar irrespective of barrier configurations with the increase in barrier length a significant increase in the amplitude of the reflected wave is observed fig 15 demonstrates the variation of free surface elevation and plate deflection for different values of barrier lengths it is observed that the amplitudes of oscillation of the free surface and plate deflection decrease with an increase in barrier length irrespective of barrier configurations which is due to the fact that more wave energy is dissipated by the porous barrier of larger length moreover there is a significant reduction in the amplitude of oscillation of the plate deflection and free surface elevation on the lee side of the floating plate compared to that of the amplitude of surface elevation in the open water region on the fore side of the porous barrier the higher amplitude on the fore side is due to the superposition of the incident and reflected waves by the porous barrier and the floating plate moreover a certain decrease in amplitude of oscillation between the barrier and plate which is due to the dissipation of wave energy within the confined zone as the barrier length increases fig 16 reveals that the amplitude of oscillation on the lee side of the plate is less than the fore side a comparison of fig 16 with figs 13 and 15 reveals that maxima in wave reflection is associated with higher values of wave amplitude in free surface elevation on the fore side of the barrier and minima in wave reflection is associated with higher values of wave amplitude in free surface elevation on the lee side of the floating plate moreover figs 15 and 16 depict that the amplitude of oscillation of the transmitted waves are comparable in both the figures in fig 17 the free surface elevation and the elastic plate deflection are plotted for different values of porous effect parameter g from the figure it is observed that the free surface elevation and the elastic plate deflection are uniform and oscillatory in nature also these deflections of the plate and free surface elevation increases as the absolute value of porous effect parameter g increases for large absolute values of the porous effect parameter wave energy dissipation is very less leading to more wave energy passing through the barrier as a result the free surface elevation and plate deflection remain high in each region moreover a small shift towards right side is also observed in the profile with rise in absolute value of g it is also revealed from fig 17 that in the lee side of the elastic plate the free surface elevation remains less than the free surface elevation in the fore side of the barrier which is due to the fact that maximum wave reflection occurs for l λ 3 as observed in fig 13 fig 18 shows the variation of hydrodynamic force acting on the porous barrier versus gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of barrier length it is observed that the general pattern of wave force is oscillatory and uniform in nature moreover the wave forces acting on the barrier increases with an increase in barrier length a comparison with fig 13 reveals that position of optima in wave reflection and wave force on the vertical barrier occurs for the same value of barrier position l λ irrespective of barrier configuration however the magnitude of forces acting on the partial barriers depend on the nature of the barrier such as a surface piercing barrier experiences more force compared to that of a barrier with a gap whilst amplitude of wave forces is minimum for a bottom standing barrier the observation is similar to that of the reflection coefficients as observed in fig 13 in fig 19 variation of hydrodynamic force acting on the porous barrier versus gap between the barrier and the plate l λ are plotted for different values of the porous effect parameter in case of barriers of different configurations the general pattern of wave force is similar to that of fig 18 it is observed that the wave forces acting on the barrier decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g irrespective of barrier configurations which is due to the dissipation and transmission of more wave energy by the porous barrier having larger porosity moreover a comparison with fig 11 reveals that optima in wave reflection is associated with optima in wave forces fig 20 represents the variation of strain s t along the plate length for different values of barrier lengths it is observed that the strain is zero at the edges of the elastic plate which is in agreement with the assumption of free edge conditions of the floating structure it is observed that strain decreases with an increase in the barrier length near the edges of the plate strain increases very rapidly because the local effect of the evanescent modes is dominating near the edges on the other hand as one moves away from the edges strain curves exhibit the uniformly oscillatory pattern further it is observed from fig 20 that strain experienced by a plate in the presence of partial surface piercing barrier is least compared to the other barrier configurations which are due to the fact that maximum wave energy is reflected and or dissipated in case of a surface piercing barrier compared to other barrier configurations as observed in fig 13 fig 21 shows the variation of strain s t along the plate length for different values of the porous effect parameter g the study reveals that strain experienced by the plate is minimum for the surface piercing barrier and maximum in case of the bottom standing barrier for moderate values of the porous effect parameter which is similar to that of fig 20 however for higher absolute values of the porous effect parameter strain experienced by the plate is independent of porous effect parameter this is due to the increased transmission of wave energy below the elastic plate with the rise in the porosity of the barrier the shear force s f is plotted for all barrier configurations in fig 22 it is observed that at the edges of the floating plate shear force is zero as assumed in the present study which demonstrates the accuracy of the computational result moreover an identical pattern of shear force along the plate length is observed for barriers of varied configurations also it is observed that the shear force exerted on the floating plate in the presence of partial surface piercing barrier is least as compared to the other barrier configurations which is similar to that of strain as observed in fig 20 5 2 results for obliquely incident waves in the previous subsection a strong co relation has been established between the various physical quantities such as the reflection and transmission coefficients free surface elevation and plate deflection along with forces and moments for normally incident waves thus to avoid repetition in this subsection the analysis will be restricted to study the reflection coefficient pattern for various wave and structural parameters for oblique angle of incidence fig 23 demonstrates the variation in reflection coefficient k r versus θ for different barrier lengths in case of all barrier configurations all the figures reveal that for 0 θ 51 wave reflection follows an oscillatory pattern with zero minimum for different angle of incidence moreover the amplitude of oscillation in wave reflection increases with an increase in barrier length irrespective of barrier configurations for θ 51 however full reflection occurs initially for θ 51 irrespective of barrier length and configurations the angle θ 51 corresponds to the critical angle of incidence in this case for θ beyond the critical angle of incidence oscillatory pattern in wave reflection is retained in case of barriers of varied length and configurations with reflection remaining close to unity and attending maximum unity value for theta close to 70 before it reaches unity again for θ 90 moreover amplitude of oscillation decreases with an increase in barrier length irrespective of barrier configuration for θ 51 a comparison of the reflection coefficient pattern for different barrier configurations reveals that in case of oblique incident waves surface piercing barrier is highly effective in reflecting the wave energy as compared to other two barrier cases for 0 θ 51 whilst the bottom standing barrier becomes effective in reflecting maximum wave energy for 51 θ 90 fig 24 shows the variation in k r versus θ for different values of porous effect parameter g in case of all barrier configurations it is observed that irrespective of barrier configuration and structural porosity the general pattern in wave reflection is similar to that of fig 23 with θ 51 being the critical angle however the wave reflection decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g for 0 θ 51 whilst the reverse trend is observed for 51 θ 90 fig 25 shows that the variation of reflection coefficient k r versus θ for different time period t in the case of different barrier configurations all the figures reveal that the value of the critical angle θ increases with an increase in time period irrespective of barrier configurations whilst the general trend in wave reflection is similar to that of fig 23 fig 26 shows the variation of the reflection coefficient k r versus k 0 h for different angle of incidence θ in case of all barrier configurations a comparison with figs 5 10 reveals that with an increase in angle of incidence θ irrespective of barrier configurations the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection vanishes beyond certain value of the wave number k 0 h for which a sudden peak in wave reflection occurs after attending the highest peak wave reflection follows a uniform increasing decreasing pattern with an increase in wave number k 0 h the oblique angle for which sharp changes in wave reflection occur is referred as the critical angle of incidence and it depends on the wave number however this change in the pattern of wave reflection is independent of the barrier configurations whilst the maximum value in the wave reflection depends on the barrier configurations a comparison of the reflection pattern for barrier of different configurations reveals that wave reflection is maximum for a bottom standing barrier and minimum for a surface piercing barrier for higher values of k 0 h this is due to the fact that more wave energy concentrating near the free surface is dissipated in the case of surface piercing barrier compared to that of a bottom standing barrier for higher values of wave number the figure depicts that under oblique wave attack angle of incidence and the wave length of the incoming waves are strongly interrelated for diffracting waves and reducing wave induced structural response fig 27 demonstrates the variations in k r against l λ for different angle of incidence θ in case of different barrier configurations it is observed that irrespective of barrier configurations the amplitude of oscillation in the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in the angle of incidence θ moreover irrespective of the barrier configuration number of optima in the oscillatory pattern of wave reflection decreases with an increase in the angle of incidence a comparison with figs 11 13 reveals that the frequency of occurrence of optima in the amplitude of the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the oblique angle of incidence fig 28 shows the variations in k r versus 2 l λ for different values of the angle of incidence θ in case of barriers of different configurations a comparison with fig 14 reveals that unlike the case of normalized incident waves in case of oblique incident waves frequency of occurrence of optima in the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the length of the floating plate 2 l λ moreover the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern in the reflection coefficient increases with an increase in the angle of incidence also it is observed that when θ increases further the oscillatory pattern in k r is lost and k r becomes steady however the number and location of optima in wave reflection is independent of barrier configurations as θ approaches towards 90 the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection diminishes and wave reflection approaches towards unity irrespective of the plate length however the barrier configuration signifies the amount of wave energy reflection and dissipation as discussed in figs 23 25 6 conclusion in the present study the role of partial permeable vertical barriers on the reduction of wave induced hydroelastic response on a very large floating structure is studied in a finite depth of water using eigenfunction matching technique the associated boundary value problem is converted into a system of linear algebraic equations which is solved numerically energy balance relation is derived and used to check the accuracy of the computational results optima in reflection transmission and dissipation of incident wave energy occur for different values of the wave number irrespective of barrier configurations wave reflection and dissipation decrease with an increase in structural porosity whilst reverse trend in wave transmission occur with an increase in structural porosity of the barrier apart from scattering of the incident waves wave diffraction occurs by partial barriers having a narrow gap in case of long waves irrespective of barrier configurations with the introduction of structural porosity there is a 15 20 reduction in wave energy reflection transmission due to dissipation of wave energy by structural porosity irrespective of barrier configurations wave reflection is periodic with respect to the normalized distance between the floating plate edge and the barrier the free surface elevation and deflection of the floating plate can be attenuated significantly by suitably selecting the values of porous effect parameter and gap between the barrier and the floating plate the study reveals that in case of normalized incident waves when the gap between the barrier and the plate is close to an integral multiple of half of the wavelength of the incident wave maximum reflection takes place shear force and strain on the barrier reduce significantly with an increase in barrier length and increase in the absolute value of the barrier porosity unlike the case of normalized incident waves the reflection pattern depends on the oblique angle of incidence in case of oblique incident waves there exist a critical angle for which sharp maximum is observed which is dependent on the wavenumber further the study reveals that irrespective of barrier configuration the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection occurs for 0 θ θ c where θ c is the critical angle with an increase in the angle of incidence θ a rise in wave reflection is observed irrespective of barrier configurations thus it is concluded that porous barriers of suitable configurations and length placed at appropriate location can be used for reducing the wave induced structural responses on a very large floating structure the concept and methodology discussed in the present paper can be employed to deal with similar problems arising in ocean engineering and other branches of mathematical physics moreover the findings of the present study will be useful in the attenuation of the structural response on very large floating structures by way of wave trapping between the barrier and the floating plate wave diffraction

induced response of the structure the eigenfunction expansion method is employed to obtain solution in case of normal incidence and the study is extended to the case of oblique incident waves in case of normalized incident waves a detailed analysis of the results on various physical quantities such as the reflection and transmission coefficients wave force on the barrier free surface elevation plate deflection shear force and surface strain on the floating structure are presented for the case of oblique incidence results on reflection coefficient for various structural parameters are presented using green s identity energy balance relations are derived in both the cases of normally and obliquely incident surface waves and certain results for normally incident waves are compared for accuracy the study reveals that wave reflection follows an oscillatory pattern and the minima in the oscillatory pattern increase with an increase in structural porosity wave reflection and dissipation attain their optima for the same wave number irrespective of barrier configurations occurrences of wave diffraction are observed in case of long waves for barriers of varied configurations with a narrow gap which decreases with the introduction of barrier permeability moreover when the distance between the barrier and the very large floating structure is close to an integer multiple of half of the wavelength both the wave reflected by the barrier as well as wave forces acting on the barrier attains their optima keywords water wave scattering vertical porous barrier eigenfunction matching reflection coefficient transmission coefficient and dissipation coefficient 1 introduction in recent decades there is a significant interest to analyse interaction of surface gravity waves with very large floating structure vlfs for the utilization of ocean space this interest is due to urban development which is expanding continuously due to increasing population in the countries where land scarcity exists and in the countries which have long coastlines such nations resort to land reclamation from the sea in order to avoid congestion in the used land space so engineers and researchers have proposed the use of vlfs for habitation industrial space airports and storage facilities in response to the above problems vlfs has the advantage that it is an artificially created land which floats on water body and at the same time has a minimal effect on aquatic habitats tidal current flows the vlfs is assumed to behave elastically as the localized deflection vibration of the long structure becomes significant due to the continuous excitation of small amplitude waves although the motion of the whole body is small as compared to its length see sahoo et al 2001 thus a floating elastic plate renders a simple model for practical structures such as vlfs recent developments on vlfs can be found in wang and tay 2011 lamas pardo et al 2015 and the literature cited therein a parallel branch of study is the wave ice interaction problems in which the floating ice sheet is modeled as an elastic plate and squire 2011 reviewed the state of the art research and future challenges of the hydroelastic problems on wave ice interaction in the polar and subpolar seas mandal et al 2017 discussed the characteristics of the eigensystems associated with the gravity wave interaction with very large floating structures and studied the flexural gravity wave scattering due to multiple articulations in the presence of compression in both the cases of homogeneous and two layer fluid systems it is observed that due to high wave impact on the floating structure the amplitude of wave induced structural responses becomes very high which may damage the floating structure hence it is important to mitigate the structural responses of vlfs that demands convincing and tough serviceability requirements during the last two decades several techniques have been introduced to minimize the wave induced structural responses on vlfs an extensive review of the methods can be found in wang et al 2010 and tavana and khanjani 2013 for instance conventional methods such as the bottom founded type or floating type breakwaters are used to attenuate the wave forces impacting on the vlfs ohmatsu 2000 presented an effective scheme for calculating the wave induced hydroelastic response of a pontoon type very large floating structure vlfs when it is near a breakwater often floating box like breakwaters can be used for reducing structural responses of vlfs in this context headland 1995 revealed that floating box like breakwater is effective in reducing the wave forces for waves with periods ranging from 4 to 6 s hong et al 2002 employed boundary element method in performing hydroelastic analysis on vlfs in the presence of floating breakwater yang 2017 recently developed a hybrid active and passive control method to reduce structural vibration such that the resulting controlled vlfs will enhance serviceability besides the above method an innovative method namely pressurized air cushions are used to reduce the drift forces of the vlfs in this technique the bottom hulls of vlfs are raised above the water surface in order to reduce the surface interference water drag and wave making thereby reducing the hull resistance against waves and current flow at the same time the entrapped air is compressed and this creates an air cushion to eliminate the friction between the bottom hull and the water surface see lee and newman 2000 thiagarajan and morris thomas 2006 ikoma et al 2009 performed extensive studies on the effect of a different number of air cushion units for attenuating motions of vlfs recently hong and lee 2016 analyzed the hydroelastic responses of pneumatically supported vlfs vlfs supported by air cushion below structural bottom using coupled boundary element method and finite element method another technique for reduction of hydroelastic response on vlfs involves the use of anti motion devices that are connected to vlfs lee et al 2003 used composite grid method to analyse hydrodynamic interactions of anti motion device and vlfs and concluded that the submerged plate generates vortex which reduces the structural response by increasing the added mass and damping force of vlfs ohta et al 1999 investigated the effect of submerged vertical as well as a horizontal plate attached at the fore end of the vlfs watanabe et al 2003 examined the effect of attached horizontal plates to vlfs cheng et al 2014 experimentally analyzed vlfs edged with submerged horizontal plates recently cheng et al 2016 studied the fluid structure interaction of irregular waves with vlfs edged with dual inclined perforated plates in context of time domain theory by employing hybrid finite element boundary element method and eigenfunction matching method mohapatra and sahoo 2014 studied the effect of submerged flexible structure in reducing the structural responses of a flexible floating structure mondal and banerjea 2016 presented results of dissipation of wave energy by inclined porous plate submerged beneath the ice cover oscillating water column owc devices because of their effectiveness in absorbing the wave energy finds an application in mitigating structural responses of vlfs owc floating breakwater was considered for reducing the structural response of vlfs by ikoma et al 2002 it can be used as an anti motion device as suggested in maeda et al 2001 the effectiveness of various hybrid techniques known as hybrid anti motion devices is discussed in shigemitsu et al 2001 wang et al 2012 developed a novel hybrid system for reducing the hydroelastic response of very large floating structures moreover gao et al 2013 employed boundary element method and finite element method to study the effect of flexible connector and gill cells in reducing the hydroelastic response of pontoon type very large floating structures recently yoon et al 2014 performed hydroelastic analysis of floating plates with multiple hinge connections in regular waves on the other hand in the last three decades there is a significant progress on wave interaction with porous structures which helps in dissipating a major part of wave energy sahoo et al 2000 investigated the trapping of surface gravity waves by vertical partial barriers located near a rigid wall in a two dimensional channel of uniform depth and reveals that in the presence of partial porous barriers of three different configurations all the incident waves are reflected back when the distance between the end wall and the barrier is an integer multiple of half of the wavelength moreover it was demonstrated that for moderate values of structural permeability wave reflection attends certain minimum when the distance between the end wall and the barrier is equal to a quarter wavelength plus an integer multiple of the half wavelength of the incident wave all the waves are absorbed within the confined zone behera et al 2015 analyzed the trapping of obliquely incident gravity waves by porous barrier located near a rigid wall in the presence of a step type bottom bed using mild slope approximation method koley and sahoo 2017 studied oblique wave trapping by permeable vertical flexible membrane barriers located near a rigid wall in water of uniform depth under the assumption of linear water wave theory and small amplitude membrane response in the aforementioned studies the emphasis was given on the creation of tranquility zone with the help of a vertical porous structure located near a wall moreover all these studies reveal that the maxima in wave reflection by the porous structure was associated with the minimum wave force on the vertical wall moreover the aforementioned studies on wave trapping reveals that because of their ability to absorb and dissipate wave energy porous barriers can be used as breakwaters for mitigating the structural responses in the present study effects of three different configurations of permeable barrier namely surface piercing barrier bottom standing barrier and a barrier with a gap are analyzed for mitigating hydroelastic response of a very large floating structure here the emphasis is on the use of partial porous barriers for reducing wave induced structural responses on a very large floating structures when kept at a finite distance from the structure the problem is studied for normally incident waves in the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system under the assumption of linearized water wave theory and small amplitude structure response and the results are generalized to deal with obliquely incident waves in three dimensions wave past the porous barrier is modeled based on darcy s law for wave past thin porous plate the mathematical problem is handled for a solution using suitable application of eigenfunctions expansion method for both normal incidence and oblique incidence the study aims at finding the optimum distance between the porous plate and the floating structure for obtaining maximum wave reflection by the porous barrier which in turn will reduce the wave loads on the very large floating structure various hydrodynamic characteristics are analyzed from the computed results of the reflection and transmission coefficients plate deflection and forces acting on the barriers and the floating plate for different wave and structural parameters the energy balance relation is derived and used to check the accuracy of the computational results and to obtain quantitative information about wave energy dissipation 2 mathematical formulation under the assumption of the linearized theory of water waves the wave structure interaction problem is formulated in a two dimensional channel of finite water depth the physical problem is studied in the cartesian co ordinate system with x axis being in the horizontal direction and y axis being positive in the vertically downward direction the fluid occupies the region x 0 y h except the barrier and the floating structure in the fluid region the notations l b and l g represent the regions of the barrier and gap respectively the very large floating structure of length 2 l is floating on the mean free surface and occupies the region l x l and the barrier occupies the region x a 1 y l b as shown in fig 1 the length of the barrier is a for surface piercing barrier b for bottom standing barrier and c d for barrier with a gap where c and d are the lengths of the upper part and the submerged part of the barrier the fluid domain under consideration is divided into four regions region 1 x a 1 0 y h region 2 a 1 x l 0 y h region 3 l x l 0 y h region 4 l x 0 y h the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and the fluid motion is assumed to be irrotational and simple harmonic in time t with angular frequency ω thus in region j there exists a velocity potential φ j x y t of the form φ j x y t re ϕ j x y e i ω t j 1 4 with ϕ j x y being the spatial component of the velocity potential which satisfies 2 1 2 ϕ j x 2 2 ϕ j y 2 0 in region j the linearized free surface boundary condition on the mean free surface is given by 2 2 ϕ j y k ϕ j 0 on y 0 j 1 2 4 with k ω 2 g g being the acceleration due to gravity and subscript y denoting the partial derivative with respect to y the no flow condition on the bottom boundary yields 2 3 ϕ j y 0 on y h j 1 4 the boundary condition on the floating plate is given by as in mandal et al 2017 2 4 d x 4 1 ε k ϕ 3 y k ϕ 3 0

s h 0 ρ with h 0 as the thickness of the plate and ρ s is the density of the elastic plate it may be noted that in the absence of floating elastic plate i e when d 0 ε 0 the relation 2 4 reduces to the free surface condition as in eq 2 2 the boundary condition on the porous barrier is given by as in yu and chwang 1994 2 5 ϕ j x a 1 y i k 0 g ϕ 1 a 1 y ϕ 2 a 1 y y l b j 1 2 where g g r i g i ε f i s k 0 d f 2 s 2 with ε being the porosity of the barrier f the resistance force coefficient s the inertial force coefficient and d the thickness of the porous barrier further the real part g r represents the resistance effect of the porous material against the seepage flow while the imaginary part g i denotes the inertia effect of the fluid inside the porous material assuming that the

considering eqs 3 9 3 11a and 3 11b 3 12a 3 12d for m 0 1 n along with eqs 3 13a 3 13d a linear system of 6 n 10 equations for 6 n 10 unknowns are derived 4 obliquely incident waves in case of obliquely incident waves the physical fluid domain is assumed to be three dimensional in nature with the y axis being vertically downward the physical fluid domain being similar to that discussed in case of section 2 except that the fluid domain is extended along the z axis in the horizontal direction with the x z plane being the horizontal plane with θ being the angle made with x axis as shown in fig 2 whilst the schematic diagram for other barrier configurations will be similar to that of fig 1 here the velocity potentials φ j and the free surface elevations η j are assumed to be of the forms φ j x y z t re ϕ j x y e i ν 0 z i ω t and η j x z t re η j x e i ν 0 z i ω t for j 1 4 and ν 0 k 0 sin θ thus the governing equation in eq 2 1 will be replaced by 4 1 2 ϕ j x 2 2 ϕ j y 2 ν 0 2 ϕ j 0 in region j the free surface condition eq 2 2 the rigid bed condition eq 2 3 and condition across the porous barrier eq 2 5 will remain the same and the condition across the elastic plate eq 2 4 transforms to 4 2 d 2 x 2 ν 0 2 2 1 ε k ϕ 3 y k ϕ 3 0 on y 0 the free edge conditions in eq 2 6 near the edges of the elastic plate are replaced by 4 3 2 x 2 ν ν 0 2 ϕ 3 y 0 at l 0 x 2 x 2 2 ν ν 0 2 ϕ

across the interfaces as in eqs 2 7 2 9 along with the edge conditions in eq 4 3 a system of linear equations can be obtained for the determination of the unknown coefficients whose details are deferred here to avoid repetition 5 numerical results and discussion various results associated with normalized and obliquely incident waves are analyzed in the subsequent subsections separately 5 1 results for normalized incident waves in this section matlab programs are developed to investigate the effects of various wave and structural parameters on the reflection and transmission coefficients plate deflection and hydrodynamic forces on the porous barrier here the non dimensionalized parameters are k h flexural rigidity d h 4 thickness of the plate ε h the barrier length a h b h the upper barrier and lower barrier lengths c h d h for barrier having a gap position of the barrier a 1 h and plate length l h in the numerical computations incident wave time period and water depth are kept fixed as t 3 5 π sec and h 10 m respectively which yield k h 0 33 and k 0 h 0 61 also other parameters are taken as d h 4 10 ε h 0 01 g 0 2 0 2 i a h 0 3 b h 0 3 c h 0 2 d h 0 1 l λ 0 5 and l h 25 unless otherwise stated with λ 2 π k 0 being the wavelength of the incoming wave the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients are computed using the formulae 5 1 k r r 0 i 0 k t t 0 i 0 and k d k 1 hereafter in all the computations i 0 1 is assumed to be kept fixed the elastic plate deflection is obtained from the linearized dynamic boundary condition at y 0 as 5 2 η i ω g ϕ 3 y 0 the free surface elevation in the respective open water region is obtained using the formula 5 3 η j i ω g ϕ j y 0 j 1 2 and 4 the non dimensional wave force f x on the porous barrier is given by 5 4 f x ω g h 2 l b ϕ 1 a 1 y ϕ 2 a 1 y d y the non dimensional surface strain s t and shear force s f on the plate surface are given by 5 5 s t ε 2 ω 3 ϕ 3 x 2 y y 0 5 6 s f d h ω 4 ϕ 3 x 3 y y 0 table 1 demonstrates the values of the reflection coefficient k r and transmission coefficient k t for the bottom standing and surface piercing barriers as well as for barrier with a gap respectively of moderate barrier length for different values of n against a fixed value of k 0 h to find the value of n in various infinite series in the previous section it is concluded that for n 60 the values of k r and k t converge up to three decimal places thus n 60 is considered in the subsequent numerical calculations however it is observed that in long wave regime k 0 h close to zero when the gap length diminishes i e as the barrier length approaches to unity the value n increases considerably this is due to fact that the horizontal velocity distribution in the vertical direction is not well reproduced around the gap of the barrier by the eigenfunction expansion method because the method uses superposition of hyperbolic and trigonometric functions in such situation one has to consider the convergence by considering higher values of n and in the present study the solution converges for n 150 upto three decimal places the corresponding data is presented in table 2 it may be noted that when there is no barrier and the rigidity of the floating elastic plate is very high the present problem reduces to wave scattering by a floating dock studied by linton 2001 table 3 illustrates the values of k r and k t obtained by the present method when the barrier length is zero and the same obtained using the modified residue calculus technique of linton 2001 for normal incidence with l h 1 fig 3 a demonstrates that the present solution matches exactly with the results of linton 2001 which can be considered as a check for the correctness of the computed results moreover the present work reduces to the problem by andrianov and hermans 2003 for b h 0 in the case of bottom standing barrier fig 3b demonstrates the results of the present problem with ε h 0 d h 4 10 3 which matches exactly with the results of andrianov and hermans 2003 which can be considered as another check of validation of the present computational result the physical quantities associated with the energy identity as in appendix are computed and presented in tables 4 6 for different values of k 0 h in case of barriers of different configurations these results demonstrate the accuracy of the present numerical computations and also provide quantitative information about the amount of wave energy loss due to the porosity of the vertical barrier fig 4 demonstrates the variations of k r k t and k d versus non dimensional wave number k 0 h for different values of the porous effect parameter g for surface piercing barrier fig 4a for k r exhibits an oscillatory pattern which is due to the mutual interactions of the incident and reflected waves as well as the interaction of waves between the barrier and the plate moreover the span width of the oscillatory pattern and maxima in wave reflection increases with an increase in wave number k 0 h which may be due to the predominant role of wave energy concentration near the free surface for higher values of wave number k 0 h corresponding to waves in deep water in general wave reflection is more for an impermeable breakwater as compared to that of a permeable barrier moreover the minima in wave reflection is very high in case of a impermeable barrier compared to that of a permeable barrier further maxima in reflection occurs for moderate absolute values of the complex porous effect parameter g in the presence of permeable barrier a comparison with fig 4b reveals that wave transmission follows an opposite trend to that of wave reflection on the other hand fig 4c reveals that with an increase in the absolute value of the complex porous effect parameter g the dissipation coefficient increases which is due to the fact that a major amount of energy concentrating near the free surface is dissipated by the barrier for higher values of the wave number k 0 h when absolute g becomes very large like for g 5 5 i the barrier becomes more transparent to the fluid which allows more energy to transmit by the barrier on the other hand smaller value of wave number which corresponds to shallow water region maximum energy dissipation takes place by the vertical barrier which predominantly propagate in the horizontal direction a comparison of fig 4a c reveals that certain bending in the oscillatory patterns are observed this may be due to the change in argument of the complex porous effect parameter which in turn changes the phase of the incoming and outgoing waves in the presence of the barrier and floating plate further fig 4a c depicts that the energy identity k r 2 k t 2 k 1 1 as in appendix is satisfied further a comparison between fig 4a and c reveals that the minima in wave reflection is associated with the minima in wave energy dissipation which is due to the negligible role of the barrier on wave motion under such condition fig 5 shows the variation of reflection coefficient k r transmission coefficient k t and dissipation coefficient k d versus non dimensional wave number k 0 h for different values of porous effect parameter g in case of bottom standing barrier fig 5a reveals that the reflection coefficient k r increases and the transmission coefficient k t decreases in an oscillatory pattern which is similar to that of fig 4 moreover fig 5c reveals that a very small amount of wave energy is dissipated in case of a bottom standing barrier compared to the surface piercing barrier in fig 4c further fig 5a b depicts that the minima in wave reflection are very close to zero whilst the maxima in wave transmission is very close to one with an increase in wave number k 0 h in case of the bottom standing barrier which is not the case in case of the surface piercing barrier this is due to the fact that energy dissipation by a bottom standing barrier is much less compared to that of a surface piercing barrier the variations of k r k t and k d versus the dimensionless wave number k 0 h with c h 0 2 and d h 0 1 are plotted in fig 6 the general shape of the plots of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients are similar to that of a surface piercing and bottom standing barriers as in figs 4 and 5 however the optima in reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients in case of barrier having a gap lies between that of the bottom standing and surface piercing barriers moreover a comparison with figs 4 and 5 reveals that optima in the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients occur for the same wave numbers which demonstrates that wave energy reflection transmission and dissipation are independent of barrier configurations and the structural configurations of the barriers provide a quantitative behavior on the wave energy reflection transmission and dissipation hereafter to avoid repetition results associated with the reflection coefficient are plotted for various physical parameters for understanding the scattering characteristics of wave transformation as the transmission and dissipation coefficients will follow the energy identity fig 7 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for various barrier lengths in case of various barrier configurations for an impermeable barrier where g 0 fig 7 reveals that the reflection coefficient changes from zero towards unity for very small gap length as k 0 h approaches to zero which corresponds to the case of long waves irrespective of impermeable barrier configurations this is due to the diffraction of water waves by the narrow gap of the impermeable barrier the pattern is similar to that of wave diffraction by a flexible porous plate having a narrow gap as observed in koley et al 2015 and wave diffraction by a barrier having a gap in tuck 1971 fig 7a reveals that wave reflection increases with an increase in barrier length in case of surface piercing barrier it is observed that for smaller values of k 0 h with an increase in barrier length k r approaches towards unity whilst full reflection occurs for larger values of k 0 h this is due to the reflection of the wave energy concentrating near the free surface fig 7b reveals that the reflection pattern of the bottom standing barrier is similar to that of the surface piercing barrier for smaller values of k 0 h whilst for larger values of k 0 h minima in wave reflection decreases in an oscillatory pattern with an increase in wave number k 0 h as the barrier length increases in case of bottom standing barrier a major part of wave energy being reflected whilst in case of the surface piercing barrier due to the negligible role of wave energy near the sea bed almost full reflection is observed in the narrow gap of the surface piercing barrier with an increase in barrier length for larger values of k 0 h fig 7c demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficient k r versus wave number k 0 h for various values of gap length assuming that the length of upper barrier is fixed whilst that of lower barrier is changing a comparison of fig 7c with figs 7a and 7b reveals that for larger gap almost full reflection occurs in case of barrier having a gap for higher values of k 0 h however the amplitude in the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection is moderately higher than that of the surface piercing barrier and lower than that of the bottom standing barrier however for finite gap length irrespective of the position of the gap and barrier configurations value of the reflection coefficient is almost same for smaller values of k 0 h which is due to the fact that wave energy propagation is uniform across the water depth fig 8 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for permeable barriers of different configurations having narrow gap with g 0 1 0 1 i a comparison with fig 7 reveals that although the general pattern in wave reflection is almost similar to that of the non permeable barriers wave reflection decreases with the introduction of structural permeability irrespective of the wave number k 0 h the decrease in the amplitude of oscillation in wave reflection is due to the predominant role of the porous barrier in dampening the resonating pattern in wave motion fig 9 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for different barrier lengths of varied configurations with g 0 2 0 2 i a comparison of figs 8 and 9 reveals that except for a narrow gap nearly zero reflection occurs for long waves corresponding to smaller k 0 h even for permeable barrier of any configurations while wave energy dissipation takes place in case of water of intermediate depth and deep water fig 10 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus wave number k 0 h for various values of the porous effect parameter g in case of various barrier configurations having very small gap length all the figures reveal that with an increase in the absolute values of the porous effect parameter g wave reflection decreases significantly for smaller values of k 0 h which demonstrates that there is a significant reduction in the amount of energy diffraction and reflection in case of long waves with the increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter this is mainly due to the dissipation and transmission of wave energy by the porous barrier fig 11 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of the porous effect parameter g in case of barriers of varied configurations it is observed that irrespective of barrier configurations the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter of the barriers which is due to the dissipation and transmission of wave energy by the porous barrier further fig 11 reveals that wave reflection increases in an uniformly oscillatory pattern with an increase in the gap length l λ moreover the optima in wave reflection occur when the distance between the barrier and the plate is close to an integer multiple of half of the wavelength which is irrespective of barrier configurations however optima in wave reflection are more for a surface piercing barrier see fig 11a compared to that of the other barrier configurations the maxima minima in wave reflection are due to the constructive destructive interference of the incident and reflected waves in the presence of the porous barrier the observation is similar to wave trapping by porous barriers located near a wall as discussed in koley and sahoo 2017 and the literature cited therein fig 12 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of the porous effect parameter g with k 0 h 0 3 in case of barriers of varied configurations a comparison with fig 11 reveals that the number of optima in wave reflection reduces with an increase in the time period moreover a comparison with fig 11 depicts that as the barrier gap length is small there is a significant reduction in the reflection coefficient as major part of the wave energy is dissipated instead of being diffracted further all subfigures of fig 12 reveal that the reflection coefficient is almost independent of barrier configuration in case of long waves corresponding to k 0 h 0 3 in case of barrier having a narrow gap the similarity in the wave reflection is due to the fact that the wave motion is almost uniform along the water depth for long waves and the diffraction pattern remains almost similar in nature the minor variation in wave reflection is due to the variation in the dissipation of wave energy by the porous structures of varied configurations fig 13 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of the barrier length in case of barriers of varied configurations in general the pattern in wave reflection is similar to that of fig 11 although the optima in wave reflection depend on the barrier length the location of the optima is not affected due to change in barrier length fig 14 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficients versus the plate length 2 l λ for different values of barrier length in the case of barriers of varied configurations the general pattern of k r curves is similar irrespective of barrier configurations with the increase in barrier length a significant increase in the amplitude of the reflected wave is observed fig 15 demonstrates the variation of free surface elevation and plate deflection for different values of barrier lengths it is observed that the amplitudes of oscillation of the free surface and plate deflection decrease with an increase in barrier length irrespective of barrier configurations which is due to the fact that more wave energy is dissipated by the porous barrier of larger length moreover there is a significant reduction in the amplitude of oscillation of the plate deflection and free surface elevation on the lee side of the floating plate compared to that of the amplitude of surface elevation in the open water region on the fore side of the porous barrier the higher amplitude on the fore side is due to the superposition of the incident and reflected waves by the porous barrier and the floating plate moreover a certain decrease in amplitude of oscillation between the barrier and plate which is due to the dissipation of wave energy within the confined zone as the barrier length increases fig 16 reveals that the amplitude of oscillation on the lee side of the plate is less than the fore side a comparison of fig 16 with figs 13 and 15 reveals that maxima in wave reflection is associated with higher values of wave amplitude in free surface elevation on the fore side of the barrier and minima in wave reflection is associated with higher values of wave amplitude in free surface elevation on the lee side of the floating plate moreover figs 15 and 16 depict that the amplitude of oscillation of the transmitted waves are comparable in both the figures in fig 17 the free surface elevation and the elastic plate deflection are plotted for different values of porous effect parameter g from the figure it is observed that the free surface elevation and the elastic plate deflection are uniform and oscillatory in nature also these deflections of the plate and free surface elevation increases as the absolute value of porous effect parameter g increases for large absolute values of the porous effect parameter wave energy dissipation is very less leading to more wave energy passing through the barrier as a result the free surface elevation and plate deflection remain high in each region moreover a small shift towards right side is also observed in the profile with rise in absolute value of g it is also revealed from fig 17 that in the lee side of the elastic plate the free surface elevation remains less than the free surface elevation in the fore side of the barrier which is due to the fact that maximum wave reflection occurs for l λ 3 as observed in fig 13 fig 18 shows the variation of hydrodynamic force acting on the porous barrier versus gap between the barrier and the plate l λ for different values of barrier length it is observed that the general pattern of wave force is oscillatory and uniform in nature moreover the wave forces acting on the barrier increases with an increase in barrier length a comparison with fig 13 reveals that position of optima in wave reflection and wave force on the vertical barrier occurs for the same value of barrier position l λ irrespective of barrier configuration however the magnitude of forces acting on the partial barriers depend on the nature of the barrier such as a surface piercing barrier experiences more force compared to that of a barrier with a gap whilst amplitude of wave forces is minimum for a bottom standing barrier the observation is similar to that of the reflection coefficients as observed in fig 13 in fig 19 variation of hydrodynamic force acting on the porous barrier versus gap between the barrier and the plate l λ are plotted for different values of the porous effect parameter in case of barriers of different configurations the general pattern of wave force is similar to that of fig 18 it is observed that the wave forces acting on the barrier decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g irrespective of barrier configurations which is due to the dissipation and transmission of more wave energy by the porous barrier having larger porosity moreover a comparison with fig 11 reveals that optima in wave reflection is associated with optima in wave forces fig 20 represents the variation of strain s t along the plate length for different values of barrier lengths it is observed that the strain is zero at the edges of the elastic plate which is in agreement with the assumption of free edge conditions of the floating structure it is observed that strain decreases with an increase in the barrier length near the edges of the plate strain increases very rapidly because the local effect of the evanescent modes is dominating near the edges on the other hand as one moves away from the edges strain curves exhibit the uniformly oscillatory pattern further it is observed from fig 20 that strain experienced by a plate in the presence of partial surface piercing barrier is least compared to the other barrier configurations which are due to the fact that maximum wave energy is reflected and or dissipated in case of a surface piercing barrier compared to other barrier configurations as observed in fig 13 fig 21 shows the variation of strain s t along the plate length for different values of the porous effect parameter g the study reveals that strain experienced by the plate is minimum for the surface piercing barrier and maximum in case of the bottom standing barrier for moderate values of the porous effect parameter which is similar to that of fig 20 however for higher absolute values of the porous effect parameter strain experienced by the plate is independent of porous effect parameter this is due to the increased transmission of wave energy below the elastic plate with the rise in the porosity of the barrier the shear force s f is plotted for all barrier configurations in fig 22 it is observed that at the edges of the floating plate shear force is zero as assumed in the present study which demonstrates the accuracy of the computational result moreover an identical pattern of shear force along the plate length is observed for barriers of varied configurations also it is observed that the shear force exerted on the floating plate in the presence of partial surface piercing barrier is least as compared to the other barrier configurations which is similar to that of strain as observed in fig 20 5 2 results for obliquely incident waves in the previous subsection a strong co relation has been established between the various physical quantities such as the reflection and transmission coefficients free surface elevation and plate deflection along with forces and moments for normally incident waves thus to avoid repetition in this subsection the analysis will be restricted to study the reflection coefficient pattern for various wave and structural parameters for oblique angle of incidence fig 23 demonstrates the variation in reflection coefficient k r versus θ for different barrier lengths in case of all barrier configurations all the figures reveal that for 0 θ 51 wave reflection follows an oscillatory pattern with zero minimum for different angle of incidence moreover the amplitude of oscillation in wave reflection increases with an increase in barrier length irrespective of barrier configurations for θ 51 however full reflection occurs initially for θ 51 irrespective of barrier length and configurations the angle θ 51 corresponds to the critical angle of incidence in this case for θ beyond the critical angle of incidence oscillatory pattern in wave reflection is retained in case of barriers of varied length and configurations with reflection remaining close to unity and attending maximum unity value for theta close to 70 before it reaches unity again for θ 90 moreover amplitude of oscillation decreases with an increase in barrier length irrespective of barrier configuration for θ 51 a comparison of the reflection coefficient pattern for different barrier configurations reveals that in case of oblique incident waves surface piercing barrier is highly effective in reflecting the wave energy as compared to other two barrier cases for 0 θ 51 whilst the bottom standing barrier becomes effective in reflecting maximum wave energy for 51 θ 90 fig 24 shows the variation in k r versus θ for different values of porous effect parameter g in case of all barrier configurations it is observed that irrespective of barrier configuration and structural porosity the general pattern in wave reflection is similar to that of fig 23 with θ 51 being the critical angle however the wave reflection decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g for 0 θ 51 whilst the reverse trend is observed for 51 θ 90 fig 25 shows that the variation of reflection coefficient k r versus θ for different time period t in the case of different barrier configurations all the figures reveal that the value of the critical angle θ increases with an increase in time period irrespective of barrier configurations whilst the general trend in wave reflection is similar to that of fig 23 fig 26 shows the variation of the reflection coefficient k r versus k 0 h for different angle of incidence θ in case of all barrier configurations a comparison with figs 5 10 reveals that with an increase in angle of incidence θ irrespective of barrier configurations the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection vanishes beyond certain value of the wave number k 0 h for which a sudden peak in wave reflection occurs after attending the highest peak wave reflection follows a uniform increasing decreasing pattern with an increase in wave number k 0 h the oblique angle for which sharp changes in wave reflection occur is referred as the critical angle of incidence and it depends on the wave number however this change in the pattern of wave reflection is independent of the barrier configurations whilst the maximum value in the wave reflection depends on the barrier configurations a comparison of the reflection pattern for barrier of different configurations reveals that wave reflection is maximum for a bottom standing barrier and minimum for a surface piercing barrier for higher values of k 0 h this is due to the fact that more wave energy concentrating near the free surface is dissipated in the case of surface piercing barrier compared to that of a bottom standing barrier for higher values of wave number the figure depicts that under oblique wave attack angle of incidence and the wave length of the incoming waves are strongly interrelated for diffracting waves and reducing wave induced structural response fig 27 demonstrates the variations in k r against l λ for different angle of incidence θ in case of different barrier configurations it is observed that irrespective of barrier configurations the amplitude of oscillation in the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in the angle of incidence θ moreover irrespective of the barrier configuration number of optima in the oscillatory pattern of wave reflection decreases with an increase in the angle of incidence a comparison with figs 11 13 reveals that the frequency of occurrence of optima in the amplitude of the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the oblique angle of incidence fig 28 shows the variations in k r versus 2 l λ for different values of the angle of incidence θ in case of barriers of different configurations a comparison with fig 14 reveals that unlike the case of normalized incident waves in case of oblique incident waves frequency of occurrence of optima in the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in the length of the floating plate 2 l λ moreover the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern in the reflection coefficient increases with an increase in the angle of incidence also it is observed that when θ increases further the oscillatory pattern in k r is lost and k r becomes steady however the number and location of optima in wave reflection is independent of barrier configurations as θ approaches towards 90 the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection diminishes and wave reflection approaches towards unity irrespective of the plate length however the barrier configuration signifies the amount of wave energy reflection and dissipation as discussed in figs 23 25 6 conclusion in the present study the role of partial permeable vertical barriers on the reduction of wave induced hydroelastic response on a very large floating structure is studied in a finite depth of water using eigenfunction matching technique the associated boundary value problem is converted into a system of linear algebraic equations which is solved numerically energy balance relation is derived and used to check the accuracy of the computational results optima in reflection transmission and dissipation of incident wave energy occur for different values of the wave number irrespective of barrier configurations wave reflection and dissipation decrease with an increase in structural porosity whilst reverse trend in wave transmission occur with an increase in structural porosity of the barrier apart from scattering of the incident waves wave diffraction occurs by partial barriers having a narrow gap in case of long waves irrespective of barrier configurations with the introduction of structural porosity there is a 15 20 reduction in wave energy reflection transmission due to dissipation of wave energy by structural porosity irrespective of barrier configurations wave reflection is periodic with respect to the normalized distance between the floating plate edge and the barrier the free surface elevation and deflection of the floating plate can be attenuated significantly by suitably selecting the values of porous effect parameter and gap between the barrier and the floating plate the study reveals that in case of normalized incident waves when the gap between the barrier and the plate is close to an integral multiple of half of the wavelength of the incident wave maximum reflection takes place shear force and strain on the barrier reduce significantly with an increase in barrier length and increase in the absolute value of the barrier porosity unlike the case of normalized incident waves the reflection pattern depends on the oblique angle of incidence in case of oblique incident waves there exist a critical angle for which sharp maximum is observed which is dependent on the wavenumber further the study reveals that irrespective of barrier configuration the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection occurs for 0 θ θ c where θ c is the critical angle with an increase in the angle of incidence θ a rise in wave reflection is observed irrespective of barrier configurations thus it is concluded that porous barriers of suitable configurations and length placed at appropriate location can be used for reducing the wave induced structural responses on a very large floating structure the concept and methodology discussed in the present paper can be employed to deal with similar problems arising in ocean engineering and other branches of mathematical physics moreover the findings of the present study will be useful in the attenuation of the structural response on very large floating structures by way of wave trapping between the barrier and the floating plate wave diffraction

there are numerous types of neural networks for the present study the so called multi layer perceptron mlp networks have been selected and systematically trained and evaluated in order to assess their potential to estimate the resistance of marad type hullforms selected alternatives of mlps and their application for prediction of marad hullforms resistance are provided 2 artificial neural networks 2 1 historical background artificial neural networks anns are inspired by the human brain functionality and loosely model the way it processes sensory information received from the environment they consist of parallel distributed interconnected non linear processing units the neurons information is acquired from their environment via a learning process and stored in the form of weights in the connections haykin 1999 a simplified model of the biological neuron was initially introduced by mcculloch and pitts 1943 as a possible component of a computational system this neuron had several inputs both excitatory and inhibitory 1 1 excitatory signals increase the probability of the neuron to be activated whereas the inhibitory ones in this model prevent its activation and an output which reflected the state 2 2 i e the sum of the neuron s inputs of the neuron in order for the neuron to be activated the sum of the excitatory signals had to exceed a threshold value t while inhibitory signals were absent in variations of this model positive and negative stimulations were of the same importance due to the use of adequate linear weights haykin 1999 russell and norvig 1995 there were numerous milestones in the field of neural networks since they were originally introduced regarding the architecture of the networks and their learning process hebbian learning is one of the oldest learning algorithms based on the dynamics of biological systems hebb 1949 according to this hypothesis when the neurons connected by a synapse are stimulated repeatedly and simultaneously this synapse becomes stronger and the neurons are connected more effectively in terms of anns this is accomplished with the increase of synaptic weights haykin 1999 russell and norvig 1995 one of the first anns to be developed was the perceptron presented by rosenblatt 1958 this simple neural network was a binary classifier based on the mcculloch pitts neuron and had the ability of updating its weights via a supervised learning method minsky and papert 1969 analysed it and proved mathematically that a single layer network is not able to solve more complex problems such as linear classification in more than two classes back propagation learning algorithm revived the interest for neural networks in the mid 80s when it was used in numerous different problems this algorithm adapts the synaptic weights in a way that minimizes the mean square error between the actual and desired output haykin 1999 rojas 1996 it was at that time when many research programs regarding neural networks were initiated as a result their application expanded in more complex and practical problems autonomous drivers weather or stock value predictions image recognition and optimal path selection could be solved with anns zurada 1992 2 2 artificial neural network architectures an artificial neural network consists of a distribution of interconnected neurons arranged in layers its architecture is defined by the number of its layers the kind of neural synapses and the learning algorithm used according to the first characteristic they may be distinguished in single layer and multi layer networks the first type of networks contains only one layer of neurons as its output layer while the later has hidden layers between the input and the output layer with respect to the kind of their neural synapses networks may be characterized as feed forward and recurrent the data in feed forward networks flow in one direction from the input layer to the output through the hidden layers if existent recurrent networks contain at least one feedback interconnection which links the output of a neuron with the input of another placed at the same or previous layer a network can be also characterized as fully or partially connected if every node is connected with every node of its forward layer or not a fundamental feature of anns is their ability to learn for this purpose they adjust the weights of their connections and threshold values in order to present a satisfactory behaviour according to a prescribed criterion there are three different learning techniques supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning in supervised learning the network is provided with a series of input and output pairs in order to find a function that connects them this procedure is evaluated by a cost function usually the mean square error between actual and desired output which needs to be minimized in unsupervised learning the network has to classify the input data finding a patern without external information in reinforcement learning the network is in continuous communication with its environment which rewards or not the input output mapping that has been achieved in order to minimize a performance indicator 2 3 feed forward multi layer perceptron one of the most widely used neural networks is the feed forward multi layer perceptron mlp mlps are considered particularly suitable for function approximation data classification or pattern recognition problems therefore they have been selected to be used in the present study an mlp consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer fig 1 the number of the input and output nodes is equal to the dimension of the input and output data respectively the signal is transferred in the forward direction from the input to the output layer haykin 1999 every node except for the input layers is a neuron with a differentiable activation function that generates its output haykin 1999 sigmoid transfer functions such as logistic sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent sigmoid are usually preferred as activation functions for mlps because consecutive layers of neurons with non linear activation functions enable the network to learn non linear relationships between input and output data the linear transfer function is often used for the neurons of the output layer the logistic sigmoid function is given by eq 1 while its graphical representation is illustrated in fig 2 1 y k f u k 1 1 e u k the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function is given by eq 2 and its graphical representation is illustrated in fig 3 2 y k f u k 1 e u k 1 e u k in the above equations y k is the output of the kth neuron and u k is the weighted sum of its input synapses in mlps a popular supervised learning method capable of handling complicated learning problems is the back propagation algorithm bp a gradient descent technique with backward error propagation this algorithm is based on the error correction learning rule and is executed in two stages in the first stage the input signal is transferred through the layers in order for the output signal to be derived during this phase the synaptic weights remain constant then the mean square error of the deviation between the actual response of the network and the desired output is calculated in the second stage these deviations are transferred backwards and the synaptic weights change accordingly so that the average squared error is minimized this cost function is given by eq 3 3 e a v 1 t t e t 1 t t 1 2 k d k t y k t 2 where k is the number of neurons in the output layer t the number of input output patterns in the training set d k t and y k t the target and actual output of the kth neuron haykin 1999 a learning function is utilized for the adjustment of the weights e g the gradient descent learning rule known as delta rule the correction of the weights is given by eq 4 4 δ w k i η e t w k i t where η is the learning rate parameter which controls the rate of adaptation of the weights and bias and affects the speed of convergence of the training process haykin 1999 2 3 1 training algorithms the training algorithm is used to train the neural network to recognize a certain input and map it to the corresponding output back propagation algorithms can be distinguished into gradient descent newton gauss conjugate gradient and quasi newton algorithms in this study three gradient descent algorithms and one quasi newton algorithm were utilized 2 3 1 1 gradient descent algorithms they are first order optimisation algorithms that employ the gradient vector of the cost function to decide the direction of the training always pointing towards its negative value snyman 2005 in the gradient descent back propagation algorithm also known as steepest descent the weights and biases are updated in the direction of the negative gradient of the performance function the gradient descent with adaptive learning rate back propagation algorithm enables changes to the learning rate throughout the training in this way the learning rate adapts to the local complexity of the error surface a higher learning rate is accepted as far as the learning process stability is ensured otherwise the learning rate is decreased as necessary hagan et al 2014 the gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation combines adaptive learning with momentum training it is invoked in the same way as the gradient descent with adaptive learning with the addition of a momentum coefficient as training parameter introduced to help the algorithm escaping from a shallow local minimum 2 3 1 2 quasi newton algorithms newton s algorithm is a second order optimisation algorithm that requires the calculation of a hessian matrix containing the second derivatives of the errors quasi newton algorithms approximate the hessian without the need of calculating second derivatives hagan et al 2014 for small or medium sized networks the levenberg marquardt levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 training algorithm is most frequently used the update of the weights is defined as follows 5 w m 1 w m j t j μ i 1 j t e where j is the jacobian matrix of the first derivatives of the network s errors with respect to its weights and biases e the vector of network s errors w m the weights vector after the m th step and μ a positive parameter beale et al 2015 2 3 2 learning algorithms the learning algorithm defines the way that weights and bias of the network will be updated during the training two different learning algorithms were utilized in this study the gradient descent weight and bias and the gradient descent with momentum weight and bias 2 3 3 data sets the available data for the network training are usually divided into three mutually exclusive sets the training set is used for the update of weights and biases of the network in order for the cost function to be minimized the validation set is used for the tuning of parameters other than weights and for comparison between different neural networks the test set is used for the evaluation of the network s predictive ability the available data are randomly distributed into the three datasets 3 marad systematic series the marad systematic series was developed by the u s maritime administration roseman and seibold 1987 1985 aiming to respond to the rising interest for full hull form merchant ships and the lack of systematic data regarding the performance of these vessels that could be used in the design process as a result this systematic series is characterized by high block coefficient values c b low length to beam ratios l b and high breadth to draft ratios b t were also adopted for economic and operational reasons i e draft restrictions respectively a cylindrical bow shape was selected as a means of achieving lower resistance values for full form hulls whilst the stern was designed taking into account hydrodynamic issues such as flow separation sets of lines were developed for the parent and the offspring hulls as a combination of three segments the entrance the parallel mid body and two alternative run segments a short and a long one sixteen models were constructed and tank tested in order to obtain their calm water resistance and manoeuvering characteristics their longitudinal centre of buoyancy lcb was placed 2 5 of length forward of amidships as a result of preliminary resistance tests the sixteen hulls comprising the marad series are characterized by their block coefficient c b their beam to draft ratio b t and length to beam ratio l b as shown in fig 4 roseman and seibold 1987 bare hull resistance tests were performed for the sixteen hulls at full load and ballast condition the obtained results were presented in diagrams in the form of the residual resistance coefficient c r defined as follows 6 c r c t m c f m r 1 2 ρ s υ 2 c f m where r tm is the model s total measured resistance s is its wetted surface υ is its speed c tm and c fm are its total and frictional resistance coefficient respectively and ρ is the mass density of water in the basin c fm is expressed by the 1975 ittc formula as a function of reynold s number r n 7 c f 0 075 log 10 r n 2 2 the diagrams provided by the marad systematic series illustrate c r versus l b or b t for a series of froude numbers fn for given values of block coefficient c b and b t or l b respectively five diagrams for full load and five for ballast condition are included in roseman and seibold 1987 those corresponding to the full load condition were used in this study a number of 1983 points in total were obtained from these diagrams characterized by five variables fn l b b t c b c r 4 development of the neural networks the development of the anns for the approximation of the resistance of ships designed according to the marad series was carried out using the matlab neural networks toolbox beale et al 2015 the mathworks inc 2018 which provides tools for designing implementing visualizing and simulating neural networks the data required for the networks training were obtained from a series of diagrams provided in roseman and seibold 1987 in the form of pairs of four dimensional input vectors and scalar outputs the input vector consists of the length to breadth ratio l b the breadth to draft ratio b t the block coefficient c b and the froude number fn while the output is the residual resistance coefficient c r as already stated among the various types of anns multi layer perceptron networks mlps have been selected for the present study as they are considered particularly suitable for function approximation problems in order to identify the mlp that suits better to the problem at hand several trials have been conducted with different configurations each configuration is determined by the number of hidden layers used the number and type of neurons that comprise each one of them the training algorithm learning algorithm and rate beale et al 2015 in total 18 different network architectures have been tested for each one of them 16 different networks have been implemented based on a combination of four back propagation training algorithms and four different pairs of activation functions the training algorithms used for this study are the levenberg marquardt gradient descent gradient descent with adaptive learning rate and gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate four combinations of three different activation functions have been used i e the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid herein denoted as t the pure linear denoted as p and the logistic sigmoid function denoted as l as a result 288 networks were constructed and tested during this initial stage of trials the gradient descent weight and bias learning algorithm was used and the learning rate was set to 0 02 the available data was separated into mutually exclusive training 80 and validation 20 sets the validation set comprises data unknown to the trained network and is usually used for the comparison and ranking of different network configurations a graphical description of this stage of trials is given in fig 5 for each one of these 288 networks the corresponding mean squared error mse and regression value r were calculated based on the training and validation sets of data the regression value is an indicator of the relationship between the actual and target outputs and its absolute value ranges between one and zero suggesting the existence of an exact linear relationship between outputs and targets or its absence respectively the performance of these 288 networks was ranked according to their mean squared error mse and regression value r based on the validation set results from the evaluation of each one of the 18 architectures tested are presented in table 1 the second column in the table shows the number of nodes per layer input layer hidden layer s output layer the number of nodes of the input and output layer is by default equal to 4 and 1 respectively corresponding to the dimensions of the input and output vectors the number of neurons and its distribution among the hidden layers varies the minimum mean squared error values and the maximum regression values for each one of the 18 architectures obtained with the 16 combinations of training algorithms and activation functions both for the training and validation sets of data are presented in table 1 the ten networks that presented the lower values of mse and the ten networks with the higher values of r based on the validation dataset were selected for further testing according to the above selection criteria and due to the observed overlapping between them six networks were eventually identified for further study the architecture and the activation functions of these networks are presented in table 2 the first digit of their code numbers corresponds to the serial number of their architecture the second one to the training algorithm used and the third one to the combination of activation functions as described in fig 5 the most important factor associated with improved mse and r values was the training algorithm the levenberg marquardt training algorithm presented the best results in comparison with the other three training algorithms that were tested with respect to the pairs of activation functions the networks that consisted only of logistic sigmoid neurons presented the worst performance as a result the networks selected for further study were using the levenberg marquardt algorithm while the networks with only logistic sigmoid neurons were excluded the objective of the second stage of trials was to determine the most appropriate learning algorithm and rate to this end tests were carried out using six different learning rates 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and two learning algorithms the gradient descent weight and bias used also during the first stage and the gradient descent with momentum weight and bias as a result a total of 72 networks were tested fig 6 the available data was divided into training validation and test dataset with ratios 80 12 and 8 respectively for each one of the six networks listed in table 2 the minimum mse and maximum r values obtained by the 12 combinations of learning rates and learning algorithms for the training validation and test data set are presented in table 3 5 discussion of results a series of neural networks has been developed trained and tested for the prediction of calm water resistance of marad type hullforms as already mentioned this work was conducted in two stages in the first stage the most promising network configurations i e combinations of architecture training algorithm and pairs of activation functions were determined in the second stage the selected combinations were tested using 12 pairs of learning algorithms and rates fig 6 aiming to obtain improved results the networks constructed in the second stage presented better validation mse and r values i e mse and r values based on the validation set compared to those of the first stage the validation mse value was reduced by 52 9 96 9 while the increase of the r value varied between 0 7 and 3 1 since r values were already very high the actual improvement may be better observed by looking at the 1 r values which showed a reduction of 46 7 98 2 fig 7 the two networks that showed the lowest validation and test mse values were selected for the prediction of the residual resistance coefficient and subsequently the resistance of hullforms based on the marad systematic series the architecture of the first neural network herein denoted as mlp1 is illustrated in fig 8 it comprises two hidden layers with 16 and 8 hyperbolic tangent sigmoid neurons each and a linear output the levenberg marquardt training algorithm was used along with the gradient descent with weight and bias learning algorithm and a learning rate equal to 0 20 the progression of the mse value during training is presented in fig 9 the training stopped when a minimum value of mse for the validation dataset was reached this network was selected for its low validation mse reached in 105th epoch of the training process the mses based on the training and validation sets are relatively higher than that based on the test set after the training process was completed scatter diagrams comparing the actual output of the network with the desired one for all three datasets i e training validation test were generated see fig 10 larger deviations between the actual and the desired output values may be observed in the scatter diagram corresponding to the training set this is an expected result since the network uses this set for updating its parameters while validation and test sets are used for the evaluation of its predictive ability much smaller deviations are observed in the scatter diagrams corresponding to the validation and test data sets which present an almost linear relationship between actual and target outputs with r values over 0 999 for both of them the architecture of the second network denoted as mlp2 is composed by four hidden layers of 16 12 8 and 4 hyperbolic tangent neurons each and one linear output layer fig 11 the same training algorithm as for mlp1 was used but the gradient descent with momentum bias and weight learning algorithm and a learning rate equal to 0 15 were applied the training stopped in the 43rd epoch the lower mse value was obtained by the test set fig 12 the r values for this network were also very high with the one corresponding to the test set being the higher fig 13 the two selected networks were used to evaluate the residual resistance coefficient of three marad hullforms listed in table 4 it should be noted that data from these hulls were not included in the training validation and test datasets used for the training and evaluation of the networks for all three ships the results derived by both networks presented very small deviations from the target values and between them figs 14 16 predictions were conducted for froude numbers up to 0 18 and in some cases up to 0 19 which are quite high when compared to froude numbers of existing full form vessels of similar size however since the marad diagrams are extending up to these values it was decided to use the full range of available data the results from the calculation of the total resistance based on the experimental cr values and those estimated by the neural networks for the three hullforms are compared in tables 5 7 as well as in figs 17 19 the predictions by mlp1 and mlp2 for the three ships present very low deviations from the experimental values in the order of 0 1 1 8 for both networks 6 conclusions the present paper investigates the possibility of using artificial neural networks for the prediction of resistance of full ships designed according to the marad hullforms the data for the training and evaluation of the networks were obtained from a series of diagrams illustrating the residual resistance coefficient c r of the sixteen marad hullforms at the full load condition for a range of froude numbers a large number of multi layer perceptron neural networks were trained and evaluated initially a total number of 288 networks were developed in this stage the learning algorithm and rate were kept constant while combinations of different architectures training algorithms and pairs of activation functions were tested based on their performance on a validation data set six networks of specific architecture training algorithm and pair of activation functions were selected for further study in the second stage of trials these six networks were tested using six learning rates and two learning functions while their other characteristics remained constant finally the two networks that presented the lower mean squared error on the validation dataset were selected in order to illustrate the ability of these two networks to provide accurate resistance predictions results have been presented comparing their predictions for three ships based on marad hullforms with those derived from the experimental results multi layer perceptron neural networks proved to be effective in the evaluation of resistance of marad hullforms with geometric characteristics within the limits of training data with maximum deviation less than 2 based on the presented results it may be argued that properly designed and trained multi layer perceptron neural networks proved to be rather effective in the evaluation of resistance of marad hullforms considering their successful performance in the case of the marad series they are expected to be equally suitable for the calculation of the calm water resistance of ships designed according to other systematic series in addition they could be also used in order to provide fast and accurate predictions based on training sets derived from the systematic application of cfd calculations for selected hullform types and speed ranges if such networks are available and properly trained they can provide the basis for systematic hullform optimisations taking into account not only resistance predictions but also other important aspects of a ship s hydrodynamic performance such as propulsion power manoeuvering characteristics and seakeeping responses

reflected the state 2 2 i e the sum of the neuron s inputs of the neuron in order for the neuron to be activated the sum of the excitatory signals had to exceed a threshold value t while inhibitory signals were absent in variations of this model positive and negative stimulations were of the same importance due to the use of adequate linear weights haykin 1999 russell and norvig 1995 there were numerous milestones in the field of neural networks since they were originally introduced regarding the architecture of the networks and their learning process hebbian learning is one of the oldest learning algorithms based on the dynamics of biological systems hebb 1949 according to this hypothesis when the neurons connected by a synapse are stimulated repeatedly and simultaneously this synapse becomes stronger and the neurons are connected more effectively in terms of anns this is accomplished with the increase of synaptic weights haykin 1999 russell and norvig 1995 one of the first anns to be developed was the perceptron presented by rosenblatt 1958 this simple neural network was a binary classifier based on the mcculloch pitts neuron and had the ability of updating its weights via a supervised learning method minsky and papert 1969 analysed it and proved mathematically that a single layer network is not able to solve more complex problems such as linear classification in more than two classes back propagation learning algorithm revived the interest for neural networks in the mid 80s when it was used in numerous different problems this algorithm adapts the synaptic weights in a way that minimizes the mean square error between the actual and desired output haykin 1999 rojas 1996 it was at that time when many research programs regarding neural networks were initiated as a result their application expanded in more complex and practical problems autonomous drivers weather or stock value predictions image recognition and optimal path selection could be solved with anns zurada 1992 2 2 artificial neural network architectures an artificial neural network consists of a distribution of interconnected neurons arranged in layers its architecture is defined by the number of its layers the kind of neural synapses and the learning algorithm used according to the first characteristic they may be distinguished in single layer and multi layer networks the first type of networks contains only one layer of neurons as its output layer while the later has hidden layers between the input and the output layer with respect to the kind of their neural synapses networks may be characterized as feed forward and recurrent the data in feed forward networks flow in one direction from the input layer to the output through the hidden layers if existent recurrent networks contain at least one feedback interconnection which links the output of a neuron with the input of another placed at the same or previous layer a network can be also characterized as fully or partially connected if every node is connected with every node of its forward layer or not a fundamental feature of anns is their ability to learn for this purpose they adjust the weights of their connections and threshold values in order to present a satisfactory behaviour according to a prescribed criterion there are three different learning techniques supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning in supervised learning the network is provided with a series of input and output pairs in order to find a function that connects them this procedure is evaluated by a cost function usually the mean square error between actual and desired output which needs to be minimized in unsupervised learning the network has to classify the input data finding a patern without external information in reinforcement learning the network is in continuous communication with its environment which rewards or not the input output mapping that has been achieved in order to minimize a performance indicator 2 3 feed forward multi layer perceptron one of the most widely used neural networks is the feed forward multi layer perceptron mlp mlps are considered particularly suitable for function approximation data classification or pattern recognition problems therefore they have been selected to be used in the present study an mlp consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer fig 1 the number of the input and output nodes is equal to the dimension of the input and output data respectively the signal is transferred in the forward direction from the input to the output layer haykin 1999 every node except for the input layers is a neuron with a differentiable activation function that generates its output haykin 1999 sigmoid transfer functions such as logistic sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent sigmoid are usually preferred as activation functions for mlps because consecutive layers of neurons with non linear activation functions enable the network to learn non linear relationships between input and output data the linear transfer function is often used for the neurons of the output layer the logistic sigmoid function is given by eq 1 while its graphical representation is illustrated in fig 2 1 y k f u k 1 1 e u k the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function is given by eq 2 and its graphical representation is illustrated in fig 3 2 y k f u k 1 e u k 1 e u k in the above equations y k is the output of the kth neuron and u k is the weighted sum of its input synapses in mlps a popular supervised learning method capable of handling complicated learning problems is the back propagation algorithm bp a gradient descent technique with backward error propagation this algorithm is based on the error correction learning rule and is executed in two stages in the first stage the input signal is transferred through the layers in order for the output signal to be derived during this phase the synaptic weights remain constant then the mean square error of the deviation between the actual response of the network and the desired output is calculated in the second stage these deviations are transferred backwards and the synaptic weights change accordingly so that the average squared error is minimized this cost function is given by eq 3 3 e a v 1 t t e t 1 t t 1 2 k d k t y k t 2 where k is the number of neurons in the output layer t the number of input output patterns in the training set d k t and y k t the target and actual output of the kth neuron haykin 1999 a learning function is utilized for the adjustment of the weights e g the gradient descent learning rule known as delta rule the correction of the weights is given by eq 4 4 δ w k i η e t w k i t where η is the learning rate parameter which controls the rate of adaptation of the weights and bias and affects the speed of convergence of the training process haykin 1999 2 3 1 training algorithms the training algorithm is used to train the neural network to recognize a certain input and map it to the corresponding output back propagation algorithms can be distinguished into gradient descent newton gauss conjugate gradient and quasi newton algorithms in this study three gradient descent algorithms and one quasi newton algorithm were utilized 2 3 1 1 gradient descent algorithms they are first order optimisation algorithms that employ the gradient vector of the cost function to decide the direction of the training always pointing towards its negative value snyman 2005 in the gradient descent back propagation algorithm also known as steepest descent the weights and biases are updated in the direction of the negative gradient of the performance function the gradient descent with adaptive learning rate back propagation algorithm enables changes to the learning rate throughout the training in this way the learning rate adapts to the local complexity of the error surface a higher learning rate is accepted as far as the learning process stability is ensured otherwise the learning rate is decreased as necessary hagan et al 2014 the gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation combines adaptive learning with momentum training it is invoked in the same way as the gradient descent with adaptive learning with the addition of a momentum coefficient as training parameter introduced to help the algorithm escaping from a shallow local minimum 2 3 1 2 quasi newton algorithms newton s algorithm is a second order optimisation algorithm that requires the calculation of a hessian matrix containing the second derivatives of the errors quasi newton algorithms approximate the hessian without the need of calculating second derivatives hagan et al 2014 for small or medium sized networks the levenberg marquardt levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 training algorithm is most frequently used the update of the weights is defined as follows 5 w m 1 w m j t j μ i 1 j t e where j is the jacobian matrix of the first derivatives of the network s errors with respect to its weights and biases e the vector of network s errors w m the weights vector after the m th step and μ a positive parameter beale et al 2015 2 3 2 learning algorithms the learning algorithm defines the way that weights and bias of the network will be updated during the training two different learning algorithms were utilized in this study the gradient descent weight and bias and the gradient descent with momentum weight and bias 2 3 3 data sets the available data for the network training are usually divided into three mutually exclusive sets the training set is used for the update of weights and biases of the network in order for the cost function to be minimized the validation set is used for the tuning of parameters other than weights and for comparison between different neural networks the test set is used for the evaluation of the network s predictive ability the available data are randomly distributed into the three datasets 3 marad systematic series the marad systematic series was developed by the u s maritime administration roseman and seibold 1987 1985 aiming to respond to the rising interest for full hull form merchant ships and the lack of systematic data regarding the performance of these vessels that could be used in the design process as a result this systematic series is characterized by high block coefficient values c b low length to beam ratios l b and high breadth to draft ratios b t were also adopted for economic and operational reasons i e draft restrictions respectively a cylindrical bow shape was selected as a means of achieving lower resistance values for full form hulls whilst the stern was designed taking into account hydrodynamic issues such as flow separation sets of lines were developed for the parent and the offspring hulls as a combination of three segments the entrance the parallel mid body and two alternative run segments a short and a long one sixteen models were constructed and tank tested in order to obtain their calm water resistance and manoeuvering characteristics their longitudinal centre of buoyancy lcb was placed 2 5 of length forward of amidships as a result of preliminary resistance tests the sixteen hulls comprising the marad series are characterized by their block coefficient c b their beam to draft ratio b t and length to beam ratio l b as shown in fig 4 roseman and seibold 1987 bare hull resistance tests were performed for the sixteen hulls at full load and ballast condition the obtained results were presented in diagrams in the form of the residual resistance coefficient c r defined as follows 6 c r c t m c f m r 1 2 ρ s υ 2 c f m where r tm is the model s total measured resistance s is its wetted surface υ is its speed c tm and c fm are its total and frictional resistance coefficient respectively and ρ is the mass density of water in the basin c fm is expressed by the 1975 ittc formula as a function of reynold s number r n 7 c f 0 075 log 10 r n 2 2 the diagrams provided by the marad systematic series illustrate c r versus l b or b t for a series of froude numbers fn for given values of block coefficient c b and b t or l b respectively five diagrams for full load and five for ballast condition are included in roseman and seibold 1987 those corresponding to the full load condition were used in this study a number of 1983 points in total were obtained from these diagrams characterized by five variables fn l b b t c b c r 4 development of the neural networks the development of the anns for the approximation of the resistance of ships designed according to the marad series was carried out using the matlab neural networks toolbox beale et al 2015 the mathworks inc 2018 which provides tools for designing implementing visualizing and simulating neural networks the data required for the networks training were obtained from a series of diagrams provided in roseman and seibold 1987 in the form of pairs of four dimensional input vectors and scalar outputs the input vector consists of the length to breadth ratio l b the breadth to draft ratio b t the block coefficient c b and the froude number fn while the output is the residual resistance coefficient c r as already stated among the various types of anns multi layer perceptron networks mlps have been selected for the present study as they are considered particularly suitable for function approximation problems in order to identify the mlp that suits better to the problem at hand several trials have been conducted with different configurations each configuration is determined by the number of hidden layers used the number and type of neurons that comprise each one of them the training algorithm learning algorithm and rate beale et al 2015 in total 18 different network architectures have been tested for each one of them 16 different networks have been implemented based on a combination of four back propagation training algorithms and four different pairs of activation functions the training algorithms used for this study are the levenberg marquardt gradient descent gradient descent with adaptive learning rate and gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate four combinations of three different activation functions have been used i e the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid herein denoted as t the pure linear denoted as p and the logistic sigmoid function denoted as l as a result 288 networks were constructed and tested during this initial stage of trials the gradient descent weight and bias learning algorithm was used and the learning rate was set to 0 02 the available data was separated into mutually exclusive training 80 and validation 20 sets the validation set comprises data unknown to the trained network and is usually used for the comparison and ranking of different network configurations a graphical description of this stage of trials is given in fig 5 for each one of these 288 networks the corresponding mean squared error mse and regression value r were calculated based on the training and validation sets of data the regression value is an indicator of the relationship between the actual and target outputs and its absolute value ranges between one and zero suggesting the existence of an exact linear relationship between outputs and targets or its absence respectively the performance of these 288 networks was ranked according to their mean squared error mse and regression value r based on the validation set results from the evaluation of each one of the 18 architectures tested are presented in table 1 the second column in the table shows the number of nodes per layer input layer hidden layer s output layer the number of nodes of the input and output layer is by default equal to 4 and 1 respectively corresponding to the dimensions of the input and output vectors the number of neurons and its distribution among the hidden layers varies the minimum mean squared error values and the maximum regression values for each one of the 18 architectures obtained with the 16 combinations of training algorithms and activation functions both for the training and validation sets of data are presented in table 1 the ten networks that presented the lower values of mse and the ten networks with the higher values of r based on the validation dataset were selected for further testing according to the above selection criteria and due to the observed overlapping between them six networks were eventually identified for further study the architecture and the activation functions of these networks are presented in table 2 the first digit of their code numbers corresponds to the serial number of their architecture the second one to the training algorithm used and the third one to the combination of activation functions as described in fig 5 the most important factor associated with improved mse and r values was the training algorithm the levenberg marquardt training algorithm presented the best results in comparison with the other three training algorithms that were tested with respect to the pairs of activation functions the networks that consisted only of logistic sigmoid neurons presented the worst performance as a result the networks selected for further study were using the levenberg marquardt algorithm while the networks with only logistic sigmoid neurons were excluded the objective of the second stage of trials was to determine the most appropriate learning algorithm and rate to this end tests were carried out using six different learning rates 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and two learning algorithms the gradient descent weight and bias used also during the first stage and the gradient descent with momentum weight and bias as a result a total of 72 networks were tested fig 6 the available data was divided into training validation and test dataset with ratios 80 12 and 8 respectively for each one of the six networks listed in table 2 the minimum mse and maximum r values obtained by the 12 combinations of learning rates and learning algorithms for the training validation and test data set are presented in table 3 5 discussion of results a series of neural networks has been developed trained and tested for the prediction of calm water resistance of marad type hullforms as already mentioned this work was conducted in two stages in the first stage the most promising network configurations i e combinations of architecture training algorithm and pairs of activation functions were determined in the second stage the selected combinations were tested using 12 pairs of learning algorithms and rates fig 6 aiming to obtain improved results the networks constructed in the second stage presented better validation mse and r values i e mse and r values based on the validation set compared to those of the first stage the validation mse value was reduced by 52 9 96 9 while the increase of the r value varied between 0 7 and 3 1 since r values were already very high the actual improvement may be better observed by looking at the 1 r values which showed a reduction of 46 7 98 2 fig 7 the two networks that showed the lowest validation and test mse values were selected for the prediction of the residual resistance coefficient and subsequently the resistance of hullforms based on the marad systematic series the architecture of the first neural network herein denoted as mlp1 is illustrated in fig 8 it comprises two hidden layers with 16 and 8 hyperbolic tangent sigmoid neurons each and a linear output the levenberg marquardt training algorithm was used along with the gradient descent with weight and bias learning algorithm and a learning rate equal to 0 20 the progression of the mse value during training is presented in fig 9 the training stopped when a minimum value of mse for the validation dataset was reached this network was selected for its low validation mse reached in 105th epoch of the training process the mses based on the training and validation sets are relatively higher than that based on the test set after the training process was completed scatter diagrams comparing the actual output of the network with the desired one for all three datasets i e training validation test were generated see fig 10 larger deviations between the actual and the desired output values may be observed in the scatter diagram corresponding to the training set this is an expected result since the network uses this set for updating its parameters while validation and test sets are used for the evaluation of its predictive ability much smaller deviations are observed in the scatter diagrams corresponding to the validation and test data sets which present an almost linear relationship between actual and target outputs with r values over 0 999 for both of them the architecture of the second network denoted as mlp2 is composed by four hidden layers of 16 12 8 and 4 hyperbolic tangent neurons each and one linear output layer fig 11 the same training algorithm as for mlp1 was used but the gradient descent with momentum bias and weight learning algorithm and a learning rate equal to 0 15 were applied the training stopped in the 43rd epoch the lower mse value was obtained by the test set fig 12 the r values for this network were also very high with the one corresponding to the test set being the higher fig 13 the two selected networks were used to evaluate the residual resistance coefficient of three marad hullforms listed in table 4 it should be noted that data from these hulls were not included in the training validation and test datasets used for the training and evaluation of the networks for all three ships the results derived by both networks presented very small deviations from the target values and between them figs 14 16 predictions were conducted for froude numbers up to 0 18 and in some cases up to 0 19 which are quite high when compared to froude numbers of existing full form vessels of similar size however since the marad diagrams are extending up to these values it was decided to use the full range of available data the results from the calculation of the total resistance based on the experimental cr values and those estimated by the neural networks for the three hullforms are compared in tables 5 7 as well as in figs 17 19 the predictions by mlp1 and mlp2 for the three ships present very low deviations from the experimental values in the order of 0 1 1 8 for both networks 6 conclusions the present paper investigates the possibility of using artificial neural networks for the prediction of resistance of full ships designed according to the marad hullforms the data for the training and evaluation of the networks were obtained from a series of diagrams illustrating the residual resistance coefficient c r of the sixteen marad hullforms at the full load condition for a range of froude numbers a large number of multi layer perceptron neural networks were trained and evaluated initially a total number of 288 networks were developed in this stage the learning algorithm and rate were kept constant while combinations of different architectures training algorithms and pairs of activation functions were tested based on their performance on a validation data set six networks of specific architecture training algorithm and pair of activation functions were selected for further study in the second stage of trials these six networks were tested using six learning rates and two learning functions while their other characteristics remained constant finally the two networks that presented the lower mean squared error on the validation dataset were selected in order to illustrate the ability of these two networks to provide accurate resistance predictions results have been presented comparing their predictions for three ships based on marad hullforms with those derived from the experimental results multi layer perceptron neural networks proved to be effective in the evaluation of resistance of marad hullforms with geometric characteristics within the limits of training data with maximum deviation less than 2 based on the presented results it may be argued that properly designed and trained multi layer perceptron neural networks proved to be rather effective in the evaluation of resistance of marad hullforms considering their successful performance in the case of the marad series they are expected to be equally suitable for the calculation of the calm water resistance of ships designed according to other systematic series in addition they could be also used in order to provide fast and accurate predictions based on training sets derived from the systematic application of cfd calculations for selected hullform types and speed ranges if such networks are available and properly trained they can provide the basis for systematic hullform optimisations taking into account not only resistance predictions but also other important aspects of a ship s hydrodynamic performance such as propulsion power manoeuvering characteristics and seakeeping responses 
23164,extensive experiments were made in this study to investigate the effects of tmd tuned mass damper tld tuned liquid damper and a hybrid tmd tld on structure motion control different mass ratios of tmd and different liquid depth ratios of tld were studied and various tmd tld were used to determine the optimal hybrid tmd tld system for a tld system the liquid depth ratio do l do liquid depth l tank width must be smaller than 0 4 to have significant response reduction besides the maximum motion reduction can be obtained when the liquid depth ratio decreases to 0 2 and the motion reduction rate can reach nearly 70 the maximum motion reduction always occurs when the exciting frequency is equal to the fundamental frequency of the tld however the violent sloshing of liquid in the tld tank with small liquid depth ratio is found in the experiments for a tmd system the tmd mass ratio must be greater than 10 to have a notable response reduction the addition of tmd to the tld and base structure system can calm down the violent sloshing of liquid in tld tank and the hybrid tmd tld has the best performance of the structure motion control keywords tmd tld hybrid tmd tld motion reduction control 1 introduction earthquakes frequently occur in taiwan and the reduction of the seismic response of high rise structures such as taipei 101 becomes an important engineering topic as early as 1911 frahm designed a tuned mass device to reduce the dynamic response of a structure under a harmonic excitation and it might be the first tuned mass damper tmd ormondroyd and den hartog 1928 developed an instrument which can change the natural frequency of the structure system to reduce the dynamic response and they reported a formula to describe the best natural frequency absorption rate and also found the optimal mass ratio of tmd to the structure since then tmd is frequently used in the structures for motion reduction control mcnamara 1977 started to include tmd as parts of the architecture design parameters and tmd becomes the most commonly used damping devices hoang and warnitchai 2005 kareem and kline 1995 tmd has been implemented in many high rise buildings such as in the condo tower in san francisco and the citicorp building in new york city and the largest tmd in the world was installed at the taipei 101 in taipei city jabary and madabhushi 2015 reported a series of geotechnical centrifuge tests and he investigated the effects of tmds on the response of a multiple story sway frame structure undergoing dynamic soil structure interaction ssi yoyong arfiadi 2016 suggested the optimization of composite tuned mass dampers in reducing the response of structures subject to earthquake arfiadi 2017 further reported nonlinear control of buildings utilizing composite tuned mass dampers subject to earthquakes sakr 2017 proposed an innovative technique for using partial floor loads as multiple tmds at a limited number of floors his technique eliminates complications resulting from the addition of huge masses required for response control and maintains the mass of the original structure without any added loads miranda 2013 studied tuned mass dampers tmds resulting in high modal damping for mechanical systems incorporating such devices for seismic response reduction aswathy and krishna 2017 reported a review paper on tuned mass damper and detailed describe the idea behind the various type of dampers and found when a smaller mass is attached to the multiple degrees of freedom system and its parameters are tuned precisely then the oscillation of the whole system can be reduced by this smaller mass the equations of motion of a base structure mounted with a tuned mass damper can be expressed as soto and adeli 2013 chen and huang 2015 1 μ t m d x s 2 ξ g ω s x s ω s 2 x s p m d μ t m d x t m d x t m d 2 ξ d ω d x t m d ω d 2 x t m d x s where μtmd mass ratio of tmd to the system ωs and ωd are fundamental frequencies of the base structure and tmd respectively ξs and ξd are the damping ratio of the base structure and tmd respectively xs and xd are displacement of the base structure and tmd respectively and p is the external exciting force in 2007 bakre and jangid made a numerical study to find the optimal parameters damping and tuning frequency of the tmd the mass ratio considered in their study is from 0 005 to 0 1 they summarized that the damping of tmd is not influenced by the damping of the main system while the optimal tuning frequency of tmd is significantly affected by the damping of the system to have better motion reduction say 40 the mass ratio of tmd must increase to 2 and the corresponding damping ratio must increase twice larger while for a motion reduction to 70 the mass ratio must increase to 10 and the damping of tmd must increase even five times larger although the optimal damping of tmd can be electrically obtained by rlc circuit li et al 2013 the mass ratio of tmd still must be increased to a certain value to have notable motion reduction albeit the tmd has been regarded as a traditional seismic reduction system the tmd in general works well at a specific exciting frequency however the environmental loadings such wind wave and earthquakes always contain multiple exciting frequencies and the researchers and the engineers started to study the new type of the damper system and tld was reported tlds were gradually installed in the high rise structures as well as ships one of the advantages of tld is the fundamental frequency of the tank can be changed according to the exciting frequency and the required fundamental frequency can obtained by properly filling liquid depth in the tanks the researchers reported by xu et al 1992 balendra et al 1995 et al sadek et al 1998 fujino et al 1992 marivani and hamed 2009 yamamoto and kawahara 1999 yang et al 2003 and chen and huang 2015 have found that tld does have the excellent seismic response reduction on a structure under earthquake loadings theoretically the simulation of tld was usually made by solving the continuity equation and momentum equation of motion of liquid in tank along with the fully nonlinear kinematic free surface condition and those equations can be expressed as chen and hung 2015 marivani and hamed 2009 continuity equation u x w z 0 momentum equation of motion u t u u x w u z 1 ρ p x x s w t u w x w w z g 1 ρ p z kinematic free surface condition h t u h x w where u w are liquid velocities in x and z direction respectively p is the hydrodynamic pressure ρ is liquid density and h is the liquid surface displacement the numerical method has been used to solve for the above equations e g banerji et al 2000 and chen and huang 2015 among many others they reported a numerical simulations of a sdof structure with a tld and subjected to both real and artificially generated earthquake ground motions their results show that a properly designed tld can significantly reduce the structure s response their simulations suggested the fundamental frequency of tld can be tuned to the structure s natural frequency and the tld is more effective in reducing structural response as the ground excitation level increases banerji et al found the sloshing as well as the wave breaking will results in the motion reduction of the structure they also reported that a larger water depth and a larger water mass to structure mass ratio are shown to be required for a tld to remain equally effective as structural damping increases they also suggested a practical approach for the design of a tld to control earthquake response shad and adnan 2013 used ansys software to study the effect of tld on structure motion reduction and also concluded that the frequency of tld tuned with the structure will have the best structure motion reduction tait et al 2008 made extensive numerical as well as experimental studies to report the performance of the tuned liquid dampers which was measured in terms of efficiency and robustness they made a series of experimental tests on tmd systems to evaluate their performance and compared the results to that of the existed reported tmds roy and ghosh 2012 also used a numerical method to carry out a study of a tld system on the response reduction of an elevated water tank as listed in the above literatures among others the tuned tld frequency with structures is the key on response reduction of a structure however in all the above studies the precise physics explanation of the phenomenon are still incomplete besides the hybrid tmd and tld on structure motion control is rarely studied and reported sun et al 1992 reported experimental studies and suggested the optimum value of the liquid frequency is near the excitation frequency that the liquid in tld is in resonance with tank motion the researchers and engineers then simply suggested the tld frequency tuned to equal to that of structure will have best structure motion reduction in this study we will clarify the optimal value of the tld frequency on structure motion reduction control that is exactly equal to the exciting frequency while fujino et al 1988 reported some disadvantage of tld that the violent sloshing occurred during a resonant excitation and it could not quickly calm down and might affect the stability of the structure in this study we showed the addition of tmd to tld can resolve the violent sloshing wave and also increase the motion reduction of the structure in this study a hybrid tmd and tld are attached to a base structure bs and the effect of hybrid tuned mass and liquid dampers on dynamic structure response control is experimentally studied the advantages of tmd simple and easy installation and that of tld frequency flexibly changeable are combined in the hybrid damper system to increase the damper efficiency of the base structure section 2 describes the experimental setup and test cases because of the budget limit the damping of the tmd and main bs system are fixed and only three different mass ratios of tmd were considered however various liquid depth ratios of tld were considered in the study section 3 reports the measured results and gives a detailed discussion of the observed data and the final section describes the conclusions of this study 2 experimental setup in this study four different experimental models were included the conceptual sketches of the experimental setup are depicted in fig 1 the first model is a base structure bs which is composed by a steel plate on which an acryl tank is attached and the tank without liquid filled is also regarded as part of the base structure the tank size used in this study is 30 30 45 cm and the total weight of the bs is 46 kg the bs is attached and horizontally movable on a steel plate which is attached with a spring with a stiffness of 3040 n m the second model is a bs tld and the tanks of the first model are partially filled with liquid the third model is the first model plus a tmd which is composed of a steel box and a slider weight is attached with a spring to the bs with a spring stiffness of 122 n m no liquid is filled in the tank of the third model the fourth model is a hybrid tmd tld system whose configuration is basically the same as the third model except the liquid is partially filled in the tank the detailed mass ratios of tmd and liquid depth ratios of tld are listed in the tables described in the later sections as illustrated in fig 2 the photograph of the bs with empty liquid tank attached to a shaking table can be moved back and forth by an ac motor the maximum moving distance r of the shaking table is 30 mm and the highest revolutions of the motor is 2000 rpm the frequency level depends on the limitation of the maximum velocity implemented by the ac motor and the motor reducer in this experiment work the maximum velocity v m ω r of the shaking table is 30 mm s the material of the tank is acryl with 20 mm thickness the displacement responses at the base have been acquired using keyence laser displacement meter il 300 the measurement capability is 999 mm the sloshing displacement of liquid in tld is acquired using ncku wave probe and the measurement capability is 0 005 m 4 5 m 3 results and discussions in this section various damper systems are introduced the prominent motion controls are reported and the related physics are discussed 3 1 base structure system the mass of the base structure is 46 kg and the attached spring stiffness is k 3040 n m the free vibration experiment was first made to evaluate the damping coefficient of the system fig 3 shows the decay history of the dynamic displacement and the damping ratio of the experimental set up can be calculated according to the following equation ln x 1 x j 2 π j ζ 1 ζ 2 according to the decay history the damping ratio ζ 0 028 was determined the damping coefficient c 21 17 is then obtained by ζ c 2 m k to confirm the accuracy of experimental measurements the fundamental frequency of the base structure system was checked the base structure was excited by a harmonic force f t a ω x sin ω x t a runge kutta rk method is used to calculate the corresponding dynamic displacement response and fig 4 shows the comparison of the rk solution and the experimental measurements and the agreement is very good the dynamic displacements measured in this section will also be used as the dynamic response of bs without damper system and as a reference to evaluate the effects of tmd tld and hybrid tmd tld on response reduction of the base structure

the liquid tank ω s is the natural frequency of bs system and ω x is the exciting frequency the harmonic exciting force is f t a ω x 2 sin ω x t and a 0 003 m is the excited amplitude nine different liquid depths were used and they are d o l 2 30 4 30 6 30 8 30 10 30 12 30 15 30 20 30 and 30 30 fig 5 a shows the dynamic displacements of the bs tld with various liquid depths filled in the tank and the results of bs are also shown in the figure as can be seen in the figure the resonant frequency of the bs tld system is shift to the left also as depicted in the figure for liquid depth ratio 20 30 as an example the motion of the system is nearly zero when the exciting frequency is equal to 1 4 ωs that is exactly equal to the fundamental frequency of the tld noted that ω s ω 1 0 69 0 69 of d o l 20 30 d o l 20 30 20 30 and 1 4 ωs ω1 0 97 similar phenomena can be found in the other liquid depth ratios and the displacement response is suppressed to nearly zero once the exciting frequency is close to the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank the numerical simulation made by chen and huang 2015 also showed the similar characteristics in that simulation they found the phases of the sloshing force and the exciting force is out of phase when the exciting frequency is close to the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank also found in fig 5a the response peak decreases as does the liquid depth in the tank we then further made two more experiments with the smaller liquid depths 4 cm and 2 cm fig 5b shows the corresponding measurements and the results shown in the figure imply no further response reduction and the tld with a liquid depth ratio 6 30 has the best structural displacement reduction fig 6 illustrates the contour of the dynamic displacement versus various combinations of the excitation frequencies the reduction amount of the tld with liquid depth ratio d o l 6 30 is much smaller than that of d o l 20 30 also can be seen in the figure the best reduction of the dynamic displacement always occurs when the excitation frequency is close the natural frequency of the tld no matter what the liquid depth ratio is fig 7 shows the sloshing waves in the tld under a near resonant excitation frequency as shown in fig 7 a 1 a 2 the liquid depth is 6 cm only and the sloshing waves is breaking and slamming against the tank walls which create large resistance force opposite to the external force and the dynamic response of the system is therefore prominently reduced for the cases of do l 20 30 and 30 30 the sloshing waves behave like a bore and neither breaking nor slamming occur whereas the sloshing displacements are much larger than those of tld with smaller liquid depths the tld with larger liquid depths also has a significant effect on dynamic response control but the reduction is smaller than that of the case of do l 6 30 3 3 tuned mass damper tmd in this section the effect of tmd on bs motion control was investigated table 2 lists the parameters used for the experiments made in this section the stiffness of the springs attached to bs and tmd were k 3040 n m and k 122 6 n m respectively the exciting force was the same as that used in the previous section fig 8 shows the maximum dynamic displacement responses of tmd bs system versus various exciting frequencies as shown in the figure the resonant frequency of the tmd bs system is shifted to the left and decreases as the weight of tmd increases and only 10 of the dynamic displacement is reduced if the mass ratio μ m is less than 8 whereas the profound suppression 70 of dynamic displacement of bs can be obtained when the mass of the mass ratio of tmd to tmd bs is larger than 15 3 4hybrid tmd tld system in this section a hybrid tmd tld system is introduced the same parameters of tmd used in the previous section are also used in this section and four different liquid depths in tld tank were used the detailed parameters used are listed in table 3 fig 9 depicts the measured maximum dynamic displacements versus various exciting frequencies as shown in the figure for a hybrid tmd tld system with a large liquid depth ω e 20 30 and a tmd weight 5 3 kg the suppressing effects are limited and the response reduction is only less than 2 compare the results shown in figs 7 and 9 the addition of tmd to tld bs system with a small tmd weight does not provide more contribution to response reduction and only mildly decreases the suppression magnitude of the dynamic displacement when the tmd weight increases to 7 3 kg or the weight ratio of tmd increases to 11 2 the addition of tmd to tld bs system does increase the response reduction to a profound amount fig 9 also illustrates the significant increase of the suppression of the resonant dynamic displacement of the system when the weight of tmd 11 2 7 3 kg or 14 3 9 3 kg is added to tld bs system for a liquid depth ratio is equal to 0 4 12 30 50 more displacement suppression can be obtained for a hybrid tmd tld bs system than that of a tld bs system the largest response suppression is 66 displacement suppression and occurs at a hybrid tmd tld bs with a liquid depth ratio 0 2 6 30 and tmd mass ratio μ t m d 0 122 see table 4 fig 10 further depicts the contour plots of the maximum dynamic displacement of hybrid tmd tld system under various excitation frequencies using the same liquid depth in tld d o l 20 30 one can easily find the largest displacement reduction occurred in the same small region no matter what the weight of tmd has the small region is located at ω x ω s 1 55 1 65 and ω x ω 1 1 0 1 1 which indicates the best dynamic response control can be obtained when the exciting frequency is equal to or near the natural frequency of the liquid in the tld tank in other words once we can predict or monitor the range of the excitation frequency the best liquid depth needed to be filled in the tld tank can be determined for a tld with low filled liquid depth say ω s 0 2 the sloshing waves are easily breaking and plunging wave breakers are also frequently found and the air pockets may occur the plunge waves with bubbles collapse will generate inevitable profound high pressure and may cause possible damage to the structures with the addition of tmd to the tld bs system violently sloshing disappears in the tld tank fig 11 shows the instant sloshing waves in the tld of the hybrid tmd tld bs system the sloshing waves are more gentle and smooth than those of tld bs system as shown in fig 7 the addition of tmd on the system will not only provide a certain contribution to the reduction of the base structure motion but also clam the sloshing waves in the tld tank and both the slamming waves and breaking waves are seldom triggered when the tmd is added to the tld bs system besides fig 12 depicts the relationship between the elevation of probes 1 and 2 at tld tank when the systems are under near resonant frequency as shown in the figure the swirling waves turn to the single directional waves when the tmd is added to the system whereas the swirling wave occurred at a tld bs system that the tmd is not attached in other words the addition of tmd to tld bs system not only prevent the violent sloshing waves but also diminish the swirling wave occurrence and the hybrid tmd tld bs system will be much more stable than tld bs system when they are under a resonant excitation 3 5hybrid tmd tld with constant total weight and μ t m d 0 112 in the previous section the total weight of the hybrid tmd tld system is varied when the liquid depth in tld changes and the natural frequency of the whole system will also change as described in the previous section the mass ratio of tmd to the whole system plays a key factor on the dynamic displacement suppression to clarify the contribution of tld in the hybrid tmd tld system on the displacement suppression we will fix the total mass of the hybrid tmd tld system as 65 kg which is the case of d0 l 12 cm 30 cm we will add extra weight when the liquid depth in tld is smaller than 12 cm to keep the total weight of the system is 65 kg the mass ratio of tmd to the whole system will also be fixed as 0 112 whereas the liquid depth ratios are varied as 12 30 10 30 8 30 6 30 and 2 30 fig 13 illustrates the suppression rates of the hybrid tmd tld on dynamic displacement versus various liquid depths in tld as shown in the figure the suppression rates are 41 when the liquid depth of tld are 12 30 and 10 30 and that is about the same as that of base structure with tmd only μtmd 0 112 the addition of tld to tmd system does not increase the suppression rate when the liquid depth of tld is larger than 10 30 when the liquid depth ratio of tld decreases to 8 30 6 30 5 30 and 2 30 the displacement suppression rates become 51 67 71 and 65 respectively and the best displacement reduction rate is nearly 70 when the liquid depth ratio of tld is 5 30 also shown in the figure the resonant frequency of the system shifts father left as the liquid depth of the tld decreases from 12 cm to 5 cm but it bounces back when the liquid depth further decreases to 2 cm besides the displacement reduction rate does not further increase as the liquid depth ratio decreases to 2 30 fig 14 plots the rate of the response reduction of hybrid tmd tld system versus various the liquid depths in the tld tank and the liquid depth ratio equal to 5 30 may be regarded as the bifurcation point of the dynamic displacement reduction fig 15 shows the time histories of the dynamic displacement of the system and the sloshing displacement at probe 2 of tld tank which is excited at the natural frequency of tld it is well known the response of a dynamic system will be small when the system is not excited at the natural frequency resonant frequency of the system but the dynamic response of the system will not be vanished unless the exciting frequency is far away from the resonant frequency however as shown in figs 13 and 15 the hybrid tmd tld bs system is almost motionless when the exciting frequencies are close to the natural frequency of the tld the sloshing effects retard the dynamic response of the structure system if the natural frequency of the liquid in a tld tank can be properly tuned to be equal to the exciting frequency see fig 16 fig 16 further compares the dynamic response of four different structural systems under various exciting frequencies as shown in the figure the reduction effects of tld tmd and hybrid tmd tld on structure response are significant but the hybrid tmd tld has the best performance of the structure motion control 4 conclusions the extensive experimental studies were made to investigate the motion reduction effects of tmd tld and hybrid tmd tld system on a structure the accuracy of the experiment measurement was checked by a theoretical validation three different mass ratio of tmd and more than nine different liquid depth ratios of tld were considered sloshing displacement of liquid in tld the dynamic displacement of the base structure and the instant sloshing wave photos were recorded the following key conclusions are made 1 the effect of tld on structure motion reduction was measured first and the tld has significant dynamic response control effect the dynamic motion reduction increases as the liquid depth of tld decreases but the liquid depth ratio equal to 6 30 has the best motion reduction effect the effective motion reduction of a tld system with very small liquid depth was novelty experimentally found in this study and we believed it might be due to the impact loads occurred in waves breaking and slamming in the tld however the violent sloshing waves may cause the possible damage of the tld tank and the noise of breaking or slamming waves might become the drawback of the tld when the liquid depth of tld is small 2 in all the experimental cases of tld we found that the maximum motion reduction nearly motionless can be obtained when the exciting frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the tld in other words if one can expect the possible exciting frequency applied on the structure one can tune the natural frequency of the tld to the exciting frequency and the dynamic response of the system can be reduced to a very small value the similar results were also reported in the numerical simulation made by chen and huang 2015 3 the tmd also has profound effects on motion reduction control but the mass ratio of tmd must be larger enough to have effectiveness in minimizing the structure response however it is theoretically known the optimal tuning frequency of tmd is significantly affected by the damping of the system and the optimal tmd has lower tuning frequency and higher damping ratio as the mass ratio increases hoang et al 2008 4 the addition of tmd on the tld bs system can calm the violent sloshing waves occurred in the tld tank even the system is excited at a near resonant frequency for a tuned mass ratio μ t m d 0 112 the best displacement reduction rate is nearly 70 when the liquid depth ratio of tld is 5 30 which may be regarded as the bifurcation point of the dynamic displacement reduction 5 although the addition of tmd to tld system does not much increase the structure response the hybrid tmd tld system still has the best performance on motion reduction control acknowledgment we thank very much the anonymous reviewers gave very valued comments that help us enhance the insight and highlight of the study the study is partially supported by a grant of

23164,extensive experiments were made in this study to investigate the effects of tmd tuned mass damper tld tuned liquid damper and a hybrid tmd tld on structure motion control different mass ratios of tmd and different liquid depth ratios of tld were studied and various tmd tld were used to determine the optimal hybrid tmd tld system for a tld system the liquid depth ratio do l do liquid depth l tank width must be smaller than 0 4 to have significant response reduction besides the maximum motion reduction can be obtained when the liquid depth ratio decreases to 0 2 and the motion reduction rate can reach nearly 70 the maximum motion reduction always occurs when the exciting frequency is equal to the fundamental frequency of the tld however the violent sloshing of liquid in the tld tank with small liquid depth ratio is found in the experiments for a tmd system the tmd mass ratio must be greater than 10 to have a notable response reduction the addition of tmd to the tld and base structure system can calm down the violent sloshing of liquid in tld tank and the hybrid tmd tld has the best performance of the structure motion control keywords tmd tld hybrid tmd tld motion reduction control 1 introduction earthquakes frequently occur in taiwan and the reduction of the seismic response of high rise structures such as taipei 101 becomes an important engineering topic as early as 1911 frahm designed a tuned mass device to reduce the dynamic response of a structure under a harmonic excitation and it might be the first tuned mass damper tmd ormondroyd and den hartog 1928 developed an instrument which can change the natural frequency of the structure system to reduce the dynamic response and they reported a formula to describe the best natural frequency absorption rate and also found the optimal mass ratio of tmd to the structure since then tmd is frequently used in the structures for motion reduction control mcnamara 1977 started to include tmd as parts of the architecture design parameters and tmd becomes the most commonly used damping devices hoang and warnitchai 2005 kareem and kline 1995 tmd has been implemented in many high rise buildings such as in the condo tower in san francisco and the citicorp building in new york city and the largest tmd in the world was installed at the taipei 101 in taipei city jabary and madabhushi 2015 reported a series of geotechnical centrifuge tests and he investigated the effects of tmds on the response of a multiple story sway frame structure undergoing dynamic soil structure interaction ssi yoyong arfiadi 2016 suggested the optimization of composite tuned mass dampers in reducing the response of structures subject to earthquake arfiadi 2017 further reported nonlinear control of buildings utilizing composite tuned mass dampers subject to earthquakes sakr 2017 proposed an innovative technique for using partial floor loads as multiple tmds at a limited number of floors his technique eliminates complications resulting from the addition of huge masses required for response control and maintains the mass of the original structure without any added loads miranda 2013 studied tuned mass dampers tmds resulting in high modal damping for mechanical systems incorporating such devices for seismic response reduction aswathy and krishna 2017 reported a review paper on tuned mass damper and detailed describe the idea behind the various type of dampers and found when a smaller mass is attached to the multiple degrees of freedom system and its parameters are tuned precisely then the oscillation of the whole system can be reduced by this smaller mass the equations of motion of a base structure mounted with a tuned mass damper can be expressed as soto and adeli 2013 chen and huang 2015 1 μ t m d x s 2 ξ g ω s x s ω s 2 x s p m d μ t m d x t m d x t m d 2 ξ d ω d x t m d ω d 2 x t m d x s where μtmd mass ratio of tmd to the system ωs and ωd are fundamental frequencies of the base structure and tmd respectively ξs and ξd are the damping ratio of the base structure and tmd respectively xs and xd are displacement of the base structure and tmd respectively and p is the external exciting force in 2007 bakre and jangid made a numerical study to find the optimal parameters damping and tuning frequency of the tmd the mass ratio considered in their study is from 0 005 to 0 1 they summarized that the damping of tmd is not influenced by the damping of the main system while the optimal tuning frequency of tmd is significantly affected by the damping of the system to have better motion reduction say 40 the mass ratio of tmd must increase to 2 and the corresponding damping ratio must increase twice larger while for a motion reduction to 70 the mass ratio must increase to 10 and the damping of tmd must increase even five times larger although the optimal damping of tmd can be electrically obtained by rlc circuit li et al 2013 the mass ratio of tmd still must be increased to a certain value to have notable motion reduction albeit the tmd has been regarded as a traditional seismic reduction system the tmd in general works well at a specific exciting frequency however the environmental loadings such wind wave and earthquakes always contain multiple exciting frequencies and the researchers and the engineers started to study the new type of the damper system and tld was reported tlds were gradually installed in the high rise structures as well as ships one of the advantages of tld is the fundamental frequency of the tank can be changed according to the exciting frequency and the required fundamental frequency can obtained by properly filling liquid depth in the tanks the researchers reported by xu et al 1992 balendra et al 1995 et al sadek et al 1998 fujino et al 1992 marivani and hamed 2009 yamamoto and kawahara 1999 yang et al 2003 and chen and huang 2015 have found that tld does have the excellent seismic response reduction on a structure under earthquake loadings theoretically the simulation of tld was usually made by solving the continuity equation and momentum equation of motion of liquid in tank along with the fully nonlinear kinematic free surface condition and those equations can be expressed as chen and hung 2015 marivani and hamed 2009 continuity equation u x w z 0 momentum equation of motion u t u u x w u z 1 ρ p x x s w t u w x w w z g 1 ρ p z kinematic free surface condition h t u h x w where u w are liquid velocities in x and z direction respectively p is the hydrodynamic pressure ρ is liquid density and h is the liquid surface displacement the numerical method has been used to solve for the above equations e g banerji et al 2000 and chen and huang 2015 among many others they reported a numerical simulations of a sdof structure with a tld and subjected to both real and artificially generated earthquake ground motions their results show that a properly designed tld can significantly reduce the structure s response their simulations suggested the fundamental frequency of tld can be tuned to the structure s natural frequency and the tld is more effective in reducing structural response as the ground excitation level increases banerji et al found the sloshing as well as the wave breaking will results in the motion reduction of the structure they also reported that a larger water depth and a larger water mass to structure mass ratio are shown to be required for a tld to remain equally effective as structural damping increases they also suggested a practical approach for the design of a tld to control earthquake response shad and adnan 2013 used ansys software to study the effect of tld on structure motion reduction and also concluded that the frequency of tld tuned with the structure will have the best structure motion reduction tait et al 2008 made extensive numerical as well as experimental studies to report the performance of the tuned liquid dampers which was measured in terms of efficiency and robustness they made a series of experimental tests on tmd systems to evaluate their performance and compared the results to that of the existed reported tmds roy and ghosh 2012 also used a numerical method to carry out a study of a tld system on the response reduction of an elevated water tank as listed in the above literatures among others the tuned tld frequency with structures is the key on response reduction of a structure however in all the above studies the precise physics explanation of the phenomenon are still incomplete besides the hybrid tmd and tld on structure motion control is rarely studied and reported sun et al 1992 reported experimental studies and suggested the optimum value of the liquid frequency is near the excitation frequency that the liquid in tld is in resonance with tank motion the researchers and engineers then simply suggested the tld frequency tuned to equal to that of structure will have best structure motion reduction in this study we will clarify the optimal value of the tld frequency on structure motion reduction control that is exactly equal to the exciting frequency while fujino et al 1988 reported some disadvantage of tld that the violent sloshing occurred during a resonant excitation and it could not quickly calm down and might affect the stability of the structure in this study we showed the addition of tmd to tld can resolve the violent sloshing wave and also increase the motion reduction of the structure in this study a hybrid tmd and tld are attached to a base structure bs and the effect of hybrid tuned mass and liquid dampers on dynamic structure response control is experimentally studied the advantages of tmd simple and easy installation and that of tld frequency flexibly changeable are combined in the hybrid damper system to increase the damper efficiency of the base structure section 2 describes the experimental setup and test cases because of the budget limit the damping of the tmd and main bs system are fixed and only three different mass ratios of tmd were considered however various liquid depth ratios of tld were considered in the study section 3 reports the measured results and gives a detailed discussion of the observed data and the final section describes the conclusions of this study 2 experimental setup in this study four different experimental models were included the conceptual sketches of the experimental setup are depicted in fig 1 the first model is a base structure bs which is composed by a steel plate on which an acryl tank is attached and the tank without liquid filled is also regarded as part of the base structure the tank size used in this study is 30 30 45 cm and the total weight of the bs is 46 kg the bs is attached and horizontally movable on a steel plate which is attached with a spring with a stiffness of 3040 n m the second model is a bs tld and the tanks of the first model are partially filled with liquid the third model is the first model plus a tmd which is composed of a steel box and a slider weight is attached with a spring to the bs with a spring stiffness of 122 n m no liquid is filled in the tank of the third model the fourth model is a hybrid tmd tld system whose configuration is basically the same as the third model except the liquid is partially filled in the tank the detailed mass ratios of tmd and liquid depth ratios of tld are listed in the tables described in the later sections as illustrated in fig 2 the photograph of the bs with empty liquid tank attached to a shaking table can be moved back and forth by an ac motor the maximum moving distance r of the shaking table is 30 mm and the highest revolutions of the motor is 2000 rpm the frequency level depends on the limitation of the maximum velocity implemented by the ac motor and the motor reducer in this experiment work the maximum velocity v m ω r of the shaking table is 30 mm s the material of the tank is acryl with 20 mm thickness the displacement responses at the base have been acquired using keyence laser displacement meter il 300 the measurement capability is 999 mm the sloshing displacement of liquid in tld is acquired using ncku wave probe and the measurement capability is 0 005 m 4 5 m 3 results and discussions in this section various damper systems are introduced the prominent motion controls are reported and the related physics are discussed 3 1 base structure system the mass of the base structure is 46 kg and the attached spring stiffness is k 3040 n m the free vibration experiment was first made to evaluate the damping coefficient of the system fig 3 shows the decay history of the dynamic displacement and the damping ratio of the experimental set up can be calculated according to the following equation ln x 1 x j 2 π j ζ 1 ζ 2 according to the decay history the damping ratio ζ 0 028 was determined the damping coefficient c 21 17 is then obtained by ζ c 2 m k to confirm the accuracy of experimental measurements the fundamental frequency of the base structure system was checked the base structure was excited by a harmonic force f t a ω x sin ω x t a runge kutta rk method is used to calculate the corresponding dynamic displacement response and fig 4 shows the comparison of the rk solution and the experimental measurements and the agreement is very good the dynamic displacements measured in this section will also be used as the dynamic response of bs without damper system and as a reference to evaluate the effects of tmd tld and hybrid tmd tld on response reduction of the base structure 3 2 tuned liquid damper tld bs in this section the tld is attached to the base structure the experimental parameters studied in this section are listed in table 1 where ω 1 is the natural frequency of the liquid tank ω s is the natural frequency of bs system and ω x is the exciting frequency the harmonic exciting force is f t a ω x 2 sin ω x t and a 0 003 m is the excited amplitude nine different liquid depths were used and they are d o l 2 30 4 30 6 30 8 30 10 30 12 30 15 30 20 30 and 30 30 fig 5 a shows the dynamic displacements of the bs tld with various liquid depths filled in the tank and the results of bs are also shown in the figure as can be seen in the figure the resonant frequency of the bs tld system is shift to the left also as depicted in the figure for liquid depth ratio 20 30 as an example the motion of the system is nearly zero when the exciting frequency is equal to 1 4 ωs that is exactly equal to the fundamental frequency of the tld noted that ω s ω 1 0 69 0 69 of d o l 20 30 d o l 20 30 20 30 and 1 4 ωs ω1 0 97 similar phenomena can be found in the other liquid depth ratios and the displacement response is suppressed to nearly zero once the exciting frequency is close to the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank the numerical simulation made by chen and huang 2015 also showed the similar characteristics in that simulation they found the phases of the sloshing force and the exciting force is out of phase when the exciting frequency is close to the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank also found in fig 5a the response peak decreases as does the liquid depth in the tank we then further made two more experiments with the smaller liquid depths 4 cm and 2 cm fig 5b shows the corresponding measurements and the results shown in the figure imply no further response reduction and the tld with a liquid depth ratio 6 30 has the best structural displacement reduction fig 6 illustrates the contour of the dynamic displacement versus various combinations of the excitation frequencies the reduction amount of the tld with liquid depth ratio d o l 6 30 is much smaller than that of d o l 20 30 also can be seen in the figure the best reduction of the dynamic displacement always occurs when the excitation frequency is close the natural frequency of the tld no matter what the liquid depth ratio is fig 7 shows the sloshing waves in the tld under a near resonant excitation frequency as shown in fig 7 a 1 a 2 the liquid depth is 6 cm only and the sloshing waves is breaking and slamming against the tank walls which create large resistance force opposite to the external force and the dynamic response of the system is therefore prominently reduced for the cases of do l 20 30 and 30 30 the sloshing waves behave like a bore and neither breaking nor slamming occur whereas the sloshing displacements are much larger than those of tld with smaller liquid depths the tld with larger liquid depths also has a significant effect on dynamic response control but the reduction is smaller than that of the case of do l 6 30 3 3 tuned mass damper tmd in this section the effect of tmd on bs motion control was investigated table 2 lists the parameters used for the experiments made in this section the stiffness of the springs attached to bs and tmd were k 3040 n m and k 122 6 n m respectively the exciting force was the same as that used in the previous section fig 8 shows the maximum dynamic displacement responses of tmd bs system versus various exciting frequencies as shown in the figure the resonant frequency of the tmd bs system is shifted to the left and decreases as the weight of tmd increases and only 10 of the dynamic displacement is reduced if the mass ratio μ m is less than 8 whereas the profound suppression 70 of dynamic displacement of bs can be obtained when the mass of the mass ratio of tmd to tmd bs is larger than 15 3 4hybrid tmd tld system in this section a hybrid tmd tld system is introduced the same parameters of tmd used in the previous section are also used in this section and four different liquid depths in tld tank were used the detailed parameters used are listed in table 3 fig 9 depicts the measured maximum dynamic displacements versus various exciting frequencies as shown in the figure for a hybrid tmd tld system with a large liquid depth ω e 20 30 and a tmd weight 5 3 kg the suppressing effects are limited and the response reduction is only less than 2 compare the results shown in figs 7 and 9 the addition of tmd to tld bs system with a small tmd weight does not provide more contribution to response reduction and only mildly decreases the suppression magnitude of the dynamic displacement when the tmd weight increases to 7 3 kg or the weight ratio of tmd increases to 11 2 the addition of tmd to tld bs system does increase the response reduction to a profound amount fig 9 also illustrates the significant increase of the suppression of the resonant dynamic displacement of the system when the weight of tmd 11 2 7 3 kg or 14 3 9 3 kg is added to tld bs system for a liquid depth ratio is equal to 0 4 12 30 50 more displacement suppression can be obtained for a hybrid tmd tld bs system than that of a tld bs system the largest response suppression is 66 displacement suppression and occurs at a hybrid tmd tld bs with a liquid depth ratio 0 2 6 30 and tmd mass ratio μ t m d 0 122 see table 4 fig 10 further depicts the contour plots of the maximum dynamic displacement of hybrid tmd tld system under various excitation frequencies using the same liquid depth in tld d o l 20 30 one can easily find the largest displacement reduction occurred in the same small region no matter what the weight of tmd has the small region is located at ω x ω s 1 55 1 65 and ω x ω 1 1 0 1 1 which indicates the best dynamic response control can be obtained when the exciting frequency is equal to or near the natural frequency of the liquid in the tld tank in other words once we can predict or monitor the range of the excitation frequency the best liquid depth needed to be filled in the tld tank can be determined for a tld with low filled liquid depth say ω s 0 2 the sloshing waves are easily breaking and plunging wave breakers are also frequently found and the air pockets may occur the plunge waves with bubbles collapse will generate inevitable profound high pressure and may cause possible damage to the structures with the addition of tmd to the tld bs system violently sloshing disappears in the tld tank fig 11 shows the instant sloshing waves in the tld of the hybrid tmd tld bs system the sloshing waves are more gentle and smooth than those of tld bs system as shown in fig 7 the addition of tmd on the system will not only provide a certain contribution to the reduction of the base structure motion but also clam the sloshing waves in the tld tank and both the slamming waves and breaking waves are seldom triggered when the tmd is added to the tld bs system besides fig 12 depicts the relationship between the elevation of probes 1 and 2 at tld tank when the systems are under near resonant frequency as shown in the figure the swirling waves turn to the single directional waves when the tmd is added to the system whereas the swirling wave occurred at a tld bs system that the tmd is not attached in other words the addition of tmd to tld bs system not only prevent the violent sloshing waves but also diminish the swirling wave occurrence and the hybrid tmd tld bs system will be much more stable than tld bs system when they are under a resonant excitation 3 5hybrid tmd tld with constant total weight and μ t m d 0 112 in the previous section the total weight of the hybrid tmd tld system is varied when the liquid depth in tld changes and the natural frequency of the whole system will also change as described in the previous section the mass ratio of tmd to the whole system plays a key factor on the dynamic displacement suppression to clarify the contribution of tld in the hybrid tmd tld system on the displacement suppression we will fix the total mass of the hybrid tmd tld system as 65 kg which is the case of d0 l 12 cm 30 cm we will add extra weight when the liquid depth in tld is smaller than 12 cm to keep the total weight of the system is 65 kg the mass ratio of tmd to the whole system will also be fixed as 0 112 whereas the liquid depth ratios are varied as 12 30 10 30 8 30 6 30 and 2 30 fig 13 illustrates the suppression rates of the hybrid tmd tld on dynamic displacement versus various liquid depths in tld as shown in the figure the suppression rates are 41 when the liquid depth of tld are 12 30 and 10 30 and that is about the same as that of base structure with tmd only μtmd 0 112 the addition of tld to tmd system does not increase the suppression rate when the liquid depth of tld is larger than 10 30 when the liquid depth ratio of tld decreases to 8 30 6 30 5 30 and 2 30 the displacement suppression rates become 51 67 71 and 65 respectively and the best displacement reduction rate is nearly 70 when the liquid depth ratio of tld is 5 30 also shown in the figure the resonant frequency of the system shifts father left as the liquid depth of the tld decreases from 12 cm to 5 cm but it bounces back when the liquid depth further decreases to 2 cm besides the displacement reduction rate does not further increase as the liquid depth ratio decreases to 2 30 fig 14 plots the rate of the response reduction of hybrid tmd tld system versus various the liquid depths in the tld tank and the liquid depth ratio equal to 5 30 may be regarded as the bifurcation point of the dynamic displacement reduction fig 15 shows the time histories of the dynamic displacement of the system and the sloshing displacement at probe 2 of tld tank which is excited at the natural frequency of tld it is well known the response of a dynamic system will be small when the system is not excited at the natural frequency resonant frequency of the system but the dynamic response of the system will not be vanished unless the exciting frequency is far away from the resonant frequency however as shown in figs 13 and 15 the hybrid tmd tld bs system is almost motionless when the exciting frequencies are close to the natural frequency of the tld the sloshing effects retard the dynamic response of the structure system if the natural frequency of the liquid in a tld tank can be properly tuned to be equal to the exciting frequency see fig 16 fig 16 further compares the dynamic response of four different structural systems under various exciting frequencies as shown in the figure the reduction effects of tld tmd and hybrid tmd tld on structure response are significant but the hybrid tmd tld has the best performance of the structure motion control 4 conclusions the extensive experimental studies were made to investigate the motion reduction effects of tmd tld and hybrid tmd tld system on a structure the accuracy of the experiment measurement was checked by a theoretical validation three different mass ratio of tmd and more than nine different liquid depth ratios of tld were considered sloshing displacement of liquid in tld the dynamic displacement of the base structure and the instant sloshing wave photos were recorded the following key conclusions are made 1 the effect of tld on structure motion reduction was measured first and the tld has significant dynamic response control effect the dynamic motion reduction increases as the liquid depth of tld decreases but the liquid depth ratio equal to 6 30 has the best motion reduction effect the effective motion reduction of a tld system with very small liquid depth was novelty experimentally found in this study and we believed it might be due to the impact loads occurred in waves breaking and slamming in the tld however the violent sloshing waves may cause the possible damage of the tld tank and the noise of breaking or slamming waves might become the drawback of the tld when the liquid depth of tld is small 2 in all the experimental cases of tld we found that the maximum motion reduction nearly motionless can be obtained when the exciting frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the tld in other words if one can expect the possible exciting frequency applied on the structure one can tune the natural frequency of the tld to the exciting frequency and the dynamic response of the system can be reduced to a very small value the similar results were also reported in the numerical simulation made by chen and huang 2015 3 the tmd also has profound effects on motion reduction control but the mass ratio of tmd must be larger enough to have effectiveness in minimizing the structure response however it is theoretically known the optimal tuning frequency of tmd is significantly affected by the damping of the system and the optimal tmd has lower tuning frequency and higher damping ratio as the mass ratio increases hoang et al 2008 4 the addition of tmd on the tld bs system can calm the violent sloshing waves occurred in the tld tank even the system is excited at a near resonant frequency for a tuned mass ratio μ t m d 0 112 the best displacement reduction rate is nearly 70 when the liquid depth ratio of tld is 5 30 which may be regarded as the bifurcation point of the dynamic displacement reduction 5 although the addition of tmd to tld system does not much increase the structure response the hybrid tmd tld system still has the best performance on motion reduction
