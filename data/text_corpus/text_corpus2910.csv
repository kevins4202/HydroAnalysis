s medium under different illumination wavelengths the results of batch cultivations obtained in presence of each illumination wavelengths are shown in fig 2 a and b sunlight exhibiting μmax of 0 45 day biomass yield on nitrate of 0 44 g g and productivity of 16 77 mg l h was found as optimum illumination wavelength all other batches exhibited 30 reduction in μmax value and 50 reduced biomass yield fig 2 a biomass productivity for sunlight was 2 18 times more than that of red light however observed μmax biomass yield and productivity of red and yellow wavelengths did not show the remarkable difference batch results obtained in blue and uv wavelengths were comparable biomass productivity in sunlight was maximum and 4 8 fold of that in uv however red light exhibited 2 21 fold biomass productivity as compared to uv but 54 2 lesser than that produced in sunlight fig 2 b highest biomass productivity was reported in earlier literature as 1 27 mg l h when a platensis was grown in cylindrical photobioreactor keeping red led of wavelength 660 nm 10 3 2 calculation of energy flux per unit power for different illumination wavelengths energy fluxes per unit power consumed were calculated for constant irradiance value of 450 μeinst m2s 108 405 w m2 3 energy flux per unit power was minimum in red light however sunlight is a natural source having 15 7 higher energy flux per unit power exhibiting highest biomass productivity of 16 77 mg l h table 1 μmax was obtained maximum in sunlight and minimum in uv a large number of photons carrying low energy was favourable for microalgae growth as shown in fig 2 b optimum energy flux per unit power consumed as 6 05 s m2 was obtained in sunlight it is necessary to assess the economic efficiency for different illumination wavelengths to define the conversion of energy to biomass percentage economic efficiency per unit power of yellow was 7 22 higher than that of red illumination and for blue it was 9 11 higher than that of uv economic efficiency decreases in the order of illumination sources are sunlight yellow red green blue and uv as shown in table 1 however prior studies on spirulina platensis exhibited the economic efficiency decreasing in order red white yellow green and blue illumination 26 maximum economic efficiency was obtained in the case of sunlight a natural illumination source in present work 3 3 acclimatization of a platensis to yamuna water acclimatization of the culture was necessary to retain specific growth rate yamuna water also carries other unknown inhibitory components findings of acclimatization of a platensis to yamuna water are shown in table 2 due to enhanced nitrate level zarrouk s medium exhibited more biomass yield and productivity as compared to yamuna water these values were decreased with the increase in yamuna water concentration nitrate reduction was 99 76 in yamuna water apparently this was due to supported nitrate metabolism of microalgae in yamuna water microalgae converts inorganic n to organic form and the process known as assimilation nitrate reductase catalyses the reduction of nitrate into nitrite further nitrite is reduced to ammonium ion via the action of nitrite reductase coupled along with the action of ferredoxins total amount of inorganic nitrogen assimilated by algae is converted to ammonium ion which then via the action of glutamine synthase combining with amino acid cycle starting with the formation of glutamate 32 34 as a result biomass yield was compromised by 34 due to the presence of unknown inhibitors heavy metals and other chemicals 16 45 enhanced lipid concentration was observed due to nitrate limiting conditions produced during stationary phase lipid concentration of 42 97 w w and 59 42 w w were produced in zarrouk s medium and yamuna water respectively low levels of ammonia in the yamuna water less than 0 5 g l allowed no inhibition for the microalgae growth reduction in the concentration of all nitrogenous components i e nitrates nitrites and ammonia were observed during cultivation 3 4 chlorophyll and phycocyanin production phycocyanin has characteristic fluorescence at particular wavelength i e it emit light of very narrow range of wavelengths the wavelengths of light produced are distinctive and reliable therefore phycocyanin is used as chemical tag in cancer research for tagging tumor cells 35 chlorophyll is known for its antioxidant antiseptic and anti constipation properties it is also used extensively for cancer research oilgae chennai india the cost of these pigments is as high as 30 nutraculture india for 60 capsules containing 100 mg of these pigments the specific chlorophyll and phycocyanin concentration obtained in zarrouk s and yamuna water are given in table 3 specific phycocyanin and chlorophyll productivities were found 89 50 and 81 91 respectively higher in yamuna water as compared to that of zarrouk s medium however lower chlorophyll 1 04 1 42 and phycocyanin 8 2 17 6 contents were reported in zarrouk s medium under artificial illumination when a platensis was cultivated in semi continuous mode of operation 10 comparing a platensis production in standard and waste water medium yamuna water produced microalgae with enhanced pigment content 3 5 sequestration of heavy metals from yamuna water by a platensis a platensis has been reported to possess heavy metals sequestration capability with the help of phytochelatin and metallothioneins 36 the increase in metallothioneins concentration increases the uptake of heavy metals and vice versa due to increased enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase 37 metalloproteins are present in chloroplast in various forms function and properties of a metalloprotein is due to the presence metal co factors metalloproteins play crucial role in photosynthetic reactions based on electron transport and redox reactions to release oxidative stress caused due to reactive oxidative species ros 38 significant amount of heavy metals are removed by a platensis if we compare amount removed by other algal species 18 heavy metal removal efficiencies are summarised in table 4 3 5 1 removal of copper cu by a platensis acclimatized a platensis sequestrated 68 57 of copper during cultivation in yamuna water utilized it as metal co factor which binds plastocyanin 39 thylakoid lumen inside chloroplast contains plastocyanin pc it is a soluble protein which act as pivot between electron transport present in photosynthesis between complex membrane proteins cytochrome b6f complex present in thylakoid lumen and photosystem i psi the soluble protein pc contains cu2 which act as electron transfer to psi and activates this system by transferring one electron to psi the conversion of pc between cytb6f complex and psi enables the efficient use of light energy 38 39 reactions takes place with psi in the presence of cu2 plastocyanin complex with cytb6f as shown in fig 3 a and b protein database rcsb deficiency of cu decreases the rate of formation of plastocyanin which deteriorates the electron transport efficiency of psi disintegration of thylakoid membrane occurs in cu deficient microalgae and higher plants 38 39 3 5 2 removal of nickel ni by a platensis nickel is utilized 100 with 0 30 mg g of microalgae which is first of its kind result for removing 0 050 g l of ni from wastewater using a platensis until date maximum concentration of ni removal reported was 0 030 g l using scenedesmus quadricauda by dissolving nicl2 artificially prepared in 150 ml digestion tube using bio sorption 40 this result emphasizes the importance of acclimatization process natural treatment along with suitable factors as used here as illumination wavelengths can greatly increase the efficiency of microalgae 3 5 3 removal of lead pb by a platensis removal efficiency of 99 22 was obtained along with very high specific removal efficiency of 29 88 mg g of cells in literature 0 1 2 0 mg l of pb was observed as nontoxic to microalgae whereas 2 0 10 mg l was proved toxic for microalgae growth 41 42 present work being using acclimatization process exhibited increased efficiency of pb removal 3 5 4 removal of cadmium cd by a platensis percent removal efficiency of cadmium by microalgae obtained as 90 80 with specific removal efficiency of 7 34 mg g of cells cadmium concentration above 0 00192 g l was reported a toxic for microalgae growth initial concentration of 0 84 mg l was present in yamuna water which was less than the toxic value 43 no inhibitory effects were observed on the growth of a platensis 4 conclusion present research work concluded that sunlight mixed wavelength is the best to support microalgae growth sunlight supported microalgae cultivation exhibited μmax of 0 45 day 1 and maximum biomass productivity of 16 77 mg l h i e highest among other provided wavelengths of illumination energy flux per unit power for the corresponding source of illumination was 6 05 10 21 s m2 microalgae cultivation utilising sunlight and river yamuna water as medium supported an economical process for microalgae and its by products production acclimatization of microalgae is an important step which governs directly biomass yield and productivity during cultivation integration of the existing secondary wastewater treatment with tertiary treatment using microalgae produces enhanced biomass and valuable pigments phycocyanin and chlorophyll in addition treatment of wastewater by microalgae is a one step process for multi component removal such as n p organic carbon and heavy metals however acclimatization process is required to be optimised to facilitate growth removal efficiency of 99 76 for nitrate 99 22 for lead 100 for nickel 90 80 for cadmium and 68 57 for copper attained in river yamuna water however biomass productivity was 40 3 lesser than that of zarrouk s medium due to limited nitrate levels which also resulted in 16 45 increase in lipid content of cells maximum productivity of chlorophyll and phycocyanin with utilization of yamuna water was achieved as 2 93 and 7 34 mg g cells day respectively a platensis exhibited great potential for all the above processes but very high specific removal efficiency of pb and nitrate from yamuna water acknowledgment we are thankful to university school of chemical technology guru gobind singh indraprastha

contains plastocyanin pc it is a soluble protein which act as pivot between electron transport present in photosynthesis between complex membrane proteins cytochrome b6f complex present in thylakoid lumen and photosystem i psi the soluble protein pc contains cu2 which act as electron transfer to psi and activates this system by transferring one electron to psi the conversion of pc between cytb6f complex and psi enables the efficient use of light energy 38 39 reactions takes place with psi in the presence of cu2 plastocyanin complex with cytb6f as shown in fig 3 a and b protein database rcsb deficiency of cu decreases the rate of formation of plastocyanin which deteriorates the electron transport efficiency of psi disintegration of thylakoid membrane occurs in cu deficient microalgae and higher plants 38 39 3 5 2 removal of nickel ni by a platensis nickel is utilized 100 with 0 30 mg g of microalgae which is first of its kind result for removing 0 050 g l of ni from wastewater using a platensis until date maximum concentration of ni removal reported was 0 030 g l using scenedesmus quadricauda by dissolving nicl2 artificially prepared in 150 ml digestion tube using bio sorption 40 this result emphasizes the importance of acclimatization process natural treatment along with suitable factors as used here as illumination wavelengths can greatly increase the efficiency of microalgae 3 5 3 removal of lead pb by a platensis removal efficiency of 99 22 was obtained along with very high specific removal efficiency of 29 88 mg g of cells in literature 0 1 2 0 mg l of pb was

m2 microalgae cultivation utilising sunlight and river yamuna water as medium supported an economical process for microalgae and its by products production acclimatization of microalgae is an important step which governs directly biomass yield and productivity during cultivation integration of the existing secondary wastewater treatment with tertiary treatment using microalgae produces enhanced biomass and valuable pigments phycocyanin and chlorophyll in addition treatment of wastewater by microalgae is a one step process for multi component removal such as n p organic carbon and heavy metals however acclimatization process is required to be optimised to facilitate growth removal efficiency of 99 76 for nitrate 99 22 for lead 100 for nickel 90 80 for cadmium and 68 57 for copper attained in river yamuna water however biomass productivity was 40 3 lesser than that of zarrouk s medium due to limited nitrate levels which also resulted in 16 45 increase in lipid content of cells maximum productivity of chlorophyll and phycocyanin with utilization of yamuna water was achieved as 2 93 and 7 34 mg g cells day respectively a platensis exhibited great potential for all the above processes but very high specific removal efficiency of pb and nitrate from yamuna water acknowledgment we are thankful to university school of chemical technology guru gobind singh indraprastha

14551,pond type reactors are widely used in biological wastewater treatment in view of their simplicity and low cost of construction the knowledge of an approximate hydrodynamic behavior can contribute to the rational design of such operation thus the aim of this work is to investigate in a pilot scale pond bioreactor the non ideality through residence time distribution rtd technique and validation of a model for the homogeneous phase material balance experimental runs were carried out using the pulse injection technique of methylene blue tracer at constant water flow rate the pilot

pond reactor as two cstrs in series with different volumes first reactor with 91 5 of useful volume and presence of dead zones useful volume 84 9 of real volume keywords residence time distribution pond bioreactor hydrodynamic behavior non idealities models wastewater 1 introduction pond type reactors are widely used in biological wastewater treatment in view of the simplicity and low cost a rational pond design should take into account the kinetics of the bioreaction taking place as well as the hydrodynamics of the material in the pond the pond geometrical parameters are similar in anaerobic and aerobic operations but the presence of mixers in aerated lagoons alters the standard of mixing stabilization ponds are associated with anaerobic lagoons facultative and maturation ponds and are used in municipal and industrial wastewater plants and for animal manure methane fermentation anaerobic digestion in rural areas these are typical in tropical and subtropical regions of brazil the standard of mixing represents hydrodynamic non idealities associated with several features including geometrical configuration which can cause the formation of dead zones velocity profiles by passing internal recirculation parallel paths and preferential paths among others the classical method for measurement involves the injection of a tracer to the continuous reactor at a constant flow rate which aids determination of the residence time distribution rtd this technique can be employed for various system types including the wetlands hydrodynamics 1 biofilters 2 3 hydrologic systems 4 sewage treatment 5 traditional and modified anaerobic baffled reactors 6 7 uasb reactor 8 to describe the hydrodynamic non idealities it is convenient to use a representative model based on experimental rtd data in a pond type reactor the dispersed flow model is the most commonly employed 9 13 however the application of this model coupled with kinetic rate law even in steady state conditions does not permits the attainment of an analytical solution except for zero or first order reactions this perhaps is the most limiting factor to the application of these models in the rational design of real reactors the combination or modification of ideal reactors mainly continuous stirred tank reactors cstr can be considered as a simpler class of non ideal model and has been used in several works 1 14 17 including fields of sanitary engineering 5 18 19 the use of such models provides a solution in steady state conditions by one or a system of linear or non linear equations the objective of this work is to determine a hydrodynamics non idealities model considering homogeneous phase in a typical pond type reactor using rtd measured in a prototype for the residence time between 3 and 9 days and a geometrical parameter height width ratio h d between 0 25 and 0 18 we tested models with combined or modified cstr reactors classified as conventional and by pass models recycle models and interchanged model theoretical rtd functions for each model as well as expressions for rtd properties were developed a methodology for model analysis based on experimental properties versus theoretical rtd properties was employed for the first time the final decision regarding the best model was based on non linear regression adjustment characterized by the determination coefficient the investigation however is limited to a situation of homogeneous flow therefore does not consider suspended and floating substances others geometrical relations and scale 2 theory elements and non idealities models development 2 1 measure of dimensionless rtd function the rtd function or exit age distribution function e t t 1 represents the fraction of the material per unit time that has a certain residence time in a reactor environment it is representative of the mixing characteristics that occur in a reactor for experimental measurement of e t the main techniques are pulse and step injections of a tracer input to a continuous reactor at constant flow and the quantification of concentration c m l 3 in the effluent stream with time t t the tracer should be easily detectable inert in the system physically similar to the reagent mixture and must not adsorb in components of the reactor from the tracer concentration profile for pulse technique the rtd function is evaluated by eq 1 16 20 1 e t c t 0 c t d t for reactor projects are common to use the residence time τ t defined as the ratio of the reactor volume v l 3 and the volumetric flow υ 0 l 3 t 1 τ v υ 0 in engineering applications using the rtd results it is more common the use dimensionless parameters that can be used for any scale situation dimensionless time θ is defined by eq 2 2 θ t τ hence a normalized rtd function e θ θ dimensionless can be defined according to eq 3 16 3 e θ θ τ e t 2 2 characteristics of dimensionless rtd for each rtd function some proprieties that characterize the hydrodynamic behavior standard of mixing can be evaluated including average residence time variance and asymmetry parameters the first moment of the normalized rtd function is the normalized average residence time θ m it is computed as a weighted mean time of the rtd function if no dead zone is present in the reactor the mean residence time can be proved as equal to the projected residence time or θ m 1 this parameter of the distribution can be evaluated by eq 4 16 4 θ m 0 θ e θ θ d θ to evaluate the dispersion of the residence time distribution around θ m it is common to adopt the variance second moment of rtd that in normalized form σ θ 2 can be obtained by eq 5 16 the behavior of this parameter can be shown by analyzing the plug flow when σ θ 2 0 or on the other hand it can be proven that σ θ 2 1 for ideal cstr 5 σ θ 2 0 θ θ m 2 e θ θ d θ the third moment of the rtd is the asymmetry of the distribution defined in dimensionless form s θ 3 by eq 6 the asymmetry parameter provides an indication of the extent of the tail of the distribution in reactor analyses larger s θ 3 values can indicate hydrodynamic behavior close to cstr or cstr configuration smaller asymmetry parameters values can be interpreted as a mixing standard closer to plug flow 6 s θ 3 1 σ θ 3 2 0 θ θ m 3 e θ θ d θ 2 3 non ideal models comments and development real reactors do not always have a standard of mixing similar to ideal representations such as the perfect mixing in cstrs or plug flow in pfr reactors for pond type bioreactors the non idealities are associated with several aspects the geometrical configuration hydrodynamic which can cause the formation of dead zones velocities profiles by passing internal recirculation parallel paths and preferential paths the sediment deposition which can decrease the useful volume among others the rtd function can be used directly to provide the conversion in a certain real reactor but it can also be used for adjusting of an appropriate non idealities model non idealities models normally employ information about flow patterns and or different configurations and or modifications of ideal reactors 16 perhaps the most common class of models used to establish the standard of mixing hydrodynamic non idealities in ponds anaerobic facultative and maturation and aerated lagoons is the dispersed flow model 10 13 21 this model can describe situations from ideal plug flow to completely mixed conditions and requires only one parameter the peclet number the validation adjustment of this model can be accomplished by residence time distribution experiments by this means the transient one dimension continuity equation an elliptic second order linear partial differential equation should be solved with appropriate initial boundary conditions three different sets of boundaries conditions can be established referred to by fogler 16 and nameche and vasel 10 21 as closed to diffusion or closed closed vessel first proposed by danckwerts 22 semi open to diffusion or open to diffusion open open a peclet parameter for each model is easily obtained from the relation with the distribution proprieties variance and mean residence time 10 16 21 or by non linear adjustment the peclet parameter of the dispersed flow model can also be obtained from continuous reaction system data with a well know reaction kinetic however the solution of the governing equation in dispersed flow models coupled with kinetic of bioreaction in a steady state allows an analytical solution only for the simple zero or first order kinetic this is perhaps the most limiting factor to the application of this model in the rational design of real reactors for first order reactions under closed closed boundary conditions the equation to describe the concentration is known as the danckwerts 22 or wehner and wilhelm 23 solution other methods applied for the determination of non idealities are based on computational fluid dynamic numeric simulations 18 24 27 normally these are applied for analysis of a specific system generating results of rtd function which aims to improve the design and or operational conditions results can also be used to establish macroscopic non ideal models the combination or modification of ideal reactors can be considered to produce an additional class of non ideal models most widely used is the tank in series model combinations of ideal reactors using by pass and dead space interchanged reactors among others can also be applied 1 14 17 when proposing selecting a specific model the simplicity of the solution and physical realism should be taken into account mainly for applications coupled with kinetic models more complex than first order it is desirable that the non ideal model in steady state does not involve solving differential equations as is the case with plug flow reactors in this manner the combination modification of cstrs reactors provides a more suitable mathematical solution for practical use as already mentioned by gupta and patel 14 in fact the steady state solutions are obtained from only one or a system of linear or non linear equations for validation of a specific model by tracer injection technique researchers use the experimental output concentration profiles or residence time distribution compared with model solution results however this approach is only valid for specific situations when analyzing concentration profiles the curve is influenced by tracer type and amount injection technique and residence time of the project while in rtd function e t residence time scale have an influence therefore to establish a comparison base for the same type of reactor independent of these factors the use of dimensionless residence time distribution e θ θ is recommended the employment of the rtd function specifically e θ θ permits the obtainment of information about the proprieties of the rtd function as shown previously typically the variance of distribution σ θ 2 is used for non ideal model parameter determination as the peclet number in dispersed flow model 10 21 and the number of reactors in tanks in series model 16 in both cases however this does not allow the establishment of whether a model is valid for representation of the mixing standard in this work we expand the strategy for using rtd proprieties to infer specific hydrodynamic non idealities models using the theoretical asymmetry parameter s θ 3 deduced from the models proposed this parameter as a new approach permits an additional degree of freedom for a fast evidence decision about the best model in this work we propose several cstrs configurations and or modifications for non ideal models according to table 1 a concerted effort was made to obtain for all models the normalized rtd function e θ θ as well as rtd proprieties θ m σ θ 2 s θ 3 as a function of models parameters the models proposed were classified as ideal reactors conventional models by pass models recycle models and interchanged models in each class they can be distinguished as having only one cstr a series of cstrs predominantly two tanks tanks with different volumes and interchanged cstrs the obtainment of the function of the normalized dtr involves the transient solution of the material balance for a tracer pulse for each configuration shown in table 1 taking the concentration profile as the response the separation of variables method for the autonomous differential equation was employed for obtainment models i 1 a a 1 b b 1 b 2 c c 1 while for the system of first order ordinary differential equation generated for the models d e and f the eigenanalysis method was used the analytical solution for the concentration was applied in rtd function definition eq 1 that was transformed by definition of eqs 2 and 3 into the normalized rtd function e θ θ these results in turn allow the attainment of normalized rtd proprieties as a function of the model parameters by the definitions of eqs 4 5 and 6 in some models models c c 1 d e and f the empirical function was adjusted based on numerical results used to describe s θ 3 as a function of a characteristic parameter p b p p p r or characteristic number x p x r x p i by analogy with the obtainment for peclet number and number of tanks in series from the variance value x and p parameters can likewise be evaluated additionally in this work x and p were used to predict s θ 3 providing evidence with one degree of freedom as to the most appropriate type of model 3 materials and methods the methodology employed involves an experimental part followed by the validation of an appropriate model for describing the standard of mixing in a pond type bioreactor experiments consist in the obtainment of normalized rtd function in set conditions using the impulse tracer injection technique in a prototype tank data were treated statistically and convenient criteria were used to establish the best non ideal model based on the list proposed in table 1 3 1 experimental apparatus we developed a small scale prototype of a pond type reactor fig 1 the geometrical design parameters employed are typical of the proportions for wastewater system treatments and those used for anaerobic digestion methane fermentation treatment of animal manure in southern brazil they had the following characteristics see fig 1 i edge inclination height basis of tan φ 2 ii experimental runs are conducted at two different heights levels of liquid surface characterized by the height width ratio geometry parameters h d 0 25 level 1 and h d 0 18 level 2 the following dimensions were employed for level 1 h 1 0 33 m d 1 1 30 m and l 1 2 7 m for level 2 h 2 0 22 m d 1 1 22 m and l 1 2 6 m iii the volume at these two heights was v 1 0 920 m 3 and v 2 0 554 m 3 respectively and iv in view of the solid geometry of the pond upside down pyramidal frustum for each height we obtained a length width ratio of l d 1 2 05 and l d 2 2 13 respectively note that the measurements l d and h refer to the liquid surface the prototype was built with wood and covered with a pvc geomembrane 8 mm thick typically used in ponds the feed of fluid was carried out by a centralized pipe close to the wall edge from top to bottom at a height of 10 that of the fluid surface height the output was at liquid surface level 3 2 materials and experimental procedure experimental runs were conducted in the filled pond prototype with a constant feed of water according to the scheme presented in fig 1 the flow rate was maintained using a previously calibrated peristaltic pump operating in the range of 70 213 ml min with an accuracy of 10 2 ml min the flow rate used in each experiment was calculated according to the selected residence time and pond volume h d parameter the impulse tracer injection technique was employed to determine rtd function methylene blue c16h18cinxh2o was used as the tracer injection of 200 ml or 100 ml for the high and low h d respectively of a concentrated methylene blue solution was performed at the start of each experiment the tracer concentration at the output of pond was measured through time the analysis was carried out using a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 665 nm total time of monitoring varies between 12 and 37 days for the experiments conducted the runtime was stopped when the detection limit of the analytical method was reached 0 001 mg l from the methylene blue concentrations obtained in the output of the pond during each experimental run were calculated the normalized time and normalized rtd using the eqs 1 2 and 3 3 3 experimental runs variables and statistical analysis we performed five experimental runs table 2 in which we investigated the effect of the residence time τ and height width ratio h d geometric parameter volume based on the ponds employed in anaerobic digestion processes in brazil we selected a range between 3 and 9 days for τ and a pond h d ratio between 0 25 and 0 18 from the concentration profiles obtained against time in the experiments the dimensionless dtr function e θ θ was determined using eqs 1 2 and 3 and the proprieties of dtr θ m σ θ 2 and s θ 3 was evaluated by eqs 4 5 and 6 the effect of parameters τ and h d on the dimensionless rtd was evaluated by variance analysis adopting the proprieties of dtr as characteristics parameters 3 4 non ideal models adjustment and selection based on the experimental results obtained several models to describe the hydrodynamic non idealities were adjusted with the aim of selecting the best one the models considered are listed in table 1 and were based on the combination and or modification of cstrs we employed two different methods of adjustment firstly was a fast method for practical use based on the comparison of theoretical rtd proprieties with experimental ones secondly a non linear regression analysis was applied to adjust the dimensionless experimental rtd function data the rtd proprieties based method can be viewed as a generalization and expansion of the traditional approach applied for evaluating peclet number in dispersed flow models and a number of reactors in tanks in series models from the variance of the distribution data the application requires however the determination of the theoretical expression for the asymmetry parameter s θ 3 for each model to be tested as well as for σ θ 2 and θ m for models tested in this work these expressions are presented in table 1 eqs 7b c d 15b c d as an indication as to the suitability of models to predict a response using this strategy we can assume that the experimental rtd proprieties are equal to theoretical ones following determination of characteristic parameters until it can predict one or more rtd proprieties which can be compared with experimental values the models with less difference between theoretical and experimental rtd proprieties can be considered as appropriated to describe the non idealities furthermore the models were tested by regression analysis with experimental dimensionless rtd functions a non linear optimization technique using least square as the objective function was employed to estimate model parameter values the trust region reflective optimization algorithm 28 was used the coefficient of determination and adjusted coefficient of determination eq 16 allowed us to evaluate the power of prediction of each model in eq 16 r s s m o d e θ m o d e θ e x p 2 is the residual sum of squares of experimental data versus model prediction s s e x p e θ e x p e θ e x p 2 is the sum of squares of the deviations of experimental medium e θ e x p and n e x p and n p is the number of experimental data and number of model parameters respectively 14 r 2 1 r s s m o d s s e x p r a d j 2 1 r s s m o d n e x p n p s s e x p n e x p 1 while r 2 reveals purely the adjustment of the model to experimental data the adjusted coefficient of determination takes into account the number of model parameters allowing us to compare different models it is also desirable that an appropriate model be able to predict the rtd proprieties hence we used the theoretical prediction to evaluate the coefficient of variation 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental data fig 2 presents the normalized rtd function of the five experimental runs performed in this work the experimental parameters values are listed in table 2 as are the characteristic parameters of the distribution fig 2 from the experimental values of the average residence time fig 2 and table 2 we can observe the presence of dead zones and or by passing in the reactor which disables about 20 of reactor volume mean θ m equal to 0 80 the variance of the distribution shows a relatively large data dispersion between plug flow and cstr values the asymmetry parameter implies the strong extent of the tail of the distribution these characteristics indicate the tendency of the real reactor in the study to have a hydrodynamic behavior closer to a cstr in detriment of plug flow additionally from analysis of fig 2 curve we observe a fast increase of e θ θ at the beginning around θ m 0 11 from these arguments it can be stated that the more suitable class of non ideal model for the standard of mixing representation of the prototype pond were the configured and or modified cstr reactors as presented in table 1 4 2 effect of residence time and pond height width ratio on the rtd function variance analysis table 3 was employed to analyze the effect of experimental parameters τ and h d on the dimensionless rtd this evaluation used the parameter average dimensionless residence time variance of the distribution and asymmetry parameter the data of runs 2 and 3 conducted with the same experimental parameters were used to establish the experimental error the variances associated with the error of each of the rtd proprieties were compared with the variance associated with a change in the experimental parameter the tests applied and the variance analysis parameters are presented in table 3 for all parameters of rtd in all variance tests conducted was weak evidence confidence level of 95 that the rtd curves obtained were significantly different therefore ignoring any interaction effect between experimental parameters tested it can be said that the standard of mixing is the same in range between 3 and 9 days of residence time and for pond height width ratios between 0 25 and 0 18 4 3 non linear adjustment of models to rtd function for the rtd curves obtained in this work the non idealities can be modeled through the configuration and or modification of cstrs as presented in table 1 furthermore the variance analysis shows that the rtd curves can be considered as representing the same standard of mixing for the range of experimental parameters investigated in order to establish a hydrodynamic non idealities model for a pond type reactor the experimental rtd function data was adjusted by a non linear optimization algorithm trust region reflective using least squares technique table 4 lists the models used a b c d e and f from table 1 the parameter values from regression analysis of each model and data about the power of prediction the coefficient of determination of the adjustment of e θ θ function and the rtd proprieties variation s coefficient were also presented table 4 considering the adjusted coefficient of determination table 4 models c d and e can be considered the most adequate to predict the rtd function of pond type reactors the behavior of modeled rtd curves with the best parameters value can be seen in fig 3 models c d and e show the same prediction power according to the r 2 values in fact the prediction of rtd proprieties see table 1 of these models has already been shown as the same functional form based on a characteristic parameter x dependent of the models parameters applying the optimized parameters values of table 4 x is equal in models c d and e from this it can be concluded that independent of the physical significance of reactor schemes the models have the same behavior since the relationship x remains equal a similar conclusion was obtained in the theoretical section regarding dead zone models and by pass models fig 3 in an evaluation of possible solutions in steady state processes it can be noted that for simple reactions rate dependent on the concentration of one specie defined in kinetic expression the use of model c can be considered the most simple for first order reactions eq 15 establishes the relation of reaction conversion x and projected residence time of reactor τ where k is the kinetic constant for complex reactions the solution can be obtained by linear or non linear equation systems x 1 1 1 α β k τ 1 α 1 β k τ 15 therefore ignoring the scale up effects for residence times of 3 9 days and geometrical controls presented earlier the pond type reactor can be modeled as two cstrs in series with the volume of first reactor as 91 5 of the total volume and a utile volume of 84 9 of the total volume the model proposed can be easily applied as a rational design of a bioreactor 4 4 models analysis based on the proprieties of rtd successive calculation method in this section we explore and compare the method of successive calculation with the non linear adjustment the successive calculation method is based on the comparison of theoretical rtd proprieties with experimental ones for hydrodynamic non idealities model evaluations and has been used in the literature table 5 describes the procedure employed firstly the models were grouped according to the functional form of the expression for rtd proprieties see table 1 the theoretical expression obtained for θ m was taken for the experimental values the model parameter α is obtained and serves to predict σ θ 2 or to estimate other characteristic parameters n or x in turn these parameters were employed to predict s θ 3 from table 5 we can observe that the only model able to predict rtd moments within the experimental confidence interval is the model of two cstrs in series with the same volumes and with the presence of dead zones model b based on the evaluation of the module of differences between the estimated and experimental proprieties and degrees of freedom of the proprieties estimations we can rank the models according to their power of prediction as i model b remains it seems the most appropriate even with 2 degrees of freedom of estimation ii the interchange model model f with one degree of freedom of estimation iii the grouping of models with two cstrs with different volumes and or recycle models c d and e and with one degree of freedom and iv model a cstr with dead zones with 2 degrees of freedom also shows in table 5 for comparison the theoretical rtd moment values of the ideal cstr that present greater difference compared with the experimental values the comparison of the successive calculation method that is extensively used in the literature with the non linear regression shows that this method can be may lead to a misinterpretation of the phenomena involved in the nonidealities of the system in fig 3 can be seen that the model of two cstr with dead zones model b do not show an adequate correlation with experimental values of rtd distribution despite good correlation the moments of rtd 5 conclusions the study presented here focuses on developing and validating an approximate hydrodynamic non idealities model for homogeneous phase in a pond bioreactor the models used was based on the combination and or modification of cstrs the rtd function that characterizes the non idealities was theoretically obtained for various proposed models as well as expressions of rtd moments average dimensionless residence time variance and asymmetry parameter experimental measurement of rtd function and proprieties were obtained from impulse tracer injection technique experiments in a pilot scale pond with geometrical parameter values typically employed in anaerobic digestion processes in tropical and subtropical regions of brazil from variance analysis of experiments with residence times in the range 3 and 9 days and height width ratio geometry parameter of 0 18 0 25 we can conclude that exhibits equivalent hydrodynamic behavior in these conditions we explored the successive calculation method to evaluate non idealities models by comparison of theoretical and experimental rtd proprieties the models proposed also were adjusted by a non linear regression using least squares technique the comparison showed that the successive calculation method can be may lead to a misinterpretation of the phenomena involved in the non idealities of system we proved that configuration and modification of some cstr models exhibit the same power of prediction based on a characteristic number x the best model revels that the hydrodynamic non idealities of pond type reactors can be approximately described as two cstrs in series with the volume of first reactor being 91 5 and the utile volume being 84 9 of the total volume acknowledgements the authors are very grateful to foundation of research support of rio grande do sul fapergs brazil and program for scientific

are pulse and step injections of a tracer input to a continuous reactor at constant flow and the quantification of concentration c m l 3 in the effluent stream with time t t the tracer should be easily detectable inert in the system physically similar to the reagent mixture and must not adsorb in components of the reactor from the tracer concentration profile for pulse technique the rtd function is evaluated by eq 1 16 20 1 e t c t 0 c t d t for reactor projects are common to use the residence time τ t defined as the ratio of the reactor volume v l 3 and the volumetric flow υ 0 l 3 t 1 τ v υ 0 in engineering applications using the rtd results it is more common the use dimensionless parameters that can be used for any scale situation dimensionless time θ is defined by eq 2 2 θ t τ hence a normalized rtd function e θ θ dimensionless can be defined according to eq 3 16 3 e θ θ τ e t 2 2 characteristics of dimensionless rtd for each rtd function some proprieties that characterize the hydrodynamic behavior standard of mixing can be evaluated including average residence time variance and asymmetry parameters the first moment of the normalized rtd function is the normalized average residence time θ m it is computed as a weighted mean time of the rtd function if no dead zone is present in the reactor the mean residence time can be proved as equal to the projected residence time or θ m 1 this parameter of the distribution can be evaluated by eq 4 16 4 θ m 0 θ e θ θ d θ to evaluate the dispersion of the residence time distribution around θ m it is common to adopt the variance second moment of rtd that in normalized form σ θ 2 can be obtained by eq 5 16 the behavior of this parameter can be shown by analyzing the plug flow when σ θ 2 0 or on the other hand it can be proven that σ θ 2 1 for ideal cstr 5 σ θ 2 0 θ θ m 2 e θ θ d θ the third moment of the rtd is the asymmetry of the distribution defined in dimensionless form s θ 3 by eq 6 the asymmetry parameter provides an indication of the extent of the tail of the distribution in reactor analyses larger s θ 3 values can indicate hydrodynamic behavior close to cstr or cstr configuration smaller asymmetry parameters values can be interpreted as a mixing standard closer to plug flow 6 s θ 3 1 σ θ 3 2 0 θ θ m 3 e θ θ d θ 2 3 non ideal models comments and development real reactors do not always have a standard of mixing similar to ideal representations such as the perfect mixing in cstrs or plug flow in pfr reactors for pond type bioreactors the non idealities are associated with several aspects the geometrical configuration hydrodynamic which can cause the formation of dead zones velocities profiles by passing internal recirculation parallel paths and preferential paths the sediment deposition which can decrease the useful volume among others the rtd function can be used directly to provide the conversion in a certain real reactor but it can also be used for adjusting of an appropriate non idealities model non idealities models normally employ information about flow patterns and or different configurations and or modifications of ideal reactors 16 perhaps the most common class of models used to establish the standard of mixing hydrodynamic non idealities in ponds anaerobic facultative and maturation and aerated lagoons is the dispersed flow model 10 13 21 this model can describe situations from ideal plug flow to completely mixed conditions and requires only one parameter the peclet number the validation adjustment of this model can be accomplished by residence time distribution experiments by this means the transient one dimension continuity equation an elliptic second order linear partial differential equation should be solved with appropriate initial boundary conditions three different sets of boundaries conditions can be established referred to by fogler 16 and nameche and vasel 10 21 as closed to diffusion or closed closed vessel first proposed by danckwerts 22 semi open to diffusion or open to diffusion open open a peclet parameter for each model is easily obtained from the relation with the distribution proprieties variance and mean residence time 10 16 21 or by non linear adjustment the peclet parameter of the dispersed flow model can also be obtained from continuous reaction system data with a well know reaction kinetic however the solution of the governing equation in dispersed flow models coupled with kinetic of bioreaction in a steady state allows an analytical solution only for the simple zero or first order kinetic this is perhaps the most limiting factor to the application of this model in the rational design of real reactors for first order reactions under closed closed boundary conditions the equation to describe the concentration is known as the danckwerts 22 or wehner and wilhelm 23 solution other methods applied for the determination of non idealities are based on computational fluid dynamic numeric simulations 18 24 27 normally these are applied for analysis of a specific system generating results of rtd function which aims to improve the design and or operational conditions results can also be used to establish macroscopic non ideal models the combination or modification of ideal reactors can be considered to produce an additional class of non ideal models most widely used is the tank in series model combinations of ideal reactors using by pass and dead space interchanged reactors among others can also be applied 1 14 17 when proposing selecting a specific model the simplicity of the solution and physical realism should be taken into account mainly for applications coupled with kinetic models more complex than first order it is desirable that the non ideal model in steady state does not involve solving differential equations as is the case with plug flow reactors in this manner the combination modification of cstrs reactors provides a more suitable mathematical solution for practical use as already mentioned by gupta and patel 14 in fact the steady state solutions are obtained from only one or a system of linear or non linear equations for validation of a specific model by tracer injection technique researchers use the experimental output concentration profiles or residence time distribution compared with model solution results however this approach is only valid for specific situations when analyzing concentration profiles the curve is influenced by tracer type and amount injection technique and residence time of the project while in rtd function e t residence time scale have an influence therefore to establish a comparison base for the same type of reactor independent of these factors the use of dimensionless residence time distribution e θ θ is recommended the employment of the rtd function specifically e θ θ permits the obtainment of information about the proprieties of the rtd function as shown previously typically the variance of distribution σ θ 2 is used for non ideal model parameter determination as the peclet number in dispersed flow model 10 21 and the number of reactors in tanks in series model 16 in both cases however this does not allow the establishment of whether a model is valid for representation of the mixing standard in this work we expand the strategy for using rtd proprieties to infer specific hydrodynamic non idealities models using the theoretical asymmetry parameter s θ 3 deduced from the models proposed this parameter as a new approach permits an additional degree of freedom for a fast evidence decision about the best model in this work we propose several cstrs configurations and or modifications for non ideal models according to table 1 a concerted effort was made to obtain for all models the normalized rtd function e θ θ as well as rtd proprieties θ m σ θ 2 s θ 3 as a function of models parameters the models proposed were classified as ideal reactors conventional models by pass models recycle models and interchanged models in each class they can be distinguished as having only one cstr a series of cstrs predominantly two tanks tanks with different volumes and interchanged cstrs the obtainment of the function of the normalized dtr involves the transient solution of the material balance for a tracer pulse for each configuration shown in table 1 taking the concentration profile as the response the separation of variables method for the autonomous differential equation was employed for obtainment models i 1 a a 1 b b 1 b 2 c c 1 while for the system of first order ordinary differential equation generated for the models d e and f the eigenanalysis method was used the analytical solution for the concentration was applied in rtd function definition eq 1 that was transformed by definition of eqs 2 and 3 into the normalized rtd function e θ θ these results in turn allow the attainment of normalized rtd proprieties as a function of the model parameters by the definitions of eqs 4 5 and 6 in some models models c c 1 d e and f the empirical function was adjusted based on numerical results used to describe s θ 3 as a function of a characteristic parameter p b p p p r or characteristic number x p x r x p i by analogy with the obtainment for peclet number and number of tanks in series from the variance value x and p parameters can likewise be evaluated additionally in this work x and p were used to predict s θ 3 providing evidence with one degree of freedom as to the most appropriate type of model 3 materials and methods the methodology employed involves an experimental part followed by the validation of an appropriate model for describing the standard of mixing in a pond type bioreactor experiments consist in the obtainment of normalized rtd function in set conditions using the impulse tracer injection technique in a prototype tank data were treated statistically and convenient criteria were used to establish the best non ideal model based on the list proposed in table 1 3 1 experimental apparatus we developed a small scale prototype of a pond type reactor fig 1 the geometrical design parameters employed are typical of the proportions for wastewater system treatments and those used for anaerobic digestion methane fermentation treatment of animal manure in southern brazil they had the following characteristics see fig 1 i edge inclination height basis of tan φ 2 ii experimental runs are conducted at two different heights levels of liquid surface characterized by the height width ratio geometry parameters h d 0 25 level 1 and h d 0 18 level 2 the following dimensions were employed for level 1 h 1 0 33 m d 1 1 30 m and l 1 2 7 m for level 2 h 2 0 22 m d 1 1 22 m and l 1 2 6 m iii the volume at these two heights was v 1 0 920 m 3 and v 2 0 554 m 3 respectively and iv in view of the solid geometry of the pond upside down pyramidal frustum for each height we obtained a length width ratio of l d 1 2 05 and l d 2 2 13 respectively note that the measurements l d and h refer to the liquid surface the prototype was built with wood and covered with a pvc geomembrane 8 mm thick typically used in ponds the feed of fluid was carried out by a centralized pipe close to the wall edge from top to bottom at a height of 10 that of the fluid surface height the output was at liquid surface level 3 2 materials and experimental procedure experimental runs were conducted in the filled pond prototype with a constant feed of water according to the scheme presented in fig 1 the flow rate was maintained using a previously calibrated peristaltic pump operating in the range of 70 213 ml min with an accuracy of 10 2 ml min the flow rate used in each experiment was calculated according to the selected residence time and pond volume h d parameter the impulse tracer injection technique was employed to determine rtd function methylene blue c16h18cinxh2o was used as the tracer injection of 200 ml or 100 ml for the high and low h d respectively of a concentrated methylene blue solution was performed at the start of each experiment the tracer concentration at the output of pond was measured through time the analysis was carried out using a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 665 nm total time of monitoring varies between 12 and 37 days for the experiments conducted the runtime was stopped when the detection limit of the analytical method was reached 0 001 mg l from the methylene blue concentrations obtained in the output of the pond during each experimental run were calculated the normalized time and normalized rtd using the eqs 1 2 and 3 3 3 experimental runs variables and statistical analysis we performed five experimental runs table 2 in which we investigated the effect of the residence time τ and height width ratio h d geometric parameter volume based on the ponds employed in anaerobic digestion processes in brazil we selected a range between 3 and 9 days for τ and a pond h d ratio between 0 25 and 0 18 from the concentration profiles obtained against time in the experiments the dimensionless dtr function e θ θ was determined using eqs 1 2 and 3 and the proprieties of dtr θ m σ θ 2 and s θ 3 was evaluated by eqs 4 5 and 6 the effect of parameters τ and h d on the dimensionless rtd was evaluated by variance analysis adopting the proprieties of dtr as characteristics parameters 3 4 non ideal models adjustment and selection based on the experimental results obtained several models to describe the hydrodynamic non idealities were adjusted with the aim of selecting the best one the models considered are listed in table 1 and were based on the combination and or modification of cstrs we employed two different methods of adjustment firstly was a fast method for practical use based on the comparison of theoretical rtd proprieties with experimental ones secondly a non linear regression analysis was applied to adjust the dimensionless experimental rtd function data the rtd proprieties based method can be viewed as a generalization and expansion of the traditional approach applied for evaluating peclet number in dispersed flow models and a number of reactors in tanks in series models from the variance of the distribution data the application requires however the determination of the theoretical expression for the asymmetry parameter s θ 3 for each model to be tested as well as for σ θ 2 and θ m for models tested in this work these expressions are presented in table 1 eqs 7b c d 15b c d as an indication as to the suitability of models to predict a response using this strategy we can assume that the experimental rtd proprieties are equal to theoretical ones following determination of characteristic parameters until it can predict one or more rtd proprieties which can be compared with experimental values the models with less difference between theoretical and experimental rtd proprieties can be considered as appropriated to describe the non idealities furthermore the models were tested by regression analysis with experimental dimensionless rtd functions a non linear optimization technique using least square as the objective function was employed to estimate model parameter values the trust region reflective optimization algorithm 28 was used the coefficient of determination and adjusted coefficient of determination eq 16 allowed us to evaluate the power of prediction of each model in eq 16 r s s m o d e θ m o d e θ e x p 2 is the residual sum of squares of experimental data versus model prediction s s e x p e θ e x p e θ e x p 2 is the sum of squares of the deviations of experimental medium e θ e x p and n e x p and n p is the number of experimental data and number of model parameters respectively 14 r 2 1 r s s m o d s s e x p r a d j 2 1 r s s m o d n e x p n p s s e x p n e x p 1 while r 2 reveals purely the adjustment of the model to experimental data the adjusted coefficient of determination takes into account the number of model parameters allowing us to compare different models it is also desirable that an appropriate model be able to predict the rtd proprieties hence we used the theoretical prediction to evaluate the coefficient of variation 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental data fig 2 presents the normalized rtd function of the five experimental runs performed in this work the experimental parameters values are listed in table 2 as are the characteristic parameters of the distribution fig 2 from the experimental values of the average residence time fig 2 and table 2 we can observe the presence of dead zones and or by passing in the reactor which disables about 20 of reactor volume mean θ m equal to 0 80 the variance of the distribution shows a relatively large data dispersion between plug flow and cstr values the asymmetry parameter implies the strong extent of the tail of the distribution these characteristics indicate the tendency of the real reactor in the study to have a hydrodynamic behavior closer to a cstr in detriment of plug flow additionally from analysis of fig 2 curve we observe a fast increase of e θ θ at the beginning around θ m 0 11 from these arguments it can be stated that the more suitable class of non ideal model for the standard of mixing representation of the prototype pond were the configured and or modified cstr reactors as presented in table 1 4 2 effect of residence time and pond height width ratio on the rtd function variance analysis table 3 was employed to analyze the effect of experimental parameters τ and h d on the dimensionless rtd this evaluation used the parameter average dimensionless residence time variance of the distribution and asymmetry parameter the data of runs 2 and 3 conducted with the same experimental parameters were used to establish the experimental error the variances associated with the error of each of the rtd proprieties were compared with the variance associated with a change in the experimental parameter the tests applied and the variance analysis parameters are presented in table 3 for all parameters of rtd in all variance tests conducted was weak evidence confidence level of 95 that the rtd curves obtained were significantly different therefore ignoring any interaction effect between experimental parameters tested it can be said that the standard of mixing is the same in range between 3 and 9 days of residence time and for pond height width ratios between 0 25 and 0 18 4 3 non linear adjustment of models to rtd function for the rtd curves obtained in this work the non idealities can be modeled through the configuration and or modification of cstrs as presented in table 1 furthermore the variance analysis shows that the rtd curves can be considered as representing the same standard of mixing for the range of experimental parameters investigated in order to establish a hydrodynamic non idealities model for a pond type reactor the experimental rtd function data was adjusted by a non linear optimization algorithm trust region reflective using least squares technique table 4 lists the models used a b c d e and f from table 1 the parameter values from regression analysis of each model and data about the power of prediction the coefficient of determination of the adjustment of e θ θ function and the rtd proprieties variation s coefficient were also presented table 4 considering the adjusted coefficient of determination table 4 models c d and e can be considered the most adequate to predict the rtd function of pond type reactors the behavior of modeled rtd curves with the best parameters value can be seen in fig 3 models c d and e show the same prediction power according to the r 2 values in fact the prediction of rtd proprieties see table 1 of these models has already been shown as the same functional form based on a characteristic parameter x dependent of the models parameters applying the optimized parameters values of table 4 x is equal in models c d and e from this it can be concluded that independent of the physical significance of reactor schemes the models have the same behavior since the relationship x remains equal a similar conclusion was obtained in the theoretical section regarding dead zone models and by pass models fig 3 in an evaluation of possible solutions in steady state processes it can be noted that for simple reactions rate dependent on the concentration of one specie defined in kinetic expression the use of model c can be considered the most simple for first order reactions eq 15 establishes the relation of reaction conversion x and projected residence time of reactor τ where k is the kinetic constant for complex reactions the solution can be obtained by linear or non linear equation systems x 1 1 1 α β k τ 1 α 1 β k τ 15 therefore ignoring the scale up effects for residence times of 3 9 days and geometrical controls presented earlier the pond type reactor can be modeled as two cstrs in series with the volume of first reactor as 91 5 of the total volume and a utile volume of 84 9 of the total volume the model proposed can be easily applied as a rational design of a bioreactor 4 4 models analysis based on the proprieties of rtd successive calculation method in this section we explore and compare the method of successive calculation with the non linear adjustment the successive calculation method is based on the comparison of theoretical rtd proprieties with experimental ones for hydrodynamic non idealities model evaluations and has been used in the literature table 5 describes the procedure employed firstly the models were grouped according to the functional form of the expression for rtd proprieties see table 1 the theoretical expression obtained for θ m was taken for the experimental values the model parameter α is obtained and serves to predict σ θ 2 or to estimate other characteristic parameters n or x in turn these parameters were employed to predict s θ 3 from table 5 we can observe that the only model able to predict rtd moments within the experimental confidence interval is the model of two cstrs in series with the same volumes and with the presence of dead zones model b based on the evaluation of the module of differences between the estimated and experimental proprieties and degrees of freedom of the proprieties estimations we can rank the models according to their power of prediction as i model b remains it seems the most appropriate even with 2 degrees of freedom of estimation ii the interchange model model f with one degree of freedom of estimation iii the grouping of models with two cstrs with different volumes and or recycle models c d and e and with one degree of freedom and iv model a cstr with dead zones with 2 degrees of freedom also shows in table 5 for comparison the theoretical rtd moment values of the ideal cstr that present greater difference compared with the experimental values the comparison of the successive calculation method that is extensively used in the literature with the non linear regression shows that this method can be may lead to a misinterpretation of the phenomena involved in the nonidealities of the system in fig 3 can be seen that the model of two cstr with dead zones model b do not show an adequate correlation with experimental values of rtd distribution despite good correlation the moments of rtd 5 conclusions the study presented here focuses on developing and validating an approximate hydrodynamic non idealities model for homogeneous phase in a pond bioreactor the models used was based on the combination and or modification of cstrs the rtd function that characterizes the non idealities was theoretically obtained for various proposed models as well as expressions of rtd moments average dimensionless residence time variance and asymmetry parameter experimental measurement of rtd function and proprieties were obtained from impulse tracer injection technique experiments in a pilot scale pond with geometrical parameter values typically employed in anaerobic digestion processes in tropical and subtropical regions of brazil from variance analysis of experiments with residence times in the range 3 and 9 days and height width ratio geometry parameter of 0 18 0 25 we can conclude that exhibits equivalent hydrodynamic behavior in these conditions we explored the successive calculation method to evaluate non idealities models by comparison of theoretical and experimental rtd proprieties the models proposed also were adjusted by a non linear regression using least squares technique the comparison showed that the successive calculation method can be may lead to a misinterpretation of the phenomena involved in the non idealities of system we proved that configuration and modification of some cstr models exhibit the same power of prediction based on a characteristic number x the best model revels that the hydrodynamic non idealities of pond type reactors can be approximately described as two cstrs in series with the volume of first reactor being 91

14552,a thin film composite tfc fo membrane was used to study the fouling characteristics of effluent organic matter efom fractions in treated wastewater effluent represented by alginate bovine serum albumin humic acid and octanoic acid these model foulants were chosen to represent carbohydrates proteins humic substances and fatty acids inter foulant interactions and their influence on membrane flux loss was established by running series of fouling tests with feed solutions containing mixtures of model foulants the obtained results demonstrated that under our experimental conditions humic acid ha and octanoic acid oa had no significant role on permeate flux loss during wastewater treatment over short periods however alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa and their mixtures caused significant total flux loss through alginate calcium complexation that led to the formation of a resistant gel layer on the membrane surface protein fouling was mainly attributed to multiple layer adsorption onto the polyamide membrane surface mixing alginate with bsa saw a further decline in permeate flux worse than that caused individually by either of the foulants and gives an indication of the synergistic effect between the two foulants there were favourable inter foulant interactions between the carbohydrates and the proteins that promoted the formation of hybrid aggregates that were deposited on the membrane surface and enhanced flux loss the additional presence of humic acid to the mixture of bsa and alginate further aggravated membrane fouling polysaccharides and proteins were found to be the most dominant foulants during wastewater reclamation the extent of interactions between the organic foulants had an effect on the fouling layer structure and its role in permeate flux loss keywords bovine serum albumin complexation effluent organic matter flux decline thin film composite wastewater 1 introduction wastewater treatment for the purposes of supplementing the continuously decreasing fresh water supplies has caught global attention amongst water authorities and researchers as a potential alternative fresh water source 1 3 this has prompted several research studies that focus on the viability and efficiency of using such feed streams in membrane based separation processes 4 6 the potential benefit of using wastewater as a feed stream in water treatment include its constant availability through out the year and it could also be a means of limiting contamination of aquatic environments from treated industrial effluent that contains various pollutants 7 apart from the inorganic compounds and particulates in wastewater effluent it also contains effluent organic matter efom which comprises a range of low to high molecular weight organic compounds such as polysaccharides proteins humic and fulvic acids organic acids and lipids 8 9 thus membrane filtration processes are ideal as advance treatment steps for such feed streams due to their excellent rejection abilities of a wide array of contaminants however one key drawback of using wastewater as a feed stream is the intense fouling that is mainly caused by fractions of efom 7 8 10 membrane fouling is a consequence of the interaction between the membrane and the feed solution which maybe a complex mixture comprising of colloids bacteria flocs and dissolved organic macromolecules 11 the adverse impacts of fouling on membrane performance and the overall water treatment system is well documented in previous studies and it includes reduced membrane lifespan poor permeate quality increased applied pressure and inflated overall treatment costs 5 12 one strategy of minimising both energy consumption and membrane fouling during wastewater effluent treatment is the possibility of using forward osmosis membrane process as a pre treatment step this process is dependent on the solute concentration difference between the feed solution and draw solution that drives water across a semi permeable membrane therefore there is no application of external hydraulic pressure and thus fouling is largely reversible 13 in this work the thin film composite tfc membrane was chosen to conduct fouling tests using feed streams simulating secondary treated wastewater effluent this water characteristically contain effluent organic matter efom which is known to contribute significantly to organic fouling of nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes in advanced wastewater reclamation processes 14 19 the chemical complexity and heterogeneous nature efom presents a challenge to developing proper understanding of the role of inter foulant interactions in permeate flux decline as well as fouling layer formation numerous findings have attributed the observed severe flux loss to synergistic effects between co existing foulants 20 ang et al 21 reported a synergistic fouling effect when ro membranes were fouled by both alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa foulant foulant adhesion forces were found to increase with calcium concentration zhao and co workers then investigated the interactions between efom fractions and ro membranes 22 it was revealed that hydrophilic neutral fractions mainly composed of small sized carbohydrates resulted in the highest flux decline and exhibited highest affinity towards the membrane however in contrast to previous findings they found that extracellular polymeric substances eps did not cause significant flux loss in another study by ang et al 23 ro membranes were fouled by a mixture of organic foulants simulating wastewater effluent using alginate bsa suwannee river natural organic matter nom and octanoic acid they found that membrane fouling was governed by alginate in the presence of ca2 which was in turn influenced by alginate aggregate size and conformation in the bulk solution li et al 24 investigated a different influential factor where the role of ro membrane surface properties in membrane fouling by bsa and sodium alginate experimental results revealed that membrane surface roughness had the greatest effect on fouling by the biopolymers a considerable synergistic effect was observed when both bsa and alginate co existed in the same feed solution which was attributed to the large foulant particle sizes resulting from the formation of bsa alginate aggregates another importance of membrane surfaces was reported by wang and tang 25 who observed that membranes with smoother and more hydrophilic surface turn to possess favourable electrostatic repulsion experienced less initial flux membrane fouling the influence of membrane surface was also highlighted by mo et al 26 who found that protein membrane interactions influenced the fouling behaviour of polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membranes the above mentioned studies offers insight onto the influence of both feed composition and membrane surfaces on membrane fouling using pressure driven processes ro however the few studies conducted in forward osmosis offer little insight into membrane fouling mechanisms but rather a performance evaluation of the process in direct wastewater reclamation 27 linares et al 28 assessed the efficiency of a submerged fo system to treat wastewater permeate flux loss was attributed formation of fouling layer on the membrane surface which was mainly composed of biopolymer like substances another attempt to treat wastewater was made by achilli et al 29 where they utilized a submerged fo membrane inside a bioreactor and found that fouling was mild and permeate flux was almost completely restored using osmotic backwash this literature review has availed valuable information into membrane fouling behaviour and the characteristic fouling potential of wastewater effluent components proper understanding of the chemical composition of wastewater is important since it can help predict possible of reactions and interactions amongst organic foulants and inorganics 30 33 however the systematic understanding of the interactions between the different efom fractions is still poorly understood the labile nature and complex structure of biological foulants such as proteins brings additional challenges in fouling characterization thus in this work we aim at investigating the exact inter foulant interactions that influences permeate flux decline and the fouling layer formation when the efom fractions co exist in feed streams fouling tests were performed using the high performance polyamide modified tfc fo membrane with hydrophilic surfaces particular emphasis was made to identifying efom fractions with a superior role to permeate flux loss during wastewater effluent treatment by performing sequential and combined foulant experiments 2 experimental 2 1 model foulants several parameters can be used to describe typical wastewater and composition is one of the universally used parameter typical domestic wastewater effluent organic matter efom can be generally characterized by varying concentrations of proteins carbohydrates aquatic humic substances and oil fats 2 thus for the purposes of this work we chose bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate alg humic acid and octanoic acid to represent the previously mentioned efom fractions these model organic foulants were supplied by sigma aldrich st louis mo bovine serum albumin sodium alginate and humic acid were received in powder form and stock solutions 1 g l bsa 2 g l alginate 2 g l humic acid were prepared by dissolving each foulant in deionised water the stock solutions were continuously stirred over 24 h to ensure complete dissolution of each foulant and then kept at 4 c a stock solution of octanoic acid was also prepared in di water 1 g l and its ph was adjusted to around 6 7 using 0 1 m

electrophoretic mobility which is then converted to zeta potential 2 3 2 microscopic characterization the topology structure and roughness of the tfc membrane and the fouling layers were characterized

deionised water glycerol and diiodomethane were used for contact angle measurements using the kruss drop shape analyzer dsa30 kruss gmbh germany which was equipped with a video camera linked to a computer program the sessile drop method was used to measure the contact angles of the liquids about 3 μl on the clean and fouled membrane surfaces at 25 c a minimum of 15 measurements on different

concentration used during fouling tests was set at 200 mg l nacl and cacl2 were added to each feed solution to adjust its ionic strength to 20 mm the various feed solutions and their compositions are listed in table 1 the fouling characteristics and potential of the organic foulants were determined by conducting single foulant experiments for all four model foulants furthermore possible synergistic interactions between two or more foulants were investigated through conducting filtration tests using mixed foulants feed streams the concentration of the draw solution was fixed at 3 0 m nacl for all experiments and it yielded an initial permeate flux of 22 12 0 87 lm 2 h 1 the laboratory scale cross flow filtration test unit used in this work is similar to that used in our previously published work 39 it composed of a flat sheet membrane cell variable gear peristaltic pumps masterflex cole parmer usa and conductivity control consort multi parameter conductivity meter feed and draw reservoirs and data acquisition system the concentration of the draw solution was maintained at a constant value using a real time conductivity monitoring program using a consort conductivity meter before to conducting each membrane fouling test baseline experiments were conducted with feed solutions lacking the foulant this was followed by the membrane fouling experiments which were performed for 24 h the active layer facing feed solution fo mode configuration was used during all fouling tests both the feed and draw solutions had a fixed cross flow velocity of 10 0 cm s 2 4 1 sequential fouling in an effort to study the specific interactions between the foulant species we conducted sequential fouling experiments where the membrane was fouled by the two foulants with the most fouling potential bsa and alginate in alternating sequences such that the complete fouling experiment lasted for 48 h after the first 24 h of filtration fresh solutions of both feed and draw solutions were replaced all experimental conditions feed solution chemistry and cross flow velocity were kept the same as previous single and combined fouling tests alginate and bsa were used to perform sequential studies based on their high fouling potentials which were likely to yield significant information on fouling mechanisms and inter foulant interactions 3 results 3 1 foulant and gel layer characterization dynamic light scattering dls measurements provided information on the hydrodynamic diameters of the foulant macro aggregates in the aqueous feed solutions the values presented in table 2 show the aggregate sizes before and after the addition of nacl and cacl2 it also shows the total permeate flux decline percentages after filtration of the various feed streams there is a clear influence of na and ca2 on the macromolecular size which significantly increased after their introduction this is in line with previously reported studies where the influence of divalent cations particularly ca2 on organic fouling was investigated and using surrogate organic compounds 40 their presence has been described to aggravate fouling caused by organic foulants via charge neutralization complexation and forming calcium bridges 41 the changes in aggregate sizes were quite conspicuous and the order of increasing particle size was bsa humic acid alginate this trend is in line with observed intensity of surface charge reduction values the zeta potential values of all three primary foulants were found to be negative alginate and humic acid exhibited a high negative charge mainly due to the presence of negative carboxylate groups therefore they had prominent interaction with the cations both na and ca2 as evidenced by the large reduction in negative charges the determination of both surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter of octanoic acid was unsuccessful bsa macromolecules had the lowest zeta potential values table 2 and were least influenced by the cations the zeta potential and hydrodynamic sizes for mixed foulants were influenced by species concentrations molecular size and shape as well as organic organic interactions 42 therefore the values presented here are averages of a range of sizes and they should be viewed with some reservation thus the discussion is based on qualitative observations rather than on quantitative data the influence of these ions on the fouling potential of each foulant was found to vary although alginate fouling was consistent with the observed physicochemical charge and particle size changes however a noticeable deviation was observed with humic acid which resulted in less fouling even in the presence of calcium ions a possible explanation for this anomalous observation is the ha ca2 ratio used for the purposes of this study this particular ratio included insufficient calcium ions to complex with ha the presence of sodium ions was an additional factor as the na competed with the ca2 for the negatively charged ha carboxylic groups 3 2 fouling characteristics of single foulants the impact of each foulant on permeate flux was investigated by filtering all four single foulants in the presence of both na and ca2 using the tfc es membrane the resulting flux decline profiles are presented and compared in fig 1 the corresponding permeate flux drops are listed in table 2 permeate flux drop caused by octanoic acid was indistinct and almost unnoticeable the water flux was stable throughout the filtration experiment indicating that no foulant deposition occurred a similar observation was made with humic acid the flux decline curve was the same as that of the baseline experiment suggesting that the only observed flux decline was due to the increase in feed solute concentration due to the inevitable decrease in feed solution volume which in turn increased the feed s osmotic pressure according to past studies the presence of ca2 can intensify humic acid fouling due to the formation of humic acid calcium complexes 41 however humic acid is not very selective for calcium ions in this case the na ions were in abundance 17 mm compared to ca2 1 mm and therefore they competed for the negative charges in humic acid leading to the formation of small humic aggregates that were not easily deposited onto the membrane surface 40 42 this was further supported by the humic acid aggregate sizes that were measured in the presence of ca2 na and ca2 na as they recorded average aggregate sizes of 278 161 and 189 nm respectively electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged membrane 9 4 mv and humic acid particles also played a role in its relative low deposition and adhesion notably the humic acid maintained a negative charge 27 mv even after the introduction of cations table 2 contrary to octanoic acid and humic acid distinctive permeate flux decline trends were observed with bsa and alginate despite being low in concentrations compared to humic acid alginate had a higher initial flux decline rate compared to bsa the significant initial flux decline caused by alginate fouling is attributed to the already highlighted complexation between calcium and negatively charged alginate polyanions leading to an increase in aggregate size and enhanced deposition rate eventually the membrane surface is covered by a soft thick gel that increased resistance towards permeate flow thus the adhesion of alginate onto the membrane surface in the early stages of the filtration process can be attributed to permeation drag generated by initial permeate flux membrane fouling due to bsa deposition showed a two stage flux decline profile with the initial stage characterised by constant flux without decline and then followed by a steep decline in permeate flux this fouling profile suggest that the less negative bsa molecules adsorb onto the membrane surface but the adsorbed monolayer had negligible effect on the membrane flux thus permeate flux remained stable as filtration proceeds more protein molecules deposited on the adsorbed bsa monolayer due to permeation drag forming a multi layered film that provided resistance to permeate flow it can therefore be assumed that the interactions between adsorbed bsa molecules and incoming molecules favoured the formation of a multi layered film and at the initial stages macromolecular adsorption was governed by bsa membrane interactions these observations confirm or corroborate findings made in earlier investigations that polysaccharides and protein like fractions of wastewater effluent were responsible for severe membrane fouling during wastewater treatment 42 43 the next sections discusses the interactions between foulants when they co exist in the same feed solution in an attempt to underpin foulant foulant interactions during membrane fouling 3 3 effect of co foulants on permeate flux loss the two fractions that caused the most severe permeate flux loss alginate bsa were mixed in the same feed stream and their combined effect on permeate flux decline was investigated the fouling trend was then compared to those of the single foulants as displayed in fig 2 the most outstanding observation is that the co existence of alginate and bsa caused further permeate flux loss the flux decline curve resembled that of bsa alone characterised by the first stable flux region followed by the high flux loss rate until a steady flux point was reached this indicates that bsa molecules had a primary effect on the formation of the combined fouling layer the zeta potential results suggest that the two foulants should repel each other because they possess negative surface charges however the interactions between the foulants seem to be governed by other forces beyond electrostatic interactions most likely hydrophobic interactions were more dominant in the formation of alginate bsa aggregates as supported by the observed increase in foulant aggregate size when the two foulants were present in the same feed solution table 1 bsa macromolecules were incorporated into the alginate calcium complexes 24 44 these large aggregates were easily deposited onto the membrane surface under permeation drag forming a layer that also reduced the back diffusion of salts from the membrane surface to the bulk solution it can therefore be concluded that the addition of alginate to bsa enhanced permeate flux loss fouling which confirms the synergistic interactions between the two foulants an attempt to unpack the mechanisms is made in subsequent sections 3 4 organic fouling with three co foulants upon determining the combined effect of alginate and bsa on permeate flux loss the next step was to investigate the influence of oa and ha when added to the feed solution containing alginate and bsa thus the more complex feed solutions comprising of a mixture of three foulants were then treated using the tfc membrane fig 3 a shows that the mixture of alginate humic acid and octanoic acid had an almost constant flux over 24 h of filtration without any noticeable flux loss this result was again beyond expectations since alginate and humic acid in the presence ca2 have been reported to worsen fouling due to the formation of ha ca2 alg ca2 and alg ha complexes as the formed fouling layers act to increase resistance to permeate flow 41 45 the explanation for this could be that the ca2 concentration was ineffective in causing complete complexation of the foulants 80 mg l alg and 200 mg l ha thus aggregate formation was insignificant the macromolecules were stable in the feed solution and the foulants remained in the bulk solution rather than being deposited this explanation is backed by the flux loss curves given in fig 3b which shows that an increase in permeate flux loss when the ca2 concentration was increased to 2 mm calcium ions enhanced the alginate alginate interactions which led to complexation and their subsequent deposition on the membrane surface a clear decline in permeate flux loss was recorded when the tfc membrane was used to filter the mixture of alginate octanoic acid and bsa permeate flux decline rate was slow at the initial stages within 5 h of filtration followed by a fast decline the entire experiment fig 3a the permeate flux decline trend was similar to that of the mixture of alginate and bsa an indication that octanoic acid did not contribute to flux loss however excessive flux loss was observed when humic acid was added to the mixture of alginate and bsa the permeate flux loss rate was so rapid that it dropped to 10 in the first 10 h of filtration and the steady state flux point was also reached at about the same filtration period therefore humic acid enhanced membrane fouling in the presence of bsa and alginate this suggests that there were favourable interactions between the organic foulants that led to excessive deposition rate onto the membrane surface resulting on a thick and resistant cake layer which enhanced permeate flux loss the differences observed in the flux decline rates due to the various feed compositions could be attributed to the different foulant foulant and foulant membrane interactions during filtration which then led to different fouling layer properties these findings support those of earlier studies that humic acids polysaccharides and proteins are the most significant foulants during wastewater reclamation and the fo membrane process was no exception 25 31 44 3 5 composition of fouling layers the composition of the fouling layers were then studied with fluorescence excitation emission matrix to identify the dominant efom fractions responsible for fouling layer formation fig 4 shows the excitation emission spectra for the different model foulants and their mixtures the recorded maximum excitation emission wavelengths λex em were 250 500 250 450 and 200 400 nm for bsa alginate and humic acid respectively there was a clear shift on both the maximum excitation and emission wavelengths of the resulting spectra when the foulants co existed in the feed solution as shown in fig 4 the fluorescence analysis further provided proof that interactions amongst the organic foulants results in modification of chemical properties leading to new excitation emission regions which led to the observed fouling mechanisms and fouling layer structural properties the spectra resulting from the foulant mixtures revealed contour regions that can be attributed to aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by products represented by alginate 45 49 suggesting that the fouling layer was dominated by polysaccharides and proteins 3 6 foulant foulant interaction mechanisms 3 6 1 fouling layer physicochemical properties the understanding on the synergistic interactions between alginate and bsa was developed by conducting sequential fouling tests the morphology and topology of the clean and fouled tfc membrane were studied using scanning electron and atomic force microscopy culminating to the micrographs displayed in fig 5 sem images reveal that the membrane surfaces were completely covered with a gel layer after filtration of the three feed solutions as a result of the extensive deposition of alginate and bsa there were no visible morphological differences amongst the formed fouling layers however analysis with afm showed that their topologies vary based on roughness the gel layer resulting from the mixture of alginate and bsa had the least rough topology ra 91 nm compared to that of the sequential fouling which translates to a tight gel layer configuration that had higher resistance to mass transfer whilst the deposition of alginate after bsa resulted in the roughest layer ra 183 nm 3 6 2 sequential fouling membrane fouling mechanisms this section discusses the sequential fouling phenomena in a bid to further identify foulant foulant interactions and understand their influence on fouling and cake layer formation during filtration of complex feed streams alginate and bsa were used to perform sequential studies based on their fouling behaviours observed in the previous experiments fig 6 shows the flux decline curves during sequential fouling with alginate and bsa the fouling curves were representative of the single foulants a high initial flux loss rate was observed for alginate and the delayed initial flux loss associated with bsa fouling when the membrane was first fouled with bsa then followed by alginate the membrane initial permeate flux was completely recovered followed by a fast flux loss the permeate flux regain can be attributed to the cleaning effect and the lowered feed osmotic pressure induced by the fresh alginate feed solution it also shows that the bsa multiple layers are poorly attached on the membrane surface which is typical of the forward osmosis process due to the lack of external hydraulic force 50 however permeate flux loss on the second part of the experiment the next 24 h was significantly high and was a function of both the settling of the disturbed fouling layer as well as the formation of a highly resistant gel layer similar observations were made when the bsa feed solution came after algninate about 90 of membrane initial permeate flux was recovered when the switch was made from alginate to bsa followed by a quick decline in permeate flux loss towards pseudo stable flux at about 36 h these curves confirms that there is continued deposition of either foulant when the membrane surface was already covered by the previous foulant implying the adsorption of either foulant on each other 51 in terms of electrostatic interactions it is expected that attractive forces should be dominant when the two foulants co exist in an aqueous solution resulting in micro aggregate formation which subsequently led to fouling layer formation the changes on membrane surface charge during foulant deposition was studied using adsorption experiments the same foulant concentration as that used during fouling experiments was used during adsorption to mimic the fouling experiments the observed zeta potential curves were representative of the surface charges of the single foulants alginate and bsa fig 7 the tfc membrane exhibited a negative charge at slightly acidic ph 5 98 initial deposition of bsa resulted in a positive surface but the subsequent adsorption of alginate reversed the surface charge back to negative suggesting that alginate got adsorbed on the bsa multilayers a similar observation was made when the order of fouling was reversed therefore these observation also reinforces our earlier hypothesis that there are favourable interactions between alginate and bsa that promote membrane fouling during wastewater treatment 3 6 3 surface free energy determinations the clean tfc membrane recorded the lowest water contact angle of 30 7 2 2 which classify its surface as hydrophilic the presence of the combined alginate bsa gel layer on the surface completely modified the surface to the lower end of hydrophilicity as per the angles listed in table 3 the resulting fouling layer from the sequential fouling resulted in similar electron donor functionality the presence of fouling layer clearly modified the surface of the membrane by lowering both the electron donor and acceptor functionality and slightly increasing the liftshitz van de waals component an observation corroborated by the increased measured water contact angles the reduced surface hydrophilicity contributed to the lowered permeate flux during filtration which implies that long term filtration of such feed streams would not be ideal due to the excessive fouling resulting in poor water recovery rates the fouling layers formed through sequential fouling using alginate and bsa had different physicochemical properties the fouling layer terminated by bsa was more hydrophilic 44 1 compared to that terminated by alginate 58 5 these observed differences in fouling layer properties further confirms the effect of foulant interactions that contribute to fouling layer formation 3 6 4 influence of foulant ratios on permeate flux loss the interactions between foulants were further studied by varying the concentration ratio of alginate and bsa fig 8 shows that there is a clear difference between the two trends the change in concentration between alginate and bsa have an influence on fouling behaviour when the concentration of alginate is double that of bsa severe flux loss was recorded these fouling trends were further corroborated by the aggregate sizes shown in fig 9 across the filtration duration it has been clearly demonstrated in previous sections that the mixture of alginate and bsa exacerbated membrane fouling however what could be drawn from this section is that during combined fouling the resultant layer is dominated by alginate macromolecules thus when the concentration of bsa was doubled when bsa molecules are dominant fouling is less this is due to the differences in adhesion energies between the foulants and the membranes 36 when alginate and bsa exist in the ratio of 1 1 25 the preferred ratio used in this study in the latter stages of filtration after 7 h the fouling process is mainly governed by alginate aggregates the aggregate size generally increased with filtration duration as the concentration of solutes increased in the feed streams the denser aggregates should be deposited easily on the membrane surface form a thick fouling layer this graph fig 8 give an idea of the fouling layer formation during combined foulant fouling at the initial stages fouling was set on by the smaller aggregates forming a thin uniform layer which was eventually covered by larger aggregates it has already been established that alginate and bsa interact to form hybrid aggregates thus the changes in aggregate sizes there was more aggregation in the retentate solution when the concentration of alginate was doubled rising from 175 to 370 nm during the filtration period as a result there was more permeate flux loss was recorded when this feed composition was used implying a faster deposition rate of gel aggregates that formed a more hydrostatic fouling layer however when the concentration of bsa was doubled the particle size did not change significantly starting at 200 275 nm in 24 h it can then be inferred that the smaller particles has a relatively lower deposition rate and so effective permeate flux was maintained over an extended period yielding higher water recoveries these results imply that in the case of the mixture of polysaccharides and proteins fouling severity depends on foulant foulant concentrations as well as interactions and the variations feed composition brings about different interactions that lead to different trends of fouling mechanisms the discussed results clearly demonstrated the synergy during combined fouling comes from alginate bsa interactions that favours the formation of resistant cake layer on membrane surface 52 4 conclusions a series of fouling experiments using various feed compositions was conducted to determine the fouling behaviour of the commercial tfc membrane when used to filter feed streams that simulate treated wastewater effluents fouling tests using model organic foulants representative of the individual efom fractions ha alg bsa oa indicated that intensive flux loss was mainly caused by carbohydrate and protein like fractions through gel layer formation and multiple layer adsorption it was revealed that different fouling mechanisms were responsible for the individual foulants and that informed our investigation into combined foulant feed streams fouling due to bsa deposition was in a two stage flux decline profile characterised by the initial constant flux stage of monolayer adsorption followed by the rapid flux loss due to multiple bsa layer formation on the membrane surface when alginate and bsa were co existed in the feed solution more severe permeate flux loss was observed compared to that caused by either foulant this was evidence of the existence of synergistic effects between the two foulants through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that led to the formation of alginate bsa aggregates these aggregates were readily deposited on the membrane surface under high permeation drag the nature and extent of these interactions had an effect on the fouling layer structure and its role in permeate flux loss the much more complex feed solution of alg ha and bsa caused excessive flux loss due to the presence of favourable organic organic interactions that led to a dense cake layer that retarded permeate flow the presence of cations particularly ca2 aggravated alginate fouling through gel layer formation that creates resistance to permeate flow forward osmosis can be used as a treatment process for treated wastewater effluent where the foulant concentrations are less than in our simulated experiments and the resulting fouling is reversible acknowledgements this research study was supported financially by the ghent university the particle

14552,a thin film composite tfc fo membrane was used to study the fouling characteristics of effluent organic matter efom fractions in treated wastewater effluent represented by alginate bovine serum albumin humic acid and octanoic acid these model foulants were chosen to represent carbohydrates proteins humic substances and fatty acids inter foulant interactions and their influence on membrane flux loss was established by running series of fouling tests with feed solutions containing mixtures of model foulants the obtained results demonstrated that under our experimental conditions humic acid ha and octanoic acid oa had no significant role on permeate flux loss during wastewater treatment over short periods however alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa and their mixtures caused significant total flux loss through alginate calcium complexation that led to the formation of a resistant gel layer on the membrane surface protein fouling was mainly attributed to multiple layer adsorption onto the polyamide membrane surface mixing alginate with bsa saw a further decline in permeate flux worse than that caused individually by either of the foulants and gives an indication of the synergistic effect between the two foulants there were favourable inter foulant interactions between the carbohydrates and the proteins that promoted the formation of hybrid aggregates that were deposited on the membrane surface and enhanced flux loss the additional presence of humic acid to the mixture of bsa and alginate further aggravated membrane fouling polysaccharides and proteins were found to be the most dominant foulants during wastewater reclamation the extent of interactions between the organic foulants had an effect on the fouling layer structure and its role in permeate flux loss keywords bovine serum albumin complexation effluent organic matter flux decline thin film composite wastewater 1 introduction wastewater treatment for the purposes of supplementing the continuously decreasing fresh water supplies has caught global attention amongst water authorities and researchers as a potential alternative fresh water source 1 3 this has prompted several research studies that focus on the viability and efficiency of using such feed streams in membrane based separation processes 4 6 the potential benefit of using wastewater as a feed stream in water treatment include its constant availability through out the year and it could also be a means of limiting contamination of aquatic environments from treated industrial effluent that contains various pollutants 7 apart from the inorganic compounds and particulates in wastewater effluent it also contains effluent organic matter efom which comprises a range of low to high molecular weight organic compounds such as polysaccharides proteins humic and fulvic acids organic acids and lipids 8 9 thus membrane filtration processes are ideal as advance treatment steps for such feed streams due to their excellent rejection abilities of a wide array of contaminants however one key drawback of using wastewater as a feed stream is the intense fouling that is mainly caused by fractions of efom 7 8 10 membrane fouling is a consequence of the interaction between the membrane and the feed solution which maybe a complex mixture comprising of colloids bacteria flocs and dissolved organic macromolecules 11 the adverse impacts of fouling on membrane performance and the overall water treatment system is well documented in previous studies and it includes reduced membrane lifespan poor permeate quality increased applied pressure and inflated overall treatment costs 5 12 one strategy of minimising both energy consumption and membrane fouling during wastewater effluent treatment is the possibility of using forward osmosis membrane process as a pre treatment step this process is dependent on the solute concentration difference between the feed solution and draw solution that drives water across a semi permeable membrane therefore there is no application of external hydraulic pressure and thus fouling is largely reversible 13 in this work the thin film composite tfc membrane was chosen to conduct fouling tests using feed streams simulating secondary treated wastewater effluent this water characteristically contain effluent organic matter efom which is known to contribute significantly to organic fouling of nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes in advanced wastewater reclamation processes 14 19 the chemical complexity and heterogeneous nature efom presents a challenge to developing proper understanding of the role of inter foulant interactions in permeate flux decline as well as fouling layer formation numerous findings have attributed the observed severe flux loss to synergistic effects between co existing foulants 20 ang et al 21 reported a synergistic fouling effect when ro membranes were fouled by both alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa foulant foulant adhesion forces were found to increase with calcium concentration zhao and co workers then investigated the interactions between efom fractions and ro membranes 22 it was revealed that hydrophilic neutral fractions mainly composed of small sized carbohydrates resulted in the highest flux decline and exhibited highest affinity towards the membrane however in contrast to previous findings they found that extracellular polymeric substances eps did not cause significant flux loss in another study by ang et al 23 ro membranes were fouled by a mixture of organic foulants simulating wastewater effluent using alginate bsa suwannee river natural organic matter nom and octanoic acid they found that membrane fouling was governed by alginate in the presence of ca2 which was in turn influenced by alginate aggregate size and conformation in the bulk solution li et al 24 investigated a different influential factor where the role of ro membrane surface properties in membrane fouling by bsa and sodium alginate experimental results revealed that membrane surface roughness had the greatest effect on fouling by the biopolymers a considerable synergistic effect was observed when both bsa and alginate co existed in the same feed solution which was attributed to the large foulant particle sizes resulting from the formation of bsa alginate aggregates another importance of membrane surfaces was reported by wang and tang 25 who observed that membranes with smoother and more hydrophilic surface turn to possess favourable electrostatic repulsion experienced less initial flux membrane fouling the influence of membrane surface was also highlighted by mo et al 26 who found that protein membrane interactions influenced the fouling behaviour of polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membranes the above mentioned studies offers insight onto the influence of both feed composition and membrane surfaces on membrane fouling using pressure driven processes ro however the few studies conducted in forward osmosis offer little insight into membrane fouling mechanisms but rather a performance evaluation of the process in direct wastewater reclamation 27 linares et al 28 assessed the efficiency of a submerged fo system to treat wastewater permeate flux loss was attributed formation of fouling layer on the membrane surface which was mainly composed of biopolymer like substances another attempt to treat wastewater was made by achilli et al 29 where they utilized a submerged fo membrane inside a bioreactor and found that fouling was mild and permeate flux was almost completely restored using osmotic backwash this literature review has availed valuable information into membrane fouling behaviour and the characteristic fouling potential of wastewater effluent components proper understanding of the chemical composition of wastewater is important since it can help predict possible of reactions and interactions amongst organic foulants and inorganics 30 33 however the systematic understanding of the interactions between the different efom fractions is still poorly understood the labile nature and complex structure of biological foulants such as proteins brings additional challenges in fouling characterization thus in this work we aim at investigating the exact inter foulant interactions that influences permeate flux decline and the fouling layer formation when the efom fractions co exist in feed streams fouling tests were performed using the high performance polyamide modified tfc fo membrane with hydrophilic surfaces particular emphasis was made to identifying efom fractions with a superior role to permeate flux loss during wastewater effluent treatment by performing sequential and combined foulant experiments 2 experimental 2 1 model foulants several parameters can be used to describe typical wastewater and composition is one of the universally used parameter typical domestic wastewater effluent organic matter efom can be generally characterized by varying concentrations of proteins carbohydrates aquatic humic substances and oil fats 2 thus for the purposes of this work we chose bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate alg humic acid and octanoic acid to represent the previously mentioned efom fractions these model organic foulants were supplied by sigma aldrich st louis mo bovine serum albumin sodium alginate and humic acid were received in powder form and stock solutions 1 g l bsa 2 g l alginate 2 g l humic acid were prepared by dissolving each foulant in deionised water the stock solutions were continuously stirred over 24 h to ensure complete dissolution of each foulant and then kept at 4 c a stock solution of octanoic acid was also prepared in di water 1 g l and its ph was adjusted to around 6 7 using 0 1 m

composition as those used for fouling experiments were used during size determination analysis macro particle surface charge in the feed solution was monitored using the same instrument by measuring electrophoretic mobility which is then converted to zeta potential 2 3 2 microscopic characterization the topology structure and roughness of the tfc membrane and the fouling layers were characterized using an atomic force microscope afm alpha30 witec focus innovations ulm germany scanning electron microscopy sem was also carried out to investigate the morphology of the fouling layers using a jeol it300 microscope jeol ltd tokyo japan 2 3 3 streaming potential measurements streaming potential measurements were carried out with a surpass electrokinetic analyzer anton paargmbh graz austria to

liftshitz van der waals γlw and polar γab components of surface free energy of the clean and fouled membrane three well characterized probe liquids with known surface tension components such as deionised water glycerol and diiodomethane were used for contact angle measurements using the kruss drop shape analyzer dsa30 kruss gmbh germany which was equipped with a video camera linked to a computer program the sessile drop method was used to measure the contact angles of the liquids about 3 μl on the clean and fouled membrane surfaces at 25 c a minimum of 15 measurements on different spots of the membrane sample were performed and averaged to obtain the contact angle of the measured membrane sample according to van oss et al the surface free energy is expressed as the sum of the

listed in table 1 the fouling characteristics and potential of the organic foulants were determined by conducting single foulant experiments for all four model foulants furthermore possible synergistic interactions between two or more foulants were investigated through conducting filtration tests using mixed foulants feed streams the concentration of the draw solution was fixed at 3 0 m

for 24 h the active layer facing feed solution fo mode configuration was used during all fouling tests both the feed and draw solutions had a fixed cross flow velocity of 10 0 cm s 2 4 1 sequential fouling in an effort to study the specific interactions between the foulant species we conducted sequential fouling experiments where the membrane was fouled by the two foulants with the most fouling potential bsa and alginate in alternating sequences such that the complete fouling experiment lasted for 48 h after the first 24 h of filtration fresh solutions of both feed and draw solutions were replaced all experimental conditions feed solution chemistry and cross flow velocity were kept the same as previous single and combined fouling tests alginate and bsa were used to perform sequential studies based on their high fouling potentials which were likely to yield significant information on fouling mechanisms and inter foulant interactions 3 results 3 1 foulant and gel layer characterization dynamic light scattering dls measurements provided information on the hydrodynamic diameters of the foulant macro aggregates in the aqueous feed solutions the values presented in table 2 show the aggregate sizes before and after the addition of nacl and cacl2 it also shows the total permeate flux decline percentages after filtration of the various feed streams there is a clear influence of na and ca2 on the macromolecular size which significantly increased after their introduction this is in line with previously reported studies where the influence of divalent cations particularly ca2 on organic fouling was investigated and using surrogate organic compounds 40 their presence has been described to aggravate fouling caused by organic foulants via charge neutralization complexation and forming calcium bridges 41 the changes in aggregate sizes were quite conspicuous and the order of increasing particle size was bsa humic acid alginate this trend is in line with observed intensity of surface charge reduction values the zeta potential values of all three primary foulants were found to be negative alginate and humic acid exhibited a high negative charge mainly due to the presence of negative carboxylate groups therefore they had prominent interaction with the cations both na and ca2 as evidenced by the large reduction in negative charges the determination of both surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter of octanoic acid was unsuccessful bsa macromolecules had the lowest zeta potential values table 2 and were least influenced by the cations the zeta potential and hydrodynamic sizes for mixed foulants were influenced by species concentrations molecular size and shape as well as organic organic interactions 42 therefore the values presented here are averages of a range of sizes and they should be viewed with some reservation thus the discussion is based on qualitative observations rather than on quantitative data the influence of these ions on the fouling potential of each foulant was found to vary although alginate fouling was consistent with the observed physicochemical charge and particle size changes however a noticeable deviation was observed with humic acid which resulted in less fouling even in the presence of calcium ions a possible explanation for this anomalous observation is the ha ca2 ratio used for the purposes of this study this particular ratio included insufficient calcium ions to complex with ha the presence of sodium ions was an additional factor as the na competed with the ca2 for the negatively charged ha carboxylic groups 3 2 fouling characteristics of single foulants the impact of each foulant on permeate flux was investigated by filtering all four single foulants in the presence of both na and ca2 using the tfc es membrane the resulting flux decline profiles are presented and compared in fig 1 the corresponding permeate flux drops are listed in table 2 permeate flux drop caused by octanoic acid was indistinct and almost unnoticeable the water flux was stable throughout the filtration experiment indicating that no foulant deposition occurred a similar observation was made with humic acid the flux decline curve was the same as that of the baseline experiment suggesting that the only observed flux decline was due to the increase in feed solute concentration due to the inevitable decrease in feed solution volume which in turn increased the feed s osmotic pressure according to past studies the presence of ca2 can intensify humic acid fouling due to the formation of humic acid calcium complexes 41 however humic acid is not very selective for calcium ions in this case the na ions were in abundance 17 mm compared to ca2 1 mm and therefore they competed for the negative charges in humic acid leading to the formation of small humic aggregates that were not easily deposited onto the membrane surface 40 42 this was further supported by the humic acid aggregate sizes that were measured in the presence of ca2 na and ca2 na as they recorded average aggregate sizes of 278 161 and 189 nm respectively electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged membrane 9 4 mv and humic acid particles also played a role in its relative low deposition and adhesion notably the humic acid maintained a negative charge 27 mv even after the introduction of cations table 2 contrary to octanoic acid and humic acid distinctive permeate flux decline trends were observed with bsa and alginate despite being low in concentrations compared to humic acid alginate had a higher initial flux decline rate compared to bsa the significant initial flux decline caused by alginate fouling is attributed to the already highlighted complexation between calcium and negatively charged alginate polyanions leading to an increase in aggregate size and enhanced deposition rate eventually the membrane surface is covered by a soft thick gel that increased resistance towards permeate flow thus the adhesion of alginate onto the membrane surface in the early stages of the filtration process can be attributed to permeation drag generated by initial permeate flux membrane fouling due to bsa deposition showed a two stage flux decline profile with the initial stage characterised by constant flux without decline and then followed by a steep decline in permeate flux this fouling profile suggest that the less negative bsa molecules adsorb onto the membrane surface but the adsorbed monolayer had negligible effect on the membrane flux thus permeate flux remained stable as filtration proceeds more protein molecules deposited on the adsorbed bsa monolayer due to permeation drag forming a multi layered film that provided resistance to permeate flow it can therefore be assumed that the interactions between adsorbed bsa molecules and incoming molecules favoured the formation of a multi layered film and at the initial stages macromolecular adsorption was governed by bsa membrane interactions these observations confirm or corroborate findings made in earlier investigations that polysaccharides and protein like fractions of wastewater effluent were responsible for severe membrane fouling during wastewater treatment 42 43 the next sections discusses the interactions between foulants when they co exist in the same feed solution in an attempt to underpin foulant foulant interactions during membrane fouling 3 3 effect of co foulants on permeate flux loss the two fractions that caused the most severe permeate flux loss alginate bsa were mixed in the same feed stream and their combined effect on permeate flux decline was investigated the fouling trend was then compared to those of the single foulants as displayed in fig 2 the most outstanding observation is that the co existence of alginate and bsa caused further permeate flux loss the flux decline curve resembled that of bsa alone characterised by the first stable flux region followed by the high flux loss rate until a steady flux point was reached this indicates that bsa molecules had a primary effect on the formation of the combined fouling layer the zeta potential results suggest that the two foulants should repel each other because they possess negative surface charges however the interactions between the foulants seem to be governed by other forces beyond electrostatic interactions most likely hydrophobic interactions were more dominant in the formation of alginate bsa aggregates as supported by the observed increase in foulant aggregate size when the two foulants were present in the same feed solution table 1 bsa macromolecules were incorporated into the alginate calcium complexes 24 44 these large aggregates were easily deposited onto the membrane surface under permeation drag forming a layer that also reduced the back diffusion of salts from the membrane surface to the bulk solution it can therefore be concluded that the addition of alginate to bsa enhanced permeate flux loss fouling which confirms the synergistic interactions between the two foulants an attempt to unpack the mechanisms is made in subsequent sections 3 4 organic fouling with three co foulants upon determining the combined effect of alginate and bsa on permeate flux loss the next step was to investigate the influence of oa and ha when added to the feed solution containing alginate and bsa thus the more complex feed solutions comprising of a mixture of three foulants were then treated using the tfc membrane fig 3 a shows that the mixture of alginate humic acid and octanoic acid had an almost constant flux over 24 h of filtration without any noticeable flux loss this result was again beyond expectations since alginate and humic acid in the presence ca2 have been reported to worsen fouling due to the formation of ha ca2 alg ca2 and alg ha complexes as the formed fouling layers act to increase resistance to permeate flow 41 45 the explanation for this could be that the ca2 concentration was ineffective in causing complete complexation of the foulants 80 mg l alg and 200 mg l ha thus aggregate formation was insignificant the macromolecules were stable in the feed solution and the foulants remained in the bulk solution rather than being deposited this explanation is backed by the flux loss curves given in fig 3b which shows that an increase in permeate flux loss when the ca2 concentration was increased to 2 mm calcium ions enhanced the alginate alginate interactions which led to complexation and their subsequent deposition on the membrane surface a clear decline in permeate flux loss was recorded when the tfc membrane was used to filter the mixture of alginate octanoic acid and bsa permeate flux decline rate was slow at the initial stages within 5 h of filtration followed by a fast decline the entire experiment fig 3a the permeate flux decline trend was similar to that of the mixture of alginate and bsa an indication that octanoic acid did not contribute to flux loss however excessive flux loss was observed when humic acid was added to the mixture of alginate and bsa the permeate flux loss rate was so rapid that it dropped to 10 in the first 10 h of filtration and the steady state flux point was also reached at about the same filtration period therefore humic acid enhanced membrane fouling in the presence of bsa and alginate this suggests that there were favourable interactions between the organic foulants that led to excessive deposition rate onto the membrane surface resulting on a thick and resistant cake layer which enhanced permeate flux loss the differences observed in the flux decline rates due to the various feed compositions could be attributed to the different foulant foulant and foulant membrane interactions during filtration which then led to different fouling layer properties these findings support those of earlier studies that humic acids polysaccharides and proteins are the most significant foulants during wastewater reclamation and the fo membrane process was no exception 25 31 44 3 5 composition of fouling layers the composition of the fouling layers were then studied with fluorescence excitation emission matrix to identify the dominant efom fractions responsible for fouling layer formation fig 4 shows the excitation emission spectra for the different model foulants and their mixtures the recorded maximum excitation emission wavelengths λex em were 250 500 250 450 and 200 400 nm for bsa alginate and humic acid respectively there was a clear shift on both the maximum excitation and emission wavelengths of the resulting spectra when the foulants co existed in the feed solution as shown in fig 4 the fluorescence analysis further provided proof that interactions amongst the organic foulants results in modification of chemical properties leading to new excitation emission regions which led to the observed fouling mechanisms and fouling layer structural properties the spectra resulting from the foulant mixtures revealed contour regions that can be attributed to aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by products represented by alginate 45 49 suggesting that the fouling layer was dominated by polysaccharides and proteins 3 6 foulant foulant interaction mechanisms 3 6 1 fouling layer physicochemical properties the understanding on the synergistic interactions between alginate and bsa was developed by conducting sequential fouling tests the morphology and topology of the clean and fouled tfc membrane were studied using scanning electron and atomic force microscopy culminating to the micrographs displayed in fig 5 sem images reveal that the membrane surfaces were completely covered with a gel layer after filtration of the three feed solutions as a result of the extensive deposition of alginate and bsa there were no visible morphological differences amongst the formed fouling layers however analysis with afm showed that their topologies vary based on roughness the gel layer resulting from the mixture of alginate and bsa had the least rough topology ra 91 nm compared to that of the sequential fouling which translates to a tight gel layer configuration that had higher resistance to mass transfer whilst the deposition of alginate after bsa resulted in the roughest layer ra 183 nm 3 6 2 sequential fouling membrane fouling mechanisms this section discusses the sequential fouling phenomena in a bid to further identify foulant foulant interactions and understand their influence on fouling and cake layer formation during filtration of complex feed streams alginate and bsa were used to perform sequential studies based on their fouling behaviours observed in the previous experiments fig 6 shows the flux decline curves during sequential fouling with alginate and bsa the fouling curves were representative of the single foulants a high initial flux loss rate was observed for alginate and the delayed initial flux loss associated with bsa fouling when the membrane was first fouled with bsa then followed by alginate the membrane initial permeate flux was completely recovered followed by a fast flux loss the permeate flux regain can be attributed to the cleaning effect and the lowered feed osmotic pressure induced by the fresh alginate feed solution it also shows that the bsa multiple layers are poorly attached on the membrane surface which is typical of the forward osmosis process due to the lack of external hydraulic force 50 however permeate flux loss on the second part of the experiment the next 24 h was significantly high and was a function of both the settling of the disturbed fouling layer as well as the formation of a highly resistant gel layer similar observations were made when the bsa feed solution came after algninate about 90 of membrane initial permeate flux was recovered when the switch was made from alginate to bsa followed by a quick decline in permeate flux loss towards pseudo stable flux at about 36 h these curves confirms that there is continued deposition of either foulant when the membrane surface was already covered by the previous foulant implying the adsorption of either foulant on each other 51 in terms of electrostatic interactions it is expected that attractive forces should be dominant when the two foulants co exist in an aqueous solution resulting in micro aggregate formation which subsequently led to fouling layer formation the changes on membrane surface charge during foulant deposition was studied using adsorption experiments the same foulant concentration as that used during fouling experiments was used during adsorption to mimic the fouling experiments the observed zeta potential curves were representative of the surface charges of the single foulants alginate and bsa fig 7 the tfc membrane exhibited a negative charge at slightly acidic ph 5 98 initial deposition of bsa resulted in a positive surface but the subsequent adsorption of alginate reversed the surface charge back to negative suggesting that alginate got adsorbed on the bsa multilayers a similar observation was made when the order of fouling was reversed therefore these observation also reinforces our earlier hypothesis that there are favourable interactions between alginate and bsa that promote membrane fouling during wastewater treatment 3 6 3 surface free energy determinations the clean tfc membrane recorded the lowest water contact angle of 30 7 2 2 which classify its surface as hydrophilic the presence of the combined alginate bsa gel layer on the surface completely modified the surface to the lower end of hydrophilicity as per the angles listed in table 3 the resulting fouling layer from the sequential fouling resulted in similar electron donor functionality the presence of fouling layer clearly modified the surface of the membrane by lowering both the electron donor and acceptor functionality and slightly increasing the liftshitz van de waals component an observation corroborated by the increased measured water contact angles the reduced surface hydrophilicity contributed to the lowered permeate flux during filtration which implies that long term filtration of such feed streams would not be ideal due to the excessive fouling resulting in poor water recovery rates the fouling layers formed through sequential fouling using alginate and bsa had different physicochemical properties the fouling layer terminated by bsa was more hydrophilic 44 1 compared to that terminated by alginate 58 5 these observed differences in fouling layer properties further confirms the effect of foulant interactions that contribute to fouling layer formation 3 6 4 influence of foulant ratios on permeate flux loss the interactions between foulants were further studied by varying the concentration ratio of alginate and bsa fig 8 shows that there is a clear difference between the two trends the change in concentration between alginate and bsa have an influence on fouling behaviour when the concentration of alginate is double that of bsa severe flux loss was recorded these fouling trends were further corroborated by the aggregate sizes shown in fig 9 across the filtration duration it has been clearly demonstrated in previous sections that the mixture of alginate and bsa exacerbated membrane fouling however what could be drawn from this section is that during combined fouling the resultant layer is dominated by alginate macromolecules thus when the concentration of bsa was doubled when bsa molecules are dominant fouling is less this is due to the differences in adhesion energies between the foulants and the membranes 36 when alginate and bsa exist in the ratio of 1 1 25 the preferred ratio used in this study in the latter stages of filtration after 7 h the fouling process is mainly governed by alginate aggregates the aggregate size generally increased with filtration duration as the concentration of solutes increased in the feed streams the denser aggregates should be deposited easily on the membrane surface form a thick fouling layer this graph fig 8 give an idea of the fouling layer formation during combined foulant fouling at the initial stages fouling was set on by the smaller aggregates forming a thin uniform layer which was eventually covered by larger aggregates it has already been established that alginate and bsa interact to form hybrid aggregates thus the changes in aggregate sizes there was more aggregation in the retentate solution when the concentration of alginate was doubled rising from 175 to 370 nm during the filtration period as a result there was more permeate flux loss was recorded when this feed composition was used implying a faster deposition rate of gel aggregates that formed a more hydrostatic fouling layer however when the concentration of bsa was doubled the particle size did not change significantly starting at 200 275 nm in 24 h it can then be inferred that the smaller particles has a relatively lower deposition rate and so effective permeate flux was maintained over an extended period yielding higher water recoveries these results imply that in the case of the mixture of polysaccharides and proteins fouling severity depends on foulant foulant concentrations as well as interactions and the variations feed composition brings about different interactions that lead to different trends of fouling mechanisms the discussed results clearly demonstrated the synergy during combined fouling comes from alginate bsa interactions that favours the formation of resistant cake layer on membrane surface 52 4 conclusions a series of fouling experiments using various feed compositions was conducted to determine the fouling behaviour of the commercial tfc membrane when used to filter feed streams that simulate treated wastewater effluents fouling tests using model organic foulants representative of the individual efom fractions ha alg bsa oa indicated that intensive flux loss was mainly caused by carbohydrate and protein like fractions through gel layer formation and multiple layer adsorption it was revealed that different fouling mechanisms were responsible for the individual foulants and that informed our investigation into combined foulant feed streams fouling due to bsa deposition was in a two stage flux decline profile characterised by the initial constant flux stage of monolayer adsorption followed by the rapid flux loss due to multiple bsa layer formation on the membrane surface when alginate and bsa were co existed in the feed solution more severe permeate flux loss was observed compared to that caused by either foulant this was evidence of the existence of synergistic effects between the two foulants through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that led to the formation of alginate bsa aggregates these aggregates were readily deposited on the membrane surface under high permeation drag the nature and extent of these interactions had an effect on the fouling layer structure and its role in permeate flux loss the much more complex feed solution of alg ha and bsa caused excessive flux loss due to the presence of favourable organic organic interactions that led to a dense cake layer that retarded permeate flow the presence of cations particularly ca2 aggravated alginate fouling through gel layer formation that creates resistance to permeate flow forward osmosis can be used as a treatment process for treated wastewater effluent where the foulant concentrations are less than in our simulated experiments and the resulting fouling is reversible acknowledgements this research study was supported financially by the ghent university the particle

14553,landfill leachate is one of the major problems generated from waste it has high concentrations of biodegradable and refractory organic and inorganic matter such as ammonia and heavy metals the combined treatment of leachate with sewage has been used in various sewage treatment plants in the world however there are still many questions and uncertainties about the process especially the effects of adding leachate to the treatment system in this context the objective of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of combined leachate sewage treatment in activated sludge under different conditions treatability experiments were carried out using a bench scale sbr process using the volumetric proportions of 0 control 2 and 5 leachate under different experimental conditions experiment 2 leachate pre treated by alkalinization and air stripping was technically more feasible achieving removal efficiencies of bod cod and doc above 97 82 60 respectively and the highest diversity indices of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities and flake structure stability were observed up to a volumetric ratio of 2 of pre treated leachate the dgge technique used showed that populations of eukaryotes were apparently the most affected with increasing proportions of 2 5 of the mixture mainly for experiments 3 b3r2 and 4 b4r4 where the lowest diversity indices of these populations were found keywords combined treatment landfill leachate air stripping nitrification activated sludge dgge 1 introduction landfills are still used in brazil because they are technically and economically feasible while in developed countries there is a tendency to reduce or extinguish this form of final disposal of solid waste furthermore the disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills has increased over the last years in the country due to the current brazilian legislation law 12 305 2010 national policy on solid waste 1 which prohibits the maintenance of dumps in the country and determined a deadline for replacing them with sanitary landfills according to the brazilian association of public cleaning and special wastes 2 of the 78 6 million tons of solid waste generated in 2014 29 6 million tons were disposed of in dumps and controlled landfills which are considered inadequate and pose risks to human health and the environment in developed countries with limited land availability the landfill alternative is not the preferred method 3 4 and the incineration process is the most commonly used for urban solid waste treatment 5 since the regulations which restrict the disposal of organic materials in landfills were established member countries of the european community are seeking for effective ways to treat the organic matter of msw 6 some of these approaches are anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of msw for the production of bio methane 7 nutrients 8 and biohydrogen 9 a negative aspect related to landfills concerns the gases produced which are not captured by the system and eliminated in the atmosphere the leachate generated in landfills is a potential pollution source mainly due to the high concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen biodegradable organic matter refractory and heavy metals when it is not collected transported and treated properly it can cause environmental impacts such as the pollution of water resources and public health problems 10 the ideal landfill leachate treatment to prevent negative environmental impacts is still a challenge one alternative is the biological treatment of leachate mixed with domestic sewage resulting in an effluent that meets the legal requirements the mixture of leachate with sanitary sewage has shown good results using the correct mixture percentages 11 14 the combined treatment of leachate with domestic sewage has been used in several countries as a way to reduce the costs of implementing treatment units in landfills and operational costs over a long period of time in brazil the use of this combined treatment has become more and more widespread the bandeirantes são joão vila albertina and santo amaro landfills in são paulo sp tupã landfill sp baleia landfill in são sebastião sp meridiano sp and extrema porto alegre rs salvaterra in juiz de fora mg ctr br040 in belo horizonte mg and morro do céu in niterói rj are brazilian examples of combined leachate and domestic sewage treatments 15 17 10 also several configurations of reactors have been used in other countries to promote the combined treatment of leachate with domestic sewage 18 20 the efficiency of the conventional biological treatment of leachate in the activated sludge system is affected by the high concentrations of free ammonia which is potentially toxic to aerobic microorganisms at the high concentrations found in the leachate concentrations higher than 800 mg l 1 18 the pre treatments indicated for ammonia removal include precipitation coagulation flocculation adsorption chemical oxidation and air stripping 21 25 in this context the objective of this research was to evaluate the treatability of domestic sewage mixtures with raw and pre treated leachate and anaerobic effluent mixtures with raw and pre treated leachate in bench scale activated sludge system and characterize the microbial community by demonstrating the performance of the system submitted to the different operating conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate and domestic sewage the leachate was collected at the end of the sanitary landfill drainage system in são carlos sp brazil coordinates 21 56 56 s and 47 55 14 w in the tietê jacaré hydrographic basin such landfill served the city for about 20 years and it is considered a stabilized system 26 the sanitary sewage was collected from the sewage system of a residential region and after passing through a hose reel it was accumulated in a suction well after which it was repressed to feed the reactors used in that work process the leachate was subjected to pre treatment by chemical precipitation with the addition of lime to ph 11 then the ammonia was removed in an air stripping tower 2 25 m height and 15 cm diameter filled with raschig rings made of polyethylene with corrugated walls of 1 5 cm internal diameter and 5 cm length two 6 l washing flasks were used to recover the ammonia with 4 l of 0 4 mol l 1 sulfuric acid with an average efficiency of 80 25 the ammonia concentration in the effluent was 20 mg l 1 maximum value established in brazil through resolution 430 2011 of the national environmental council conama 1 although this resolution does not require that this limit be met in plants receiving leachate of landfill 2 2 experimental equipment and design the aeration chamber used in the bench scale experiments consisted in four chambers separately operated with uninterrupted aeration r1 r2 r3 and r4 with individual volume of 10 l containing internal decanters for the partial separation of sedimented solids in addition each chamber was equipped with an external 8 l decanter fig 1 2 3 inoculation and adaptation of biomass activated sludge reactors were inoculated with aerobic sludge from the batch activated sludge treatment system of a paper and cellulose industry the collected sludge presented good sedimentability and low concentration of filamentous microorganisms the inoculum volume 25 of the reactor volume was adopted so that after inoculation and filling the reactors with sewage each chamber could operate with suspended solids concentration of approximately 2000 mg l 1 the adaptation of the inoculum was performed in a 60 l capacity reactor with the mixture of 30 l of sewage 10 l of the aerobic sludge and aerated for 22 h a volume of 20 l of this aerated mixture was subjected to 2 h of sedimentation and after the supernatant was discarded and the sedimented sludge was returned to the reactor and the volume was filled with sewage the procedure was repeated for seven days by microscopic monitoring of the microbiota degradation of organic matter during adaptation the ph was maintained at around 7 0 and the dissolved oxygen above 2 0 mg l 1 27 2 4 experimental procedures

effluent from the anaerobic reactor raw and pre treated leachate followed the methodologies described by eaton et al 28 the treatability of the mixtures was evaluated at different proportions of leachate 0 2 and 5 the four reactors were operated using a 24 h cycle after 23 h of aeration of the mixture 7 l of the contents of each chamber was separated and after 1 h of sedimentation 5l of supernatant was discarded the sedimented sludge was returned to the reactor and the volume was filled with the leachate sewage mixture the mixture was prepared daily for each reactor aeration in the

microbiological examinations were carried out using an olympus optical microscope model dp 72 and the microphotographs were treated by image pro plus software at the end of each experimental step the samples were characterized by the dgge denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique for the bacteria and eucarya domains genomic dna was extracted from cell lysis with glass beads a mixture of phenol chloroform and phosphate buffer 29 and modified for this work the 16s rrna fragments for the bacteria domain and 18s rrna for the eucarya domain were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers 968fgc 1401r 30 for the community of bacteria and primers 1427fcg 1616r 31 for the eukaryotic community for the bacteria domain the pcr had the following conditions preincubation at 95 c for 7 min followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 c for 45 s 56 c for 45 s and 72 c for 1 min and the final extension at 72 c for 10 min the concentrations of the denaturation gradients for the dgge were 45 and 65 and the electrophoresis conditions were 75 v and 60 c for 16 h for the eucarya domain the pcr had the following conditions preincubation at 94 c for 5 min followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 c for 50 s 52 c for 1 min sec and 72 c for 3 min and the final extension at 72 c for 7 min the concentrations of denaturation gradients for dgge were 30 and 55 and the electrophoresis

similarity indices were calculated from the band profiles using pearson s correlations in order to estimate the complexity of the microbial communities the alpha diversity indices were calculated for each sample using estimates of diversity shannon richness chao1 and dominance calculated by the free software past statistical 3 results and discussion the characteristics of the raw leachate indicate a high polluting potential due to the high concentrations of organic matter cod bod doc and ammoniacal nitrogen table 1 the performance of the conventional activated sludge process can be significantly affected by the high concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen 32 11 and this concentration needs to be reduced by pre treatment with air stripping or precipitation prior to biological treatment the air stripping towers proved to be viable for the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen reaching 100 short term aeration removal when the leachate was alkalinized at ph 12 followed by color removal at the 50 level of true color 22 25 after the pretreatment of raw leachate with commercial lime alkalinization and subsequent air stripping for the bench experiments a considerable reduction of cod bod doc tkn and an concentrations was observed in this work the removal efficiencies of ammoniacal nitrogen were around 80 reaching an average concentration of 8 8 mg l 1 an table 1 table 2 shows the average removal efficiencies of cod bod doc tkn an in the activated sludge scale system treating the sewage mixture with different percentages of leachate 0 2 and 5 and operating conditions e1 e2 e3 and e4 the removal of cod bod tkn and an was higher than 90 for 0 of leachate and lower for the other mixture proportions with the increase of the mixture percentages of the raw leachate with domestic sewage e1 and anaerobic reactor effluent e4 a significant reduction of the system performance was observed this efficiency reduction of the system may be associated with the toxicity of free ammonia fa whose maximum concentration reaches 26 mg n nh3 l 1 5 leachate which can inhibit the nitrification and the presence of organic matter of difficult biological degradation in the raw leachate 33 34 a range of fa inhibition to nitrosomonads was of 10 150 mg l 1 and fa inhibition to nitrobacters was of 0 1 1 0 mg l 1 and peaked to values of 8 5 and 33 5 mg nh3 l 1 also innibed the nitrification in an activated sludge system tretaing landfill leachate 34 the composition of this wastewater is complex and irregular including volatile fatty acids more recalcitrant compounds such as humic and fulvic acids heavy metals inorganic compounds and organic xenobiotics however the concentration of metals is not considered as problematic in landfill leachate 35 the highest removal efficiencies of the measured parameters occurred under the conditions of mixing the pre treated leachate and domestic sewage e2 and anaerobic reactor effluent e3 however e2 showed the best system performance in terms of removal efficiency of cod bod doc tkn and an for both mixture proportions of 2 and 5 when compared to the other assays table 2 the best performance in this experiment may be associated with a reduction in the toxicity effect of free ammonia which was removed by air stripping to a concentration of less than 20 mg l 1 and the precipitation of part of the recalcitrant organic matter promoted by the pre alkalinization of the raw leachate a cod removal efficiency of 72 in 5 of leachate and sanitary sewage mixture was observed in the bench tests which is higher than that obtained in this work which was 51 in 5 of the mixture 32 however cod removal reduced to 16 in 20 of the mixture in a pilot plant installed at the icaraí plant niterói rj brazil franco 12 found an average removal efficiency of 76 cod and 73 doc in the mixture ratio of 0 5 to 1 and 72 of cod and 63 doc in the proportion of 2 to 2 5 of leachate achieving removals of ammonia nitrogen above 90 the reactors did not show biological sludge losses due to the addition of leachate at mixture percentages of 0 5 to 2 5 of leachate as observed in this work the lower cod removal efficiencies were for e3 and e4 when compared to the other tests which may be associated to the low concentration of soluble organic matter less than 90 mg l 1 in the affluent of the aerobic system which had already been partially degraded in the anaerobic reactor thus insufficient to maintain the microbial activity in the reactor in addition the toxicity of the ammoniacal nitrogen in the raw leachate e4 mainly at the proportion of 5 of the mixture may have possibly influenced the wastewater treatment the bod removal results also indicated better system performance under the e2 conditions in which the bod removal efficiency remained above 95 in all proportions doc removal efficiencies were low in all tests since the affluent concentrations were already reduced ranging from 30 mg l 1 in 0 leachate raw sewage to 100 mg l 1 in 5 of the mixture however the highest doc removal efficiencies 60 in 2 of the mixture and 54 in 5 of the mixture were also obtained in e2 when compared to 0 of the control leachate e4 presented the lowest doc removal efficiencies 51 at 2 mixture and 33 at 5 mixture the addition of raw leachate also compromised the efficiency of nitrogen removal as well as organic matter however for e2 the interference of the leachate addition was practically negligible and high efficiencies were maintained in all proportions the results indicate the occurrence of nitrification in all leachate proportions and in all batch experiments according to the concentrations of no2 and no3 as shown in tables 3 6 however as the concentration of an increased in the affluent due to the greater proportion of the leachate mixture 5 there was a significant reduction in the removal of tkn and an in e2 table 4 and e3 table 5 higher tkn and an removal efficiencies were achieved in e2 with mixtures of 2 and 5 the tkn removal efficiencies were 92 and 84 respectively in e3 with mixtures of 2 and 5 the tkn removal efficiencies were 79 and 80 respectively and 100 for an the ammonia no3 n conversion ratios remained above 0 70 indicating no inhibition caused by the ammonia which had been removed in the pretreatment of leachate the lowest removal efficiencies of tkn and an were obtained in the tests conducted for e1 table 3 and e4 table 6 however for e4 the lowest tkn and an removal efficiencies were recorded for both mixtures around 55 and 56 respectively and the no3 an conversion ratios remained at around 0 20 in addition nitrite concentrations in 5 of the mixture remained higher than in the other tests reaching concentrations of 71 mg l 1 and indicating possible inhibition of complete nitrification by the reduced activity of nitrobacter bacteria which are more sensitive to the presence of free ammonia and higher ph values than nitrosomonas 34 inhibition of nitrification by ammonia in the raw leachate was also reported by other studies 30 11 the geometric and hydrodynamic characteristics of the bench reactor allowed complete mixing so that the dead zones were practically non existent obtaining a high dispersion of the oxygen in the medium so that observed little variation of od concentration at various points in the reactor in addition in the pilot scale experiment the results indicated treatment viability under the conditions studied with 2 pre treated leachate the average removal of bod cod doc was 93 84 and 60 respectively in general there was a near 10 of the organic matter removal efficiency in relation to the reactor control r2 the variations of bod cod and doc during the operational period 64 days of pilot scale reactors are shown in figs 2 4 respectively nitrification occurred both reactors r2 and r1 there were no significant differences between the two reactors figs 5 and 6 respectively the high age of the sludge 20 days and the low f m ratio 0 22 kg bod kg ssv dia 1 favored nitrification in both reactors nitrification was also confirmed by high alkalinity consumption the average alkalinity consumption was 71 and 79 in the reactors r1 and r2 respectively 3 1 microbiological examinations the number and intensity of the bands in the dgge profiles provide an estimate of the dominant phylogotypes in a given sample 36 37 in environments where a wide variety of bacterial populations are represented by various bands such as soil the difference between these populations is difficult using the dgge technique therefore the number and intensity of bands will depend on the sampled environment considering freshwater systems like meromithic lakes this variation was between 15 and 20 38 in sediments of euthrofic lakes this variation ranged between 24 and 40 39 in rsb reactors a variant of the activated sludge 3 10 bands were detected in the dgge profile for the bacteria domain 40 in the present study the number of bands ranged from 5 to 21 for the bacteria domain fig 7 and from 8 to 21 for the eucarya domain fig 8 shannon and chao1 diversity ecological indexes and dominance to the bacteria domain and eucarya domain are shown in tables 7 and 8 respectively in this work the highest number of bands indicated by the chao1 index richness for both domains was obtained in e2 b2r3 with a mixture of 2 pre treated leachate and raw sewage and the lowest number of bands was obtained in experiment 4 b4r4 with 5 of raw leachate and effluent from the anaerobic reactor as for e1 raw leachate and raw sewage the similarity between the 2 b1r3 and 5 b1r4 mixtures for the eukaryotes was 72 comparing both mixture percentages with 0 of leachate b1r1 the similarity was 43 microscopic examinations showed an apparent reduction in the frequency of rhizopods in the proportion of 2 of the mixture the dominance decreased to 0 097 when compared to 0 of the mixture whose dominance was 0 11 with 5 of the leachate there was also an apparent decrease in the frequency of attached ciliates and the dominance decreased to 0 087 the bacterial community for e1 had a higher coefficient of similarity than the eukaryote community 82 with mixtures ranging from 2 b1r3 to 5 b1r4 the shannon diversity indices were 2 96 dominance of 0 053 and richness of 13 in 2 and 2 61 dominance of 0 074 and richness of 15 in 5 indicating the selection of organisms adapted to the more difficult degradation conditions of the organic matter in 5 of the mixture with the raw leachate in e1 the highest frequencies of filamentous bacteria were also observed which caused a reduction in the treatment efficiency of the system the lowest removal efficiencies of cod bod doc tkn and an were in this condition of 5 of raw leachate and raw sewage which were of 51 18 44 62 and 61 respectively on the other hand the highest removal efficiencies of organic matter and nitrogen were recorded in e2 mixture of pre treated leachate and raw sewage in which the community of eukaryotes had 80 similarity between 2 b2r3 and 5 b2r4 of the mixture the similarity between 0 of leachate and both percentages of the mixture was 54 the highest diversity index of 2 99 dominance of 0 052 and richness of 21 were found for the 2 mixture while in 5 this index was 2 71 dominance of 0 070 and richness of 16 the removal efficiencies were 81 cod 97 bod 60 doc 92 tkn and 96 an microscopic examinations indicated no significant differences between the 2 and 5 mixtures for the eukaryote community in e2 the attached ciliates similar to vorticella fig 9 and epistylis fig 10 followed by euglypha like rhizopods fig 11 and some unidentified species were predominant sludge stability and high removal efficiencies of bod and cod showed a high correlation to these genera 41 42 the higher removal efficiencies of bod and cod obtained in this experiment are compatible with the biological stability acquired by the system in addition attached ciliates indicate sludge stability and testate amoebae indicate the occurrence of nitrification 43 corroborating the nitrification efficiency in the e2 reactors the frequency of epiphanes like rotifers fig 12 was lower than that of ciliates and rhizopods the rotifers are important to the system as they participate in the cycling of nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus revolving and feeding on the flakes allowing new absorption surfaces and facilitating the penetration of oxygen in these flakes 44 similar behavior was observed for the bacteria domain the highest diversity index of 3 01 and dominance of 0 051 were determined for the mixture of 2 b2r3 when compared to 5 b2r4 with diversity of 2 46 dominance of 0 087 and richness of 12 also indicating the selection of the bacterial microbiota for the most difficult degradation conditions of the organic matter in the highest mixture percentage however the bacterial community was less sensitive than the community of eukaryotes with a variation ranging between 2 and 5 of the mixture with a similarity coefficient of 57 including comparing 0 of mixture b1r1 with e2 b2r3 comparing the same mixture percentages 2 and 5 for the e1 and e2 tests the lowest similarity indices for the bacterial community were observed these coefficients were 36 for both mixture percentages and in the different tests the bacterial microbiota was more sensitive than the eukaryotic one to both types of substrate raw and pre treated leachate with the lowest richness indices at 5 of the mixture for both tests e1 and e2 indicating the selection need of the species to the metabolization of leachate in the e3 and e4 assays using the pre treated and raw leachate mixture with anaerobic sewage treatment effluent the lowest coefficients of similarity were observed when compared to the other experiments these coefficients were 14 between b3r1 b3r2 and b3r4 for the eucarya domain the lowest indices of diversity and richness were recorded in b3r2 1 46 and 5 respectively and b4r4 1 56 and 5 respectively compared to b3r1 which had a diversity of 2 24 and richness of 11 microscopic examinations of e3 for both 2 and 5 proportions of pre treated leachate and anaerobic reactor effluent show the presence of attached ciliates similar to epistylis and vorticella with an apparently lower frequency than in e1 and e2 and higher frequency of rhizopods similar to euglypha and some unidentified species the rotifers remained at a low frequency and those similar to philodinavus were predominant fig 13 nitrification indicator organisms such as teasted amoebae crawler ciliates fig 14 and tardigrade like metazoa fig 15 remained in both leachate mixture proportions confirmed by the tkn removal results converted to nitrite and nitrate in e4 an apparent decrease in the frequency of nitrification indicators occurred as the proportion of leachate 5 increased with a reduction of the removal efficiency of tkn to 55 and an to 56 in b3r4 5 a high frequency of suspension flagellate and rotiferous similar to epiphanes and rotari was observed a decrease in the number and size of flakes as well as the modification of their structure the increase in flagellate organisms indicates unstable operating conditions 45 and or indicates a transitional period in the recovery of the system after an organic load shock toxic or not 46 47 which also results in the increase of the bacteria in suspension there was an increase in the frequency of attached ciliates similar to opercularia fig 16 in detriment to other similar epistylis and vorticella the abundance of attached ciliate protozoa of the genus opercularia was associated with low bod removal efficiency and a decrease in sedimentable solids concentration 48 41 the physico chemical results of the e3 and e4 tests indicated low removal efficiency of cod and bod mainly in b4r4 where bod removal efficiency was lower than 5 the frequency of the arcella like and euglypha like rhizopods fig 12 and 11 respectively also decreased as the proportion of leachate increased in b4r4 5 these organisms were practically absent the low removal efficiencies of cod bod doc and nitrogen in b4r4 indicated the toxicity of the raw leachate in the microbiota of the system and changes in the structure of the activated sludge reactor flakes 49 50 possibly due to the high concentrations of ammonia salinity and other unidentified compounds found in this residue in addition a process of deflocculation was initiated and the frequency of filamentous bacteria increased fig 17 in e4 with increasing mixture percentages ranging from 2 b4r2 to 5 b4r4 when compared to the other tests excess filaments are associated with nutritional deficiency low concentrations of dissolved oxygen and the presence of recalcitrant or toxic organic matter thus the low concentration of organic matter from the effluent of the anaerobic reactor bod lower than 100 mg l 1 resulted in the development of these filaments especially in the highest proportion of leachate 5 which also has the highest recalcitrant concentrations although filamentous organisms are important for the maintenance of the flake structure increasing them may cause sedimentability problems in b4r4 the highest svi values were determined varying from 95 ml g 1 to 121 ml g 1 although they remained below the ideal 150 mg g 1 43 it appears that a good diversity of microbial protozoa and micrometazoa morphologies was maintained as in the batch assays however in the pilot assay bristle worm like aeolosoma fig 18 and tardigrades were observed they are associated with nitrification and high sludge age systems figures m and n and low f m ratio 43 which was observed in this assay condition sludge age around 20 days and hrt of 24 h are characteristic if activated sludge systems with prolonged aeration the dgge band profiles for the bacteria domain indicated more significant changes in the populations of e4 with 5 raw leachate b4r4 which had the lowest similarity index 1 99 when compared to e1 e3 indicating a selection of the bacterial microbiota to the even more restrictive growth conditions and the adaptation of the higher mixture percentage of the raw leachate to the effluent of the anaerobic sewage treatment reactor in addition to the increase in the frequency of filamentous bacteria there was an apparent increase of the bacteria in suspension and consequent increase in the density of flagellates as well as an increase in the frequency of rotifers when compared to the e1 e3 tests considering the limitations of the dgge methodology 51 the diversity indices calculated from the band profiles and the microscopic examination of the samples provided a good estimate of the microbiota diversity when submitted to the different pre treated and raw percentages using the sewage and effluent from anaerobic sewage treatment in addition although dgge only qualifies microbial populations as the coefficients of similarity diversity and richness indices corroborate the principles of general ecology 52 which characterizes a less diverse eutrophic system in this work this principle was confirmed by experiment 4 with a 5 mixture of raw leachate and anaerobic sewage under more inhospitable conditions to microbial growth which showed the lowest diversity and richness indices and also the worst performance of the batch reactor b4r4 however the best reactor performance was observed in b2r3 which was corroborated by the higher diversity indices for both domains when compared to the other tests for the removal of cod doc tkn and an the pilot scale reactor operated according to the best results obtained in the batch reactors confirm the performance of the e2 assay volumetric proportion of 2 of pre treated leachate with domestic sewage 4 conclusion the highest removal efficiencies of cod bod tkn and an were obtained in experiment 2 in which the affluent was composed of 2 pre treated leachate b2r3 this experiment showed the highest diversity indices of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities and stability of the flake structure the proportions of 5 of the mixtures pre treated b3r4 and raw b4r4 leachate and anaerobic sewage treatment effluent indicated the worst organic matter and nitrogen removal performances of the system with a reduction of microbial diversity mainly in b4r4 and significant increase in the frequency of filamentous microorganisms and disintegration of the flakes in the activated sludge system it appears that the eukaryote populations were the most affected with increasing proportions of 2 to 5 of the mixture mainly for experiments 3 b3r2 and 4 b4r4 which had the lowest diversity indices of these populations the dgge technique coupled with the microscopic examination was important for understanding the performance of batch operated reactors with different percentages of leachate mixture and with raw sewage and effluent from an anaerobic domestic sewage treatment reactor the physical chemical and microbiological monitoring results were satisfactory and indicate that biological treatability was feasible under the e2 experiment

14553,landfill leachate is one of the major problems generated from waste it has high concentrations of biodegradable and refractory organic and inorganic matter such as ammonia and heavy metals the combined treatment of leachate with sewage has been used in various sewage treatment plants in the world however there are still many questions and uncertainties about the process especially the effects of adding leachate to the treatment system in this context the objective of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of combined leachate sewage treatment in activated sludge under different conditions treatability experiments were carried out using a bench scale sbr process using the volumetric proportions of 0 control 2 and 5 leachate under different experimental conditions experiment 2 leachate pre treated by alkalinization and air stripping was technically more feasible achieving removal efficiencies of bod cod and doc above 97 82 60 respectively and the highest diversity indices of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities and flake structure stability were observed up to a volumetric ratio of 2 of pre treated leachate the dgge technique used showed that populations of eukaryotes were apparently the most affected with increasing proportions of 2 5 of the mixture mainly for experiments 3 b3r2 and 4 b4r4 where the lowest diversity indices of these populations were found keywords combined treatment landfill leachate air stripping nitrification activated sludge dgge 1 introduction landfills are still used in brazil because they are technically and economically feasible while in developed countries there is a tendency to reduce or extinguish this form of final disposal of solid waste furthermore the disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills has increased over the last years in the country due to the current brazilian legislation law 12 305 2010 national policy on solid waste 1 which prohibits the maintenance of dumps in the country and determined a deadline for replacing them with sanitary landfills according to the brazilian association of public cleaning and special wastes 2 of the 78 6 million tons of solid waste generated in 2014 29 6 million tons were disposed of in dumps and controlled landfills which are considered inadequate and pose risks to human health and the environment in developed countries with limited land availability the landfill alternative is not the preferred method 3 4 and the incineration process is the most commonly used for urban solid waste treatment 5 since the regulations which restrict the disposal of organic materials in landfills were established member countries of the european community are seeking for effective ways to treat the organic matter of msw 6 some of these approaches are anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of msw for the production of bio methane 7 nutrients 8 and biohydrogen 9 a negative aspect related to landfills concerns the gases produced which are not captured by the system and eliminated in the atmosphere the leachate generated in landfills is a potential pollution source mainly due to the high concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen biodegradable organic matter refractory and heavy metals when it is not collected transported and treated properly it can cause environmental impacts such as the pollution of water resources and public health problems 10 the ideal landfill leachate treatment to prevent negative environmental impacts is still a challenge one alternative is the biological treatment of leachate mixed with domestic sewage resulting in an effluent that meets the legal requirements the mixture of leachate with sanitary sewage has shown good results using the correct mixture percentages 11 14 the combined treatment of leachate with domestic sewage has been used in several countries as a way to reduce the costs of implementing treatment units in landfills and operational costs over a long period of time in brazil the use of this combined treatment has become more and more widespread the bandeirantes são joão vila albertina and santo amaro landfills in são paulo sp tupã landfill sp baleia landfill in são sebastião sp meridiano sp and extrema porto alegre rs salvaterra in juiz de fora mg ctr br040 in belo horizonte mg and morro do céu in niterói rj are brazilian examples of combined leachate and domestic sewage treatments 15 17 10 also several configurations of reactors have been used in other countries to promote the combined treatment of leachate with domestic sewage 18 20 the efficiency of the conventional biological treatment of leachate in the activated sludge system is affected by the high concentrations of free ammonia which is potentially toxic to aerobic microorganisms at the high concentrations found in the leachate concentrations higher than 800 mg l 1 18 the pre treatments indicated for ammonia removal include precipitation coagulation flocculation adsorption chemical oxidation and air stripping 21 25 in this context the objective of this research was to evaluate the treatability of domestic sewage mixtures with raw and pre treated leachate and anaerobic effluent mixtures with raw and pre treated leachate in bench scale activated sludge system and characterize the microbial community by demonstrating the performance of the system submitted to the different operating conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate and domestic sewage the leachate was collected at the end of the sanitary landfill drainage system in são carlos sp brazil coordinates 21 56 56 s and 47 55 14 w in the tietê jacaré hydrographic basin such landfill served the city for about 20 years and it is considered a stabilized system 26 the sanitary sewage was collected from the sewage system of a residential region and after passing through a hose reel it was accumulated in a suction well after which it was repressed to feed the reactors used in that work process the leachate was subjected to pre treatment by chemical precipitation with the addition of lime to ph 11 then the ammonia was removed in an air stripping tower 2 25 m height and 15 cm diameter filled with raschig rings made of polyethylene with corrugated walls of 1 5 cm internal diameter and 5 cm length two 6 l washing flasks were used to recover the ammonia with 4 l of 0 4 mol l 1 sulfuric acid with an average efficiency of 80 25 the ammonia concentration in the effluent was 20 mg l 1 maximum value established in brazil through resolution 430 2011 of the national environmental council conama 1 although this resolution does not require that this limit be met in plants receiving leachate of landfill 2 2 experimental equipment and design the aeration chamber used in the bench scale experiments consisted in four chambers separately operated with uninterrupted aeration r1 r2 r3 and r4 with individual volume of 10 l containing internal decanters for the partial separation of sedimented solids in addition each chamber was equipped with an external 8 l decanter fig 1 2 3 inoculation and adaptation of biomass activated sludge reactors were inoculated with aerobic sludge from the batch activated sludge treatment system of a paper and cellulose industry the collected sludge presented good sedimentability and low concentration of filamentous microorganisms the inoculum volume 25 of the reactor volume was adopted so that after inoculation and filling the reactors with sewage each chamber could operate with suspended solids concentration of approximately 2000 mg l 1 the adaptation of the inoculum was performed in a 60 l capacity reactor with the mixture of 30 l of sewage 10 l of the aerobic sludge and aerated for 22 h a volume of 20 l of this aerated mixture was subjected to 2 h of sedimentation and after the supernatant was discarded and the sedimented sludge was returned to the reactor and the volume was filled with sewage the procedure was repeated for seven days by microscopic monitoring of the microbiota degradation of organic matter during adaptation the ph was maintained at around 7 0 and the dissolved oxygen above 2 0 mg l 1 27 2 4 experimental procedures and analytical methods in this work four tests were developed the mixture of domestic sewage with raw leachate e1 the mixture of domestic sewage with pre treated leachate e2 the mixture of sewage effluent from anaerobic reactor with pre treated leachate e3 the mixture of anaerobic reactor effluent with raw leachate e4 table 1 shows the physical chemical characterization of domestic sewage effluent from the anaerobic reactor raw and pre treated leachate followed the methodologies described by eaton et al 28 the treatability of the mixtures was evaluated at different proportions of leachate 0 2 and 5 the four reactors were operated using a 24 h cycle after 23 h of aeration of the mixture 7 l of the contents of each chamber was separated and after 1 h of sedimentation 5l of supernatant was discarded the sedimented sludge was returned to the reactor and the volume was filled with the leachate sewage mixture the mixture was prepared daily for each reactor aeration in the chambers was not interrupted during the sedimentation period this procedure was performed until the end of the experiment each experiment lasted 20 days operation and a 2 day hydraulic retention time hrt was maintained after these batch assays the pilot scale of a conventional activated sludge reactor with continuous regime was operated for 64 days according to the best cod and nitrogen removal results obtained in the batch assays e2 the pilot scale activated sludge system consisted of a stainless tank an aeration tank 100l decanter and effluent collection chamber of conjugated form the feed rate of the pilot reactor was approximately 110 l day 1 4 5 l h 1 in order to maintain the hydraulic retention time hrt of around 24 h the age of the sludge was maintained around 20 days the analysis

ammoniacal nitrogen an 4500 nh3c nitrite 4500 no2 and nitrate 4500 no3 were used to monitor the inffluent and effluent of the activated sludge reactors 28 the ph values of the aeration tank were adjusted to values close to 7 0 all doc determinations were performed with the filtered sample 0 45 μm average membrane diameter and acidified to ph of around 2 2 5 microbiological examinations the microbiological examinations were carried out using an olympus optical microscope model dp 72 and the microphotographs were treated by image pro plus software at the end of each experimental step the samples were characterized by the dgge denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique for the bacteria and eucarya domains genomic dna was extracted from cell lysis with glass beads a mixture of phenol chloroform and phosphate buffer 29 and modified for this work the 16s rrna fragments for the bacteria domain and 18s rrna for the eucarya domain were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers 968fgc 1401r 30 for the community of bacteria and primers 1427fcg 1616r 31 for the eukaryotic community for the bacteria domain the pcr had the following conditions preincubation at 95 c for 7 min followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 c for 45 s 56 c for 45 s and 72 c for 1 min and the final extension at 72 c for 10 min the concentrations of the denaturation gradients for the dgge were 45 and 65 and the electrophoresis conditions were 75 v and 60 c for 16 h for the eucarya domain the pcr had the following conditions preincubation at 94 c for 5 min followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 c for 50 s 52 c for 1 min sec and 72 c for 3 min and the final extension at 72 c for 7 min the concentrations of denaturation gradients for dgge were 30 and 55 and the electrophoresis conditions were 75 v and 60 c for 16 h the dendrograms were constructed with the clustering method upgma unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean using software bionumerics version 3 5 the similarity indices were calculated from the band profiles using pearson s correlations in order to estimate the complexity of the microbial communities the alpha diversity indices were calculated for each sample using estimates of diversity shannon richness chao1 and dominance calculated by the free software past statistical 3 results and discussion the characteristics of the raw leachate indicate a high polluting potential due to the high concentrations of organic matter cod bod doc and ammoniacal nitrogen table 1 the performance of the conventional activated sludge process can be significantly affected by the high concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen 32 11 and this concentration needs to be reduced by pre treatment with air stripping or precipitation prior to biological treatment the air stripping towers proved to be viable for the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen reaching 100 short term aeration removal when the leachate was alkalinized at ph 12 followed by color removal at the 50 level of true color 22 25 after the pretreatment of raw leachate with commercial lime alkalinization and subsequent air stripping for the bench experiments a considerable reduction of cod bod doc tkn and an concentrations was observed in this work the removal efficiencies of ammoniacal nitrogen were around 80 reaching an average concentration of 8 8 mg l 1 an table 1 table 2 shows the average removal efficiencies of cod bod doc tkn an in the activated sludge scale system treating the sewage mixture with different percentages of leachate 0 2 and 5 and operating conditions e1 e2 e3 and e4 the removal of cod bod tkn and an was higher than 90 for 0 of leachate and lower for the other mixture proportions with the increase of the mixture percentages of the raw leachate with domestic sewage e1 and anaerobic reactor effluent e4 a significant reduction of the system performance was observed this efficiency reduction of the system may be associated with the toxicity of free ammonia fa whose maximum concentration reaches 26 mg n nh3 l 1 5 leachate which can inhibit the nitrification and the presence of organic matter of difficult biological degradation in the raw leachate 33 34 a range of fa inhibition to nitrosomonads was of 10 150 mg l 1 and fa inhibition to nitrobacters was of 0 1 1 0 mg l 1 and peaked to values of 8 5 and 33 5 mg nh3 l 1 also innibed the nitrification in an activated sludge system tretaing landfill leachate 34 the composition of this wastewater is complex and irregular including volatile fatty acids more recalcitrant compounds such as humic and fulvic acids heavy metals inorganic compounds and organic xenobiotics however the concentration of metals is not considered as problematic in landfill leachate 35 the highest removal efficiencies of the measured parameters occurred under the conditions of mixing the pre treated leachate and domestic sewage e2 and anaerobic reactor effluent e3 however e2 showed the best system performance in terms of removal efficiency of cod bod doc tkn and an for both mixture proportions of 2 and 5 when compared to the other assays table 2 the best performance in this experiment may be associated with a reduction in the toxicity effect of free ammonia which was removed by air stripping to a concentration of less than 20 mg l 1 and the precipitation of part of the recalcitrant organic matter promoted by the pre alkalinization of the raw leachate a cod removal efficiency of 72 in 5 of leachate and sanitary sewage mixture was observed in the bench tests which is higher than that obtained in this work which was 51 in 5 of the mixture 32 however cod removal reduced to 16 in 20 of the mixture in a pilot plant installed at the icaraí plant niterói rj brazil franco 12 found an average removal efficiency of 76 cod and 73 doc in the mixture ratio of 0 5 to 1 and 72 of cod and 63 doc in the proportion of 2 to 2 5 of leachate achieving removals of ammonia nitrogen above 90 the reactors did not show biological sludge losses due to the addition of leachate at mixture percentages of 0 5 to 2 5 of leachate as observed in this work the lower cod removal efficiencies were for e3 and e4 when compared to the other tests which may be associated to the low concentration of soluble organic matter less than 90 mg l 1 in the affluent of the aerobic system which had already been partially degraded in the anaerobic reactor thus insufficient to maintain the microbial activity in the reactor in addition the toxicity of the ammoniacal nitrogen in the raw leachate e4 mainly at the proportion of 5 of the mixture may have possibly influenced the wastewater treatment the bod removal results also indicated better system performance under the e2 conditions in which the bod removal efficiency remained above 95 in all proportions doc removal efficiencies were low in all tests since the affluent concentrations were already reduced ranging from 30 mg l 1 in 0 leachate raw sewage to 100 mg l 1 in 5 of the mixture however the highest doc removal efficiencies 60 in 2 of the mixture and 54 in 5 of the mixture were also obtained in e2 when compared to 0 of the control leachate e4 presented the lowest doc removal efficiencies 51 at 2 mixture and 33 at 5 mixture the addition of raw leachate also compromised the efficiency of nitrogen removal as well as organic matter however for e2 the interference of the leachate addition was practically negligible and high efficiencies were maintained in all proportions the results indicate the occurrence of nitrification in all leachate proportions and in all batch experiments according to the concentrations of no2 and no3 as shown in tables 3 6 however as the concentration of an increased in the affluent due to the greater proportion of the leachate mixture 5 there was a significant reduction in the removal of tkn and an in e2 table 4 and e3 table 5 higher tkn and an removal efficiencies were achieved in e2 with mixtures of 2 and 5 the tkn removal efficiencies were 92 and 84 respectively in e3 with mixtures of 2 and 5 the tkn removal efficiencies were 79 and 80 respectively and 100 for an the ammonia no3 n conversion ratios remained above 0 70 indicating no inhibition caused by the ammonia which had been removed in the pretreatment of leachate the lowest removal efficiencies of tkn and an were obtained in the tests conducted for e1 table 3 and e4 table 6 however for e4 the lowest tkn and an removal efficiencies were recorded for both mixtures around 55 and 56 respectively and the no3 an conversion ratios remained at around 0 20 in addition nitrite concentrations in 5 of the mixture remained higher than in the other tests reaching concentrations of 71 mg l 1 and indicating possible inhibition of complete nitrification by the reduced activity of nitrobacter bacteria which are more sensitive to the presence of free ammonia and higher ph values than nitrosomonas 34 inhibition of nitrification by ammonia in the raw leachate was also reported by other studies 30 11 the geometric and hydrodynamic characteristics of the bench reactor allowed complete mixing so that the dead zones were practically non existent obtaining a high dispersion of the oxygen in the medium so that observed little variation of od concentration at various points in the reactor in addition in the pilot scale experiment the results indicated treatment viability under the conditions studied with 2 pre treated leachate the average removal of bod cod doc was 93 84 and 60 respectively in general there was a near 10 of the organic matter removal efficiency in relation to the reactor control r2 the variations of bod cod and doc during the operational period 64 days of pilot scale reactors are shown in figs 2 4 respectively nitrification occurred both reactors r2 and r1 there were no significant differences between the two reactors figs 5 and 6 respectively the high age of the sludge 20 days and the low f m ratio 0 22 kg bod kg ssv dia 1 favored nitrification in both reactors nitrification was also confirmed by high alkalinity consumption the average alkalinity consumption was 71 and 79 in the reactors r1 and r2 respectively 3 1 microbiological examinations the number and intensity of the bands in the dgge profiles provide an estimate of the dominant phylogotypes in a given sample 36 37 in environments where a wide variety of bacterial populations are represented by various bands such as soil the difference between these populations is difficult using the dgge technique therefore the number and intensity of bands will depend on the sampled environment considering freshwater systems like meromithic lakes this variation was between 15 and 20 38 in sediments of euthrofic lakes this variation ranged between 24 and 40 39 in rsb reactors a variant of the activated sludge 3 10 bands were detected in the dgge profile for the bacteria domain 40 in the present study the number of bands ranged from 5 to 21 for the bacteria domain fig 7 and from 8 to 21 for the eucarya domain fig 8 shannon and chao1 diversity ecological indexes and dominance to the bacteria domain and eucarya domain are shown in tables 7 and 8 respectively in this work the highest number of bands indicated by the chao1 index richness for both domains was obtained in e2 b2r3 with a mixture of 2 pre treated leachate and raw sewage and the lowest number of bands was obtained in experiment 4 b4r4 with 5 of raw leachate and effluent from the anaerobic reactor as for e1 raw leachate and raw sewage the similarity between the 2 b1r3 and 5 b1r4 mixtures for the eukaryotes was 72 comparing both mixture percentages with 0 of leachate b1r1 the similarity was 43 microscopic examinations showed an apparent reduction in the frequency of rhizopods in the proportion of 2 of the mixture the dominance decreased to 0 097 when compared to 0 of the mixture whose dominance was 0 11 with 5 of the leachate there was also an apparent decrease in the frequency of attached ciliates and the dominance decreased to 0 087 the bacterial community for e1 had a higher coefficient of similarity than the eukaryote community 82 with mixtures ranging from 2 b1r3 to 5 b1r4 the shannon diversity indices were 2 96 dominance of 0 053 and richness of 13 in 2 and 2 61 dominance of 0 074 and richness of 15 in 5 indicating the selection of organisms adapted to the more difficult degradation conditions of the organic matter in 5 of the mixture with the raw leachate in e1 the highest frequencies of filamentous bacteria were also observed which caused a reduction in the treatment efficiency of the system the lowest removal efficiencies of cod bod doc tkn and an were in this condition of 5 of raw leachate and raw sewage which were of 51 18 44 62 and 61 respectively on the other hand the highest removal efficiencies of organic matter and nitrogen were recorded in e2 mixture of pre treated leachate and raw sewage in which the community of eukaryotes had 80 similarity between 2 b2r3 and 5 b2r4 of the mixture the similarity between 0 of leachate and both percentages of the mixture was 54 the highest diversity index of 2 99 dominance of 0 052 and richness of 21 were found for the 2 mixture while in 5 this index was 2 71 dominance of 0 070 and richness of 16 the removal efficiencies were 81 cod 97 bod 60 doc 92 tkn and 96 an microscopic examinations indicated no significant differences between the 2 and 5 mixtures for the eukaryote community in e2 the attached ciliates similar to vorticella fig 9 and epistylis fig 10 followed by euglypha like rhizopods fig 11 and some unidentified species were predominant sludge stability and high removal efficiencies of bod and cod showed a high correlation to these genera 41 42 the higher removal efficiencies of bod and cod obtained in this experiment are compatible with the biological stability acquired by the system in addition attached ciliates indicate sludge stability and testate amoebae indicate the occurrence of nitrification 43 corroborating the nitrification efficiency in the e2 reactors the frequency of epiphanes like rotifers fig 12 was lower than that of ciliates and rhizopods the rotifers are important to the system as they participate in the cycling of nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus revolving and feeding on the flakes allowing new absorption surfaces and facilitating the penetration of oxygen in these flakes 44 similar behavior was observed for the bacteria domain the highest diversity index of 3 01 and dominance of 0 051 were determined for the mixture of 2 b2r3 when compared to 5 b2r4 with diversity of 2 46 dominance of 0 087 and richness of 12 also indicating the selection of the bacterial microbiota for the most difficult degradation conditions of the organic matter in the highest mixture percentage however the bacterial community was less sensitive than the community of eukaryotes with a variation ranging between 2 and 5 of the mixture with a similarity coefficient of 57 including comparing 0 of mixture b1r1 with e2 b2r3 comparing the same mixture percentages 2 and 5 for the e1 and e2 tests the lowest similarity indices for the bacterial community were observed these coefficients were 36 for both mixture percentages and in the different tests the bacterial microbiota was more sensitive than the eukaryotic one to both types of substrate raw and pre treated leachate with the lowest richness indices at 5 of the mixture for both tests e1 and e2 indicating the selection need of the species to the metabolization of leachate in the e3 and e4 assays using the pre treated and raw leachate mixture with anaerobic sewage treatment effluent the lowest coefficients of similarity were observed when compared to the other experiments these coefficients were 14 between b3r1 b3r2 and b3r4 for the eucarya domain the lowest indices of diversity and richness were recorded in b3r2 1 46 and 5 respectively and b4r4 1 56 and 5 respectively compared to b3r1 which had a diversity of 2 24 and richness of 11 microscopic examinations of e3 for both 2 and 5 proportions of pre treated leachate and anaerobic reactor effluent show the presence of attached ciliates similar to epistylis and vorticella with an apparently lower frequency than in e1 and e2 and higher frequency of rhizopods similar to euglypha and some unidentified species the rotifers remained at a low frequency and those similar to philodinavus were predominant fig 13 nitrification indicator organisms such as teasted amoebae crawler ciliates fig 14 and tardigrade like metazoa fig 15 remained in both leachate mixture proportions confirmed by the tkn removal results converted to nitrite and nitrate in e4 an apparent decrease in the frequency of nitrification indicators occurred as the proportion of leachate 5 increased with a reduction of the removal efficiency of tkn to 55 and an to 56 in b3r4 5 a high frequency of suspension flagellate and rotiferous similar to epiphanes and rotari was observed a decrease in the number and size of flakes as well as the modification of their structure the increase in flagellate organisms indicates unstable operating conditions 45 and or indicates a transitional period in the recovery of the system after an organic load shock toxic or not 46 47 which also results in the increase of the bacteria in suspension there was an increase in the frequency of attached ciliates similar to opercularia fig 16 in detriment to other similar epistylis and vorticella the abundance of attached ciliate protozoa of the genus opercularia was associated with low bod removal efficiency and a decrease in sedimentable solids concentration 48 41 the physico chemical results of the e3 and e4 tests indicated low removal efficiency of cod and bod mainly in b4r4 where bod removal efficiency was lower than 5 the frequency of the arcella like and euglypha like rhizopods fig 12 and 11 respectively also decreased as the proportion of leachate increased in b4r4 5 these organisms were practically absent the low removal efficiencies of cod bod doc and nitrogen in b4r4 indicated the toxicity of the raw leachate in the microbiota of the system and changes in the structure of the activated sludge reactor flakes 49 50 possibly due to the high concentrations of ammonia salinity and other unidentified compounds found in this residue in addition a process of deflocculation was initiated and the frequency of filamentous bacteria increased fig 17 in e4 with increasing mixture percentages ranging from 2 b4r2 to 5 b4r4 when compared to the other tests excess filaments are associated with nutritional deficiency low concentrations of dissolved oxygen and the presence of recalcitrant or toxic organic matter thus the low concentration of organic matter from the effluent of the anaerobic reactor bod lower than 100 mg l 1 resulted in the development of these filaments especially in the highest proportion of leachate 5 which also has the highest recalcitrant concentrations although filamentous organisms are important for the maintenance of the flake structure increasing them may cause sedimentability problems in b4r4 the highest svi values were determined varying from 95 ml g 1 to 121 ml g 1 although they remained below the ideal 150 mg g 1 43 it appears that a good diversity of microbial protozoa and micrometazoa morphologies was maintained as in the batch assays however in the pilot assay bristle worm like aeolosoma fig 18 and tardigrades were observed they are associated with nitrification and high sludge age systems figures m and n and low f m ratio 43 which was observed in this assay condition sludge age around 20 days and hrt of 24 h are characteristic if activated sludge systems with prolonged aeration the dgge band profiles for the bacteria domain indicated more significant changes in the populations of e4 with 5 raw leachate b4r4 which had the lowest similarity index 1 99 when compared to e1 e3 indicating a selection of the bacterial microbiota to the even more restrictive growth conditions and the adaptation of the higher mixture percentage of the raw leachate to the effluent of the anaerobic sewage treatment reactor in addition to the increase in the frequency of filamentous bacteria there was an apparent increase of the bacteria in suspension and consequent increase in the density of flagellates as well as an increase in the frequency of rotifers when compared to the e1 e3 tests considering the limitations of the dgge methodology 51 the diversity indices calculated from the band profiles and the microscopic examination of the samples provided a good estimate of the microbiota diversity when submitted to the different pre treated and raw percentages using the sewage and effluent from anaerobic sewage treatment in addition although dgge only qualifies microbial populations as the coefficients of similarity diversity and richness indices corroborate the principles of general ecology 52 which characterizes a less diverse eutrophic system in this work this principle was confirmed by experiment 4 with a 5 mixture of raw leachate and anaerobic sewage under more inhospitable conditions to microbial growth which showed the lowest diversity and richness indices and also the worst performance of the batch reactor b4r4 however the best reactor performance was observed in b2r3 which was corroborated by the higher diversity indices for both domains when compared to the other tests for the removal of cod doc tkn and an the pilot scale reactor operated according to the best results obtained in the batch reactors confirm the performance of the e2 assay volumetric proportion of 2 of pre treated leachate with domestic sewage 4 conclusion the highest removal efficiencies of cod bod tkn and an were obtained in experiment 2 in which the affluent was composed of 2 pre treated leachate b2r3 this experiment showed the highest diversity indices of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities and stability of the flake structure the proportions of 5 of the mixtures pre treated b3r4 and raw b4r4 leachate and anaerobic sewage treatment effluent indicated the worst organic matter and nitrogen removal performances of the system with a reduction of microbial diversity mainly in b4r4 and significant increase in the frequency of filamentous microorganisms and disintegration of the flakes in the activated sludge system it appears that the eukaryote populations were the most affected with increasing proportions of 2 to 5 of the mixture mainly for experiments 3 b3r2 and 4 b4r4 which had the lowest diversity indices of these populations the dgge technique coupled with the microscopic examination was important for understanding the performance of batch operated reactors with different percentages of leachate mixture and with raw sewage and effluent from an anaerobic domestic sewage treatment reactor the physical chemical and microbiological monitoring results were satisfactory and indicate that biological treatability was feasible under the e2 experiment

water purification and softening soil remediation etc during these studies many experimental variables were investigated such as temperature solution ionic strength concentration of adsorbates contact time and present cationic anionic species 13 15 in previous works the porous structure of this modified natural clinoptilolite as a supported catalyst nz a fe has been reported 16 18 where the behavior of this material nz a fe in both adsorption and oxidation processes were explored this paper presents novel results for btx removal considering that simultaneous processes are taking place

standard the software used in this analysis is peakfit by systat software inc 2 4 heterogeneous fenton reaction the reactor consisted of a column 9 0 cm length and 1 0 cm in diameter made of pyrex glass packed with the catalyst particles filled with 5 0 g of nz a fe catalyst fig 1 iron content in nz a fe catalyst was near 1 3 w w temperature control 20 c for column was performed by water recirculation with a cooling jacket while neutral ph was controlled with the buffered solution for all the experiences before starting the adsorption oxidation step the column was rinsed with deionized water for several hours in order to adjust the flow rate a volume of 250 cm3 of the feed solution with btx section 2 1 was pumped at a flow rate of 0 88 cm3 min through the column in the upward direction using a rotary piston pump fig 1 shows a scheme of the system involved in heterogeneous fenton like reactions catalyzed by nz a fe specified amount of reaction mixture were withdrawn

catalyst and hydrogen peroxide btx nz a fe 0 016 and h2o2 nz a fe 0 23 the experience time was 870 min ph 7 and t 20 c as it was described in russo et al 17 the catalyst powder was suspended in the btx aqueous solution samples were mixed in a horizontal shaker while aliquot of 1 ml were extracted at different intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the natural clinoptilolite nz and the treated and iron loaded zeolites nz a and nz a fe were characterized using xrd fig 2 the results indicate that the main mineral in the samples is clinoptilolite 9 quartz and feldespate and can be fitted with the clinoptilolite reference ref code 01 013 0304 corresponding to the monoclinic system space group c2 m no significant change has been observed either in the position of the most intense peaks of the clinoptilolite 20 nor in its crystallinity we can observe that the main differences between the peaks are in their intensity the peak corresponding to the 020 and 200 planes of clinoptilolite see fig 2 are the ones having the highest intensity variation these changes in peaks intensity are mainly associated with differences in the nature amount and position of the extra framework species in clinoptilolite channels 21 fe inclusion only slightly modifies patterns intensities such shift must be attributed to the ion exchange of fe2 into the sites occupied by ca2 and or na in the crystalline structure of the clinoptilolite during edx analysis we normally get elemental composition in normalized atomic concentration table 1 this tecnique is a semiquantitative method because not all elements are considered although individual cationic values of both samples nz and nz a fe show some variations as a consequence of the chemical treatment si al ratio remains in 4 5 ratifying preserved crystallinity in both zeolites iron loading increases iron content in nz a fe compared to nz the state of iron in natural zeolite is an important feature for the practical applications of these materials it has been determined that iron is located as low spin fe iii in the tetrahedral sites of the framework in extra framework octahedral sites as free fe h2 o 6 3 and as high spin fe ii in octahedral coordination in extra framework sites or in another aluminosilicate associated with the zeolite 22 uv vis spectra obtained in diffuse reflectance drs mode provide information on the iron speciation in fe zeolites the preparation method framework composition of the support and pretreatment conditions determine the nature and distribution of fe species in the final catalyst 23 the respective uv vis drs spectra for samples nz nz a fe and nz a fe u section 2 2 are presented in fig 3 iron in zeolite structure can be considered in three different species according to literature the peaks at 200 nm and 285 nm correspond to the presence of isolated fe iii ions in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination respectively octahedral fe iii ions in small oligonuclear iron oxo clusters give bands between 300 and 400 nm and bands above 400 nm are characteristic for large iron oxide particles 24 these large iron oxide particles are not desired but not completely avoidable due to the limited space inside the channel system of the zeolites oxide clusters can only be formed at the outer surface where they can play a significant role for the surface charge distribution these isolated fe iii species absorbance at 300 nm and small oligonuclear clusters fexoy are considered as the most active catalytic species for the heterogeneous fenton reaction table 2 shows for nz sample that the dominant fraction consists of iron species of low nuclearity isolated or binuclear i1 79 with relative low intensity values 4 as large iron oxide nanoparticles i3 peak 6 742 57 nm contribution was not considered as it seems without physical meaning probably it may be a background scan iron loading in nz a fe increases iron as oligonuclear clusters fe iii xoy i1 i2 it is interesting to remark that after fluxing an aqueous solution of btx 3 3 mm for 900 min the catalyst nz a fe u maintains a similar fe composition within the zeolite structure table 2 no contribution of large iron oxide particles was detected in this sample studies of the time dependence of reduction and reoxidation at 673 k by uv vis drs reported by kumar 24 for nitrogen oxide catalysis with nz fe show that iron in free samples extra framework isolated fe 3 ions in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination i1 and iron in clusters i2 possess different redox properties the former species are relatively fastly reduced but only slowly reoxidized in contrast iron oxide clusters are hardly reduced and very fastly reoxidized in cluster containing samples this suggests that the properties of iron species within clusters located in the channels may be more uniform than those of isolated sites 3 2 catalytic oxidation the heterogeneous fenton reaction was performed as it was previously described in 2 4 btx adsorption oxidation profiles by closed circuit flushing with the feed solution through the glass column using 5 g of nz a fe to treat 250 cm3 aqueous solutions for the three different pollutants bz tol and xyl respectively are presented in fig 4 samples were tested at regular intervals in order to characterize both inlet and outlet concentration see fig 1 of each pollutant previous results showed that absorption processes take place at the preliminary steps 100 min see fig 4 while oxidation processes mainly happen during all the experimental time inside the zeolite where the catalyst is placed 12 this analysis explains the great difference between inlet and outlet results at the very initial time all profiles show similar characteristics after 870 min c c0 reaches near 10 for each pollutant pollutants removal amounts c c0 are in the sequence xyl bz tol fig 5 shows the residual mass of each pollutant calculated as btx residual mg mass btx inlet mass btx outlet at each time interval consumed peroxide is also shown it is possible to observe that hydrogen peroxide concentration decreases continually although peroxide is not completely expended after the complete experience the system removed 65 mg btx after 870 min russo et al 14 preliminary results showed that adsorption capacity at equilibrium process of a btx solution on nz a fe a ph 7 was 2 7 2 8 and 0 5 mg l for bz tol and xyl these results confirm that both processes adsorption and oxidation are present hydrogen peroxide analysis supports these results btx kinetic removal is related to adsorption processes onto zeolite surface and peroxide diffusion to zeolite surface where the catalyst fe is placed in order to go through the following reactions 1 h 2 o 2 a c z f e 3 a c z f e 2 a c h a c h o 2 a c 2 h 2 o 2 a c z f e 2 a c z f e 3 a c o h a c o h a c the catalyst and the hydrogen peroxide generate oh and h o 2 0 radicals that can degrade pollutants structures and improve the oxidation efficiency the hydroperoxyl radicals h o 2 0 generated in eq 1 are less reactive than the oh species reactions presented in eqs 1 and 2 show that the formed oxidative radicals oh and h o 2 0 react with the activated organic molecules to produce mineralization products h2o co2 the comparisson of this heterogeneous fenton process in the recirculating column for a btx aqueous solution was implemented with a batch reactor system in similar experimental conditions taking in account the following mass ratio btx nz a fe and h2o2 nz a fe time min ph 7 and t 20 c fig 6 a higher degradation efficiency de was obtained in the recirculating column in 870 min 90 compared to 50 these results can be related to an enhancement of the contact between the catalyst and the pollutants and high mass transfer coefficients in the recirculating column specified amount of reaction mixture were withdrawn at regular time interval were leached iron species were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy solubilized iron remains below 0 15 0 05 ppm these results contribute to enhance the stability of the catalyst nz fe prepared in this work such a low extent of release may be regarded as the iron resistance to the leaching process 4 conclusion heterogeneous catalysis using fe species immobilized on the zeolite by liquid ion exchange showed to be a satisfactory method to remove organic pollutants although these hydrophobic zeolites have a relative low ion exchange capacity sio2 al2o3 near 4 5 it was possible to obtain good active catalyst properties after iron loading near 1 3 w w the results indicate that the recirculation bed reactor is an excellent system to remove by adsorption and oxidation processes btx from water due to high mass transfer coefficients and other advantages when compared to batch reactor experiments the system removed near 90 btx in the present conditions 13 mg g nz a fe it works at near neutral ph and can be easily reused fe zeolites as

standard the software used in this analysis is peakfit by systat software inc 2 4 heterogeneous fenton reaction the reactor consisted of a column 9 0 cm length and 1 0 cm in diameter made of pyrex glass packed with the catalyst particles filled with 5 0 g of nz a fe catalyst fig 1 iron content in nz a fe catalyst was near 1 3 w w temperature control 20 c for column was performed by water recirculation with a cooling jacket while neutral ph was controlled with the buffered solution for all the experiences before starting the adsorption oxidation step the column was rinsed with deionized water for several hours in order to adjust the flow rate a volume of 250 cm3 of the feed solution with btx section 2 1 was pumped at a flow rate of 0 88 cm3 min through the column in the upward direction using a rotary piston pump fig 1 shows a scheme of the system involved in heterogeneous fenton like reactions catalyzed by nz a fe specified amount of reaction mixture were withdrawn at regular time intervals degradation experiments in batch were performed with a batch reactor system in similar experimental conditions taking in account the following mass ratio for pollutants catalyst and hydrogen peroxide btx nz a fe 0 016 and h2o2 nz a fe 0 23 the experience time was 870 min ph 7 and t 20 c as it was described in russo et al 17 the catalyst powder was suspended in the btx aqueous solution samples were mixed in a horizontal shaker while aliquot of 1 ml were extracted at different intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the natural clinoptilolite nz and the treated and iron loaded zeolites nz a and nz a fe were characterized using xrd fig 2 the results indicate that the main mineral in the samples is clinoptilolite 9 quartz and feldespate and can be fitted with the clinoptilolite reference ref code 01 013 0304 corresponding to the monoclinic system space group c2 m no significant change has been observed either in the position of the most intense peaks of the clinoptilolite 20 nor in its crystallinity we can observe that the main differences between the peaks are in their intensity the peak corresponding to the 020 and 200 planes of clinoptilolite see fig 2 are the ones having the highest intensity variation these changes in peaks intensity are mainly associated with differences in the nature amount and position of the extra framework species in clinoptilolite channels 21 fe inclusion only slightly modifies patterns intensities such shift must be attributed to the ion exchange of fe2 into the sites occupied by ca2 and or na in the crystalline structure of the clinoptilolite during edx analysis we normally get elemental composition in normalized atomic concentration table 1 this tecnique is a semiquantitative method because not all elements are considered although individual cationic values of both samples nz and nz a fe show some variations as a consequence of the chemical treatment si al ratio remains in 4 5 ratifying preserved crystallinity in both zeolites iron loading increases iron content in nz a fe compared to nz the state of iron in natural zeolite is an important feature for the practical applications of these materials it has been determined that iron is located as low spin fe iii in the tetrahedral sites of the framework in extra framework octahedral sites as free fe h2 o 6 3 and as high spin fe ii in octahedral coordination in extra framework sites or in another aluminosilicate associated with the zeolite 22 uv vis spectra obtained in diffuse reflectance drs mode provide information on the iron speciation in fe zeolites the preparation method framework composition of the support and pretreatment conditions determine the nature and distribution of fe species in the final catalyst 23 the respective uv vis drs spectra for samples nz nz a fe and nz a fe u section 2 2 are presented in fig 3 iron in zeolite structure can be considered in three different species according to literature the peaks at 200 nm and 285 nm correspond to the presence of isolated fe iii ions in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination respectively octahedral fe iii ions in small oligonuclear iron oxo clusters give bands between 300 and 400 nm and bands above 400 nm are characteristic for large iron oxide particles 24 these large iron oxide particles are not desired but not completely avoidable due to the limited space inside the channel system of the zeolites oxide clusters can only be formed at the outer surface where they can play a significant role for the surface charge distribution these isolated fe iii species absorbance at 300 nm and small oligonuclear clusters fexoy are considered as the most active catalytic species for the heterogeneous fenton reaction table 2 shows for nz sample that the dominant fraction consists of iron species of low nuclearity isolated or binuclear i1 79 with relative low intensity values 4 as large iron oxide nanoparticles i3 peak 6 742 57 nm contribution was not considered as it seems without physical meaning probably it may be a background scan iron loading in nz a fe increases iron as oligonuclear clusters fe iii xoy i1 i2 it is interesting to remark that after fluxing an aqueous solution of btx 3 3 mm for 900 min the catalyst nz a fe u maintains a similar fe composition within the zeolite structure table 2 no contribution of large iron oxide particles was detected in this sample studies of the time dependence of reduction and reoxidation at 673 k by uv vis drs reported by kumar 24 for nitrogen oxide catalysis with nz fe show that iron in free samples extra framework isolated fe 3 ions in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination i1 and iron in clusters i2 possess different redox properties the former species are relatively fastly reduced but only slowly reoxidized in contrast iron oxide clusters are hardly reduced and very fastly reoxidized in cluster containing samples this suggests that the properties of iron species within clusters located in the channels may be more uniform than those of isolated sites 3 2 catalytic oxidation the heterogeneous fenton reaction was performed as it was previously described in 2 4 btx adsorption oxidation profiles by closed circuit flushing with the feed solution through the glass column using 5 g of nz a fe to treat 250 cm3 aqueous solutions for the three different pollutants bz tol and xyl respectively are presented in fig 4 samples were tested at regular intervals in order to characterize both inlet and outlet concentration see fig 1 of each pollutant previous results showed that absorption processes take place at the preliminary steps 100 min see fig 4 while oxidation processes mainly happen during all the experimental time inside the zeolite where the catalyst is placed 12 this analysis explains the great difference between inlet and outlet results at the very initial time all profiles show similar characteristics after 870 min c c0 reaches near 10 for each pollutant pollutants removal amounts c c0 are in the sequence xyl bz tol fig 5 shows the residual mass of each pollutant calculated as btx residual mg mass btx inlet mass btx outlet at each time interval consumed peroxide is also shown it is possible to observe that hydrogen peroxide concentration decreases continually although peroxide is not completely expended after the complete experience the system removed 65 mg btx after 870 min russo et al 14 preliminary results showed that adsorption capacity at equilibrium process of a btx solution on nz a fe a ph 7 was 2 7 2 8 and 0 5 mg l for bz tol and xyl these results confirm that both processes adsorption and oxidation are present hydrogen peroxide analysis supports these results btx kinetic removal is related to adsorption processes onto zeolite surface and peroxide diffusion to zeolite surface where the catalyst fe is placed in order to go through the following reactions 1 h 2 o 2 a c z f e 3 a c z f e 2 a c h a c h o 2 a c 2 h 2 o 2 a c z f e 2 a c z f e 3 a c o h a c o h a c the catalyst and the hydrogen peroxide generate oh and h o 2 0 radicals that can degrade pollutants structures and improve the oxidation efficiency the hydroperoxyl radicals h o 2 0 generated in eq 1 are less reactive than the oh species reactions presented in eqs 1 and 2 show that the formed oxidative radicals oh and h o 2 0 react with the activated organic molecules to produce mineralization products h2o co2 the comparisson of this heterogeneous fenton process in the recirculating column for a btx aqueous solution was implemented with a batch reactor system in similar experimental conditions taking in account the following mass ratio btx nz a fe and h2o2 nz a fe time min ph 7 and t 20 c fig 6 a higher degradation efficiency de was obtained in the recirculating column in 870 min 90 compared to 50 these results can be related to an enhancement of the contact between the catalyst and the pollutants and high mass transfer coefficients in the recirculating column specified amount of reaction mixture were withdrawn at regular time interval were leached iron species were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy solubilized iron remains below 0 15 0 05 ppm these results contribute to enhance the stability of the catalyst nz fe prepared in this work such a low extent of release may be regarded as the iron resistance to the leaching process 4 conclusion heterogeneous catalysis using fe species immobilized on the zeolite by liquid ion exchange showed to be a satisfactory method to remove organic pollutants although these hydrophobic zeolites have a relative low ion exchange capacity sio2 al2o3 near 4 5 it was possible to obtain good active catalyst properties after iron loading near 1 3 w w the results indicate that the recirculation bed reactor is an excellent system to remove by adsorption and oxidation processes btx from water due to high mass transfer coefficients and other advantages when compared to batch reactor experiments the system removed near 90 btx in the present conditions 13 mg g nz a fe it works at near neutral ph and can be easily reused fe zeolites as
