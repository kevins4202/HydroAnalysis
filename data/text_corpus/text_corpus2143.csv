10715,cover crops are a potential component of agroecological cropping systems since they may render crop rotations more sustainable they simultaneously provide multiple ecosystem services such as decreasing nitrate leaching decreasing erosion and increasing soil organic matter however cover crops increase evapotranspiration and reduce drainage which results in a potential disservice for groundwater recharge little attention has focused on management of cover crop residues after destruction or their influence on water flux dynamics particularly in dry and temperate climates the objective of our study was to analyze and quantify the impact of cover crop management on soil water content and water flux dynamics to understand the main mechanisms of system functioning we combined a two year field experiment with crop model simulations we performed the field experiment in southwestern france that compared three cover crop treatments with bare soil as the control the treatments included 1 living cover crops lasting ca 9 months from august april 2 crushing cover crops in november and leaving them as mulch on the soil and 3 plowing up cover crops in november to promote residue decomposition and the green manure effect the stics soil crop model was used to predict water fluxes that were not measured and to perform a 20 year independent simulation study based on recent climate series for the experimental site our main results indicated that cover crops 1 always reduce water drainage by 20 60 mm compared to that under bare soil and 2 could significantly reduce soil water content 0 120 cm deep for the next cash crop by a mean of 20 50 mm and up to 80 mm in dry spring conditions but early destruction could decrease this negative impact the simulations clearly showed that the interaction between climate variability i e rainfall distribution during the fallow period and cover crop management should be considered to explain the impact of inter annual variability on the water balance thus destroying cover crops mechanically in late autumn and retaining the residues as mulch could be a good compromise between the multiple services the cover crop provides during the fallow period and avoiding the negative impact on soil water availability for the next cash crop keywords water fluxes termination date evapotranspiration stics crop model 1 introduction intensive agriculture has reached a critical point particularly in europe and temperate climate zones conventional agriculture is increasingly shown to be responsible for multiple problems such as stagnating yields a decrease in soil fertility pollution of groundwater and rivers and soil erosion agriculture must adapt in response to climate change which is causing more droughts less water availability and more extreme climatic events ipcc 2013 therefore scientists farmers and policy makers urgently need to find more sustainable and resilient cropping and farming systems the use of cover crops could help cropping systems become more agroecological and diversified cover crops are sown after one cash crop is harvested and terminated before the next one is sown their residues are retained as a mulch or incorporated into the soil by plowing or shallow tillage such as disking cover crops provide a wide range of ecosystem services including reducing nitrate leaching tonitto et al 2006 providing a green manure effect tosti et al 2014 tribouillois et al 2015 improving physical properties of soil that reduce erosion or compaction chen and weil 2010 ryder and fares 2008 decreasing greenhouse gas emissions increasing carbon c storage in the soil poeplau and don 2015 tribouillois et al 2018a and controlling pests diseases and weeds couëdel et al 2018a haramoto and gallandt 2005 schipanski et al 2014 using cover crops could also help mitigate and adapt to climate change kaye and quemada 2017 tribouillois et al 2018b demonstrated the effective mitigating influence of cover crops and highlighted the challenge of finding a good compromise between certain ecosystem services they provide and the decrease in groundwater recharge they cause by increasing evapotranspiration of cropping systems cover crops influence the soil water balance and water fluxes they reduce water drainage in temperate climates meyer et al 2019 and increase transpiration by increasing leaf cover transpiration and decreasing soil evaporation nielsen et al 2015b qi et al 2011 when well established they can also increase water infiltration and reduce runoff eshel et al 2015 yu et al 2016 however the importance of these processes depends on cover crop management climate and soil type no consensus exists about the impact of cover crops on soil water availability for the next cash crop corak et al 1991 and restovich et al 2012 reported less water available with cover crops compared to that with bare soil while chen et al 2014 and daigh et al 2014 found no significant differences between these two treatments at sowing of the next crop several studies reported more water in the topsoil 0 20 cm depth blanco canqui et al 2011 wells et al 2014 likewise no consensus exists about the impact of management of cover crop residues after cover crops are terminated several studies reported an increase in soil water content swc up to 20 cm deep alliaume et al 2014 moschler et al 1967 stipešević and kladivko 2005 williams and weil 2004 observed no differences in soil moisture 20 50 cm deep between cover crop mulch and bare soil pedrosa de azevedo et al 1999 observed no significant difference in soil moisture between keeping cover crops alive during the fallow period and crushing them and leaving their residues as mulch kornecki et al 2013 observed a small difference between these two treatments with more soil moisture under the mulched cover crop it is also difficult to generalize the impact of cover crops on water balance because studies are performed in different contexts of fallow periods e g august november vs october april climate conditions and cover crop management in some studies cover crops are terminated in late winter or early spring while in others they are terminated the day before sowing the next cash crop especially when herbicide termination is used these differences are crucial to understanding cover crop impacts since multiple processes of variable intensity interact in these dynamics thus spring rainfall can recharge the soil and mask differences in swc and in the topsoil seedbed of the next cash crop even though water fluxes e g drainage evapotranspiration flow simultaneously dynamic soil crop models can be useful tools to estimate water fluxes that are difficult to measure in field experiments such as drainage evaporation and transpiration and can do so accurately over long periods these models also can simulate a wide range of cover crop management practices under several soil and climate conditions and extrapolate results of field experiments that are expensive time consuming and rare bergez et al 2010 the goal of our study was to understand and quantify impacts of cover crops and their management on water flux dynamics e g soil evaporation plant transpiration drainage and balance at the crop rotation scale two components of the water balance were a particular focus of analysis 1 drainage which governs groundwater recharge and 2 water availability for the next cash crop which determines the risk of water deficit for crop emergence and early growth we combined a two year field experiment with simulation modeling to address this issue the field experiment was performed to analyze impacts of cover crop management on dynamics of swc and cover crop biomass this field experiment was supplemented with a modeling approach using the stics soil crop model to understand and quantify the water flux dynamics drainage evaporation and transpiration not measured during the experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodological approach to determine the impact of various cover crop management practices on soil water balance during the fallow period and soil water availability for the next spring summer cash crop the following methodological approach was used 1 a two year field experiment was performed to quantify the impact of three cover crop management practices on swc in multiple soil layers during the fallow period compared to the swc under bare soil used as a control 2 the dynamics of swc and cover crop biomass measured in the experiment were used to calibrate the stics soil crop model for the mixed cover crop sown in the experiment and evaluate the model s ability to predict the experiment the objective was to simulate soil and plant dynamics sufficiently well to obtain accurate simulations of water fluxes 3 we assumed that if dynamics of swc and crop biomass were simulated accurately then those of water fluxes would also be simulated accurately after verifying satisfactory agreement between model predictions and experimental observations stics was used to predict dynamics of soil evaporation plant transpiration and water drainage processes not measured in the field and the complete water balance for the two experimental years 4 to place the weather during the two experimental years in the study site s interannual variability in climate we used the calibrated stics to simulate a 20 year climate series to better understand and generalize the impact of cover crop management on water fluxes and the complete water balance 2 2 case study site 2 2 1 climate characteristics a two year experiment was performed from 2017 to 2018 and 2018 2019 hereafter 2017 and 2018 respectively in southwestern france near toulouse 43 31 n 1 30 e the site has a temperate climate corresponding to cfb in the köppen climate classification over the past two decades 1998 2018 the site s mean 1 standard deviation sd annual temperature was 13 8 0 5 c annual potential evapotranspiration pet penman equation was 962 51 mm and annual rainfall was 655 105 mm the weather conditions from cover crop sowing in july august to termination in march april differed during the two years of the experiment fig 1 for 2017 and 2018 cumulative rainfall was 504 mm and 343 mm and cumulative pet was 437 mm and 334 mm respectively in 2017 autumn was dry and winter and spring were rainy with a high pet in the three months following the sowing of cover crops conversely in 2018 autumn and early winter were rainy with a low pet and late winter and spring were dry cumulative temperature calculated with base 0 from the day of cover crop sowing 31 july in 2017 and 28 august in 2018 until 9 april was 2920 c in 2017 and 2490 c in 2018 2 2 2 soil characteristics the two year experiment was performed at an institut national de la recherche agronomique inra experimental station on two field plots with similar soil characteristics clay loam in 2017 and loam in 2018 table 1 soil moisture at field capacity fc corresponded to the maximum observed during the experiment soil moisture at wilting point wp and bulk density bd were estimated based on soil texture classification and measurements at the experimental station jamagne et al 1977 tribouillois et al 2016 total available water capacity for plants tawc swc between fc and wp was calculated down to 120 cm deep the maximum root depth observed at this site tribouillois et al 2016 tawc was nearly the same for the two plots 152 and 164 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively the swc at fc was 347 and 328 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 3 field experiment 2 3 1 experimental design the experimental design was the same for both years four treatments and four replicates per treatment the treatments were 1 bare soil bs as a control without plant transpiration 2 cover crops mechanically terminated by crushing in autumn and left as mulch on the soil surface ccm until spring 3 cover crops mechanically terminated by crushing in autumn and buried by plowing ccp during winter when soil conditions were suitable to avoid compaction and 4 cover crops mechanically terminated by crushing in april ccl immediately before sowing the next spring summer cash crop the surface area of an elementary plot was 44 and 70 m² in 2017 and 2018 respectively the preceding cash crop for both years was durum wheat harvested in late june early july cover crop species were selected for their ability to grow rapidly during the summer and their tolerance to freezing temperatures they were also selected to favor complementary abiotic resource acquisition based on previous studies performed under the same climatic conditions couëdel et al 2018b tribouillois et al 2016 and to cover the soil during the entire fallow period due to complementary development a bispecific mixture was chosen one crucifer ethiopan mustard brassica carinata and one legume crimson clover trifolium incarnatum the crucifer grew rapidly after sowing and during autumn the legume was able to grow during winter under the mustard and could grow more rapidly in early spring maintaining soil cover and plant transpiration until april seeds were sown respectively at 3 kg ha 1 and 7 5 kg ha 1 of seeds shallow tillage was performed in both years before sowing in both years 70 mm of irrigation was applied twice after sowing to ensure homogenous emergence and establishment of cover crops to guarantee spatial homogeneity of the soil crop system weeds were controlled on bs using a herbicidal spray in october of both years 2 3 2 cover crop biomass and soil water content measurements aerial biomass mg ha 1 was sampled from a 0 5 m² area in each replicate plot of the cover crop treatments on each termination date autumn and spring mustard and clover biomass was separated and measured when present weed biomass was also measured in the cover crop treatments but it was always low dry matter was weighed after 48 h in an 80 c oven swc mm was measured once per month for 8 9 months from cover crop sowing to the following april the soil profile was sampled from 0 120 cm deep in layers 20 cm thick five samples were collected per replicate plot and then pooled by layer for each plot measurements in each of the four replicates were taken independently soil samples were weighed before and after 48 h in a 105 c oven to measure gravimetric soil moisture cg water g 1 soil 2 4 simulation approach 2 4 1 model overview we used the soil crop model stics brisson et al 2003 which simulates daily crop growth light water c and nitrogen n balances based on soil climate crop species and agricultural management a tipping bucket approach is used to model the soil which is divided into five layers with specific characteristics such as bd as well as swc at fc and wp the water balance was simulated daily by adding soil water supply and subtracting plant transpiration and soil evaporation brisson et al 2009 stics was evaluated as accurate for a wide range of agro environmental contexts in france for plant water and n outputs for bare soil and many types of cash crops brisson et al 2003 2009 stics was also used to simulate cover crops and analyze water c and n balances and the associated ecosystem services tribouillois et al 2018a stics was also successfully evaluated for water drainage beaudoin et al 2008 constantin et al 2012 2 4 2 model initialization and calibration on site 2 4 2 1 soil parameterization and initialization there was no calibration done on bare soil two soils were parameterized separately to simulate each year of the field experiment for model evaluation the swc measured at the beginning of the experiment for each treatment was used and the soil moisture at fc of each layer was adjusted for each treatment to correspond as closely as possible to field observations to initialize each soil layer in the model for simulations the mean swc and soil mineral n measured in the four treatments at the beginning of the experiment was used for each treatment table 1 2 4 2 2 crop calibration stics has been calibrated for a wide range of species used as cover crops such as mustard rapeseed radish ryegrass oat pea vetch and clover constantin et al 2012 tribouillois et al 2018b however no parameterization for a mixture of species was available to simulate the field experiment accurately we parameterized stics for the mustard clover cover crop mixture the objective was to simulate as accurately as possible the main processes governing water balance dynamics such as cover crop development biomass growth changes in soil moisture over time in each soil layer and total swc starting with parameters already calibrated for rapeseed the crop most similar to ethiopian mustard and crimson clover we optimized three parameters for cover crop development n2 fixation for clover and cover crop water requirements to generate the most accurate joint predictions of the dynamics of biomass and swc in each layer and in total for both experimental years mathematical optimization was based on the method developed by wallach et al 2011 using the simplex algorithm which is available with the stics model software java interface https www6 paca inra fr stics fr 2 4 3 water flux simulations of the field experiment after calibration model predictions of water drainage soil evaporation and plant transpiration were available for each of the four treatments for each year of the field experiment table 2 they were used to calculate total water balance and quantify the fluxes for the 2017 experimental year simulations began 28 july and ended 28 march for the 2018 experimental year simulations began on 1 august and ended on 5 april since crimson clover was observed to regrow in both years after being crushed in the ccm treatment the model was calibrated to simulate this regrowth as well using only crimson clover parameters as the crop in a second simulation step 2 4 4 simulation of water fluxes over 20 years to evaluate the impact of cover crops on soil water variables over a long time series a 20 year simulation was performed using a climate series from 1999 to 2018 from an inra weather station installed at the study site the soil was parameterized and initialized with the field data measured in 2017 then we run simulations twice once with dates of technical operations of 2017 crop management for all 20 years and once with dates of the technical operations of 2018 crop management for all 20 years since each year had different field operation dates table 2 the simulations started on 1 august and finished on 1 april for each year of the 20 year simulation predicted swc and cumulative water drainage on 1 april were also recorded as in the two year experiment potential regrowth of crimson clover after being crushed in the ccm treatment was simulated 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using r software r core team 2018 2 5 1 stics evaluation and prediction 2 5 1 1 model evaluation criteria simulations were performed using the model calibrated for the six cover crop treatments 3 treatments 2 experimental years three statistical criteria were used to evaluate the quality of agreement between observed and simulated variables after calibrating stics for the cover crop mixture mean deviation md relative root mean square error rrmse model efficiency ef calculated as follows m d 1 n i 1 n s i o i r r m s e 100 r m s e o with r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i ² e f i 1 n o i o ² i 1 n s i o i ² i 1 n o i o ² where n is the number of observations s i and o i are the simulated and observed values respectively and o is the mean value of the observed data the three criteria provide a good overview of model performance md and rrmse indicate systematic bias and the dispersal of model simulations compared to observations respectively the lower their value the better is the model prediction ef which measures agreement between simulations and observations varies from 1 perfect prediction to a negative value indicates that the mean of observations is a better predictor than the model 2 5 1 2 stics prediction quality to assess the ability of stics to simulate biomass each soil layer s moisture and total swc the relative root mean square error of prediction rrmsep was calculated using cross validation and a leave one out method wallach 2014 the six cover crop treatments were separated into two subsamples one containing five treatments to estimate crop parameters and the other containing the sixth treatment to evaluate the prediction quality of stics compared to observed data this procedure was applied six times to assess the prediction quality of stics for the six treatments by calculating individual rmsep for each treatment r m s e p 1 n i 1 n p i o i ² r r m s e p 100 r m s e p o r m s e p r m s e p where p i are the predicted values 2 5 2 field experiment and 20 year simulations 2 5 2 1 field experiment statistical analyses of swc and soil moisture for each layer in the experiment were performed based on the dataset and after testing the homogeneity of the variables a non parametric kruskall wallis test was used to test the impact of the cover crop management practices on the experimental data a non parametric wilcoxon test was used to compare each pair of cover crop treatments for all analyses differences among treatments were considered significant at p 0 05 2 5 2 2 twenty year simulations statistical analyses of swc total and in the 0 10 cm layer and the difference in drainage predicted in the 20 year simulations were performed a non parametric kruskall wallis test was used to test the impact of the cover crop management practices on the simulated data a non parametric wilcoxon test was used to compare each pair of cover crop treatments for all analyses differences among treatments were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 field experiment 3 1 1 aerial biomass of cover crop mixtures on the date of autumn termination for ccm and ccp cover crops reached a mean aerial biomass of 4 2 mg ha 1 76 mustard 24 clover in 2017 and 3 5 mg ha 1 83 mustard 17 clover in 2018 fig 2 afterwards the clover regrew in ccm reaching a biomass of 3 6 and 3 1 mg ha 1 at the end of the 2017 and 2018 experimental years early spring respectively in contrast for ccl at the end of the experimental years aerial biomass was 7 5 mg ha 1 35 mustard 65 clover in 2017 and 8 9 mg ha 1 88 mustard 12 clover in 2018 these results illustrate the temporal complementarity of the two species growth which covered the soil throughout the fallow period ethiopian mustard develops very quickly in late summer and autumn while clover growth is particularly important in winter and spring 3 1 2 soil water measurements during the fallow period soil water profiles during the fallow period varied by treatment in both years of the experiment showing no similar trends or final results figs 3 a b from july august to november december cover crops had significantly less water under them in the soil profile in 2017 than bs did but they showed no difference compared to bs in 2018 for both years of the experiment cover crops and bs showed no difference in swc during winter from february to march april swc differed significantly between ccl or ccm and bs or ccp in the layers 20 60 cm deep in 2017 and 2018 figs 3a b the change in swc depended on the yearly rainfall distribution fig 4 in 2017 october and november were dry each receiving less than 50 mm of rainfall during these months measured swc differed significantly between bs and the cover crop treatments in december the difference was ca 50 mm due to cover crops having higher actual evapotranspiration aet than bs december and january each received ca 200 mm of rainfall which caused soils of all treatments to reach fc with lower rainfall in march a significant difference in swc was observed between bs and ccp which had no vegetation and ccl and ccm which did fig 4a in 2018 rainfall distribution was more regular than that in 2017 from august february 50 100 mm of rain fell each month which explains the lack of a significant difference among the four treatments during this period february and march were dry but resulted in non significant differences in swc in the upper layers among the four treatments fig 4b 3 2 stics calibration and evaluation 3 2 1 calibration of the cover crop mixture and quality of calibration of stics for the two years of the experiment stics simulated aerial cover crop biomass well ef was high 0 82 with a non significant low md of 0 2 mg ha 1 of biomass and rrmse was only 18 2 stics also predicted swc well with a high ef 0 87 no significant md 1 mm of water and a low rrmse 4 7 table 3 fig 5 supplementary materials figs s1 s8 stics predicted water distribution in the soil well with md less than 1 cg g 1 and ef always greater than 0 4 for the five soil layers dynamics of the upper layers subject to soil evaporation and root uptake of water were simulated accurately as indicated by an rrmse of 13 8 and 9 1 for the 0 20 and 20 40 cm layers respectively the rrmse for the three deepest layers was low 9 the dynamics of swc and the soil water profile were satisfactory supplementary materials figs s1 s8 swc differed between bs and cover crops somewhat more in the simulations than in the experiment however simulation results lay within 1 sd of the observations indicating that model error was in the same range as the variability in the field measurements 3 2 2 evaluation of the predictive quality using cross validation to assess the predictive quality of stics for simulating biomass soil moisture in each layer and swc provided satisfactory results indicating an acceptable accuracy of the simulations the rrmsep of soil moisture were ca 15 for soil layers 0 40 cm deep and less than 10 for the deeper layers the rrmsep of cover crop biomass were less than 10 and those of swc were ca 5 table 3 3 3 simulated water fluxes like the measurements predicted swc was lower for the three cover crop treatments than for bs from late august until the date when fc was reached after winter rainfall fig 6 in 2018 the swc of cover crops treatments was no more than 15 mm less than that of bs swc was 60 mm lower from 50 days after sowing das to 150 das in 2017 while it was 10 mm lower from 20 to 50 das in 2018 differences in swc among the three cover crop treatments depended on the field experiment no difference in swc was observed between the three cover crop treatments in 2017 while several differences were measured and simulated in 2018 from 150 das difference in swc between ccm and ccl first appeared at 150 das resulting in swc 18 mm higher for ccm than ccl in late march at the same time in march the swc for ccp was the same as that for bs and 70 mm higher than that for ccm table 3 from 170 das to the end of the experiment the difference in simulated swc increased between bs and ccp and between ccl and ccm which was similar to the measurements simulated swc decreased more for ccl and ccm than for bs and ccp the maximum difference in simulated swc at the end of experiment was 89 mm which was similar to the difference measured between ccl and bs fig 6 simulated cumulative water fluxes for the entire experiment are summarized in table 4 for both years of the experiment higher aet was simulated for all cover crop treatments than for bs due to an increase in leaf transpiration and a concomitant decrease in soil evaporation due to plant cover in 2017 the three cover crop treatments had similar simulated evapotranspiration which was 70 mm higher than bs evaporation the relative amounts of soil evaporation and plant transpiration differed among the cover crop treatments ccp had 77 mm less simulated transpiration than ccm and 87 mm less than ccl which followed the trends for dynamics and amount of aerial biomass the difference in soil evaporation was inversely proportional to transpiration in 2018 bs had simulated evapotranspiration 36 93 and 111 mm lower than those for ccp ccm and ccl respectively the relative amounts of simulated evaporation and transpiration were similar in both years of the experiment for a given treatment table 3 consequently cover crops reduced predicted water drainage by the same degree regardless of their management in a given year compared to bs reductions of ca 60 and 15 mm were predicted in 2017 and 2018 respectively water drained 14 and 10 days later under cover crop treatments than under bs in 2017 and 2018 respectively indicating a delay in filling in the soil water reserve due to higher aet 3 4 water balance in the 20 year simulations for the two 20 year simulations cover crop biomass simulated for ccl ranged from 1 9 8 0 ha 1 mean 5 0 mg ha 1 indicating that the biomass measured during the experiment corresponded to the largest range of biomass that could be expected at this site simulated cover crop biomass for ccm and ccp at autumn termination ranged from 2 2 to 6 6 mg ha 1 mean 4 1 mg ha 1 indicating that the biomass measured during the experiment lay around the mean biomass that could be expected at this site the clover regrowth simulated for ccm ranged from 1 0 to 3 5 mg ha 1 mean 2 0 mg ha 1 indicating that its regrowth measured during the experiment corresponded to the largest range of regrowth that could be expected at this site over 20 years the swc simulated on 1 april for ccl and ccm differed significantly from that for bs fig 7 confirming the potential impact of cover crops on the water supply of the next cash crop in certain years simulated mean swc was 50 mm between ccl and bs significantly different and 60 mm between ccm and bs corresponding to the range simulated for the experiment simulated mean swc of ccp did not differ significantly from that of bs over the 20 years regardless the management year used 2017 or 2018 and was often near fc for the 2017 management mean swc of ccl differed significantly from those of ccp and bs the impact of ccm depended greatly on the climate year with high variability and a mean reduction compared to bs of ca 60 mm for the 2018 management the difference in swc between bs and ccm was ca 20 mm differences in simulated swc were compared for 1 april bs and ccp reached fc or nearly so with little variability among climate years simulated swc varied greatly for ccl and ccm for 25 of climate years it was less than 55 of tawc only three of the 20 simulated years showed no difference in swc between treatments these years were particularly rainy in winter and spring which frequently increased swc to fc the influence of sowing and termination dates was large with the difference between swc for ccl and ccmm inverted depending on the year of cover crop management simulated median swc for ccm was ca 25 mm higher and ca 15 mm lower than that for ccl for 2017 and 2018 management respectively however these differences were not statistically significant over the 20 simulated years differences in simulated swc were not due to differences in soil moisture of the 0 20 cm layer which did not differ significantly on 1 april among the bs ccp ccm and ccl treatments 14 8 14 8 15 4 and 15 0 cg g 1 respectively swc simulated over the 20 years differed from that measured in 2017 during which all treatments reached fc and in 2018 during which cover crops reduced swc in spring to a degree found at the higher end of the range simulated over the 20 years water drainage for bs ranged from 0 235 mm for the 20 simulated years three years had no drainage for both the 2017 and 2018 management years mean and median simulated drainage was 67 mm and 48 mm respectively which correspond to low drainage at that site this indicates that the drainage observed during the experiment was among the highest 25 in 20 years due to the high winter rainfall the mean difference in drainage of the cover crop treatments compared to bs was 45 mm and 20 mm for the 2017 and 2018 management years respectively fig 7 these differences represented a reduction in total drainage of ca 50 and 25 for 2017 and 2018 respectively for 25 of the 20 years no drainage was simulated for the three cover crop treatments unlike under bs regardless of the management year used over 20 years with the 2018 management ccm had three years with the same or slightly higher drainage than bs mean difference 4 mm drainage under cover crops treatments had greater variability than that under bs in some years simulated drainage started on the same date under the cover crops and bs due to a rainy autumn while in others drainage started up to 3 months later under cover crops than under bs especially after a dry autumn however the median difference for the beginning of drainage between bs and the cover crop treatments was 14 days which corresponds roughly to that observed in the experiment like in the experiment bs had significantly lower simulated aet over the 20 years than the cover crop treatments due to the lack of transpiration the difference in aet between the three cover crop treatments was small but significant for 2017 management but not significant for 2018 management compared to the other fluxes aet varied the least over the 20 years 4 discussion 4 1 influence of cover crops on soil water content for the next cash crop depends on their termination date although the two years of the field experiment had similar cover crop biomass impact of biomass on the soil water profile differed over time from sowing to autumn termination in 2017 water depletion was observed along the profile while in 2018 no difference in the water profile was observed among the treatments differences in rainfall dynamics explain why the four treatments showed no differences in the water profile in 2017 s spring while in 2018 there was less water in the soil layers 20 60 cm deep under ccl and ccm some studies indicated that cover crops did not influence swc in spring as in 2017 in our field experiment daigh et al 2014 while others reported a decrease in swc due to low rainfall in spring as in 2018 in our field experiment corak et al 1991 restovich et al 2012 blanco canqui et al 2011 suggested that soil moisture increases from 0 20 cm deep but we found no difference among the treatments over the experiments or the 20 year simulations little rainfall before the last sampling date could have removed differences in soil moisture from 0 20 cm which could explain why a difference was observed only from 20 60 cm the impact of cover crops on the yield of the following cash crop differs in the literature some studies reported a decrease in yield nielsen et al 2015b while others reported no negative impacts eshel et al 2015 in some cases yield can increase after a cover crop especially when legumes are used tonitto et al 2006 however these studies did not always identify why yield differed yield may decrease due to water stress at the beginning of the cash crop but it can also be caused by allelopathic effects kessavalou and walters 1997 or a decrease in soil n content compared to that of bare soil tonitto et al 2006 in both years of the experiment ccl and ccm had lower swc in soil layers 20 60 cm deep than bs and ccp at the end of the experiment which suggests that late termination of a cover crop decreases swc due to spring transpiration if spring rainfall is too low to make up for this difference growth of the next cash crop could decrease krueger et al 2011 highlighted the importance of the termination date on reducing the negative impact of cover crops on yields the 20 year simulations showed that cover crops reduced both mean and median swc simulated on 1 april and that spring rainfall was not sufficient to make up for the cover crops lower swc compared to that of bs indeed the effective rainfall which can indicate refilling of soil water was positive for only five of the 20 years and of these five the soil was refilled up to fc in only two of them swc of ccp did not differ significantly from that of bs which indicates that sufficient rain fell from termination to early spring to compensate for cover crop transpiration this indicates that early cover crop termination avoids large differences in swc in spring between cover crops and bare soil in temperate and mediterranean climates as suggested by alonso ayuso et al 2014 early termination could be a good way to avoid negative impact such as pre emptive competition for water on the next crop termination dates between november and april could be a good compromise to avoid a negative impact on swc and also could reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion better and maximize soil c storage terminating cover crops before winter could be the best solution in dry regions where water is scarce since we tested only two termination dates per year however we could not determine an optimal termination date this should be investigated in the future such as in a site specific simulation study 4 2 sowing date of cover crops is key to minimizing reduction in drainage in a recent meta analysis meyer et al 2019 reported that cover crops reduce water drainage by a mean of 27 mm compared to that under bare soil but the reduction varies widely among studies depending on the year and regardless of the cover crop management our field experiment indicated that cover crops reduce drainage by 20 60 mm which lies in the range found in the meta analysis early cover crop termination in autumn or early winter did not influence the reduction greatly since the same drainage reduction was observed regardless of the termination date or residue management in the two years of the experiment the 20 year simulations confirmed results of the experiment showing no difference in drainage reduction among the cover crop treatments for a given sowing date and year the range of annual reduction in predicted drainage over the 20 years 0 80 mm was consistent with the variability in results reported in the literature and can explain this variability since the impact on drainage depends on the interaction between weather conditions and cover crop management these differences can represent a reduction of nearly 50 in years with high drainage and a complete lack of drainage in drier years in our experiment the decrease in drainage due to cover crops was one third the amount with later sowing late august than early sowing late july this indicates that sowing date could be a key point to consider when analyzing the impact of cover crops on drainage as demonstrated by justes 2017 4 3 no direct relationship observed between cover crop biomass and impact on water fluxes above a certain level compared to bare soil cover crops increase evapotranspiration by increasing transpiration even though their cover decreases soil evaporation in the experiment cover crops increased evapotranspiration by a mean of 30 this result agrees with the literature nielsen et al 2015a qi and helmers 2010 in which several studies mention the relationship between biomass and transpiration suyker and verma 2009 tolk and howell 2009 however no significant relationship was observed between cover crop biomass and evapotranspiration or drainage in either year of the experiment tribouillois et al 2018 reported a correlation between cover crop biomass and an evapotranspiration they assessed cover crops with lower biomass 0 5 2 5 mg ha 1 yr 1 than we did 8 mg ha 1 crops transpiration is linked with the biomass through the leaf area index lai and it is assumed that above a certain level of lai transpiration does not increase in proportion and remains constant from a certain level kang et al 2003 kristensen 1974 this could explain why we did observed no correlation between cover crop biomass and evapotranspiration or drainage tribouillois et al 2018b also reported a strong negative correlation between the mean decrease in annual drainage and the mean increase in annual evapotranspiration due to cover crops this latter result was found in the 2017 experimental year however in 2018 no significant correlation was observed between the difference in drainage and evapotranspiration the increase in evapotranspiration influenced not only drainage which decreased only slightly but also the soil water content in spring which was much lower for ccl and ccm than for bs this could have been due to differences in rainfall distribution during the fallow period 4 4 study boundaries 4 4 1 field experiment and simulations irrigation was applied after sowing the cover crop to ensure homogenous emergence and establishment irrigation in summer which is a dry period in southwestern france could explain the large amount of biomass observed since strong growth of juvenile stages favored crop establishment since we included irrigation in the 20 year simulations stics also predicted large amounts of biomass however farmers in the region currently do not irrigate cover crops consequently water stress could occur with an early sowing date such as july or early august in our conditions which could result in lower biomass the impact of cover crops on the water balance could change since the climate in southwestern france is dry in summer and august rain is not always sufficient to ensure adequate emergence and development of cover crops to produce a sufficient amount of biomass to evaluate the impact of irrigation we also performed the 20 year simulations without irrigation the results not shown indicated that drainage was slightly lower but not significantly so predictions for the impact on swc and the difference in drainage compared to bs were similar with or without irrigation without irrigation the cover crop did not develop in some dry summers or developed later in such cases cover crops would not influence water fluxes the field experiment was performed on two similar soils at the same inra experimental station the soils had high swc due to their great depth more investigation is required to determine the importance of cover crops on shallow soils on shallow soils cover crops could have less impact on drainage due to less water lost via transpiration because their roots would not extend as deep in 2018 soil texture in the deeper layers of the field plot varied greatly even over short distances which could have masked significant differences in swc due to cover crop treatments as predicted in the 20 year simulation this highlights the ability of the strong complementarity between field experiments and modeling to help understand and quantify dynamic interactions between treatments and weather conditions 4 4 2 stics parameterization and initialization an initial step in our study was to evaluate the ability of stics to predict aerial biomass of cover crops and swc over time for the entire fallow period to obtain satisfactory water flux simulations biomass and swc were simulated sufficiently well for both years and were similar to or even an improvement on results of previous studies brisson et al 2002 coucheney et al 2015 stics already used successfully to simulate drainage under cover crops constantin et al 2012 tribouillois et al 2016 remained accurate in our study we can therefore assume that stics simulated the fluxes under different management practices sufficiently well nonetheless we could have improved calibration of the cover crop mixture had we measured dynamics of the leaf area index since leaf area governs transpiration swc predictions would have been more accurate if soil water content had been initialized for each treatment based on measurements however we initialized the soil with the mean swc measured in the four treatments to ensure that differences in simulated water fluxes would be due only to the management practices not to different initial states caused by natural field variability consequently stics slightly overestimated the difference in swc between ccl and bs in 2018 and thus could have slightly overestimated the difference in drainage and evapotranspiration between cover crops and bs nevertheless the simulated swc always lay within 1 sd of observed values which indicates that overestimates were consistent with experimental results and that predicted differences in water balance among treatments were acceptable 4 5 cover crop residues left as mulch can reduce soil evaporation and thus actual evapotranspiration one objective of our study was to analyze the impact of cover crop residues left as mulch via mechanical crushing after the first autumn termination ccm on the water balance since no reference was available in the literature despite this practice s great benefit for farmers although not planned the crimson clover regrew after crushing and produced a large amount of biomass consequently ccm caused changes in the water balance similar to those of ccl cover crop mulch can increase swc in the surface layer by reducing evaporation alliaume et al 2014 moschler et al 1967 stipešević and kladivko 2005 but we did not observe this effect for clover regrowth in the field experiment it is well known that residue mulch decreases evaporation evapotranspiration under a cover crop terminated early and left as mulch could result in the same cumulative aet as that under bare soil since compared a bare soil aet would be higher during cover crop growth and soil evaporation would be lower after cover crop termination thus a cover crop terminated early and left as mulch could reduce drainage less than a cover crop terminated late it could also increase soil moisture on the surface i e 0 10 cm and avoid an overly dry seedbed when the next cash crop is sown however it could also make the soil too wet for sowing and cause bearing capacity problems this demonstrates that cover crop management especially the termination date is important for cover crops to provide a sufficient level of services such as capturing nitrate or improving soil physical properties alonso ayuso et al 2018 in dry areas where water is scarce cover crops can reduce drainage and shallow groundwater recharge and we hypothesis that mulching could be a good practice to maintain the services expected from cover crops resulting in a good comprise between services and disservices thus this practice could encourage green manure or catch crop services and avoid disservices by minimizing negative impacts on water balance fluxes due to pre emptive competition for water which reduces drainage and water availability for the next cash crop 5 conclusion the choice of cover crop termination date and management of cover crop residues could be a way to benefit from all the services they provide such as the green manure effect or increasing soil physical properties in agroecological systems while reducing their potential negative effects on the water balance our study highlighted the impact of different cover crop management practices and the variability of their water balance compared to that of bare soil cover crops clearly increase aet and reduce drainage but do not always reduce swc at sowing of the next cash crop which depends greatly on the rainfall after cover crop termination a decrease in groundwater recharge must be considered when generalizing cover crops at the regional scale especially that of shallow groundwater which is determined by drainage from agricultural soils we demonstrated that later termination of cover crops could have a negative impact on the next cash crop even when depending on spring rainfall however an optimal solution for cover crop management could include mechanically crushing the cover crop in autumn and leaving the residues as mulch but new experiments must be carried out to verify this hypothesis studies that combine field experiments and simulation modeling are required to assess this management practice for other soil and climate conditions since the issue is also site specific due to interactions between soil type and depth and the amount and distribution of rainfall the potential of cover crop mulch to reduce soil evaporation before sowing the next cash crop could be a

10715,cover crops are a potential component of agroecological cropping systems since they may render crop rotations more sustainable they simultaneously provide multiple ecosystem services such as decreasing nitrate leaching decreasing erosion and increasing soil organic matter however cover crops increase evapotranspiration and reduce drainage which results in a potential disservice for groundwater recharge little attention has focused on management of cover crop residues after destruction or their influence on water flux dynamics particularly in dry and temperate climates the objective of our study was to analyze and quantify the impact of cover crop management on soil water content and water flux dynamics to understand the main mechanisms of system functioning we combined a two year field experiment with crop model simulations we performed the field experiment in southwestern france that compared three cover crop treatments with bare soil as the control the treatments included 1 living cover crops lasting ca 9 months from august april 2 crushing cover crops in november and leaving them as mulch on the soil and 3 plowing up cover crops in november to promote residue decomposition and the green manure effect the stics soil crop model was used to predict water fluxes that were not measured and to perform a 20 year independent simulation study based on recent climate series for the experimental site our main results indicated that cover crops 1 always reduce water drainage by 20 60 mm compared to that under bare soil and 2 could significantly reduce soil water content 0 120 cm deep for the next cash crop by a mean of 20 50 mm and up to 80 mm in dry spring conditions but early destruction could decrease this negative impact the simulations clearly showed that the interaction between climate variability i e rainfall distribution during the fallow period and cover crop management should be considered to explain the impact of inter annual variability on the water balance thus destroying cover crops mechanically in late autumn and retaining the residues as mulch could be a good compromise between the multiple services the cover crop provides during the fallow period and avoiding the negative impact on soil water availability for the next cash crop keywords water fluxes termination date evapotranspiration stics crop model 1 introduction intensive agriculture has reached a critical point particularly in europe and temperate climate zones conventional agriculture is increasingly shown to be responsible for multiple problems such as stagnating yields a decrease in soil fertility pollution of groundwater and rivers and soil erosion agriculture must adapt in response to climate change which is causing more droughts less water availability and more extreme climatic events ipcc 2013 therefore scientists farmers and policy makers urgently need to find more sustainable and resilient cropping and farming systems the use of cover crops could help cropping systems become more agroecological and diversified cover crops are sown after one cash crop is harvested and terminated before the next one is sown their residues are retained as a mulch or incorporated into the soil by plowing or shallow tillage such as disking cover crops provide a wide range of ecosystem services including reducing nitrate leaching tonitto et al 2006 providing a green manure effect tosti et al 2014 tribouillois et al 2015 improving physical properties of soil that reduce erosion or compaction chen and weil 2010 ryder and fares 2008 decreasing greenhouse gas emissions increasing carbon c storage in the soil poeplau and don 2015 tribouillois et al 2018a and controlling pests diseases and weeds couëdel et al 2018a haramoto and gallandt 2005 schipanski et al 2014 using cover crops could also help mitigate and adapt to climate change kaye and quemada 2017 tribouillois et al 2018b demonstrated the effective mitigating influence of cover crops and highlighted the challenge of finding a good compromise between certain ecosystem services they provide and the decrease in groundwater recharge they cause by increasing evapotranspiration of cropping systems cover crops influence the soil water balance and water fluxes they reduce water drainage in temperate climates meyer et al 2019 and increase transpiration by increasing leaf cover transpiration and decreasing soil evaporation nielsen et al 2015b qi et al 2011 when well established they can also increase water infiltration and reduce runoff eshel et al 2015 yu et al 2016 however the importance of these processes depends on cover crop management climate and soil type no consensus exists about the impact of cover crops on soil water availability for the next cash crop corak et al 1991 and restovich et al 2012 reported less water available with cover crops compared to that with bare soil while chen et al 2014 and daigh et al 2014 found no significant differences between these two treatments at sowing of the next crop several studies reported more water in the topsoil 0 20 cm depth blanco canqui et al 2011 wells et al 2014 likewise no consensus exists about the impact of management of cover crop residues after cover crops are terminated several studies reported an increase in soil water content swc up to 20 cm deep alliaume et al 2014 moschler et al 1967 stipešević and kladivko 2005 williams and weil 2004 observed no differences in soil moisture 20 50 cm deep between cover crop mulch and bare soil pedrosa de azevedo et al 1999 observed no significant difference in soil moisture between keeping cover crops alive during the fallow period and crushing them and leaving their residues as mulch kornecki et al 2013 observed a small difference between these two treatments with more soil moisture under the mulched cover crop it is also difficult to generalize the impact of cover crops on water balance because studies are performed in different contexts of fallow periods e g august november vs october april climate conditions and cover crop management in some studies cover crops are terminated in late winter or early spring while in others they are terminated the day before sowing the next cash crop especially when herbicide termination is used these differences are crucial to understanding cover crop impacts since multiple processes of variable intensity interact in these dynamics thus spring rainfall can recharge the soil and mask differences in swc and in the topsoil seedbed of the next cash crop even though water fluxes e g drainage evapotranspiration flow simultaneously dynamic soil crop models can be useful tools to estimate water fluxes that are difficult to measure in field experiments such as drainage evaporation and transpiration and can do so accurately over long periods these models also can simulate a wide range of cover crop management practices under several soil and climate conditions and extrapolate results of field experiments that are expensive time consuming and rare bergez et al 2010 the goal of our study was to understand and quantify impacts of cover crops and their management on water flux dynamics e g soil evaporation plant transpiration drainage and balance at the crop rotation scale two components of the water balance were a particular focus of analysis 1 drainage which governs groundwater recharge and 2 water availability for the next cash crop which determines the risk of water deficit for crop emergence and early growth we combined a two year field experiment with simulation modeling to address this issue the field experiment was performed to analyze impacts of cover crop management on dynamics of swc and cover crop biomass this field experiment was supplemented with a modeling approach using the stics soil crop model to understand and quantify the water flux dynamics drainage evaporation and transpiration not measured during the experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodological approach to determine the impact of various cover crop management practices on soil water balance during the fallow period and soil water availability for the next spring summer cash crop the following methodological approach was used 1 a two year field experiment was performed to quantify the impact of three cover crop management practices on swc in multiple soil layers during the fallow period compared to the swc under bare soil used as a control 2 the dynamics of swc and cover crop biomass measured in the experiment were used to calibrate the stics soil crop model for the mixed cover crop sown in the experiment and evaluate the model s ability to predict the experiment the objective was to simulate soil and plant dynamics sufficiently well to obtain accurate simulations of water fluxes 3 we assumed that if dynamics of swc and crop biomass were simulated accurately then those of water fluxes would also be simulated accurately after verifying satisfactory agreement between model predictions and experimental observations stics was used to predict dynamics of soil evaporation plant transpiration and water drainage processes not measured in the field and the complete water balance for the two experimental years 4 to place the weather during the two experimental years in the study site s interannual variability in climate we used the calibrated stics to simulate a 20 year climate series to better understand and generalize the impact of cover crop management on water fluxes and the complete water balance 2 2 case study site 2 2 1 climate characteristics a two year experiment was performed from 2017 to 2018 and 2018 2019 hereafter 2017 and 2018 respectively in southwestern france near toulouse 43 31 n 1 30 e the site has a temperate climate corresponding to cfb in the köppen climate classification over the past two decades 1998 2018 the site s mean 1 standard deviation sd annual temperature was 13 8 0 5 c annual potential evapotranspiration pet penman equation was 962 51 mm and annual rainfall was 655 105 mm the weather conditions from cover crop sowing in july august to termination in march april differed during the two years of the experiment fig 1 for 2017 and 2018 cumulative rainfall was 504 mm and 343 mm and cumulative pet was 437 mm and 334 mm respectively in 2017 autumn was dry and winter and spring were rainy with a high pet in the three months following the sowing of cover crops conversely in 2018 autumn and early winter were rainy with a low pet and late winter and spring were dry cumulative temperature calculated with base 0 from the day of cover crop sowing 31 july in 2017 and 28 august in 2018 until 9 april was 2920 c in 2017 and 2490 c in 2018 2 2 2 soil characteristics the two year experiment was performed at an institut national de la recherche agronomique inra experimental station on two field plots with similar soil characteristics clay loam in 2017 and loam in 2018 table 1 soil moisture at field capacity fc corresponded to the maximum observed during the experiment soil moisture at wilting point wp and bulk density bd were estimated based on soil texture classification and measurements at the experimental station jamagne et al 1977 tribouillois et al 2016 total available water capacity for plants tawc swc between fc and wp was calculated down to 120 cm deep the maximum root depth observed at this site tribouillois et al 2016 tawc was nearly the same for the two plots 152 and 164 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively the swc at fc was 347 and 328 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 3 field experiment 2 3 1 experimental design the experimental design was the same for both years four treatments and four replicates per treatment the treatments were 1 bare soil bs as a control without plant transpiration 2 cover crops mechanically terminated by crushing in autumn and left as mulch on the soil surface ccm until spring 3 cover crops mechanically terminated by crushing in autumn and buried by plowing ccp during winter when soil conditions were suitable to avoid compaction and 4 cover crops mechanically terminated by crushing in april ccl immediately before sowing the next spring summer cash crop the surface area of an elementary plot was 44 and 70 m² in 2017 and 2018 respectively the preceding cash crop for both years was durum wheat harvested in late june early july cover crop species were selected for their ability to grow rapidly during the summer and their tolerance to freezing temperatures they were also selected to favor complementary abiotic resource acquisition based on previous studies performed under the same climatic conditions couëdel et al 2018b tribouillois et al 2016 and to cover the soil during the entire fallow period due to complementary development a bispecific mixture was chosen one crucifer ethiopan mustard brassica carinata and one legume crimson clover trifolium incarnatum the crucifer grew rapidly after sowing and during autumn the legume was able to grow during winter under the mustard and could grow more rapidly in early spring maintaining soil cover and plant transpiration until april seeds were sown respectively at 3 kg ha 1 and 7 5 kg ha 1 of seeds shallow tillage was performed in both years before sowing in both years 70 mm of irrigation was applied twice after sowing to ensure homogenous emergence and establishment of cover crops to guarantee spatial homogeneity of the soil crop system weeds were controlled on bs using a herbicidal spray in october of both years 2 3 2 cover crop biomass and soil water content measurements aerial biomass mg ha 1 was sampled from a 0 5 m² area in each replicate plot of the cover crop treatments on each termination date autumn and spring mustard and clover biomass was separated and measured when present weed biomass was also measured in the cover crop treatments but it was always low dry matter was weighed after 48 h in an 80 c oven swc mm was measured once per month for 8 9 months from cover crop sowing to the following april the soil profile was sampled from 0 120 cm deep in layers 20 cm thick five samples were collected per replicate plot and then pooled by layer for each plot measurements in each of the four replicates were taken independently soil samples were weighed before and after 48 h in a 105 c oven to measure gravimetric soil moisture cg water g 1 soil 2 4 simulation approach 2 4 1 model overview we used the soil crop model stics brisson et al 2003 which simulates daily crop growth light water c and nitrogen n balances based on soil climate crop species and agricultural management a tipping bucket approach is used to model the soil which is divided into five layers with specific characteristics such as bd as well as swc at fc and wp the water balance was simulated daily by adding soil water supply and subtracting plant transpiration and soil evaporation brisson et al 2009 stics was evaluated as accurate for a wide range of agro environmental contexts in france for plant water and n outputs for bare soil and many types of cash crops brisson et al 2003 2009 stics was also used to simulate cover crops and analyze water c and n balances and the associated ecosystem services tribouillois et al 2018a stics was also successfully evaluated for water drainage beaudoin et al 2008 constantin et al 2012 2 4 2 model initialization and calibration on site 2 4 2 1 soil parameterization and initialization there was no calibration done on bare soil two soils were parameterized separately to simulate each year of the field experiment for model evaluation the swc measured at the beginning of the experiment for each treatment was used and the soil moisture at fc of each layer was adjusted for each treatment to correspond as closely as possible to field observations to initialize each soil layer in the model for simulations the mean swc and soil mineral n measured in the four treatments at the beginning of the experiment was used for each treatment table 1 2 4 2 2 crop calibration stics has been calibrated for a wide range of species used as cover crops such as mustard rapeseed radish ryegrass oat pea vetch and clover constantin et al 2012 tribouillois et al 2018b however no parameterization for a mixture of species was available to simulate the field experiment accurately we parameterized stics for the mustard clover cover crop mixture the objective was to simulate as accurately as possible the main processes governing water balance dynamics such as cover crop development biomass growth changes in soil moisture over time in each soil layer and total swc starting with parameters already calibrated for rapeseed the crop most similar to ethiopian mustard and crimson clover we optimized three parameters for cover crop development n2 fixation for clover and cover crop water requirements to generate the most accurate joint predictions of the dynamics of biomass and swc in each layer and in total for both experimental years mathematical optimization was based on the method developed by wallach et al 2011 using the simplex algorithm which is available with the stics model software java interface https www6 paca inra fr stics fr 2 4 3 water flux simulations of the field experiment after calibration model predictions of water drainage soil evaporation and plant transpiration were available for each of the four treatments for each year of the field experiment table 2 they were used to calculate total water balance and quantify the fluxes for the 2017 experimental year simulations began 28 july and ended 28 march for the 2018 experimental year simulations began on 1 august and ended on 5 april since crimson clover was observed to regrow in both years after being crushed in the ccm treatment the model was calibrated to simulate this regrowth as well using only crimson clover parameters as the crop in a second simulation step 2 4 4 simulation of water fluxes over 20 years to evaluate the impact of cover crops on soil water variables over a long time series a 20 year simulation was performed using a climate series from 1999 to 2018 from an inra weather station installed at the study site the soil was parameterized and initialized with the field data measured in 2017 then we run simulations twice once with dates of technical operations of 2017 crop management for all 20 years and once with dates of the technical operations of 2018 crop management for all 20 years since each year had different field operation dates table 2 the simulations started on 1 august and finished on 1 april for each year of the 20 year simulation predicted swc and cumulative water drainage on 1 april were also recorded as in the two year experiment potential regrowth of crimson clover after being crushed in the ccm treatment was simulated 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using r software r core team 2018 2 5 1 stics evaluation and prediction 2 5 1 1 model evaluation criteria simulations were performed using the model calibrated for the six cover crop treatments 3 treatments 2 experimental years three statistical criteria were used to evaluate the quality of agreement between observed and simulated variables after calibrating stics for the cover

criteria provide a good overview of model performance md and rrmse indicate systematic bias and the dispersal of model simulations compared to observations respectively the lower their value the better is the model prediction ef which measures agreement between simulations and observations varies from 1 perfect prediction to a negative value indicates that the mean of observations is a better predictor than the model 2 5 1 2 stics prediction quality to assess the ability of stics to simulate biomass each soil layer s moisture and total swc the relative root mean square error of prediction rrmsep was calculated using cross validation and a leave one out method wallach 2014 the six cover crop treatments were separated into two subsamples one containing five treatments to estimate crop parameters and the other containing the sixth treatment to evaluate the prediction quality of stics compared to observed data this procedure was applied six times to assess the prediction quality of

field experiment and 20 year simulations 2 5 2 1 field experiment statistical analyses of swc and soil moisture for each layer in the experiment were performed based on the dataset and after testing the homogeneity of the variables a non parametric kruskall wallis test was used to test the impact of the cover crop management practices on the experimental data a non parametric wilcoxon test was used to compare each pair of cover crop treatments for all analyses differences among treatments were considered significant at p 0 05 2 5 2 2 twenty year simulations statistical analyses of swc total and in the 0 10 cm layer and the difference in drainage predicted in the 20 year simulations were performed a non parametric kruskall wallis test was used to test the impact of the cover crop management practices on the simulated data a non parametric wilcoxon test was used to compare each pair of cover crop treatments for all analyses differences among treatments were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 field experiment 3 1 1 aerial biomass of cover crop mixtures on the date of autumn termination for ccm and ccp cover crops reached a mean aerial biomass of 4 2 mg ha 1 76 mustard 24 clover in 2017 and 3 5 mg ha 1 83 mustard 17 clover in 2018 fig 2 afterwards the clover regrew in ccm reaching a biomass of 3 6 and 3 1 mg ha 1 at the end of the 2017 and 2018 experimental years early spring respectively in contrast for ccl at the end of the experimental years aerial biomass was 7 5 mg ha 1 35 mustard 65 clover in 2017 and 8 9 mg ha 1 88 mustard 12 clover in 2018 these results illustrate the temporal complementarity of the two species growth which covered the soil throughout the fallow period ethiopian mustard develops very quickly in late summer and autumn while clover growth is particularly important in winter and spring 3 1 2 soil water measurements during the fallow period soil water profiles during the fallow period varied by treatment in both years of the experiment showing no similar trends or final results figs 3 a b from july august to november december cover crops had significantly less water under them in the soil profile in 2017 than bs did but they showed no difference compared to bs in 2018 for both years of the experiment cover crops and bs showed no difference in swc during winter from february to march april swc differed significantly between ccl or ccm and bs or ccp in the layers 20 60 cm deep in 2017 and 2018 figs 3a b the change in swc depended on the yearly rainfall distribution fig 4 in 2017 october and november were dry each receiving less than 50 mm of rainfall during these months measured swc differed significantly between bs and the cover crop treatments in december the difference was ca 50 mm due to cover crops having higher actual evapotranspiration aet than bs december and january each received ca 200 mm of rainfall which caused soils of all treatments to reach fc with lower rainfall in march a significant difference in swc was observed between bs and ccp which had no vegetation and ccl and ccm which did fig 4a in 2018 rainfall distribution was more regular than that in 2017 from august february 50 100 mm of rain fell each month which explains the lack of a significant difference among the four treatments during this period february and march were dry but resulted in non significant differences in swc in the upper layers among the four treatments fig 4b 3 2 stics calibration and evaluation 3 2 1 calibration of the cover crop mixture and quality of calibration of stics for the two years of the experiment stics simulated aerial cover crop biomass well ef was high 0 82 with a non significant low md of 0 2 mg ha 1 of biomass and rrmse was only 18 2 stics also predicted swc well with a high ef 0 87 no significant md 1 mm of water and a low rrmse 4 7 table 3 fig 5 supplementary materials figs s1 s8 stics predicted water distribution in the soil well with md less than 1 cg g 1 and ef always greater than 0 4 for the five soil layers dynamics of the upper layers subject to soil evaporation and root uptake of water were simulated accurately as indicated by an rrmse of 13 8 and 9 1 for the 0 20 and 20 40 cm layers respectively the rrmse for the three deepest layers was low 9 the dynamics of swc and the soil water profile were satisfactory supplementary materials figs s1 s8 swc differed between bs and cover crops somewhat more in the simulations than in the experiment however simulation results lay within 1 sd of the observations indicating that model error was in the same range as the variability in the field measurements 3 2 2 evaluation of the predictive quality using cross validation to assess the predictive quality of stics for simulating biomass soil moisture in each layer and swc provided satisfactory results indicating an acceptable accuracy of the simulations the rrmsep of soil moisture were ca 15 for soil layers 0 40 cm deep and less than 10 for the deeper layers the rrmsep of cover crop biomass were less than 10 and those of swc were ca 5 table 3 3 3 simulated water fluxes like the measurements predicted swc was lower for the three cover crop treatments than for bs from late august until the date when fc was reached after winter rainfall fig 6 in 2018 the swc of cover crops treatments was no more than 15 mm less than that of bs swc was 60 mm lower from 50 days after sowing das to 150 das in 2017 while it was 10 mm lower from 20 to 50 das in 2018 differences in swc among the three cover crop treatments depended on the field experiment no difference in swc was observed between the three cover crop treatments in 2017 while several differences were measured and simulated in 2018 from 150 das difference in swc between ccm and ccl first appeared at 150 das resulting in swc 18 mm higher for ccm than ccl in late march at the same time in march the swc for ccp was the same as that for bs and 70 mm higher than that for ccm table 3 from 170 das to the end of the experiment the difference in simulated swc increased between bs and ccp and between ccl and ccm which was similar to the measurements simulated swc decreased more for ccl and ccm than for bs and ccp the maximum difference in simulated swc at the end of experiment was 89 mm which was similar to the difference measured between ccl and bs fig 6 simulated cumulative water fluxes for the entire experiment are summarized in table 4 for both years of the experiment higher aet was simulated for all cover crop treatments than for bs due to an increase in leaf transpiration and a concomitant decrease in soil evaporation due to plant cover in 2017 the three cover crop treatments had similar simulated evapotranspiration which was 70 mm higher than bs evaporation the relative amounts of soil evaporation and plant transpiration differed among the cover crop treatments ccp had 77 mm less simulated transpiration than ccm and 87 mm less than ccl which followed the trends for dynamics and amount of aerial biomass the difference in soil evaporation was inversely proportional to transpiration in 2018 bs had simulated evapotranspiration 36 93 and 111 mm lower than those for ccp ccm and ccl respectively the relative amounts of simulated evaporation and transpiration were similar in both years of the experiment for a given treatment table 3 consequently cover crops reduced predicted water drainage by the same degree regardless of their management in a given year compared to bs reductions of ca 60 and 15 mm were predicted in 2017 and 2018 respectively water drained 14 and 10 days later under cover crop treatments than under bs in 2017 and 2018 respectively indicating a delay in filling in the soil water reserve due to higher aet 3 4 water balance in the 20 year simulations for the two 20 year simulations cover crop biomass simulated for ccl ranged from 1 9 8 0 ha 1 mean 5 0 mg ha 1 indicating that the biomass measured during the experiment corresponded to the largest range of biomass that could be expected at this site simulated cover crop biomass for ccm and ccp at autumn termination ranged from 2 2 to 6 6 mg ha 1 mean 4 1 mg ha 1 indicating that the biomass measured during the experiment lay around the mean biomass that could be expected at this site the clover regrowth simulated for ccm ranged from 1 0 to 3 5 mg ha 1 mean 2 0 mg ha 1 indicating that its regrowth measured during the experiment corresponded to the largest range of regrowth that could be expected at this site over 20 years the swc simulated on 1 april for ccl and ccm differed significantly from that for bs fig 7 confirming the potential impact of cover crops on the water supply of the next cash crop in certain years simulated mean swc was 50 mm between ccl and bs significantly different and 60 mm between ccm and bs corresponding to the range simulated for the experiment simulated mean swc of ccp did not differ significantly from that of bs over the 20 years regardless the management year used 2017 or 2018 and was often near fc for the 2017 management mean swc of ccl differed significantly from those of ccp and bs the impact of ccm depended greatly on the climate year with high variability and a mean reduction compared to bs of ca 60 mm for the 2018 management the difference in swc between bs and ccm was ca 20 mm differences in simulated swc were compared for 1 april bs and ccp reached fc or nearly so with little variability among climate years simulated swc varied greatly for ccl and ccm for 25 of climate years it was less than 55 of tawc only three of the 20 simulated years showed no difference in swc between treatments these years were particularly rainy in winter and spring which frequently increased swc to fc the influence of sowing and termination dates was large with the difference between swc for ccl and ccmm inverted depending on the year of cover crop management simulated median swc for ccm was ca 25 mm higher and ca 15 mm lower than that for ccl for 2017 and 2018 management respectively however these differences were not statistically significant over the 20 simulated years differences in simulated swc were not due to differences in soil moisture of the 0 20 cm layer which did not differ significantly on 1 april among the bs ccp ccm and ccl treatments 14 8 14 8 15 4 and 15 0 cg g 1 respectively swc simulated over the 20 years differed from that measured in 2017 during which all treatments reached fc and in 2018 during which cover crops reduced swc in spring to a degree found at the higher end of the range simulated over the 20 years water drainage for bs ranged from 0 235 mm for the 20 simulated years three years had no drainage for both the 2017 and 2018 management years mean and median simulated drainage was 67 mm and 48 mm respectively which correspond to low drainage at that site this indicates that the drainage observed during the experiment was among the highest 25 in 20 years due to the high winter rainfall the mean difference in drainage of the cover crop treatments compared to bs was 45 mm and 20 mm for the 2017 and 2018 management years respectively fig 7 these differences represented a reduction in total drainage of ca 50 and 25 for 2017 and 2018 respectively for 25 of the 20 years no drainage was simulated for the three cover crop treatments unlike under bs regardless of the management year used over 20 years with the 2018 management ccm had three years with the same or slightly higher drainage than bs mean difference 4 mm drainage under cover crops treatments had greater variability than that under bs in some years simulated drainage started on the same date under the cover crops and bs due to a rainy autumn while in others drainage started up to 3 months later under cover crops than under bs especially after a dry autumn however the median difference for the beginning of drainage between bs and the cover crop treatments was 14 days which corresponds roughly to that observed in the experiment like in the experiment bs had significantly lower simulated aet over the 20 years than the cover crop treatments due to the lack of transpiration the difference in aet between the three cover crop treatments was small but significant for 2017 management but not significant for 2018 management compared to the other fluxes aet varied the least over the 20 years 4 discussion 4 1 influence of cover crops on soil water content for the next cash crop depends on their termination date although the two years of the field experiment had similar cover crop biomass impact of biomass on the soil water profile differed over time from sowing to autumn termination in 2017 water depletion was observed along the profile while in 2018 no difference in the water profile was observed among the treatments differences in rainfall dynamics explain why the four treatments showed no differences in the water profile in 2017 s spring while in 2018 there was less water in the soil layers 20 60 cm deep under ccl and ccm some studies indicated that cover crops did not influence swc in spring as in 2017 in our field experiment daigh et al 2014 while others reported a decrease in swc due to low rainfall in spring as in 2018 in our field experiment corak et al 1991 restovich et al 2012 blanco canqui et al 2011 suggested that soil moisture increases from 0 20 cm deep but we found no difference among the treatments over the experiments or the 20 year simulations little rainfall before the last sampling date could have removed differences in soil moisture from 0 20 cm which could explain why a difference was observed only from 20 60 cm the impact of cover crops on the yield of the following cash crop differs in the literature some studies reported a decrease in yield nielsen et al 2015b while others reported no negative impacts eshel et al 2015 in some cases yield can increase after a cover crop especially when legumes are used tonitto et al 2006 however these studies did not always identify why yield differed yield may decrease due to water stress at the beginning of the cash crop but it can also be caused by allelopathic effects kessavalou and walters 1997 or a decrease in soil n content compared to that of bare soil tonitto et al 2006 in both years of the experiment ccl and ccm had lower swc in soil layers 20 60 cm deep than bs and ccp at the end of the experiment which suggests that late termination of a cover crop decreases swc due to spring transpiration if spring rainfall is too low to make up for this difference growth of the next cash crop could decrease krueger et al 2011 highlighted the importance of the termination date on reducing the negative impact of cover crops on yields the 20 year simulations showed that cover crops reduced both mean and median swc simulated on 1 april and that spring rainfall was not sufficient to make up for the cover crops lower swc compared to that of bs indeed the effective rainfall which can indicate refilling of soil water was positive for only five of the 20 years and of these five the soil was refilled up to fc in only two of them swc of ccp did not differ significantly from that of bs which indicates that sufficient rain fell from termination to early spring to compensate for cover crop transpiration this indicates that early cover crop termination avoids large differences in swc in spring between cover crops and bare soil in temperate and mediterranean climates as suggested by alonso ayuso et al 2014 early termination could be a good way to avoid negative impact such as pre emptive competition for water on the next crop termination dates between november and april could be a good compromise to avoid a negative impact on swc and also could reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion better and maximize soil c storage terminating cover crops before winter could be the best solution in dry regions where water is scarce since we tested only two termination dates per year however we could not determine an optimal termination date this should be investigated in the future such as in a site specific simulation study 4 2 sowing date of cover crops is key to minimizing reduction in drainage in a recent meta analysis meyer et al 2019 reported that cover crops reduce water drainage by a mean of 27 mm compared to that under bare soil but the reduction varies widely among studies depending on the year and regardless of the cover crop management our field experiment indicated that cover crops reduce drainage by 20 60 mm which lies in the range found in the meta analysis early cover crop termination in autumn or early winter did not influence the reduction greatly since the same drainage reduction was observed regardless of the termination date or residue management in the two years of the experiment the 20 year simulations confirmed results of the experiment showing no difference in drainage reduction among the cover crop treatments for a given sowing date and year the range of annual reduction in predicted drainage over the 20 years 0 80 mm was consistent with the variability in results reported in the literature and can explain this variability since the impact on drainage depends on the interaction between weather conditions and cover crop management these differences can represent a reduction of nearly 50 in years with high drainage and a complete lack of drainage in drier years in our experiment the decrease in drainage due to cover crops was one third the amount with later sowing late august than early sowing late july this indicates that sowing date could be a key point to consider when analyzing the impact of cover crops on drainage as demonstrated by justes 2017 4 3 no direct relationship observed between cover crop biomass and impact on water fluxes above a certain level compared to bare soil cover crops increase evapotranspiration by increasing transpiration even though their cover decreases soil evaporation in the experiment cover crops increased evapotranspiration by a mean of 30 this result agrees with the literature nielsen et al 2015a qi and helmers 2010 in which several studies mention the relationship between biomass and transpiration suyker and verma 2009 tolk and howell 2009 however no significant relationship was observed between cover crop biomass and evapotranspiration or drainage in either year of the experiment tribouillois et al 2018 reported a correlation between cover crop biomass and an evapotranspiration they assessed cover crops with lower biomass 0 5 2 5 mg ha 1 yr 1 than we did 8 mg ha 1 crops transpiration is linked with the biomass through the leaf area index lai and it is assumed that above a certain level of lai transpiration does not increase in proportion and remains constant from a certain level kang et al 2003 kristensen 1974 this could explain why we did observed no correlation between cover crop biomass and evapotranspiration or drainage tribouillois et al 2018b also reported a strong negative correlation between the mean decrease in annual drainage and the mean increase in annual evapotranspiration due to cover crops this latter result was found in the 2017 experimental year however in 2018 no significant correlation was observed between the difference in drainage and evapotranspiration the increase in evapotranspiration influenced not only drainage which decreased only slightly but also the soil water content in spring which was much lower for ccl and ccm than for bs this could have been due to differences in rainfall distribution during the fallow period 4 4 study boundaries 4 4 1 field experiment and simulations irrigation was applied after sowing the cover crop to ensure homogenous emergence and establishment irrigation in summer which is a dry period in southwestern france could explain the large amount of biomass observed since strong growth of juvenile stages favored crop establishment since we included irrigation in the 20 year simulations stics also predicted large amounts of biomass however farmers in the region currently do not irrigate cover crops consequently water stress could occur with an early sowing date such as july or early august in our conditions which could result in lower biomass the impact of cover crops on the water balance could change since the climate in southwestern france is dry in summer and august rain is not always sufficient to ensure adequate emergence and development of cover crops to produce a sufficient amount of biomass to evaluate the impact of irrigation we also performed the 20 year simulations without irrigation the results not shown indicated that drainage was slightly lower but not significantly so predictions for the impact on swc and the difference in drainage compared to bs were similar with or without irrigation without irrigation the cover crop did not develop in some dry summers or developed later in such cases cover crops would not influence water fluxes the field experiment was performed on two similar soils at the same inra experimental station the soils had high swc due to their great depth more investigation is required to determine the importance of cover crops on shallow soils on shallow soils cover crops could have less impact on drainage due to less water lost via transpiration because their roots would not extend as deep in 2018 soil texture in the deeper layers of the field plot varied greatly even over short distances which could have masked significant differences in swc due to cover crop treatments as predicted in the 20 year simulation this highlights the ability of the strong complementarity between field experiments and modeling to help understand and quantify dynamic interactions between treatments and weather conditions 4 4 2 stics parameterization and initialization an initial step in our study was to evaluate the ability of stics to predict aerial biomass of cover crops and swc over time for the entire fallow period to obtain satisfactory water flux simulations biomass and swc were simulated sufficiently well for both years and were similar to or even an improvement on results of previous studies brisson et al 2002 coucheney et al 2015 stics already used successfully to simulate drainage under cover crops constantin et al 2012 tribouillois et al 2016 remained accurate in our study we can therefore assume that stics simulated the fluxes under different management practices sufficiently well nonetheless we could have improved calibration of the cover crop mixture had we measured dynamics of the leaf area index since leaf area governs transpiration swc predictions would have been more accurate if soil water content had been initialized for each treatment based on measurements however we initialized the soil with the mean swc measured in the four treatments to ensure that differences in simulated water fluxes would be due only to the management practices not to different initial states caused by natural field variability consequently stics slightly overestimated the difference in swc between ccl and bs in 2018 and thus could have slightly overestimated the difference in drainage and evapotranspiration between cover crops and bs nevertheless the simulated swc always lay within 1 sd of observed values which indicates that overestimates were consistent with experimental results and that predicted differences in water balance among treatments were acceptable 4 5 cover crop residues left as mulch can reduce soil evaporation and thus actual evapotranspiration one objective of our study was to analyze the impact of cover crop residues left as mulch via mechanical crushing after the first autumn termination ccm on the water balance since no reference was available in the literature despite this practice s great benefit for farmers although not planned the crimson clover regrew after crushing and produced a large amount of biomass consequently ccm caused changes in the water balance similar to those of ccl cover crop mulch can increase swc in the surface layer by reducing evaporation alliaume et al 2014 moschler et al 1967 stipešević and kladivko 2005 but we did not observe this effect for clover regrowth in the field experiment it is well known that residue mulch decreases evaporation evapotranspiration under a cover crop terminated early and left as mulch could result in the same cumulative aet as that under bare soil since compared a bare soil aet would be higher during cover crop growth and soil evaporation would be lower after cover crop termination thus a cover crop terminated early and left as mulch could reduce drainage less than a cover crop terminated late it could also increase soil moisture on the surface i e 0 10 cm and avoid an overly dry seedbed when the next cash crop is sown however it could also make the soil too wet for sowing and cause bearing capacity problems this demonstrates that cover crop management especially the termination date is important for cover crops to provide a sufficient level of services such as capturing nitrate or improving soil physical properties alonso ayuso et al 2018 in dry areas where water is scarce cover crops can reduce drainage and shallow groundwater recharge and we hypothesis that mulching could be a good practice to maintain the services expected from cover crops resulting in a good comprise between services and disservices thus this practice could encourage green manure or catch crop services and avoid disservices by minimizing negative impacts on water balance fluxes due to pre emptive competition for water which reduces drainage and water availability for the next cash crop 5 conclusion the choice of cover crop termination date and management of cover crop residues could be a way to benefit from all the services they provide such as the green manure effect or increasing soil physical properties in agroecological systems while reducing their potential negative effects on the water balance our study highlighted the impact of different cover crop management practices and the variability of their water balance compared to that of bare soil cover crops clearly increase aet and reduce drainage but do not always reduce swc at sowing of the next cash crop which depends greatly on the rainfall after cover crop termination a decrease in groundwater recharge must be considered when generalizing cover crops at the regional scale especially that of shallow groundwater which is determined by drainage from agricultural soils we demonstrated that later termination of cover crops could have a negative impact on the next cash crop even when depending on spring rainfall however an optimal solution for cover crop management could include mechanically crushing the cover crop in autumn and leaving the residues as mulch but new experiments must be carried out to verify this hypothesis studies that combine field experiments and simulation modeling are required to assess this management practice for other soil and climate conditions since the issue is also site specific due to interactions between soil type and depth and the amount and distribution of rainfall the potential of cover crop mulch to reduce soil evaporation before sowing the next cash crop could be a good compromise between improving cover crop services and decreasing negative impact on the water balance and its resulting consequences declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10716,water scarcity climate variability and continuing growth in water demand have put severe pressure on high quality freshwater sources this challenge exacts the necessity to explore alternative water sources for agricultural irrigation the objective of this study was to implement the integrated geospatial multi criteria decision analysis mcda with the analytical hierarchy process ahp to evaluate the potentiality of reclaimed water use for agricultural irrigation in california five evaluation criteria included in this study were agricultural land crop type climate conditions water policies irrigation status and proximity to wastewater treatment plants wwtps respectively the suitability maps for reclaimed water use were generated for three cases in terms of accessibility to wwtps their discharge volume and appropriate treatment processes respectively in addition a composite suitability map was produced using the hybrid model considering all three cases together results from this study led to a better understanding of sustainable reclaimed water use for crop irrigation at a regional level it provided supporting evidence of the applicability of the gis mcda method integrated with ahp technique for a larger geographical scale with a diverse crop pattern this study established the importance of using both knowledge based and data driven criteria and sub criteria in the decision framework the results also highlighted how the spatial distribution of suitable areas for reclaimed water reuse is closely linked to the agricultural areas keywords multi criteria decision analysis mcda spatial analysis reclaimed water wastewater treatment plant wwtp crop irrigation 1 introduction the agricultural sector is the largest global consumer of freshwater which accounts for about 70 percent of total freshwater consumption fao 2017 uncertain water availability climate variability and continuing growth in water demand have put severe pressure on high quality freshwater sources for irrigation fant et al 2016 gohar and cashman 2016 taylor et al 2013 the growing global water shortage has contributed to agricultural production reduction which adversely impacts the food security and severely affect the regional economy farm value and socioeconomic development anane et al 2012 montgomery et al 2016 the water scarcity exacts a necessity to explore additional or alternative water sources to sustain food production in various countries across the world especially in water scarce environments alternative water resources may include reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants wwtps return flows of irrigation water desalination of seawater and highly brackish groundwater and stormwater harvesting chen et al 2016 hurlimann and dolnicar 2011 rygaard et al 2011 many countries like australia chile china cyprus india israel italy and mexico have been using some of their treated or partially treated wastewater for crop production angelakis et al 2018 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 jimenez and asano 2008 keraita et al 2008 in the u s growing agricultural water reuse projects e g in florida and california also provides evidence that reclaimed water can be effectively used for agricultural irrigation bischel et al 2011 exall et al 2008 worldwide most of the water reuse projects were driven by the immediate needs to increase the water supply in agriculture to overcome the crisis of recurrent and long term drought conditions bixio et al 2008 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water provides multiple benefits including reducing pressure on freshwater jaramillo and restrepo 2017 rahman et al 2016 nutrients management and recovery hanjra et al 2015 miller robbie et al 2017 and higher reliability due to constant yields chen et al 2012 rahman et al 2016 however wastewater needs to be adequately treated to be reused in agricultural irrigation especially for food crops due to potential health and environmental risks other limiting factors that need to be considered in reclaimed water use in agricultural irrigation include technical feasibility e g closeness to wwtps economic factors e g ability to meet the water demand social and environmental factors e g public acceptance and consumer response and regulatory considerations e g compliance with treatment requirements ackerman 2012 bixio et al 2008 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 saliba et al 2018 urkiaga et al 2008 as a result before the implementation of water reuse projects it is very important for the policy makers and water resource managers to have the adequate information regarding the availability quantity and quality and economic viability cost benefit analysis of the reclaimed water sources for irrigation of different type of crops food non food crops thus multiple quantitative and qualitative decision criteria should be considered to plan for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation of note is some of these criteria cannot be easily quantified in numbers or expressed into monetary values kiker et al 2005 in addition the assessment of irrigated agricultural land suitability for irrigation with reclaimed water is a spatial decision problem which involves spatially variable decision criteria this complex geospatial problem leads to the necessity of using geographical information systems gis combined with multi criteria decision analysis mcda although this approach is more subjective it has the advantage of incorporating the expertise and knowledge of the decision makers in the modeling process harris et al 2001 rikalovic et al 2014 saarikoski et al 2016 the gis mcda solves the complex decision making problem based on evidence of varying quantity quality guidelines and experts opinions and considering a wide range of decision criteria and constraints akıncı et al 2013 assefa et al 2018 montgomery et al 2016 of note is any implemented project dynamically changes the

selection depends on its sustainability characteristics peldschus et al 2010 and available technologies to use sivilevicius et al 2008 zavadskas et al 2013c stakeholders in the modern world should find a reliable solution considering the effective investments and both global and local perspective of the outcomes zolfani et al 2013 worldwide some researchers have applied the mcda framework for the evaluation of feasible wastewater reuse for irrigation ganoulis 2003 kalavrouziotis et al 2011 lee et al 2018 woltersdorf et al 2018 however very few scientific papers demonstrated the use of integrated gis mcda approach for the agricultural land suitability assessment for irrigation with reclaimed water aldababseh et al 2018 anane et al 2012 neji and turki 2015 most of these studies assess the feasibility of reclaimed water use in agricultural land at a small scale e g only including few farms and a limited number of treatment plants for instance anane et al 2012 considered only two wwtps to rank the suitable sites for irrigation with reclaimed water while neji and turki 2015 evaluated the alternatives for three wwtps in tunisia in another study aldababseh et al 2018 assessed an ex ante land suitability analysis for the irrigation of seven critical crops with desalinated and treated wastewater in the emirate of abu dhabi to the best of our knowledge there is no study that considers the spatial distribution of diverse crop patterns with a combination of a large number of wwtps and their proximity capacity and different treatment processes the aim of this study was to develop a decision support system for agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water from wwtps using an integrated framework of gis mcda the main objectives of this study were to 1 develop a gis mcda framework to identify the agricultural hotspots that are best suited for irrigation with reclaimed water 2 evaluate the feasibility of reclaimed water use for irrigation considering proximity to wwtps discharge volume and treatment processes respectively and 3 produce a composite map using a hybrid model identifying the hotspots combining all of the decision criteria in addition a sensitivity analysis has been carried out with variable criteria weights to better explain the consistency of the best solution given by the mcda 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area for this research was the entire state of california fig 1 california is the leading state in agricultural production in the united states it has the highest irrigated farm acreage and uses about one fourth of the total irrigation water in the united states johnson and cody 2015 the central valley of california is known as its productive agricultural heartland due to its well suited condition for vegetables and fruit cultivation four counties of tulare kern fresno and merced in central valley and monterey in central coastal region of california are ranked as the leading agricultural counties in the nation about 77 100 irrigated croplands generated an overall agricultural production value of 42 6 billion in 2017 usda ers 2018 the state produces over 400 different commodities including over one third of the country s vegetables and two thirds of its fruits and nuts according to usda national agricultural statistics services nass 26 of agricultural lands were orchards 52 were cultivated alfalfa hay pastureland rice corn and cotton and 11 were vegetables in 2017 the demand for alternative water supply sources is increasing among the farmers in california as a way to continually meet their irrigation demands in the face of growing water scarcity schulte 2016 the ongoing growth provides evidence that the demand for alternative water sources such as reclaimed water to irrigate the agricultural lands is increasing bischel et al 2011 schulte 2016 according to usgs estimation in 2015 california used 289 4 million gallons of reclaimed water per day mgd for irrigation including 217 7 mgd for crop irrigation dieter et al 2018 however only in california approximately 2 210 mgd of wastewater is being treated including all publicly non publicly and federally owned wwtps epa 2019 thus there is still great potential for reclaimed water use in agriculture that has not been fully exploited 2 2 multi criteria decision analysis mcda in the mcda framework the weights or scores are defined to check the performance of alternative decision options against multiple criteria that are measured in different and sometimes in incommensurable units i e a combination of quantitative and qualitative criteria in general the required inputs in the mcda process include scores across several dimensions associated with different alternatives and outcomes and weights relating to tradeoffs across these dimensions huang et al 2011 the total value score for an alternative is calculated as a linear weighted sum of its scores across several criteria eq 1 1 v i j 1 n w j x i j where v i is the overall score for alternative i w j denotes the relative weight for criteria j and x i j is the priority of alternative i with respect to criteria j numerous techniques have been developed to define the weights for criteria and combine them to solve the complex decision making process different mcda methods have different robustness when assessing choices in specific problems zavadskas et al 2013a 2013b major mcda approaches include multi criteria value functions methods such as weighted summation hajkowicz and higgins 2008 outranking approaches such as promethee brans and vincke 1985 vetschera and de almeida 2012 and electre kumar et al 2016 roy 1978 distance to ideal point methods such as topsis dong et al 2016 yoon 1980 and compromising programming cp ballestero and romero 1996 martin et al 2017 soft computing concept such as logic scoring of preference lsp dujmovi c 1996 montgomery et al 2016 pairwise comparison methods such as analytical hiearchy process ahp hou et al 2016 saaty 1978 prioritization technique such as dematel azarnivand and chitsaz 2015 fontela and gabus 1976 fuzzy set analysis kosko 1992 mirajkar and patel 2016 mathematical approach like linear programming lp srinivasan and shocker 1973 and compromising ranking method such as vikor opricovic 1998 etc in the modern era stakeholders may need newer mcda methods keshavarz ghorabaee et al 2016 or integrated mcda approaches bagocius et al 2014 to solve complicated problems ruzgys et al 2014 xu 2001 for instance improved ahp method like analytical network process anp aminu et al 2017 saaty 1996 integrated ranking method such as superiority and inferiority ranking sir xu 2001 fuzzy ahp anagnostopoulos and petalas 2011 buckley 1985 elshaikh et al 2018 fuzzy anp mikhailov and singh 2003 razavitoosi and samani 2016 and fuzzy topsis chen 2000 kim et al 2013 are used to solve the complex problem ahp method which was first introduced by saaty in 1978 is still a widely used mcda method saaty 1978 1979 1980 ahp gets its popularity due to its good understandability ease of implementation and interpretability of the results by both modelers and decision makers it allows the researchers to represent a full range of human decision making logic considering both qualitative and quantitative data and combines them by decomposing complex problems into systematic hierarchies to rank alternatives based on different criteria assefa et al 2018 opricovic 2011 woltersdorf et al 2018 for this reason several studies have applied the ahp for solving a wide variety of water and environmental problems including water resource allocation zhang et al 2019 selection grum et al 2016 feasibility evaluation cozzi et al 2015 resolving conflicts mainuddin et al 1997 and priority and ranking hassani et al 2019 of note is well backgrounded goals are essential to define the problem and should be included in any decision making model turskis et al 2019d therefore when stakeholders use mcda methods one of the critical tasks is to determine the importance of criteria the ahp method is the most widely used method for this purpose zavadskas et al 2016 in addition researchers have developed other techniques to assign criteria weights based on their importance eckenrode 1965 delbecq and vandeven 1971 kersuliene et al 2010 linstone and turoff 2002 turskis et al 2019b in the mcda process the criteria and weighting can be modelled as crisp as well as fuzzy or grey turskis et al 2019a c this may vary based on the nature of the criteria or the modelling preference in case of land allocation problems cropland and forest land could be assigned with crisp boundaries either one or the other or fuzzy boundaries with one or more classification levels where the land is partially forest and partially cropland thus in the decision making process it is sometimes difficult to choose between alternatives with multiple attributes ahp has the ability to simplify the complicated decision making process by using pairwise comparison technique and reducing the number of comparisons and confirming consistency by comparing objects with multiple attributes the pairwise comparison technique provides a powerful simplified and relatively unbiased ranking criterion assefa et al 2018 saaty 1980 worqlul et al 2015 few of the mcda techniques were integrated with gis to assess the land suitability and allocation for water resource management table 1 where ahp is the most applied to solve the complex decision making processes regarding water reuse for irrigation in the presented study the process of a suitability assessment and identifying hotspots for reclaimed water use involves two main steps fig 3 in the first step the influential geospatial decision criteria and sub criteria were evaluated then a gis mcda model was developed using the ahp technique to solve the spatial decision making process the mcda method was implemented using geospatial data and arcgis 10 1 software esri 2012 in gis mcda a spatial decision alternative is defined as a single raster of a specified size or a combination of multiple rasters the following subsections describe the procedure for the development of gis mcda in this research in more details 2 2 1 defining criteria and sub criteria decision criteria and sub criteria are labeled as either factors or constraints a factor is a criterion that amplifies or reduces the suitability of a specific alternative for the activity under consideration while a constraint serves to limit the alternatives under consideration based on the existing literature data availability and expert opinions five main influential criteria as factors and one as a constraint were selected for the assessment of the suitable agricultural land for the reclaimed water irrigation the five selected criteria are 1 land cover crop type 2 reclaimed water sources 3 irrigation status 4 groundwater priority and 5 climate each of these criteria is individually evaluated using different sub criteria sub criteria were processed separately depending on their discrete and continuous form the detailed rationale behind the selection of these criteria and sub criteria are explained hereafter 2 2 1 1 land cover crop type according to nass cdl 2017 the total harvested area in california was 46 741 km2 with a planted area of 16 591 7 km2 in 2017 to assess the suitable agricultural land for reclaimed water irrigation all of the agricultural lands were included in the land cover criteria the main concern regarding reclaimed water use is the effect on the human and health environmental thus california s water recycling criteria title 22 was followed strictly during the classification nwri 2012 schulte 2016 sheikh 2015 the detailed information can be found from title 22 of the california code of regulations division 4 chapter 3 water recycling criteria but briefly according to the regulations both nonfood crops processed food crops and food crops can be irrigated with reclaimed water depending on the treatment process table 1 therefore all the existing crops within california were categorized into six classes as alternatives based on the reclaimed water sensitivity and tolerance non food crops fiber non food crops fodder non food crops oil crops food crops grains and legumes food crops orchards and food crops vegetables 2 2 1 2 reclaimed water sources in this study treated wastewater from the wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been considered as the alternative water source for agricultural irrigation only the publicly owned treatment works potws were considered since these are mainly designed to treat the domestic sewage from residential and commercial communities and are owned and operated by the local government agencies potws data was collected and combined from the 2012 clean watersheds needs survey cwns and enforcement and compliance history online echo datasets epa 2012 after collecting the data the potws were screened and categorized using a three steps process fig 2 the step by step rationale behind selecting and categorizing the wwtps are described hereafter first each treatment facility discharges its treated wastewater effluent into the environment through many different methods i e outfall to surface waters discharge to ground water or reuse potable etc in this research five discharging ways were considered as high reuse potential for agriculture including evapotranspiration ocean discharge spray irrigation reuse irrigation and outfall to surface waters fig 2 discharging method evapotranspiration is a system to dispose the treated wastewater into the atmosphere through evaporation from the soil surface and or transpiration by plants without discharging wastewater to the groundwater reservoirs or surface water thus all the wwtps which discharge their treated wastewater through evapotranspiration were considered as a source for agricultural irrigation it is reported that more than 80 of treated wastewater 3 440 mm3 year is being discharged to the ocean in california angelakis et al 2018 this large volume of treated wastewater can also be used for irrigation purposes therefore wwtps discharging to the ocean were included here as a high potential source of water for irrigation the successful application of treated water for irrigation mainly depends on the farmers acceptability therefore the existing reusing practice nearby like spray irrigation and reuse irrigation can represent a positive economic and social impact and were included in this study in addition outfall to surface waters discharging method was considered only for those wwtps which located in the coastal regions and counties which have low surface water consumption according to usgs estimation and there is no downstream user second reclaimed water is a reliable source to meet part of the demand for irrigation water and to minimize the dependency on freshwater sources it is apparent that since larger treatment plants discharge higher volumes of reclaimed water they can be considered as more reliable sources in this study the projected design flow of individual wwtps was used to classify them depending on their treated effluent discharge capacity third the quality of the treated wastewater plays a very important role in reclaimed water applications title 22 of the california code of regulations states that the level of treatment impacts the reclaimed water use in agriculture for example if treated water contacts the edible portion of the crop i e vegetables or root crops tertiary treatment and disinfection are required table 1 in this step we classified the wwtps based on their treatment methods and included it as a decision criterion 2 2 1 3 irrigation status according to the 2015 usgs data california is the largest freshwater consumer in the u s 18 983 mgd mainly due to irrigation dieter et al 2018 california consumes 80 of the total water to produce food mount and hanak 2014 under this decision criteria county wise data of the total agricultural freshwater withdrawals surface and groundwater was considered to classify the study e g counties with highest irrigation water use were assigned higher priority for reclaimed water use 2 2 1 4 groundwater priority while surface water is the primary source of irrigation in california groundwater is also being used to meet the irrigation demand in many areas based on the california statewide groundwater elevation monitoring casgem data department of water resources dwr has identified 518 groundwater basins in california and categorized them into four prioritization groups of high medium low and very low priority the groundwater basins prioritization was made using the following eight criteria population population growth rate the total number of wells and irrigated acreage the degree of dependency on the groundwater documented impacts on groundwater like overdraft and saline intrusion and any other relevant documented adverse impacts in this study we considered the statewide groundwater prioritization as a decision criterion and assigned higher priority to watersheds that are considered high priority groundwater watersheds 2 2 1 5 climate agricultural production in california is very sensitive to climate change pathak et al 2018 change in amounts distribution and frequency of precipitation and temperature intensify the water availability for agricultural and reduce crop areas and yields pathak et al 2018 tanaka et al 2006 therefore in this study climate was selected as a criterion for suitable agricultural land evaluation climate criteria decomposed with the climate region and historical drought information for different watersheds within the state each watershed was ranked and weighted based on their severity of climate and drought conditions together through a two step process a climate region according to the california emergency management agency cema california is divided into 11 major climate impact regions fig 1 coastal and southern regions of california state have a mediterranean climate with slightly rainy winters and dry summers the coastal region has a moderate temperature warmer winters and cooler summer due to the ocean in the west northern california has a moderate oceanic climate which receives higher annual precipitation compared to the southern part of the state california s deserts have little water few plants and very hot summers situated on the east side the central valley has the semi arid climate with a distinct dry summer season and a cool foggy rainy season which is suitable for crop production the sierra nevada and the coastal region forms a ring around the central valley where half of the country s fruits vegetables and grains grow due to the rich soil and long growing season rest of california covered by the mountain ranges which include the klamath mountains and the cascade range in the north b drought index since a drought can adversely affect agricultural crop productions use of reclaimed water for irrigation can conserve the food security by providing a drought proof source of additional water to incorporate the drought information into the climate criteria the palmer drought index or the palmer drought severity index pdsi was considered as an indicator of drought in this study pdsi was collected from the west wide drought tracker https wrcc dri edu wwdt where pdsi was calculated based on the precipitation and temperature and a supply and demand model of soil moisture abatzoglou et al 2017 it assigns 0 as normal and negative number as drought condition e x negative 2 is moderate drought negative 3 is severe drought and negative 4 is extreme drought 2 2 2 developing the ahp model the ahp technique saaty 1978 was applied in the gis mcda structure where a hierarchical mechanism is used to rank criteria and alternatives according to their importance cozzi et al 2015 feizizadeh and blaschke 2014 the ahp uses pairwise comparisons between the criteria to help decision makers to evaluate the relative importance of criteria through this process the weights and ranking of the criteria were determined for the gis mcda model fig 3 the development of the ahp model for this study is described in the following steps 2 2 2 1 formulating hierarchy after defining all the selected criteria and evaluation of sub criteria they were used to formulate the hierarchy structure fig 4 the hierarchy structure was articulated based on the ahp method to organize the complex multi criteria problem in a number of levels the decision hierarchy is containing a goal the main criteria the sub criteria and the options the first level of the hierarchy corresponds to the general purpose of the problem the second level to the criteria and the third level to the sub criteria saaty 1980 fig 4 shows that the main criteria and sub criteria were outlined in the first and second levels of the hierarchy based on their priority described above to reclaimed water use in the agriculture land in this study the hierarchy is structured into four levels fig 4 2 2 2 2 weighting the criteria and sub criteria the ahp theory was applied to assign the criterion weight is a fundamental step in the mcda process the pairwise comparison technique derives the weights by comparing their relative importance between two criteria as a result the comparison matrix was established considering the relative importance of each criterion and comparing one to one based on pairwise scale the sub criteria were weighted according to saaty s 1 9 scale where the highest value 9 indicates extremely important while the reciprocal 1 9 indicates extremely insignificant table 3 the weights of each sub criterion were assigned based on the rationale described in table 4 2 2 2 3 evaluating consistency once the judgments or the weights of the criteria have been entered to the comparison matrix the consistency of the pairwise matrix is checked using a consistency ratio cr to check the degree of consistency or inconsistency saaty 1980 cr compares the consistency index ci of the matrix with the consistency of a random like matrix ri 2 c r c i r i where random index ri is the average of the consistency index of the randomly generated pairwise comparison matrix ri is varied with the numbers of criteria n saaty 1980 the ci is the consistency index calculated from the pairwise matrix and can be expressed as 3 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λmax is the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise comparison matrix n is the order of the matrix cr value of less than 0 10 indicates that judgments are consistent and are suitable for the implementation of the ahp analysis saaty 1978 for cr values greater than 0 10 the pairwise comparisons matrix needs to be adjusted and the weighting values should be modified 2 2 2 4 ranking and prioritizing the criteria from the pairwise comparison matrix the values of each cell were divided by the total of its column the resulting matrix is called a normalized matrix saaty 1978 from this normalized matrix the final priorities were obtained which are indicated as weights and ranks columns of tables 2 4 thus the final ahp outputs are i a relative priority of each criterion presented in percentages and ii a relative rank of each criterion in this study three separate robust maps were produced considering the proximity discharge flow rate and acceptable treatment process to minimize the dependence between different crop types and treated water quality for all other alternatives and criteria we assumed that there is no dependency between them therefore three pairwise matrices computed separately for 1 all wwtps with acceptable discharge methods case 1 table 5 2 wwtps categorized with flow volume case 2 table 6 and 3 wwtps considering the treatment processes case 3 table 7 2 2 3 creating thematic layers and model setup in the gis mcda method the data is needed in spatial nature for i the geographical data models ii spatial extent for the criteria evaluation and iii the spatial dimension of the decision problem six major datasets were collected and generated in spatial nature including crop data layer cdl for land use and land cover lulc the location of wwtps for reclaimed water sources groundwater basin prioritization maps county wise freshwater consumption map for irrigation status and drought index map and climate zone map for climate criteria a complete list of datasets that were used in this study is provided in table 8 after collecting the required data the spatial analysis was done to obtain the mcda criteria maps spatial analysis was made with the quantifiable data regarding single objective decision making with an optimized number of criteria spatial analysis to identify a suitable area for reclaimed water irrigation starts with representing each selected sub criterion by a thematic layer in which each point takes a value according to that sub criterion fig 4 each main criteria or thematic layer was obtained in a raster format and evaluated using gis and geo statistical tools crop data layer cdl 2017 was used to perform the agricultural land classification in the arcgis environment the wwtps information including locations discharge method flow and treatment units were collected from cwns 2012 and npdes data source and processed into a raster format the sub criteria of each main criterion was assigned with the scale according to table 4 using the spatial analysis tool named reclassify in arcgis platform and reclassified maps were produced for each criterion fig 5 a e all the thematic layers were converted into raster layers with a uniform 30 30 m resolution one constraints map fig 5f was created which indicates the unsuitable land use for irrigation e g urban areas barren land forests wetlands water bodies and shrublands the weights based on the final matrix tables 5 7 were distributed to individual criteria and then combined using the weighted sum overlay tool in arcgis total of five criteria layers for case 1 seven criteria layers for case 2 and six criteria for case 3 were combined to produce the single suitability map the interval classification was used to obtain the suitability for all generated maps and represented in four classifications of most suitable moderately suitable low suitable and least suitable respectively 2 3 sensitivity analysis in the ahp technique criteria weights represent the influence of each criterion in the model distribution feizizadeh and blaschke 2014 robinson et al 2010 the final ranking of options is dependent on the choice of performance scoring scales therefore criteria weights can be sources of uncertainty and may considerably impact the decision outcomes belton and hodgkin 1999 feizizadeh and blaschke 2014 to address this issue the sensitivity analysis was performed as the final check for the whole process and to assess the robustness of the model in this study the one at a time oat approach was applied for the sensitivity analysis which provides a good balance between efficiency and efficacy bertolini et al 2004 2006 through the analysis three aspects of criteria weight sensitivity were examined by 1 investigating the stability of the evaluation by implying a known amount of change to one weight and observing changes in the rankings of criteria 2 identifying most sensitive criteria to weight changes and 3 visualizing the changes in the spatial dynamics in this study a 10 change of weights for each main criterion was applied to analyze the model s response 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of main criteria 3 1 1 agricultural land classification mapping the agricultural land use was delineated using the boolean map fig 5a and f according to cdl 2017 more than sixty different types of food and non food crops were recorded in 30 30 m resolution based on table 4 the agricultural lands were reclassified and mapped into six classes these classes are fodder crops 49 424 km2 non food crops fiber 1 089 km2 non food crops oil 490 km2 food crops grains and legumes 7 135 km2 food crops orchard 22 294 km2 and food crops vegetables 1 610 km2 fig 5a 3 1 2 proximity mapping of reclaimed water sources the location of wwtps and their proximity to the point of use are very important factors in the decision process agricultural land close to wwtps or downstream of treatment plants can get easier access to reclaimed water compared to areas that are further from the treatment plants or are located upstream from each of the wwtp euclidean distances i e distance raster were calculated and then reclassified into three classes 0 5 km 5 15 km and 15 km fig 4 and 6b in this study three proximity maps were produced for the three cases case 1 2 and 3 the cwns 2012 database contains 905 records of wwtps within california it includes the projected flow for only 488 of the wwtps the database also includes information about the treatment process for only 53 wwtps of note is those 53 wwtps are large facilities and their combined treated effluent comprises about 73 of total recorded effluent after the reclassification three different proximity maps were created fig 5b shows the proximity map of the reclaimed water sources considering acceptable discharge methods 3 1 3 mapping of agriculture s freshwater consumption the groundwater and surface water extraction per county were mapped using the usgs 2015 dataset all the 58 counties in ca were assessed in terms of their annual freshwater consumption in the agricultural sector and the weighted county maps were generated these maps present the priority zones for using reclaimed water for irrigation results showed that imperial county extracted the highest amount of freshwater for irrigation 1 850 mgd followed by kern 1 617 mgd fresno 1 616 mgd tulare 1 396 mgd san joaquin 1 190 mgd and stanislaus 1 034 mgd respectively these six counties have the largest freshwater consumption in agriculture therefore were given the highest score in the evaluation fig 5c other counties were also classified according to their total freshwater use in agriculture respectively table 4 and fig 5c 3 1 4 groundwater basin prioritization mapping according to the casgem data a total of 43 basins were categorized as a high priority and 84 basins as medium priority regarding groundwater basin prioritization the rest of the groundwater basins were categorized as low or very low priority total of 391 after reclassification different scores were assigned to groundwater basins where high priority basins received the highest and low priority basins received the lowest scores fig 5d the groundwater basin prioritization mapping shows that the highest priority zones consisted of 51814 5 km2 and were mainly outlined to the central valley the low 17247 km2 and very low priority 55976 km2 were mapped to the eastern part of the california desert due to the insignificant agricultural activity 3 1 5 watershed prioritization mapping all the watersheds in california were classified based on their drought severity and local climate conditions using the method described before these drought severity classifications include very high high medium low very low and normal conditions for instance coastal region of southern california receives lowest pdsi 6 9 with maximum years 11 years followed by the california desert region pdsi 6 with maximum years 8 years watersheds were assigned different scores according to their pdsi in which watersheds with lowest pdsis received the highest priority for reclaimed water use in agriculture fig 5e 3 2 factors weight and ahp assessment three pairwise matrices were formulated and the weight of the criteria was computed separately for case 1 table 5 case 2 table 6 and case 3 table 7 respectively during the pairwise comparison the consistency was evaluated simultaneously to check if the judgments were rational if the cr eq 2 exceeds 10 the inconsistencies of the judgments were rechecked and the criteria evaluations were readjusted the final consistency of pairwise matrices was checked and found to be 0 051 0 056 and 0 051 for three cases of 1 2 and 3 respectively in case 1 proximity to wwtps had the highest priority with the score of 0 529 followed by the land cover crop type 0 265 and watershed prioritization 0 114 as the second and the third influential criteria table 5 in case 2 the wwtps which treated more than 100 mgd wastewater scored the largest 0 359 considered as the highest priority to irrigate the agricultural land followed by the wwtps with the capacity of 25 flow 100 mgd 0 249 and flow 25 mgd 0 171 table 6 similarly in case 3 regarding the acceptable treatment process the wwtps having advanced or secondary treatment with disinfection method scored the highest 0 540 compared to the other wwtps which treated the wastewater with secondary treatment process table 7 3 3 agricultural land suitability mapping for irrigation with reclaimed water three suitability maps were produced for three cases based on selected discharging methods discharge volumes and different treatment processes case 1 was constituted to assess the accessibility of each wwtp to the nearest agricultural land therefore the generated suitability map shows the most suitable agricultural areas that are in close proximity to the wwtps fig 6 a case 2 was established to evaluate the suitability in terms of flow fig 6b fig 6b shows the most suitable agricultural areas that are close to the wwtps with a large volume of discharge the last suitability maps were generated based on case 3 which includes the treatment process of wwtps fig 6c for instance reclaimed water from wwtps with advanced treatment process can be used for all types of crops but undisinfected secondary recycled water can only be used for nonfood crops and process food crops 3 3 1 case 1 considering selected discharging methods based on the selected discharging methods a total of 352 wwtps were included in the generation of the suitability maps the final suitability map based on the five main criteria and their sub criteria is presented in fig 6a results show that most suitable agricultural areas comprise 36 7 6515 km2 and moderately suitable areas comprise 23 3 4138 7 km2 of the total agricultural areas fig 6a the suitability map indicates that the suitability of the agriculture irrigation with reclaimed water influenced mainly by the proximity to the wwtp facilities of note is in this study the cwns database was used as the primary source to obtain treated discharge characteristics discharge volumes and treatment processes for all potw wwtps the non potw facilities that often treat wastewater from industries e g manufacturing or processing foods and beverages could be additional sources of reclaimed water for irrigation however due to the lack of effluent information and treatment processes non potw facilities were not included in this study 3 3 2 case 2 considering treated discharge volume since most of the high capacity wwtps are located near the coastal regions where agricultural land is minimal agricultural areas within close proximity to wwtps are limited the suitable areas for irrigation with reclaimed water within close proximity of large wwtps 100mgd occupy a total of 735 3 km2 which correspond to 6 of the total agriculture land fig 6b on the other hand wwtps with low capacity 100 flow 25 mgd were found to be accessible to about 1021 2 km2 of lands in the state of note is the cwns 2012 database contains projected discharge volume data for 488 out of 905 wwtps the complete dataset of recorded flow data for all of 905 wwtps could produce more comprehensive suitability maps for the gis mcda model 3 3 3 case 3 considering the appropriate treatment processes treatment processes were only reported for 53 wwtps in the cwns database but because they are all larger facilities they discharged 73 of the total treated effluent among those wwtps with treatment process data only 5 wwtps are located in the central valley therefore minimal agricultural lands 3830 km2 were found as suitable areas for irrigation with the reclaimed water close to those wwtps the majority of wwtps with treatment process information is located in the southern california coastal region and san francisco bay area 34 and 13 respectively they treat more than 3018 75 mgd of wastewater however these regions have minimal agriculture activities 1 2 of total agricultural land compared to other regions as a result only 14 km2 of agricultural area is marked as most suitable and 484 1 km2 as moderately suitable in southern california coastal region and san francisco bay area respectively fig 6c 3 3 4 composite maps considering all three cases in the end a hybrid model was built to evaluate the feasibility and suitability of treated water for agricultural irrigation considering proximity availability and appropriateness of the treated flow from municipal wwtps according to this most suitable agricultural areas occupy a total of 145 5 km2 and moderately suitable areas occupy a total of 276 km2 respectively the final suitability map from the hybrid model was then superimposed with the cdl layer for the verification of the suitability map fig 7 the discharge flow volume and agricultural land classes of the surrounding area were checked by the visual interpretation and using attribute data from the cdl layer to asses the accuracy of the classified suitability map a random wwtp was selected for the verification for instance a treatment plant fresno clovis regional wrf situated in fresno county was selected with a projected treated flow of 118 mgd with advanced treatment fresno county uses approximately 2492 77 mgd freshwater for the irrigation there are approximately 43 km2 of orchard almond grapes pistachio and walnuts 6 km2 of alfafa 5 km2 of pasture and 2 km2 of cotton are located within 5 km distance from this facility that may use reclaimed water as an additional irrigation water source of note is verification with the filed data is recommended in future studies when suitability classifications from different sources are compared 3 3 5 further discussion the focus of this study was to develop and apply a systematic geospatial decision framework using gis mcda method for the assessment of the suitable agriculture land for reclaimed water use of note is many researchers have acknowledged the advantage of knowledge driven approaches like gis mcda method in data sparse situations where decision rules derived from existing knowledge to solve the area selection and potential mapping problem harris et al 2001 machiwal et al 2015 rajabi et al 2014 it has been observed that for the cases with limited data saaty s systematic decision approach ahp will give similar results to much more complex mcda methods like promethee topsis or electre kabir et al 2014 tscheikner gratl et al 2017 it should be noted that ahp is often used in crisp decision applications where the alternatives are compared with respect to the criteria and for each criterion a crisp value is assigned as the weight of alternatives this crisp value provides a sharp and rigid boundary however in real world it is difficult to assign scores with crisp values for the assessment of complex water resource systems another limitation of the ahp approach is it becomes a lengthy task for analysis when there is a large number of criteria and sub criteria involves macharis et al 2004 considering the number of criteria and sub criteria in this study the ahp method was still relatively easy to implement additionally in some cases the final decision or ranking of options are dependent on the choice of performance scoring scales to address this issue a sensitivity analysis was performed using the oat approach and the relationship between criteria weights and performance scoring scales were examined it should be noted that the weights were changed only for the main criteria to evaluate the main effects one at a time and the interaction effects between two or more criteria had been ignored to keep the procedure simple bertolini et al 2006 chen et al 2013 sun et al 2012 3 4 sensitivity analysis six scenarios were performed for the sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the gis mcda method developed in this study to perform the sensitivity analysis the assigned weights to each criterion were altered with 10 increments from the initial input values the weight change was applied to one criterion at a time keeping the other criteria constant using the oat analysis method aldababseh et al 2018 paul and negahban azar 2018 the pixel numbers of each main criterion were evaluated in each scenario for per land suitability class fig 8 the relative sensitivity also calculated to interpret the output for the different scenarios to show how the weight change in one criterion affects the suitability classes in the output table 9 results show that 10 weight increase to five main criteria one at a time had an obvious change increasing or decreasing in the pixel numbers per land suitability class fig 8 sensitivity analysis showed that land suitability patterns change respective to the weight change under each scenario pixel numbers in most suitable areas were relatively stable with the weight increase in all main criteria except agricultural land classification the pixel numbers were decreased in low suitable class for all scenarios whereas a noticeable increase of the number of pixels found in the moderately suitable class table 9 the deviation in the decision weights e g proximity to wwtps has a substantial impact on the pixel number of the low suitable 0 02 to 0 86 and least suitable 0 24 to 0 66 class the largest variation of the pixel number found for the moderately suitable when the weight was changed for the groundwater basin prioritization relative change 1 24 there is a dramatic change in the number of cells in moderately suitable and low suitable classes the noteworthy shifts between moderately suitable and low suitable take place in all scenarios for scenario 1 when weight was changed for the distance of the wwtps the change of the pixel number was minimal compared to other scenarios thus the proximity of the wwtps to the agricultural point of use plays an important role in the suitability mapping 4 conclusion this study successfully implemented an integrated and comprehensive gis mcda approach to evaluate the agricultural land suitability for irrigation with reclaimed water to demonstrate how this gis mcda model performs under realistic conditions a case study was presented for the state of california this study appears to be the only study to model the agricultural hotspot identification for reclaimed water use in agriculture at the state wide scale considering several quantitative and qualitative decision criteria using the ahp method the ultimate goal was to produce prescriptive suitability maps showing the agricultural areas that are most suitable for irrigation with reclaimed water three separate robust maps were created at three stages considering the proximity to wwtps discharge flow rates and acceptable treatment processes respectively in addition a composite suitability map was produced using the hybrid model considering all three cases together accordingly the agricultural areas in the study area were classified spatially ranging from most suitable to least suitable areas for reclaimed water irrigation among the decision criteria proximity to wwtps and crop types were the most influentials results also highlighted how the spatial distribution of suitable areas is closely linked to the agricultural areas of not is the assumption was that all criteria were independent and there was no possible dependency influence in the decision making process as discussed before there might be dependency between some of the decision criteria for instance the irrigation of different type of crops might be influenced by the appropriateness of the treatment process for future research it is suggested that other decision analysis methods such as anp can be applied to consider the potential dependency in decision criteria and sub criteria in conclusion results from this study lead to a better understanding of sustainable reclaimed water use for crop irrigation at regional levels by developing a decision framework to prioritize agricultural areas for reclaimed water use the main contribution of this study was to develop a gis mcda framework and to test the framework at a large geographical scale state of california with diverse crop patterns while the gis mcda framework was specifically developed for the study area the proposed approach can be easily applied to other areas with some modifications e g revising the decision criteria and sub criteria thus results from this study provide a useful tool for decision makers and stakeholders e g farmers and help them with the development and expansion of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

water sources for agricultural irrigation the objective of this study was to implement the integrated geospatial multi criteria decision analysis mcda with the analytical hierarchy process ahp to evaluate the potentiality of reclaimed water use for agricultural irrigation in california five evaluation criteria included in this study were agricultural land crop type climate conditions water policies irrigation status and proximity to wastewater treatment plants wwtps respectively the suitability maps for reclaimed water use were generated for three cases in terms of accessibility to wwtps their discharge volume and appropriate treatment processes respectively in addition a composite suitability map was produced using the hybrid model considering all three cases together results from this study led to a better understanding of sustainable reclaimed water use for crop irrigation at a regional level it provided supporting evidence of the applicability of the gis mcda method integrated with ahp technique for a larger geographical scale with a diverse crop pattern this study established the importance of using both knowledge based and data driven criteria and sub criteria

rygaard et al 2011 many countries like australia chile china cyprus india israel italy and mexico have been using some of their treated or partially treated wastewater for crop production angelakis et al 2018 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 jimenez and asano 2008 keraita et al 2008 in the u s growing agricultural water reuse projects e g in florida and california also provides evidence that reclaimed water can be effectively used for agricultural irrigation bischel et al 2011 exall et al 2008 worldwide most of the water reuse projects were driven by the immediate needs to increase the water supply in agriculture to overcome the crisis of recurrent and long term drought conditions bixio et al 2008 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water provides multiple benefits including reducing pressure on freshwater jaramillo and restrepo 2017 rahman et al 2016 nutrients management and recovery hanjra et al 2015 miller robbie et al 2017 and higher reliability due to constant yields chen et al 2012 rahman et al 2016 however wastewater needs to be adequately treated to be reused in agricultural irrigation especially for food crops due to potential health and environmental risks other limiting factors that need to be considered in reclaimed water use in agricultural irrigation include technical feasibility e g closeness to wwtps economic factors e g ability to meet the water demand social and environmental factors e g public acceptance and consumer response and regulatory considerations e g compliance with treatment requirements ackerman 2012 bixio et al 2008 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 saliba et al 2018 urkiaga et al 2008 as a result before the implementation of water reuse projects it is very important for the policy makers and water resource managers to have the adequate information regarding the availability quantity and quality and economic viability cost benefit analysis of the reclaimed water sources for irrigation of different type of crops food non food crops thus multiple quantitative and qualitative decision criteria should be considered to plan for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation of note is some of these criteria cannot be easily quantified in numbers or expressed into monetary values kiker et al 2005 in addition the assessment of irrigated agricultural land suitability for irrigation with reclaimed water is a spatial decision problem which involves spatially variable decision criteria this complex geospatial problem leads to the necessity of using geographical information systems gis combined with multi criteria decision analysis mcda although this approach is more subjective it has the advantage of incorporating the expertise and knowledge of the decision makers in the modeling process harris et al 2001 rikalovic et al 2014 saarikoski et al 2016 the gis mcda solves the complex decision making problem based on evidence of varying quantity quality guidelines and experts opinions and considering a wide range of decision criteria and constraints akıncı et al 2013 assefa et al 2018 montgomery et al 2016 of note is any implemented project dynamically changes the environmental conditions saparauskas et al 2011 zavadskas et al 2009 which highly influence the feasible solutions kalibatas and turskis 2008 and determine the set of critical criteria streimikiene et al 2016 for example efficient waste utilization alternative selection could influence waste reuse efficiency in terms of social economic and environmental aspects turskis et al 2012 thus proper site selection depends on its sustainability characteristics peldschus et al 2010 and available technologies to use sivilevicius et al 2008 zavadskas et al 2013c stakeholders in the modern world should find a reliable solution considering the effective investments and both global and local perspective of the outcomes zolfani et al 2013 worldwide some researchers have applied the mcda framework for the evaluation of feasible wastewater reuse for irrigation ganoulis 2003 kalavrouziotis et al 2011 lee et al 2018 woltersdorf et al 2018 however very few scientific papers demonstrated the use of integrated gis mcda approach for the agricultural land suitability assessment for irrigation with reclaimed water aldababseh et al 2018 anane et al 2012 neji and turki 2015 most of these studies assess the feasibility of reclaimed water use in agricultural land at a small scale e g only including few farms and a limited number of treatment plants for instance anane et al 2012 considered only two wwtps to rank the suitable sites for irrigation with reclaimed water while neji and turki 2015 evaluated the alternatives for three wwtps in tunisia in another study aldababseh et al 2018 assessed an ex ante land suitability analysis for the irrigation of seven critical crops with desalinated and treated wastewater in the emirate of abu dhabi to the best of our knowledge there is no study that considers the spatial distribution of diverse crop patterns with a combination of a large number of wwtps and their proximity capacity and different treatment processes the aim of this study was to develop a decision support system for agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water from wwtps using an integrated framework of gis mcda the main objectives of this study were to 1 develop a gis mcda framework to identify the agricultural hotspots that are best suited for irrigation with reclaimed water 2 evaluate the feasibility of reclaimed water use for irrigation considering proximity to wwtps discharge volume and treatment processes respectively and 3 produce a composite map using a hybrid model identifying the hotspots combining all of the decision criteria in addition a sensitivity analysis has been carried out with variable criteria weights to better explain the consistency of the best solution given by the mcda 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area for this research was the entire state of california fig 1 california is the leading state in agricultural production in the united states it has the highest irrigated farm acreage and uses about one fourth of the total irrigation water in the united states johnson and cody 2015 the central valley of california is known as its productive agricultural heartland due to its well suited condition for vegetables and fruit cultivation four counties of tulare kern fresno and merced in central valley and monterey in central coastal region of california are ranked as the leading agricultural counties in the nation about 77 100 irrigated croplands generated an overall agricultural production value of 42 6 billion in 2017 usda ers 2018 the state produces over 400 different commodities including over one third of the country s vegetables and two thirds of its fruits and nuts according to usda national agricultural statistics services nass 26 of agricultural lands were orchards 52 were cultivated alfalfa hay pastureland rice corn and cotton and 11 were vegetables in 2017 the demand for alternative water supply sources is increasing among the farmers in california as a way to continually meet their irrigation demands in the face of growing water scarcity schulte 2016 the ongoing growth provides evidence that the demand for alternative water sources such as reclaimed water to irrigate the agricultural lands is increasing bischel et al 2011 schulte 2016 according to usgs estimation in 2015 california used 289 4 million gallons of reclaimed water per day mgd for irrigation including 217 7 mgd for crop irrigation dieter et al 2018 however only in california approximately 2 210 mgd of wastewater is being treated including all publicly non publicly and federally owned wwtps epa 2019 thus there is still great potential for reclaimed water use in agriculture that has not been fully exploited 2 2 multi criteria decision analysis mcda in the mcda framework the weights or scores are defined to check the performance of alternative decision options against multiple criteria that are measured in different and sometimes in incommensurable units i e a combination of quantitative and qualitative criteria in general the required inputs in the mcda process include scores across several dimensions associated with different alternatives and outcomes and weights relating to tradeoffs across these dimensions huang et al 2011 the total value score for an alternative is calculated as a linear weighted sum of its scores across several criteria eq 1 1 v i j 1 n w j x i j where v i is the overall score for alternative i w j denotes the relative weight for criteria j and x i j is the priority of alternative i with respect to criteria j numerous techniques have been developed to define the weights for criteria and combine them to solve the complex decision making process different mcda methods have different robustness when assessing choices in specific problems zavadskas et al 2013a 2013b major mcda approaches include multi criteria value functions methods such as weighted summation hajkowicz and higgins 2008 outranking approaches such as promethee brans and vincke 1985 vetschera and de almeida 2012 and electre kumar et al 2016 roy 1978 distance to ideal point methods such as topsis dong et al 2016 yoon 1980 and compromising programming cp ballestero and romero 1996 martin et al 2017 soft computing concept such as logic scoring of preference lsp dujmovi c 1996 montgomery et al 2016 pairwise comparison methods such as analytical hiearchy process ahp hou et al 2016 saaty 1978 prioritization technique such as dematel azarnivand and chitsaz 2015 fontela and gabus 1976 fuzzy set analysis kosko 1992 mirajkar and patel 2016 mathematical approach like linear programming lp srinivasan and shocker 1973 and compromising ranking method such as vikor opricovic 1998 etc in the modern era stakeholders may need newer mcda methods keshavarz ghorabaee et al 2016 or integrated mcda approaches bagocius et al 2014 to solve complicated problems ruzgys et al 2014 xu 2001 for instance improved ahp method like analytical network process anp aminu et al 2017 saaty 1996 integrated ranking method such as superiority and inferiority ranking sir xu 2001 fuzzy ahp anagnostopoulos and petalas 2011 buckley 1985 elshaikh et al 2018 fuzzy anp mikhailov and singh 2003 razavitoosi and samani 2016 and fuzzy topsis chen 2000 kim et al 2013 are used to solve the complex problem ahp method which was first introduced by saaty in 1978 is still a widely used mcda method saaty 1978 1979 1980 ahp gets its popularity due to its good understandability ease of implementation and interpretability of the results by both modelers and decision makers it allows the researchers to represent a full range of human decision making logic considering both qualitative and quantitative data and combines them by decomposing complex problems into systematic hierarchies to rank alternatives based on different criteria assefa et al 2018 opricovic 2011 woltersdorf et al 2018 for this reason several studies have applied the ahp for solving a wide variety of water and environmental problems including water resource allocation zhang et al 2019 selection grum et al 2016 feasibility evaluation cozzi et al 2015 resolving conflicts mainuddin et al 1997 and priority and ranking hassani et al 2019 of note is well backgrounded goals are essential to define the problem and should be included in any decision making model turskis et al 2019d therefore when stakeholders use mcda methods one of the critical tasks is to determine the importance of criteria the ahp method is the most widely used method for this purpose zavadskas et al 2016 in addition researchers have developed other techniques to assign criteria weights based on their importance eckenrode 1965 delbecq and vandeven 1971 kersuliene et al 2010 linstone and turoff 2002 turskis et al 2019b in the mcda process the criteria and weighting can be modelled as crisp as well as fuzzy or grey turskis et al 2019a c this may vary based on the nature of the criteria or the modelling preference in case of land allocation problems cropland and forest land could be assigned with crisp boundaries either one or the other or fuzzy boundaries with one or more classification levels where the land is partially forest and partially cropland thus in the decision making process it is sometimes difficult to choose between alternatives with multiple attributes ahp has the ability to simplify the complicated decision making process by using pairwise comparison technique and reducing the number of comparisons and confirming consistency by comparing objects with multiple attributes the pairwise comparison technique provides a powerful simplified and relatively unbiased ranking criterion assefa et al 2018 saaty 1980 worqlul et al 2015 few of the mcda techniques were integrated with gis to assess the land suitability and allocation for water resource management table 1 where ahp is the most applied to solve the complex decision making processes regarding water reuse for irrigation in the presented study the process of a suitability assessment and identifying hotspots for reclaimed water use involves two main steps fig 3 in the first step the influential geospatial decision criteria and sub criteria were evaluated then a gis mcda model was developed using the ahp technique to solve the spatial decision making process the mcda method was implemented using geospatial data and arcgis 10 1 software esri 2012 in gis mcda a spatial decision alternative is defined as a single raster of a specified size or a combination of multiple rasters the following subsections describe the procedure for the development of gis mcda in this research in more details 2 2 1 defining criteria and sub criteria decision criteria and sub criteria are labeled as either factors or constraints a factor is a criterion that amplifies or reduces the suitability of a specific alternative for the activity under consideration while a constraint serves to limit the alternatives under consideration based on the existing literature data availability and expert opinions five main influential criteria as factors and one as a constraint were selected for the assessment of the suitable agricultural land for the reclaimed water irrigation the five selected criteria are 1 land cover crop type 2 reclaimed water sources 3 irrigation status 4 groundwater priority and 5 climate each of these criteria is individually evaluated using different sub criteria sub criteria were processed separately depending on their discrete and continuous form the detailed rationale behind the selection of these criteria and sub criteria are explained hereafter 2 2 1 1 land cover crop type according to nass cdl 2017 the total harvested area in california was 46 741 km2 with a planted area of 16 591 7 km2 in 2017 to assess the suitable agricultural land for reclaimed water irrigation all of the agricultural lands were included in the land cover criteria the main concern regarding reclaimed water use is the effect on the human and health environmental thus california s water recycling criteria title 22 was followed strictly during the classification nwri 2012 schulte 2016 sheikh 2015 the detailed information can be found from title 22 of the california code of regulations division 4 chapter 3 water recycling criteria but briefly according to the regulations both nonfood crops processed food crops and food crops can be irrigated with reclaimed water depending on the treatment process table 1 therefore all the existing crops within california were categorized into six classes as alternatives based on the reclaimed water sensitivity and tolerance non food crops fiber non food crops fodder non food crops oil crops food crops grains and legumes food crops orchards and food crops vegetables 2 2 1 2 reclaimed water sources in this study treated wastewater from the wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been considered as the alternative water source for agricultural irrigation only the publicly owned treatment works potws were considered since these are mainly designed to treat the domestic sewage from residential and commercial communities and are owned and operated by the local government agencies potws data was collected and combined from the 2012 clean watersheds needs survey cwns and enforcement and compliance history online echo datasets epa 2012 after collecting the data the potws were screened and categorized using a three steps process fig 2 the step by step rationale behind selecting and categorizing the wwtps are described hereafter first each treatment facility discharges its treated wastewater effluent into the environment through many different methods i e outfall to surface waters discharge to ground water or reuse potable etc in this research five discharging ways were considered as high reuse potential for agriculture including evapotranspiration ocean discharge spray irrigation reuse irrigation and outfall to surface waters fig 2 discharging method evapotranspiration is a system to dispose the treated wastewater into the atmosphere through evaporation from the soil surface and or transpiration by plants without discharging wastewater to the groundwater reservoirs or surface water thus all the wwtps which discharge their treated wastewater through evapotranspiration were considered as a source for agricultural irrigation it is reported that more than 80 of treated wastewater 3 440 mm3 year is being discharged to the ocean in california angelakis et al 2018 this large volume of treated wastewater can also be used for irrigation purposes therefore wwtps discharging to the ocean were included here as a high potential source of water for irrigation the successful application of treated water for irrigation mainly depends on the farmers acceptability therefore the existing reusing practice nearby like spray irrigation and reuse irrigation can represent a positive economic and social impact and were included in this study in addition outfall to surface waters discharging method was considered only for those wwtps which located in the coastal regions and counties which have low surface water consumption according to usgs estimation and there is no downstream user second reclaimed water is a reliable source to meet part of the demand for irrigation water and to minimize the dependency on freshwater sources it is apparent that since larger treatment plants discharge higher volumes of reclaimed water they can be considered as more reliable sources in this study the projected design flow of individual wwtps was used to classify them depending on their treated effluent discharge capacity third the quality of the treated wastewater plays a very important role in reclaimed water applications title 22 of the california code of regulations states that the level of treatment impacts the reclaimed water use in agriculture for example if treated water contacts the edible portion of the crop i e vegetables or root crops tertiary treatment and disinfection are required table 1 in this step we classified the wwtps based on their treatment methods and included it as a decision criterion 2 2 1 3 irrigation status according to the 2015 usgs data california is the largest freshwater consumer in the u s 18 983 mgd mainly due to irrigation dieter et al 2018 california consumes 80 of the total water to produce food mount and hanak 2014 under this decision criteria county wise data of the total agricultural freshwater withdrawals surface and groundwater was considered to classify the study e g counties with highest irrigation water use were assigned higher priority for reclaimed water use 2 2 1 4 groundwater priority while surface water is the primary source of irrigation in california groundwater is also being used to meet the irrigation demand in many areas based on the california statewide groundwater elevation monitoring casgem data department of water resources dwr has identified 518 groundwater basins in california and categorized them into four prioritization groups of high medium low and very low priority the groundwater basins prioritization was made using the following eight criteria population population growth rate the total number of wells and irrigated acreage the degree of dependency on the groundwater documented impacts on groundwater like overdraft and saline intrusion and any other relevant documented adverse impacts in this study we considered the statewide groundwater prioritization as a decision criterion and assigned higher priority to watersheds that are considered high priority groundwater watersheds 2 2 1 5 climate agricultural production in california is very sensitive to climate change pathak et al 2018 change in amounts distribution and frequency of precipitation and temperature intensify the water availability for agricultural and reduce crop areas and yields pathak et al 2018 tanaka et al 2006 therefore in this study climate was selected as a criterion for suitable agricultural land evaluation climate criteria decomposed with the climate region and historical drought information for different watersheds within the state each watershed was ranked and weighted based on their severity of climate and drought conditions together through a two step process a climate region according to the california emergency management agency cema california is divided into 11 major climate impact regions fig 1 coastal and southern regions of california state have a mediterranean climate with slightly rainy winters and dry summers the coastal region has a moderate temperature warmer winters and cooler summer due to the ocean in the west northern california has a moderate oceanic climate which receives higher annual precipitation compared to the southern part of the state california s deserts have little water few plants and very hot summers situated on the east side the central valley has the semi arid climate with a distinct dry summer season and a cool foggy rainy season which is suitable for crop production the sierra nevada and the coastal region forms a ring around the central valley where half of the country s fruits vegetables and grains grow due to the rich soil and long growing season rest of california covered by the mountain ranges which include the klamath mountains and the cascade range in the north b drought index since a drought can adversely affect agricultural crop productions use of reclaimed water for irrigation can conserve the food security by providing a drought proof source of additional water to incorporate the drought information into the climate criteria the palmer drought index or the palmer drought severity index pdsi was considered as an indicator of drought in this study pdsi was collected from the west wide drought tracker https wrcc dri edu wwdt where pdsi was calculated based on the precipitation and temperature and a supply and demand model of soil moisture abatzoglou et al 2017 it assigns 0 as normal and negative number as drought condition e x negative 2 is moderate drought negative 3 is severe drought and negative 4 is extreme drought 2 2 2 developing the ahp model the ahp technique saaty 1978 was applied in the gis mcda structure where a hierarchical mechanism is used to rank criteria and alternatives according to their importance cozzi et al 2015 feizizadeh and blaschke 2014 the ahp uses pairwise comparisons between the criteria to help decision makers to evaluate the relative importance of criteria through this process the weights and ranking of the criteria were determined for the gis mcda model fig 3 the development of the ahp model for this study is described in the following steps 2 2 2 1 formulating hierarchy after defining all the selected criteria and evaluation of sub criteria they were used to formulate the hierarchy structure fig 4 the hierarchy structure was articulated based on the ahp method to organize the complex multi criteria problem in a number of levels the decision hierarchy is containing a goal the main criteria the sub criteria and the options the first level of the hierarchy corresponds to the general purpose of the problem the second level to the criteria and the third level to the sub criteria saaty 1980 fig 4 shows that the main criteria and sub criteria were outlined in the first and second levels of the hierarchy based on their priority described above to reclaimed water use in the agriculture land in this study the hierarchy is structured into four levels fig 4 2 2 2 2 weighting the criteria and sub criteria the ahp theory was applied to assign the criterion weight is a fundamental step in the mcda process the pairwise comparison technique derives the weights by comparing their relative importance between two criteria as a result the comparison matrix was established considering the relative importance of each criterion and comparing one to one based on pairwise scale the sub criteria were weighted according to saaty s 1 9 scale where the highest value 9 indicates extremely important while the reciprocal 1 9 indicates extremely insignificant table 3 the weights of each sub criterion were assigned based on the rationale described in table 4 2 2 2 3 evaluating consistency once the judgments or the weights of the criteria have been entered to the comparison matrix the consistency of the pairwise matrix is checked using a consistency ratio cr to check the degree of consistency or inconsistency saaty 1980 cr compares the consistency index ci of the matrix with the consistency of a random like matrix ri 2 c r c i r i where random index ri is the average of the consistency index of the randomly generated pairwise comparison matrix ri is varied with the numbers of criteria n saaty 1980 the ci is the consistency index calculated from the pairwise matrix and can be expressed as 3 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λmax is the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise comparison matrix n is the order of the matrix cr value of less than 0 10 indicates that judgments are consistent and are suitable for the implementation of the ahp analysis saaty 1978 for cr values greater than 0 10 the pairwise comparisons matrix needs to be adjusted and the weighting values should be modified 2 2 2 4 ranking and prioritizing the criteria from the pairwise comparison matrix the values of each cell were divided by the total of its column the resulting matrix is called a normalized matrix saaty 1978 from this normalized matrix the final priorities were obtained which are indicated as weights and ranks columns of tables 2 4 thus the final ahp outputs are i a relative priority of each criterion presented in percentages and ii a relative rank of each criterion in this study three separate robust maps were produced considering the proximity discharge flow rate and acceptable treatment process to minimize the dependence between different crop types and treated water quality for all other alternatives and criteria we assumed that there is no dependency between them therefore three pairwise matrices computed separately for 1 all wwtps with acceptable discharge methods case 1 table 5 2 wwtps categorized with flow volume case 2 table 6 and 3 wwtps considering the treatment processes case 3 table 7 2 2 3 creating thematic layers and model setup in the gis mcda method the data is needed in spatial nature for i the geographical data models ii spatial extent for the criteria evaluation and iii the spatial dimension of the decision problem six major datasets were collected and generated in spatial nature including crop data layer cdl for land use and land cover lulc the location of wwtps for reclaimed water sources groundwater basin prioritization maps county wise freshwater consumption map for irrigation status and drought index map and climate zone map for climate criteria a complete list of datasets that were used in this study is provided in table 8 after collecting the required data the spatial analysis was done to obtain the mcda criteria maps spatial analysis was made with the quantifiable data regarding single objective decision making with an optimized number of criteria spatial analysis to identify a suitable area for reclaimed water irrigation starts with representing each selected sub criterion by a thematic layer in which each point takes a value according to that sub criterion fig 4 each main criteria or thematic layer was obtained in a raster format and evaluated using gis and geo statistical tools crop data layer cdl 2017 was used to perform the agricultural land classification in the arcgis environment the wwtps information including locations discharge method flow and treatment units were collected from cwns 2012 and npdes data source and processed into a raster format the sub criteria of each main criterion was assigned with the scale according to table 4 using the spatial analysis tool named reclassify in arcgis platform and reclassified maps were produced for each criterion fig 5 a e all the thematic layers were converted into raster layers with a uniform 30 30 m resolution one constraints map fig 5f was created which indicates the unsuitable land use for irrigation e g urban areas barren land forests wetlands water bodies and shrublands the weights based on the final matrix tables 5 7 were distributed to individual criteria and then combined using the weighted sum overlay tool in arcgis total of five criteria layers for case 1 seven criteria layers for case 2 and six criteria for case 3 were combined to produce the single suitability map the interval classification was used to obtain the suitability for all generated maps and represented in four classifications of most suitable moderately suitable low suitable and least suitable respectively 2 3 sensitivity analysis in the ahp technique criteria weights represent the influence of each criterion in the model distribution feizizadeh and blaschke 2014 robinson et al 2010 the final ranking of options is dependent on the choice of performance scoring scales therefore criteria weights can be sources of uncertainty and may considerably impact the decision outcomes belton and hodgkin 1999 feizizadeh and blaschke 2014 to address this issue the sensitivity analysis was performed as the final check for the whole process and to assess the robustness of the model in this study the one at a time oat approach was applied for the sensitivity analysis which provides a good balance between efficiency and efficacy bertolini et al 2004 2006 through the analysis three aspects of criteria weight sensitivity were examined by 1 investigating the stability of the evaluation by implying a known amount of change to one weight and observing changes in the rankings of criteria 2 identifying most sensitive criteria to weight changes and 3 visualizing the changes in the spatial dynamics in this study a 10 change of weights for each main criterion was applied to analyze the model s response 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of main criteria 3 1 1 agricultural land classification mapping the agricultural land use was delineated using the boolean map fig 5a and f according to cdl 2017 more than sixty different types of food and non food crops were recorded in 30 30 m resolution based on table 4 the agricultural lands were reclassified and mapped into six classes these classes are fodder crops 49 424 km2 non food crops fiber 1 089 km2 non food crops oil 490 km2 food crops grains and legumes 7 135 km2 food crops orchard 22 294 km2 and food crops vegetables 1 610 km2 fig 5a 3 1 2 proximity mapping of reclaimed water sources the location of wwtps and their proximity to the point of use are very important factors in the decision process agricultural land close to wwtps or downstream of treatment plants can get easier access to reclaimed water compared to areas that are further from the treatment plants or are located upstream from each of the wwtp euclidean distances i e distance raster were calculated and then reclassified into three classes 0 5 km 5 15 km and 15 km fig 4 and 6b in this study three proximity maps were produced for the three cases case 1 2 and 3 the cwns 2012 database contains 905 records of wwtps within california it includes the projected flow for only 488 of the wwtps the database also includes information about the treatment process for only 53 wwtps of note is those 53 wwtps are large facilities and their combined treated effluent comprises about 73 of total recorded effluent after the reclassification three different proximity maps were created fig 5b shows the proximity map of the reclaimed water sources considering acceptable discharge methods 3 1 3 mapping of agriculture s freshwater consumption the groundwater and surface water extraction per county were mapped using the usgs 2015 dataset all the 58 counties in ca were assessed in terms of their annual freshwater consumption in the agricultural sector and the weighted county maps were generated these maps present the priority zones for using reclaimed water for irrigation results showed that imperial county extracted the highest amount of freshwater for irrigation 1 850 mgd followed by kern 1 617 mgd fresno 1 616 mgd tulare 1 396 mgd san joaquin 1 190 mgd and stanislaus 1 034 mgd respectively these six counties have the largest freshwater consumption in agriculture therefore were given the highest score in the evaluation fig 5c other counties were also classified according to their total freshwater use in agriculture respectively table 4 and fig 5c 3 1 4 groundwater basin prioritization mapping according to the casgem data a total of 43 basins were categorized as a high priority and 84 basins as medium priority regarding groundwater basin prioritization the rest of the groundwater basins were categorized as low or very low priority total of 391 after reclassification different scores were assigned to groundwater basins where high priority basins received the highest and low priority basins received the lowest scores fig 5d the groundwater basin prioritization mapping shows that the highest priority zones consisted of 51814 5 km2 and were mainly outlined to the central valley the low 17247 km2 and very low priority 55976 km2 were mapped to the eastern part of the california desert due to the insignificant agricultural activity 3 1 5 watershed prioritization mapping all the watersheds in california were classified based on their drought severity and local climate conditions using the method described before these drought severity classifications include very high high medium low very low and normal conditions for instance coastal region of southern california receives lowest pdsi 6 9 with maximum years 11 years followed by the california desert region pdsi 6 with maximum years 8 years watersheds were assigned different scores according to their pdsi in which watersheds with lowest pdsis received the highest priority for reclaimed water use in agriculture fig 5e 3 2 factors weight and ahp assessment three pairwise matrices were formulated and the weight of the criteria was computed separately for case 1 table 5 case 2 table 6 and case 3 table 7 respectively during the pairwise comparison the consistency was evaluated simultaneously to check if the judgments were rational if the cr eq 2 exceeds 10 the inconsistencies of the judgments were rechecked and the criteria evaluations were readjusted the final consistency of pairwise matrices was checked and found to be 0 051 0 056 and 0 051 for three cases of 1 2 and 3 respectively in case 1 proximity to wwtps had the highest priority with the score of 0 529 followed by the land cover crop type 0 265 and watershed prioritization 0 114 as the second and the third influential criteria table 5 in case 2 the wwtps which treated more than 100 mgd wastewater scored the largest 0 359 considered as the highest priority to irrigate the agricultural land followed by the wwtps with the capacity of 25 flow 100 mgd 0 249 and flow 25 mgd 0 171 table 6 similarly in case 3 regarding the acceptable treatment process the wwtps having advanced or secondary treatment with disinfection method scored the highest 0 540 compared to the other wwtps which treated the wastewater with secondary treatment process table 7 3 3 agricultural land suitability mapping for irrigation with reclaimed water three suitability maps were produced for three cases based on selected discharging methods discharge volumes and different treatment processes case 1 was constituted to assess the accessibility of each wwtp to the nearest agricultural land therefore the generated suitability map shows the most suitable agricultural areas that are in close proximity to the wwtps fig 6 a case 2 was established to evaluate the suitability in terms of flow fig 6b fig 6b shows the most suitable agricultural areas that are close to the wwtps with a large volume of discharge the last suitability maps were generated based on case 3 which includes the treatment process of wwtps fig 6c for instance reclaimed water from wwtps with advanced treatment process can be used for all types of crops but undisinfected secondary recycled water can only be used for nonfood crops and process food crops 3 3 1 case 1 considering selected discharging methods based on the selected discharging methods a total of 352 wwtps were included in the generation of the suitability maps the final suitability map based on the five main criteria and their sub criteria is presented in fig 6a results show that most suitable agricultural areas comprise 36 7 6515 km2 and moderately suitable areas comprise 23 3 4138 7 km2 of the total agricultural areas fig 6a the suitability map indicates that the suitability of the agriculture irrigation with reclaimed water influenced mainly by the proximity to the wwtp facilities of note is in this study the cwns database was used as the primary source to obtain treated discharge characteristics discharge volumes and treatment processes for all potw wwtps the non potw facilities that often treat wastewater from industries e g manufacturing or processing foods and beverages could be additional sources of reclaimed water for irrigation however due to the lack of effluent information and treatment processes non potw facilities were not included in this study 3 3 2 case 2 considering treated discharge volume since most of the high capacity wwtps are located near the coastal regions where agricultural land is minimal agricultural areas within close proximity to wwtps are limited the suitable areas for irrigation with reclaimed water within close proximity of large wwtps 100mgd occupy a total of 735 3 km2 which correspond to 6 of the total agriculture land fig 6b on the other hand wwtps with low capacity 100 flow 25 mgd were found to be accessible to about 1021 2 km2 of lands in the state of note is the cwns 2012 database contains projected discharge volume data for 488 out of 905 wwtps the complete dataset of recorded flow data for all of 905 wwtps could produce more comprehensive suitability maps for the gis mcda model 3 3 3 case 3 considering the appropriate treatment processes treatment processes were only reported for 53 wwtps in the cwns database but because they are all larger facilities they discharged 73 of the total treated effluent among those wwtps with treatment process data only 5 wwtps are located in the central valley therefore minimal agricultural lands 3830 km2 were found as suitable areas for irrigation with the reclaimed water close to those wwtps the majority of wwtps with treatment process information is located in the southern california coastal region and san francisco bay area 34 and 13 respectively they treat more than 3018 75 mgd of wastewater however these regions have minimal agriculture activities 1 2 of total agricultural land compared to other regions as a result only 14 km2 of agricultural area is marked as most suitable and 484 1 km2 as moderately suitable in southern california coastal region and san francisco bay area respectively fig 6c 3 3 4 composite maps considering all three cases in the end a hybrid model was built to evaluate the feasibility and suitability of treated water for agricultural irrigation considering proximity availability and appropriateness of the treated flow from municipal wwtps according to this most suitable agricultural areas occupy a total of 145 5 km2 and moderately suitable areas occupy a total of 276 km2 respectively the final suitability map from the hybrid model was then superimposed with the cdl layer for the verification of the suitability map fig 7 the discharge flow volume and agricultural land classes of the surrounding area were checked by the visual interpretation and using attribute data from the cdl layer to asses the accuracy of the classified suitability map a random wwtp was selected for the verification for instance a treatment plant fresno clovis regional wrf situated in fresno county was selected with a projected treated flow of 118 mgd with advanced treatment fresno county uses approximately 2492 77 mgd freshwater for the irrigation there are approximately 43 km2 of orchard almond grapes pistachio and walnuts 6 km2 of alfafa 5 km2 of pasture and 2 km2 of cotton are located within 5 km distance from this facility that may use reclaimed water as an additional irrigation water source of note is verification with the filed data is recommended in future studies when suitability classifications from different sources are compared 3 3 5 further discussion the focus of this study was to develop and apply a systematic geospatial decision framework using gis mcda method for the assessment of the suitable agriculture land for reclaimed water use of note is many researchers have acknowledged the advantage of knowledge driven approaches like gis mcda method in data sparse situations where decision rules derived from existing knowledge to solve the area selection and potential mapping problem harris et al 2001 machiwal et al 2015 rajabi et al 2014 it has been observed that for the cases with limited data saaty s systematic decision approach ahp will give similar results to much more complex mcda methods like promethee topsis or electre kabir et al 2014 tscheikner gratl et al 2017 it should be noted that ahp is often used in crisp decision applications where the alternatives are compared with respect to the criteria and for each criterion a crisp value is assigned as the weight of alternatives this crisp value provides a sharp and rigid boundary however in real world it is difficult to assign scores with crisp values for the assessment of complex water resource systems another limitation of the ahp approach is it becomes a lengthy task for analysis when there is a large number of criteria and sub criteria involves macharis et al 2004 considering the number of criteria and sub criteria in this study the ahp method was still relatively easy to implement additionally in some cases the final decision or ranking of options are dependent on the choice of performance scoring scales to address this issue a sensitivity analysis was performed using the oat approach and the relationship between criteria weights and performance scoring scales were examined it should be noted that the weights were changed only for the main criteria to evaluate the main effects one at a time and the interaction effects between two or more criteria had been ignored to keep the procedure simple bertolini et al 2006 chen et al 2013 sun et al 2012 3 4 sensitivity analysis six scenarios were performed for the sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the gis mcda method developed in this study to perform the sensitivity analysis the assigned weights to each criterion were altered with 10 increments from the initial input values the weight change was applied to one criterion at a time keeping the other criteria constant using the oat analysis method aldababseh et al 2018 paul and negahban azar 2018 the pixel numbers of each main criterion were evaluated in each scenario for per land suitability class fig 8 the relative sensitivity also calculated to interpret the output for the different scenarios to show how the weight change in one criterion affects the suitability classes in the output table 9 results show that 10 weight increase to five main criteria one at a time had an obvious change increasing or decreasing in the pixel numbers per land suitability class fig 8 sensitivity analysis showed that land suitability patterns change respective to the weight change under each scenario pixel numbers in most suitable areas were relatively stable with the weight increase in all main criteria except agricultural land classification the pixel numbers were decreased in low suitable class for all scenarios whereas a noticeable increase of the number of pixels found in the moderately suitable class table 9 the deviation in the decision weights e g proximity to wwtps has a substantial impact on the pixel number of the low suitable 0 02 to 0 86 and least suitable 0 24 to 0 66 class the largest variation of the pixel number found for the moderately suitable when the weight was changed for the groundwater basin prioritization relative change 1 24 there is a dramatic change in the number of cells in moderately suitable and low suitable classes the noteworthy shifts between moderately suitable and low suitable take place in all scenarios for scenario 1 when weight was changed for the distance of the wwtps the change of the pixel number was minimal compared to other scenarios thus the proximity of the wwtps to the agricultural point of use plays an important role in the suitability mapping 4 conclusion this study successfully implemented an integrated and comprehensive gis mcda approach to evaluate the agricultural land suitability for irrigation with reclaimed water to demonstrate how this gis mcda model performs under realistic conditions a case study was presented for the state of california this study appears to be the only study to model the agricultural hotspot identification for reclaimed water use in agriculture at the state wide scale considering several quantitative and qualitative decision criteria using the ahp method the ultimate goal was to produce prescriptive suitability maps showing the agricultural areas that are most suitable for irrigation with reclaimed water three separate robust maps were created at three stages considering the proximity to wwtps discharge flow rates and acceptable treatment processes respectively in addition a composite suitability map was produced using the hybrid model considering all three cases together accordingly the agricultural areas in the study area were classified spatially ranging from most suitable to least suitable areas for reclaimed water irrigation among the decision criteria proximity to wwtps and crop types were the most influentials results also highlighted how the spatial distribution of suitable areas is closely linked to the agricultural areas of not is the assumption was that all criteria were independent and there was no possible dependency influence in the decision making process as discussed before there might be dependency between some of the decision criteria for instance the irrigation of different type of crops might be influenced by the appropriateness of the treatment process for future research it is suggested that other decision analysis methods such as anp can be applied to consider the potential dependency in decision criteria and sub criteria in conclusion results from this study lead to a better understanding of sustainable reclaimed water use for crop irrigation at regional levels by developing a decision framework to prioritize agricultural areas for reclaimed water use the main contribution of this study was to develop a gis mcda framework and to test the framework at a large geographical scale state of california with diverse crop patterns while the gis mcda framework was specifically developed for the study area the proposed approach can be easily applied to other areas with some modifications e g revising the decision criteria and sub criteria thus results from this study provide a useful tool for decision makers and stakeholders e g farmers and help them with the development and expansion of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10717,drip irrigation has been gradually adopted for winter wheat production in the north china plain ncp due to significant saving from using irrigation water and improving water and nitrogen use efficiencies however the optimal water and nitrogen application rates for drip irrigated wheat are still unclear a field experiment with five nitrogen application rates 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 referred as n0 n1 n2 n3 and n4 and three irrigation levels 40 30 and 20 mm per irrigation referred as i1 i2 and i3 was conducted during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 winter wheat seasons to study the effects of irrigation and nitrogen rates on crop growth yield and the water and nitrogen use efficiencies results showed that increasing irrigation and nitrogen application rates notably improved actual evapotranspiration leaf area index aboveground biomass grain yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat however nitrogen application rates exceeding 240 kg ha 1 were not beneficial for wheat growth grain yield wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue the maximum grain yields of 8034 and 8760 kg ha 1 were achieved in n3i1 which had wue of 2 08 and 2 23 kg m 3 and iwue of 4 46 and 4 87 kg m 3 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the same time n3i1 did not result in much reduction of nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp average of 34 99 kg kg 1 in n3i1 for two seasons considering comprehensively growth yield wue iwue and npfp combination of n rate of 240 kg ha 1 and irrigation quota of 40 mm per irrigation was optimal pattern for drip irrigated winter wheat these results may provide a scientific basis for water and nitrogen management of drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp keywords drip irrigation winter wheat aboveground biomass grain yield water use efficiency nitrogen partial factor productivity 1 introduction winter wheat is the top irrigated crop in the north china plain ncp a very important agricultural production region in china du et al 2014 liang et al 2016 li et al 2005 and zhang et al 2003 reported that about 30 of the annual rainfall ranging from 60 to 180 mm occurs during the winter wheat season from october to june and can only provide 25 40 of the water required by wheat therefore supplemental irrigation is necessary to maintain wheat production however long term overexploitation of groundwater resulted in a decline in the regional groundwater in the ncp which has negatively affected the sustainable development of regional agriculture han et al 2016 in addition nitrogen fertilization needed to achieve high yields is resulting in over fertilization ju et al 2009 which may increase greenhouse gas emissions tan et al 2017 and bring potential threats to groundwater security lenka et al 2013 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2016c therefore the appropriate management of water and nitrogen application for wheat production is highly significant for the sustainable production of local winter wheat the optimization of water and nitrogen applications could improve photosynthesis zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2013 and biomass production mon et al 2016 which ultimately plays a positive role in improving grain yield and the water and nitrogen use efficiencies of wheat albrizio et al 2010 dar et al 2017 li et al 2010 mon et al 2016 in the ncp where surface irrigation is the dominant irrigation method the irrigation practices were optimized from 3 5 times to 2 times resulting in an improvement in the water use efficiency wue qiu et al 2008 xu et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the optimal n application rate for a high winter wheat yield in the ncp ranged from 180 to 240 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 however most of these results were based on experiments with traditional surface irrigation methods more research is needed to explore the effects of new and more efficient irrigation methods in improving wue and nitrogen use efficiency and to meet demands of future sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp in the past few years drip irrigation was gradually adopted in cereal crops to relieve severe water shortages in arid and semi arid areas dar et al 2017 jha et al 2019 mostafa et al 2018 drip irrigation is a more efficient irrigation technique that can conserve irrigation water and improve water and fertilizer use efficiencies ayars et al 2015 jha et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 fang et al 2018 reported that increasing irrigation frequency with drip irrigation would maintain higher soil water content in the top soil layers and improve crop water use and yield li et al 2018 found that drip irrigated wheat compared with traditional flood irrigation had a greater root density 80 cm below the soil surface which promoted the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen in deep soil layers wang et al 2016b and tian et al 2017 indicated that in addition to guaranteeing higher crop yields drip irrigation may also mitigate greenhouse gas n2o emissions and improve irrigation water use efficiency when compared to flood irrigation these studies show the great potential of using drip irrigation for the sustainable development of agriculture drip irrigation systems can supply water and fertilizer to root area at very low rates changing the distribution of water nutrients and roots in the soil li et al 2018 this can help promote wheat absorption of water and nutrients jha et al 2017 thus the optimal irrigation and nitrogen application using drip irrigation may be different from traditional surface irrigation some experiments for drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp have been carried out studying the crop coefficients gao et al 2014 wang et al 2018b irrigation scheduling jha et al 2019 mehmood et al 2019 and optimizing nitrogen fertilization li et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 however the optimal water and nitrogen application rates for drip irrigated wheat is still unclear more research is necessary to develop an optimal water and nitrogen management system to support using drip irrigation especially with fertigation techniques for winter wheat production in the ncp therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate effects of different irrigation and nitrogen application rates on actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai aboveground biomass grain yield and water nitrogen use efficiency and 2 to determine an optimal irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer combinative application pattern for drip irrigated winter wheat production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 wheat growing seasons at the experimental station of farmland irrigation research institute 35 08 n 113 54 e and 81 m altitude located at qiliying town xinxiang city of henan province the local weather is temperate continental and monsoonal with rainfall average of 582 mm about 70 occurs in june october annual and 161 mm during the winter wheat season the annual

water table is on average about 6 m below the soil surface 2 2 experimental design the field experiment was designed in a split plot arrangement consisting of two experimental factors the main plots were arranged for nitrogen application with five nitrogen rates of 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 referred to as n0 n1 n2 n3 and n4 the subplots contained three irrigation levels of 40 30 and 20 mm per irrigation referred as i1 i2 and i3 the size of a main plot was 15 16 m and for a subplot 5 16 m there were 15 treatments with three replications water was applied using a drip irrigation system the high yielding winter wheat cultivar aikang 58 was sown at 180 kg ha 1 ensuring 350 400 seedlings per m2 at a normal germination rate with a tractor drawn seed cum fertilizer drill with a 20 cm row spacing on november 1 2015 and october 19 2016 the crops were harvested on june 3 2016 and june 1 2017 respectively n p and k fertilization were applied using urea 46 7 n calcium superphosphate 16 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 50 k2o the base fertilization before seeding was applied by spreading the fertilizer on the surface and mixing into the soil with a rotary cultivator p and k fertilization were applied at 120 kg ha 1 as basal fertilization n fertilization was applied two times as a base fertilizer 40 and a topdressing 60 the topdressing fertilizer was applied at the winter wheat returning green stage the field was kept free from insects pests and diseases using pesticides as needed weeds were controlled with herbicides 2 3 irrigation management a surface drip irrigation sdi system having an emitter space of 20 cm and a discharge rate of 2 l h 1 under 0 15 mpa working pressure supplied the water the sdi laterals were arranged in a north south direction with a spacing of 0 6 m polyvinyl chloride pipelines were installed as main water carriers adjacent to the experimental area with outlets set for each subplot a water tight valve in the outlet controlled the irrigation amount the amount of irrigation water for each subplot was measured with a water meter installed on the outlet irrigation was applied when the average soil water content 0 100 cm in i1 decreased to less than 60 of the field capacity irrigation in all treatments was scheduled at the same time using the different irrigation amounts mentioned in table 2 2 4 methods for field investigation 2 4 1 soil water content and crop water consumption soil water content swc was measured every 7 10 days using trime time domain reflectometry with intelligent micro elements imko ettlingen germany at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 100 cm the swc of the top 0 20 cm soil layer was determined using the gravimetric method winter wheat actual evapotranspiration eta was estimated using the soil water balance

mm and δ s the change of soil water storage mm the measured values of r dw and u were zero during the two growing seasons 2 4 2 leaf area index lai leaf area was manually measured every 7 10 days after returning green of wheat ten plants in each subplot were sampled and the lai was determined following jha 2018 2 4 3 aboveground biomass aboveground biomass was measured on the same day as lai from randomly selected sample rows all plants were taken in 0 2 m by cutting them at soil surface the fresh samples were initially kept for 0 5 h in an oven at 105 and then dried at 75 until reaching a constant weight the data from these samples were converted into aboveground biomass per hectare based on plant density 2 4 4 grain yield and composition at grain maturity an area of 2 m2 of undisturbed wheat was randomly selected for measuring yield the grains were weighed after natural air drying and converted to yield per hectare in each subplot a 1 m row was collected for measuring spike number and kernels per spike the 1000 grain weight was determined by weighing 1000 seeds from the yield measurement samples 2 5 water and nitrogen use efficiencies water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency were calculated with eq 2 3 and 4 2 w u e 0 1 y e t a 3 i w u e 0 1 y i 4 n p f p y n 100 where wue is water use efficiency kg m 3 iwue is

statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed using the general linear model procedure in the spss 24 0 to test the effects of water and nitrogen application rates on wheat growth grain yield wue iwue and npfp differences were determined using duncan s multiple range test at the 5 level of significance pearson s correlations coefficients were used to analyze the relationships between grain yield and physiological traits 3 results 3 1 water balance the total amount of irrigation ranged from 80 to 180 mm in 2015 2016 and from 80 to 160 mm in 2016 2017 fig 2 the seasonal rainfall amount was 168 8 mm during 2015 2016 and 206 7 mm during 2016 2017 respectively eta in the 2016 2017 season was higher than in the 2015 2016 season as there was more rainfall in 2016 2017 the eta increased with increase in irrigation and nitrogen rate the maximum eta over the two seasons was measured in n4i1 392 9 mm in 2015 2016 and 394 9 mm in 2016 2017 while the minimum was in n0i3 273 mm in 2015 2016 and 281 mm in 2016 2017 the δ s was larger with greater nitrogen rate ranging from 12 29 66 75 mm during 2015 2016 and from 1 08 to 42 76 mm during 2016 2017 3 2 lai and aboveground biomass both irrigation and nitrogen application had significant effects on lai vegetative organs reproductive organs and aboveground biomass with the exception of reproductive organs and aboveground biomass in 2015 2016 table 3 the lai and aboveground biomass increased with an increase of nitrogen rates from n0 to n3 and decreased with increasing nitrogen rates over n3 level aboveground biomass reached its maximum in n4 in 2016 2017 figs 3 and 4 for the different irrigation amounts the lai vegetative organs reproductive organs and aboveground biomass showed the same order i1 i2 i3 in both seasons fig 3 fig 4 which shows that water deficits may reduce lai and aboveground biomass the highest lai value appeared in n3i1 and was 7 54 and 7 93 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively supplementary table s1 the maximum aboveground biomass was 18 887 kg ha 1 in n3i1 and 16 928 kg ha 1 in n4i1 during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively supplementary table s1 3 3 grain yield and composition results indicated that grain yield rose significantly with an increase of nitrogen application rate and then decreased over the n3 level table 4 supplementary table s2 nitrogen fertilizer improved grain yield when n was initially a deficit but excessive nitrogen application was harmful for grain yield under all nitrogen application rates the order of grain yield was always i1 i2 i3 table 4 supplementary table s2 which indicated that an adequate water supply was an important prerequisite for higher yields in winter wheat production the highest grain yield of 8034 kg ha 1 and 8760 kg ha 1 was recorded in n3i1 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively supplementary table s2 with the increase of nitrogen rate the spike number and kernels per spike of winter wheat increased in both seasons with the maximum values being found in n3 or n4 table 4 for irrigation treatments the maximum spike number appeared in i1 followed by i2 and i3 the kernels per spike under i1 and i2 were higher than under i3 the 1000 grain weight in n0 was significantly higher than those in other nitrogen treatments while little differences being observed between n2 n3 and n4 3 4 wue iwue and npfp winter wheat under the different treatments had iwue values between 3 33 to 8 10 kg m 3 and 3 08 to 7 79 kg m 3 and wue values between 1 62 to 2 27 kg m 3 and 1 41 to 2 23 kg m 3 in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively supplementary table s3 the minimum iwue and wue were measured in n0 in both seasons table 5 table 5 also shows that iwue and wue rose as the nitrogen application rate increase until n3 where both declined at higher nitrogen rates the only exception was the maximum wue being obtained in n2 in 2015 2016 under all nitrogen application rates iwue always appeared in the order of i3 i2 i1 the maximum wue of 2 27 kg m 3 was obtained in n2i2 during 2015 2016 and 2 23 kg m 3 in n3i1 during 2016 2017 the greatest values of iwue 8 10 and 7 79 kg m 3 for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively were obtained in n3i3 the maximum values of npfp 63 22 and 62 12 kg kg 1 for 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively were measured in n1i1 supplementary table s3 the npfp decreased with increases of nitrogen application rate however the npfp increased with increase in irrigation water application table 5 3 5 relationship between grain yield and physiological traits the relationships between grain yield nitrogen application rate and crop growth traits lai aboveground biomass reproductive organ spike number and kernels per spike were analyzed using pearson s correlation coefficients fig 5 grain yield varied with nitrogen rate with a maximum value appearing at a nitrogen application rate of 247 kg ha 1 for both seasons fig 5 a the maximum grain yield calculated by the fitted regression equation was 7366 kg ha 1 and 7450 kg ha 1 for the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively the r2 for the regression analysis between grain yield and lai was 0 81 in 2015 2016 and 0 93 in 2016 2017 fig 5 b reveals that increasing lai is beneficial to increasing grain yield the aboveground biomass and reproductive organ biomass were closely correlated with grain yield and the r2 for reproductive organ and grain yield was higher than for aboveground biomass and grain yield fig 5 c d grain yield was significantly correlated with spike number and kernels per spike with a high values of r2 fig 5 e f therefore it can be concluded that greater lai aboveground biomass especially reproductive organ more spike number and more kernels per spike are helpful achieving higher winter wheat yield 4 discussion 4 1 water balance studies have shown that winter wheat consumes about 450 mm of water with traditional surface irrigation methods in the ncp xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 in this study the maximum eta of winter wheat in well irrigated treatments was about 390 mm during the two seasons which indicates that drip irrigation may save a large quantity of water as traditional surface irrigation methods fang et al 2018 jha et al 2019 li et al 2018 more irrigation larger δ s and lower eta were found in 2015 2016 as compared to 2016 2017 fig 2 this was mainly due to the lower rainfall in 2015 2016 season which resulted in more serious drought condition and required more irrigation and soil water supply dar et al 2017 in both seasons eta increased with increase in irrigation and nitrogen application rate with maximum levels found in n4i1 that were similar to the results of other researchers bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 dar et al 2017 adequate applications of water and nitrogen resulted in crops having higher lai and biomass which increased crop water consumption the δ s also varied among treatments and were greater in treatments with higher nitrogen application this result corroborates previous research that showed nitrogen application affected water consumption in different soil layers and improved soil water utilization in wheat zhong and shangguan 2014 4 2 lai aboveground biomass grain yield and yield composition the lai and aboveground biomass are important indicators of crop growth previous studies found that lai biomass production grain yield and yield composition were affected positively by nitrogen availability and negatively by water stress karam et al 2009 mon et al 2016 shirazi et al 2014 which generally support our results in addition nitrogen application showed a threshold effect in the regulation of crop growth and yield i e excessive nitrogen application may be unfavorable to crop growth and yield mon et al 2016 wang et al 2017 2018a in our study the lai aboveground biomass and grain yield showed rising trends with increasing nitrogen application until a rate of 240 kg ha 1 after which wheat growth and grain yield began to decrease this implies that 240 kg ha 1 may be the threshold nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp the optimal nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 is consistent with the optimal nitrogen rate of 247 kg ha 1 derived from the grain yield response curves fig 5 a grain yield of wheat was closely related to the lai aboveground biomass accumulation and its remobilization into reproductive organs xu et al 2018 increasing post anthesis biomass production is an effective approach for increasing crop yield shi et al 2016 wang et al 2016a biomass production is largely dependent on lai man et al 2017 with more biomass being produced due to higher lai in our study treatments with higher application rates of irrigation and nitrogen had higher lai and more biomass produced figs 3 and 4 correlation analysis also showed that grain yield was closely correlated with lai aboveground biomass and reproductive organ biomass fig 5 b c d this is another indication that appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application rates may result in optimal lai and aboveground biomass especially reproductive organ biomass and improved grain yield wheat grain yield was highly correlated with spike number and kernels per spike xu et al 2018 karam et al 2009 and xue et al 2006 reported that irrigation and nitrogen application significantly improved grain yield by increasing grain number per square meter in our study the spike number and kernels per spike increased significantly with increase in nitrogen application in both seasons in addition the close correlation between grain yield and spike number r2 of 0 78 and 0 62 for both seasons and grain yield and kernels per spike r2 of 0 94 and 0 9 for both seasons that are shown in fig 5 e and f indicate that improving spike number and kernels per spike may be the primary factors for increasing grain yield 4 3 wue iwue and npfp improving water and nitrogen use efficiencies are beneficial for the rational utilization of agricultural resources in our study the application of water and nitrogen significantly improved wue of winter wheat table 5 however excessive nitrogen application does not contribute to an increase in wue a finding supported by recent studies gao et al 2014 jha et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 with nitrogen application rates of 180 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 and 240 kg ha 1 in 2016 2017 the maximum wue was 2 27 and 2 23 kg m 3 in both seasons respectively supplementary table s3 this is clearly greater than the average wue of 1 45 kg m 3 for winter wheat with surface irrigation in the ncp zhang et al 2011 our results are supported by some studies showing that drip irrigation consumed less water when achieving comparable or higher yield as compared to traditional surface irrigation methods thus increased wue fang et al 2018 jha et al 2019 li et al 2018 the iwue increased with nitrogen application reaching the maximum at 240 kg ha 1 however the iwue decreased with more irrigation water because the increase in irrigation was greater than the increase in yield dar et al 2017 typically npfp increases with an increase in irrigation water pradhan et al 2013 and decreases with an increase in nitrogen application cui et al 2011 pradhan et al 2013 which is also consistent with our results although npfp were better in low nitrogen conditions

10717,drip irrigation has been gradually adopted for winter wheat production in the north china plain ncp due to significant saving from using irrigation water and improving water and nitrogen use efficiencies however the optimal water and nitrogen application rates for drip irrigated wheat are still unclear a field experiment with five nitrogen application rates 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 referred as n0 n1 n2 n3 and n4 and three irrigation levels 40 30 and 20 mm per irrigation referred as i1 i2 and i3 was conducted during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 winter wheat seasons to study the effects of irrigation and nitrogen rates on crop growth yield and the water and nitrogen use efficiencies results showed that increasing irrigation and nitrogen application rates notably improved actual evapotranspiration leaf area index aboveground biomass grain yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat however nitrogen application rates exceeding 240 kg ha 1 were not beneficial for wheat growth grain yield wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue the maximum grain yields of 8034 and 8760 kg ha 1 were achieved in n3i1 which had wue of 2 08 and 2 23 kg m 3 and iwue of 4 46 and 4 87 kg m 3 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the same time n3i1 did not result in much reduction of nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp average of 34 99 kg kg 1 in n3i1 for two seasons considering comprehensively growth yield wue iwue and npfp combination of n rate of 240 kg ha 1 and irrigation quota of 40 mm per irrigation was optimal pattern for drip irrigated winter wheat these results may provide a scientific basis for water and nitrogen management of drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp keywords drip irrigation winter wheat aboveground biomass grain yield water use efficiency nitrogen partial factor productivity 1 introduction winter wheat is the top irrigated crop in the north china plain ncp a very important agricultural production region in china du et al 2014 liang et al 2016 li et al 2005 and zhang et al 2003 reported that about 30 of the annual rainfall ranging from 60 to 180 mm occurs during the winter wheat season from october to june and can only provide 25 40 of the water required by wheat therefore supplemental irrigation is necessary to maintain wheat production however long term overexploitation of groundwater resulted in a decline in the regional groundwater in the ncp which has negatively affected the sustainable development of regional agriculture han et al 2016 in addition nitrogen fertilization needed to achieve high yields is resulting in over fertilization ju et al 2009 which may increase greenhouse gas emissions tan et al 2017 and bring potential threats to groundwater security lenka et al 2013 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2016c therefore the appropriate management of water and nitrogen application for wheat production is highly significant for the sustainable production of local winter wheat the optimization of water and nitrogen applications could improve photosynthesis zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2013 and biomass production mon et al 2016 which ultimately plays a positive role in improving grain yield and the water and nitrogen use efficiencies of wheat albrizio et al 2010 dar et al 2017 li et al 2010 mon et al 2016 in the ncp where surface irrigation is the dominant irrigation method the irrigation practices were optimized from 3 5 times to 2 times resulting in an improvement in the water use efficiency wue qiu et al 2008 xu et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the optimal n application rate for a high winter wheat yield in the ncp ranged from 180 to 240 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 however most of these results were based on experiments with traditional surface irrigation methods more research is needed to explore the effects of new and more efficient irrigation methods in improving wue and nitrogen use efficiency and to meet demands of future sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp in the past few years drip irrigation was gradually adopted in cereal crops to relieve severe water shortages in arid and semi arid areas dar et al 2017 jha et al 2019 mostafa et al 2018 drip irrigation is a more efficient irrigation technique that can conserve irrigation water and improve water and fertilizer use efficiencies ayars et al 2015 jha et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 fang et al 2018 reported that increasing irrigation frequency with drip irrigation would maintain higher soil water content in the top soil layers and improve crop water use and yield li et al 2018 found that drip irrigated wheat compared with traditional flood irrigation had a greater root density 80 cm below the soil surface which promoted the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen in deep soil layers wang et al 2016b and tian et al 2017 indicated that in addition to guaranteeing higher crop yields drip irrigation may also mitigate greenhouse gas n2o emissions and improve irrigation water use efficiency when compared to flood irrigation these studies show the great potential of using drip irrigation for the sustainable development of agriculture drip irrigation systems can supply water and fertilizer to root area at very low rates changing the distribution of water nutrients and roots in the soil li et al 2018 this can help promote wheat absorption of water and nutrients jha et al 2017 thus the optimal irrigation and nitrogen application using drip irrigation may be different from traditional surface irrigation some experiments for drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp have been carried out studying the crop coefficients gao et al 2014 wang et al 2018b irrigation scheduling jha et al 2019 mehmood et al 2019 and optimizing nitrogen fertilization li et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 however the optimal water and nitrogen application rates for drip irrigated wheat is still unclear more research is necessary to develop an optimal water and nitrogen management system to support using drip irrigation especially with fertigation techniques for winter wheat production in the ncp therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate effects of different irrigation and nitrogen application rates on actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai aboveground biomass grain yield and water nitrogen use efficiency and 2 to determine an optimal irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer combinative application pattern for drip irrigated winter wheat production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted

water table is on average about 6 m below the soil surface 2 2 experimental design the field experiment was designed in a split plot arrangement consisting of two experimental factors the main plots were arranged for nitrogen application with five nitrogen rates of 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 referred to as n0 n1 n2 n3 and n4 the subplots contained three irrigation levels of 40 30 and 20 mm per irrigation referred as i1 i2 and i3 the size of a main plot was 15 16 m and for a subplot 5 16 m there were 15 treatments with three replications water was applied using a drip irrigation system the high yielding winter wheat cultivar aikang 58 was sown at 180 kg ha 1 ensuring 350 400 seedlings per m2 at a normal germination rate with a tractor drawn seed cum fertilizer drill with a 20 cm row spacing on november 1 2015 and october 19 2016 the crops were harvested on june 3 2016 and june 1 2017 respectively n p and k fertilization were applied using urea 46 7 n calcium superphosphate 16 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 50 k2o the base fertilization before seeding was applied by spreading the fertilizer on the surface and mixing into the soil with a rotary cultivator p and k fertilization were applied at 120 kg ha 1 as basal fertilization n fertilization was applied two times as a base fertilizer 40 and a topdressing 60 the topdressing fertilizer was applied at the winter wheat returning green stage the field was kept free from insects pests and diseases using pesticides as needed weeds were controlled with herbicides 2 3 irrigation management a surface drip irrigation sdi system having an emitter space of 20 cm and a discharge rate of 2 l h 1 under 0 15 mpa working pressure supplied the water the sdi laterals were arranged in a north south direction with a spacing of 0 6 m polyvinyl chloride pipelines were installed as main water carriers adjacent to the experimental area with outlets set for each subplot a water tight valve in the outlet controlled the irrigation amount the amount of irrigation water for each subplot was measured with a water meter installed on the outlet irrigation was applied when the average soil water content 0 100 cm in i1 decreased to less than 60 of the field capacity irrigation in all treatments was scheduled at the same time using the different irrigation amounts mentioned in table 2 2 4 methods for field investigation 2 4 1 soil water content and crop water consumption soil water content swc was measured every 7 10 days using trime time domain reflectometry with intelligent micro elements imko ettlingen germany at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 100 cm the swc of the top 0 20 cm soil layer was determined using the gravimetric method winter wheat actual evapotranspiration eta was estimated using the soil water balance

mm and δ s the change of soil water storage mm the measured values of r dw and u were zero during the two growing seasons 2 4 2 leaf area index lai leaf area was manually measured every 7 10 days after returning green of wheat ten plants in each subplot were sampled and the lai was determined following jha 2018 2 4 3 aboveground biomass aboveground biomass was measured on the same day as lai from randomly selected sample rows all plants were taken in 0 2 m by cutting them at soil surface the fresh samples were initially kept for 0 5 h in an oven at 105 and then dried at 75 until reaching a constant weight the data from these samples were converted into aboveground biomass per hectare based on plant density 2 4 4 grain yield and composition at grain maturity an area of 2 m2 of undisturbed wheat was randomly selected for measuring yield the grains were weighed after natural air drying and converted to yield per hectare in each subplot a 1 m row was collected for measuring spike number and kernels per spike the 1000 grain weight was determined by weighing 1000 seeds from the yield measurement samples 2 5 water and nitrogen use efficiencies water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency were calculated with eq 2 3 and 4 2 w u e 0 1 y e t a 3 i w u e 0 1 y i 4 n p f p y n 100 where wue is water use efficiency kg m 3 iwue is

statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed using the general linear model procedure in the spss 24 0 to test the effects of water and nitrogen application rates on wheat growth grain yield wue iwue and npfp differences were determined using duncan s multiple range test at the 5 level of significance pearson s correlations coefficients were used to analyze the relationships between grain yield and physiological traits 3 results 3 1 water balance the total amount of irrigation ranged from 80 to 180 mm in 2015 2016 and from 80 to 160 mm in 2016 2017 fig 2 the seasonal rainfall amount was 168 8 mm during 2015 2016 and 206 7 mm during 2016 2017 respectively eta in the 2016 2017 season was higher than in the 2015 2016 season as there was more rainfall in 2016 2017 the eta increased with increase in irrigation and nitrogen rate the maximum eta over the two seasons was measured in n4i1 392 9 mm in 2015 2016 and 394 9 mm in 2016 2017 while the minimum was in n0i3 273 mm in 2015 2016 and 281 mm in 2016 2017 the δ s was larger with greater nitrogen rate ranging from 12 29 66 75 mm during 2015 2016 and from 1 08 to 42 76 mm during 2016 2017 3 2 lai and aboveground biomass both irrigation and nitrogen application had significant effects on lai vegetative organs reproductive organs and aboveground biomass with the exception of reproductive organs and aboveground biomass in 2015 2016 table 3 the lai and aboveground biomass increased with an increase of nitrogen rates from n0 to n3 and decreased with increasing nitrogen rates over n3 level aboveground biomass reached its maximum in n4 in 2016 2017 figs 3 and 4 for the different irrigation amounts the lai vegetative organs reproductive organs and aboveground biomass showed the same order i1 i2 i3 in both seasons fig 3 fig 4 which shows that water deficits may reduce lai and aboveground biomass the highest lai value appeared in n3i1 and was 7 54 and 7 93 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively supplementary table s1 the maximum aboveground biomass was 18 887 kg ha 1 in n3i1 and 16 928 kg ha 1 in n4i1 during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively supplementary table s1 3 3 grain yield and composition results indicated that grain yield rose significantly with an increase of nitrogen application rate and then decreased over the n3 level table 4 supplementary table s2 nitrogen fertilizer improved grain yield when n was initially a deficit but excessive nitrogen application was harmful for grain yield under all nitrogen application rates the order of grain yield was always i1 i2 i3 table 4 supplementary table s2 which indicated that an adequate water supply was an important prerequisite for higher yields in winter wheat production the highest grain yield of 8034 kg ha 1 and 8760 kg ha 1 was recorded in n3i1 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively supplementary table s2 with the increase of nitrogen rate the spike number and kernels per spike of winter wheat increased in both seasons with the maximum values being found in n3 or n4 table 4 for irrigation treatments the maximum spike number appeared in i1 followed by i2 and i3 the kernels per spike under i1 and i2 were higher than under i3 the 1000 grain weight in n0 was significantly higher than those in other nitrogen treatments while little differences being observed between n2 n3 and n4 3 4 wue iwue and npfp winter wheat under the different treatments had iwue values between 3 33 to 8 10 kg m 3 and 3 08 to 7 79 kg m 3 and wue values between 1 62 to 2 27 kg m 3 and 1 41 to 2 23 kg m 3 in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively supplementary table s3 the minimum iwue and wue were measured in n0 in both seasons table 5 table 5 also shows that iwue and wue rose as the nitrogen application rate increase until n3 where both declined at higher nitrogen rates the only exception was the maximum wue being obtained in n2 in 2015 2016 under all nitrogen application rates iwue always appeared in the order of i3 i2 i1 the maximum wue of 2 27 kg m 3 was obtained in n2i2 during 2015 2016 and 2 23 kg m 3 in n3i1 during 2016 2017 the greatest values of iwue 8 10 and 7 79 kg m 3 for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively were obtained in n3i3 the maximum values of npfp 63 22 and 62 12 kg kg 1 for 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively were measured in n1i1 supplementary table s3 the npfp decreased with increases of nitrogen application rate however the npfp increased with increase in irrigation water application table 5 3 5 relationship between grain yield and physiological traits the relationships between grain yield nitrogen application rate and crop growth traits lai aboveground biomass reproductive organ spike number and kernels per spike were analyzed using pearson s correlation coefficients fig 5 grain yield varied with nitrogen rate with a maximum value appearing at a nitrogen application rate of 247 kg ha 1 for both seasons fig 5 a the maximum grain yield calculated by the fitted regression equation was 7366 kg ha 1 and 7450 kg ha 1 for the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively the r2 for the regression analysis between grain yield and lai was 0 81 in 2015 2016 and 0 93 in 2016 2017 fig 5 b reveals that increasing lai is beneficial to increasing grain yield the aboveground biomass and reproductive organ biomass were closely correlated with grain yield and the r2 for reproductive organ and grain yield was higher than for aboveground biomass and grain yield fig 5 c d grain yield was significantly correlated with spike number and kernels per spike with a high values of r2 fig 5 e f therefore it can be concluded that greater lai aboveground biomass especially reproductive organ more spike number and more kernels per spike are helpful achieving higher winter wheat yield 4 discussion 4 1 water balance studies have shown that winter wheat consumes about 450 mm of water with traditional surface irrigation methods in the ncp xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 in this study the maximum eta of winter wheat in well irrigated treatments was about 390 mm during the two seasons which indicates that drip irrigation may save a large quantity of water as traditional surface irrigation methods fang et al 2018 jha et al 2019 li et al 2018 more irrigation larger δ s and lower eta were found in 2015 2016 as compared to 2016 2017 fig 2 this was mainly due to the lower rainfall in 2015 2016 season which resulted in more serious drought condition and required more irrigation and soil water supply dar et al 2017 in both seasons eta increased with increase in irrigation and nitrogen application rate with maximum levels found in n4i1 that were similar to the results of other researchers bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 dar et al 2017 adequate applications of water and nitrogen resulted in crops having higher lai and biomass which increased crop water consumption the δ s also varied among treatments and were greater in treatments with higher nitrogen application this result corroborates previous research that showed nitrogen application affected water consumption in different soil layers and improved soil water utilization in wheat zhong and shangguan 2014 4 2 lai aboveground biomass grain yield and yield composition the lai and aboveground biomass are important indicators of crop growth previous studies found that lai biomass production grain yield and yield composition were affected positively by nitrogen availability and negatively by water stress karam et al 2009 mon et al 2016 shirazi et al 2014 which generally support our results in addition nitrogen application showed a threshold effect in the regulation of crop growth and yield i e excessive nitrogen application may be unfavorable to crop growth and yield mon et al 2016 wang et al 2017 2018a in our study the lai aboveground biomass and grain yield showed rising trends with increasing nitrogen application until a rate of 240 kg ha 1 after which wheat growth and grain yield began to decrease this implies that 240 kg ha 1 may be the threshold nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp the optimal nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 is consistent with the optimal nitrogen rate of 247 kg ha 1 derived from the grain yield response curves fig 5 a grain yield of wheat was closely related to the lai aboveground biomass accumulation and its remobilization into reproductive organs xu et al 2018 increasing post anthesis biomass production is an effective approach for increasing crop yield shi et al 2016 wang et al 2016a biomass production is largely dependent on lai man et al 2017 with more biomass being produced due to higher lai in our study treatments with higher application rates of irrigation and nitrogen had higher lai and more biomass produced figs 3 and 4 correlation analysis also showed that grain yield was closely correlated with lai aboveground biomass and reproductive organ biomass fig 5 b c d this is another indication that appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application rates may result in optimal lai and aboveground biomass especially reproductive organ biomass and improved grain yield wheat grain yield was highly correlated with spike number and kernels per spike xu et al 2018 karam et al 2009 and xue et al 2006 reported that irrigation and nitrogen application significantly improved grain yield by increasing grain number per square meter in our study the spike number and kernels per spike increased significantly with increase in nitrogen application in both seasons in addition the close correlation between grain yield and spike number r2 of 0 78 and 0 62 for both seasons and grain yield and kernels per spike r2 of 0 94 and 0 9 for both seasons that are shown in fig 5 e and f indicate that improving spike number and kernels per spike may be the primary factors for increasing grain yield 4 3 wue iwue and npfp improving water and nitrogen use efficiencies are beneficial for the rational utilization of agricultural resources in our study the application of water and nitrogen significantly improved wue of winter wheat table 5 however excessive nitrogen application does not contribute to an increase in wue a finding supported by recent studies gao et al 2014 jha et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 with nitrogen application rates of 180 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 and 240 kg ha 1 in 2016 2017 the maximum wue was 2 27 and 2 23 kg m 3 in both seasons respectively supplementary table s3 this is clearly greater than the average wue of 1 45 kg m 3 for winter wheat with surface irrigation in the ncp zhang et al 2011 our results are supported by some studies showing that drip irrigation consumed less water when achieving comparable or higher yield as compared to traditional surface irrigation methods thus increased wue fang et al 2018 jha et al 2019 li et al 2018 the iwue increased with nitrogen application reaching the maximum at 240 kg ha 1 however the iwue decreased with more irrigation water because the increase in irrigation was greater than the increase in yield dar et al 2017 typically npfp increases with an increase in irrigation water pradhan et al 2013 and decreases with an increase in nitrogen application cui et al 2011 pradhan et al 2013 which is also consistent with our results although npfp were better in low nitrogen conditions significant decreases were found in grain yield wue and iwue when crop growth yield wue iwue and npfp are all considered together n3i1 is the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management scheme 5 conclusion the combination of nitrogen rate of 240 kg ha 1 and irrigation water quota of 40 mm per irrigation consistently resulted in the highest grain yield high wue and iwue without much reduction in npfp in the two growing seasons this may be considered the optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen application pattern for drip irrigated winter wheat production in the ncp more studies are required to determine the appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application pattern of drip irrigated winter wheat with various varieties as well as in different types of soil in the ncp author

10718,irrigation systems have in recent years attained a higher level of variety in as such that the selection and implementation of an irrigation system is based on the physical constraints of the site area thus giving way to a much more adequate irrigation efficiency with due regards to the water crisis in iran and subsequent drought conditions the implementing of similar irrigation systems in different regional conditions lacks any justification in the izeh plain the use of surface irrigation systems with minimal efficiency is very common in order to implement and operate modern irrigation systems and maximize water saving the site selection of pressurized irrigation systems was evaluated through the fusing of ahp and gis maps for a variety of pressurized irrigation systems followed by the selecting of the best irrigation system for each region in the current study physical and socio economic criteria were selected as the main criterion and were then classified into several sub criterions a drip irrigation system a gun irrigation system a center pivot irrigation system and a linear irrigation system were selected as the options utilized when using the ahp method the gun and center pivot irrigation systems had the least value as they were not suitable for mountainous area drip and linear irrigation systems were given a higher value and were suitable for implementation in most regions after comparing different sub criterion the drip irrigation system was identified as being the most suitable pressurized irrigation system for the izeh plain keywords mcdm gis water saving pressurized irrigation system 1 introduction water saving and the appropriate consumption of water resources in arid and semi arid regions are of primary importance careful planning is essential in order to be able to properly utilize water resources in order to meet this particular objective precision agriculture in the area is proposed since precision agriculture methods seek to optimize water management one of the methods applied in precision agriculture is the using of pressurized irrigation systems instead of traditional irrigation systems because a pressurized irrigation system can deliver water to plants more precisely currently through the application of a pressurized irrigation system one can increase water productivity and gain higher quality crops in regions with traditional irrigation systems the amount of water losses increase and hydrologists irrigation specialists believe that the installation and operation of pressurized irrigation systems instead of traditional irrigation systems has far better advantages the multi criteria decision making mcdm model takes into account a number of methods from which one may select the best option with due regards to the different variables one of the mcdm methods is that of saaty s 1977 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp has several advantages including over specification of judgment built in consistency tests the use of appropriate measurement scales and the applicability in elicitation of utility functions chen and huang 2004 conditional to the spatial variability of an area under study multi criteria decision making mcdm is integrated with geographic information system gis for better results many environmental and agricultural problems have been solved using ahp and gis including the identifying of groundwater potential zones and quality mallik et al 2020 nair nithya et al 2019 das and pal 2019 karakuş 2018 power site suitability ali et al 2018 giamalaki and tsoutsos 2019 koc et al 2019 land slide susceptibility abay et al 2019 and ranking different alternatives baffoe 2019 sharma et al 2018 based on the available literature on ahp and gis in the field of decision making for the selecting of the best region for the utilization of each pressurized irrigation system in order to attain higher efficiency water use this method was adopted in case studies in semi arid areas the application of traditional irrigation systems is very common with the increasing of drought conditions and lessening of precipitation the use of a pressurized irrigation system as a suitable alternative for a type of precision agricultural method manifests itself due to the fact that pressurized irrigation systems have less water losses and higher water productivity these irrigation methods are much more practical in drought conditions as seen in the case study carried out by the researchers the main objective of the current research is to select the most suitable pressurized irrigation system by means of ahp and gis in order to cope with drought conditions for each region the izeh plain contains different geological features including mountains and wetlands which create different physical conditions from region to region these physical conditions effect the site selection of different pressurized irrigation systems whats more the socio economic conditions of the area also effect site selection in the study region since urban and rural areas will have to deal differently with the new irrigation systems that have been implemented therefore socio economic conditions were considered as one of main criteria in the current study based on the physical and socio economic conditions of the study area different pressurized irrigation systems with different optimized operations were selected for each region through the application of ahp and gis in order to identify the most suitable region for each pressurized irrigation system 2 materials and method 2 1 characteristics of the study area the izeh plain is located at in the khuzestan province in the southwest part of iran at geographical longitude and latitude of 49ᵒ 45 to 49ᵒ 59 e and 31ᵒ 46 to 31ᵒ 57 n and encompassing an area of 11 080 5 km2 fig 1 the region has an average temperature of 30 c and the climate in the region is arid due to an annual evaporation rate of 1685 mm and 625 mm annual precipitation in the izeh plain khuzestan water and power authority 2018 the izeh plain is flat with a slope varying from 2 to 5 percent the soil texture is loamy and surface water classified as c3s1 water quality class khuzestan water and power authority 2018 during the study irrigation systems such as gun irrigation systems linear irrigation systems center pivot irrigation systems and drip irrigation systems were taken into account when selecting the most suitable sites for different irrigation systems in the izeh plain two wetlands locally known as the miangaran wetlands and the bondoun wetlands are located in the izeh plain the miangaran wetland is located 1 5 km north of the city of izeh encompassing an area of 2500 ha and the bondoun wetlands which are located 3 km south of the city encompass 1300 ha these two wetlands play an important role in environmental conservation and surface water retention the zagros mountains are located along the the northern and southern parts of the izeh plain the highest elevation of the plain is 342 m it is of note that the existing of mountainous areas will have an effect on site selection and the implementing of a suitable irrigation system 2 2 methodology overview to locate suitable sites for various irrigation systems an analytic hierarchy process ahp integrated with gis was used fig 2 shows the methodology flowchart for site selection of different pressurized irrigation systems socio economic criterion and physical criterion are the two main criteria applied in the model to determine suitable sites for each pressurized irrigation system physical criterions include five sub criteria namely crop climate water soil and topography each physical sub criterion is then classified into several sub criterions due to the variation in elevation in different parts of the study area the sub criterion related to topography was classified into elevation difference land slope sub criterion water is the main criterion for selecting an irrigation system therefore water sub criterion was classified into many sub criterion including the existence of suspended materials concentration of sodium existence of biological materials availability of water ec and ph pressurized irrigation systems especially the sprinkler type are affected by factors such as the climatic conditions of the study area wind velocity and temperature which are the two sub criterion of climate a pressurized irrigation system must be implemented and operated in appropriate soil characteristics these characteristics include soil texture and infiltration which were considered as sub criteria for soil crop conditions such as crop density crop type and crop pests are considered as crop sub criterion which can affect the operating of the pressurized irrigation systems socio economic criterion have been classified into four main sub criterion that is to say the acceptability of an irrigation system technical support requirements system costs and labour skills 3 data analysis 3 1 analytical hierarchy process and weighting in order to evaluate the suitability of a given site a weight was assigned for each sub criterion weighting expresses the criterion degree of relevance or preference relative to the others the process is achieved through the pairwise comparison between the elements for each hierarchical level saaty 1980 the pairwise comparison employed a semantic 9 point scale for the assignment of priority values 1 3 5 7 and 9 corresponding respectively to values defined as equally moderately strongly very strongly and extremely important criterion when compared with other numbers 2 4 6 and 8 are intermediate values the assignment of preference values is based on consultation with specialist and the reviewing of technical documents and published international guidelines fig 3 shows the analytical hierarchy process ahp structure for selecting a suitable irrigation system in the region 3 2 consistency ratio cr the consistency ratio controls the decision consistency for each decision matrix the quotient of consistency index to inconsistency index of a stochastic matrix of the same vector is taken as the criterion to judge the decision inconsistency in cases where the ratio is less than 0 1 the system has an acceptable consistency saaty 1980 otherwise judgments must be repeated and a new comparison matrix is created in the present study the evaluation of a decision consistency was performed for each of the matrices developed based on saaty 1980 the consistency ratio cr is defined as the quotient between the consistency index ci and the random index ri as defined in eq 1 1 cr ci ri the consistency index ci is determined using the following eq 2 2 ci λmax n n 1 where n is the criteria number and λmax is the maximum value of eigen vector the random index ri is obtained from table 1 created by oak ridge national laboratory saaty 1980 the main logic behind using ri is that the cr is a normalized value since it is divided by an arithmetic mean of random matrix consistency indices alonso and lamata 2006 consistency ratio less than 0 1 is considered acceptable if the cr was higher than 0 1 the generated weights have to be revised until the cr is less than 0 1 3 3 sub criterion layering using gis for layering each sub criterion via gis data was gathered from satellite images and official sources satellite images were used for extracting physical sub criteria maps dem slope climate and etc and official sources such as the khuzestan water and power authority kwpa were used for developing socio economic criteria maps using geo statistical tools like the kriging method most of the physical criterion were interpolated and were processed as a raster layer in order to assign the weights obtained by ahp for socio economic maps each layer was developed through the input provided by ten local socio economic experts fig 4 shows some of the physical and socio economic sub criterion layer maps extracted via gis 4 results 4 1 weights obtained by the analytical hierarchy process ahp selecting the most suitable sites for implementing different pressurized irrigation systems is carried out by calculating the weight of each criterion and sub criterion using the analytical hierarchy process ahp the weight of each criterion and sub criterion was calculated based on saaty s scale mentioned in the previous section appendix a shows the results of the calculated weights for the pressurized irrigation systems under consideration in this research appendix a reveals that the sub criterion of cost in the socio economic criterion has the highest weight as compared with other sub criteria this is because of the economic conditions of the study area which can affect the outcome of the benefit gained from implementing a pressurized irrigation system even though these systems can increase water retention and water use efficiency drip irrigation system function when activated by operating emitters therefore a drip irrigation system is more effected by the cost sub criterion a gun irrigation system has a higher weight factor in the sub criterion related to skilled labour and the acceptability of the irrigation system criteria skilled labor and the acceptability of the irrigation system criteria show a higher weight factor for solid set irrigation because modern and automated systems have not yet been installed in the study area physical criterion includes the topography climate water soil and crop sub criterion these criteria could have an effect on the operation of pressurized irrigation systems in the study area as shown in the aforementioned table the criterion related to topography has less weight when compared to other irrigation systems because according to the responses given to the questionnaire given to the hydrologists mountainous areas were allocated a high priority status for the implementing of a drip irrigation system in terms of the criterion related to climate wind velocity has less weight for drip irrigation systems yet it has a higher weight for other irrigation systems which reveals that these irrigation systems are affected by wind velocity in the study area water criteria were classified into several sub criterions which have the greatest effect on site selection of the irrigation system under consideration water quality conditions can effect the clogging of the emitters therefore a drip irrigation system has less weight in this sub criterion while a gun irrigation system has a higher weight factor due to it having a high pressure nozzle soil and crop sub criteria are the most influential for physical sub criterion causing a higher weight effect on the implementing and operating of pressurized irrigation systems soil characteristics vary significantly over different parts of the study area and a variety of crops are also to be observed hence a drip irrigation system is much more viable when implemented in light soil texture and other irrigation systems can be implemented in areas with moderate to heavy soil texture however a gun irrigation system is much more preferred in moderate soil texture for the criterion related to crop it was observed that every irrigation system considered has different mechanisms for irrigation and the questionnaire provided showed that any decision made must consider crop sub criteria and the irrigation mechanisms of the irrigation system the weights and matrices of each criterion and sub criterion were calculated and applied for the site selection of the appropriate irrigation system the calculated weights were validated via a consistency ratio the consistency ratios were lower than 0 1 and the pair wise comparison matrix and the weights are therefore acceptable 4 2 spatial distribution of the calculated weights after calculating the weights of each criterion and sub criterion using ahp the weights were assigned to each related layer on the gis map to determine the most appropriate sites for the pressurized irrigation system under consideration fig 3 shows the site selection of different pressurized irrigation systems the wetlands urban centers and mountainous areas are shown in the maps and these sections do not take the evaluation of the irrigation systems into consideration according to the obtained maps class 4 is related to the low quality of the considered irrigation system classes 5 and 6 are related to moderate and good qualities respectively considering the main physical criterion and according to fig 5 a most of the mountainous areas of the izeh plain are classified as areas of high value and are suitable for implementing a drip irrigation system the socio economic conditions of the study area are significant for the implementing of the drip irrigation system therefore all the regions around the urban area are classified as areas of high value for the installing of a drip irrigation system a small mountainous area with a high slope is considered in the area categorized as low class due to its distance from the city of izeh city since it fails meet the requirement of logistics and equipment support fig 5 b shows the site selection of the center pivot irrigation system the socio economic conditions of the area under study could affect the center pivot irrigation system s efficiency based on the criteria for the center pivot irrigation system the most appropriate area selected was the mountainous area which is classified as the area of low value for this irrigation system fig 5 c shows the gun irrigation system which is affected by physical criteria more than socio economic criteria therefore mountainous areas are classified as low value regions for this particular irrigation system in the southern part of the izeh plain the regions between the mountains and wetland are classified as areas of low value due to its critical physical slope and topography conditions the regions around the city of izeh have acceptable socio economic conditions for the implementing of a solid set irrigation system and are thus classified as areas of high value fig 5 d shows a linear irrigation system according to the figure a linear irrigation system can be implemented and operated around wetlands and urban centers mountainous areas are classified as low value for this irrigation system this reveals that a linear irrigation system is affected by physical criterion more than socio economic criterion table 2 represents the percentage of specified areas for each irrigation system which reveals that drip irrigation systems and center pivot pressure irrigation systems dominate with the highest percentage of a suitable site in class 6 and 5 respectively due to the arid conditions of the study area the drip irrigation system acquires the highest percentage in class 5 and 6 and is selected as the most suitable modernized irrigation system for the area under study 5 discussion based on the drought conditions imposed upon the study area water retention has become a major issue and an efficient proposed solution is the saving of water in the agricultural sector precision agriculture is among one of the best way to saving water which it does by replacing old irrigating methods with modern irrigation systems surface irrigation systems are the most commonly used irrigation systems within the study area which have a low efficiency therefore ahp combined with gis was utilized in order to develop a working model to replace old methods of irrigation with new irrigation systems the physical conditions of the study area such as water climate soil and etc are different in many parts so physical conditions were considered as being the main criterion for site selection for the majority of suitable irrigation systems proposed since these irrigation systems were newly suggested in the study area socio economic conditions such as the acceptability of an irrigation system its cost and etc were considered in site selection evaluations the study area was either mountainous flator was near urban centers which all affected the site selection of the pressurized irrigation systems after calculating the weight factors using ahp and superimposing them on gis maps the most suitable regions for implementing pressurized irrigation systems were obtained based on the obtained maps the mountainous regions were deemed appropriate for implementing a drip irrigation system and the flatt plain area was considered to be appropriate for implementing center pivot linear and gun irrigation systems although a drip irrigation system is also a viable option for flat plain regions yet the high cost of implementing a drip irrigation system as compared to the other pressurized irrigation systems indicates that it would be far more advantageous to utilize other pressurized irrigation systems in the plain area naseri et al 2009 albaji et al 2009 and albaji et al 2015 found similar results 6 conclusions utilizing ahp and super imposing the results onto gis maps provides practical maps for identifying areas for the implementation of pressurized irrigation systems in a region this in itself has the implication of being able to deliver water to the plant more precisely thus diminishing water loss and increasing the efficiency of irrigation in a region multi criteria decision making based on a variety of factors will effect site selection for determining the most appropriate irrigation system in a specified region using this approach two main criteria were considered for the study area physical and socio economic criteria the two main criteria were then classified into several sub criterion which made the site selection more precise while considering different possible aspects ultimately it was found that utilizing a drip irrigation system is the most suitable option for most regions of the study area it is further proposed that other

10718,irrigation systems have in recent years attained a higher level of variety in as such that the selection and implementation of an irrigation system is based on the physical constraints of the site area thus giving way to a much more adequate irrigation efficiency with due regards to the water crisis in iran and subsequent drought conditions the implementing of similar irrigation systems in different regional conditions lacks any justification in the izeh plain the use of surface irrigation systems with minimal efficiency is very common in order to implement and operate modern irrigation systems and maximize water saving the site selection of pressurized irrigation systems was evaluated through the fusing of ahp and gis maps for a variety of pressurized irrigation systems followed by the selecting of the best irrigation system for each region in the current study physical and socio economic criteria were selected as the main criterion and were then classified into several sub criterions a drip irrigation system a gun irrigation system a center pivot irrigation system and a linear irrigation system were selected as the options utilized when using the ahp method the gun and center pivot irrigation systems had the least value as they were not suitable for mountainous area drip and linear irrigation systems were given a higher value and were suitable for implementation in most regions after comparing different sub criterion the drip irrigation system was identified as being the most suitable pressurized irrigation system for the izeh plain keywords mcdm gis water saving pressurized irrigation system 1 introduction water saving and the appropriate consumption of water resources in arid and semi arid regions are of primary importance careful planning is essential in order to be able to properly utilize water resources in order to meet this particular objective precision agriculture in the area is proposed since precision agriculture methods seek to optimize water management one of the methods applied in precision agriculture is the using of pressurized irrigation systems instead of traditional irrigation systems because a pressurized irrigation system can deliver water to plants more precisely currently through the application of a pressurized irrigation system one can increase water productivity and gain higher quality crops in regions with traditional irrigation systems the amount of water losses increase and hydrologists irrigation specialists believe that the installation and operation of pressurized irrigation systems instead of traditional irrigation systems has far better advantages the multi criteria decision making mcdm model takes into account a number of methods from which one may select the best option with due regards to the different variables one of the mcdm methods is that of saaty s 1977 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp has several advantages including over specification of judgment built in consistency tests the use of appropriate measurement scales and the applicability in elicitation of utility functions chen and huang 2004 conditional to the spatial variability of an area under study multi criteria decision making mcdm is integrated with geographic information system gis for better results many environmental and agricultural problems have been solved using ahp and gis including the identifying of groundwater potential zones and quality mallik et al 2020 nair nithya et al 2019 das and pal 2019 karakuş 2018 power site suitability ali et al 2018 giamalaki and tsoutsos 2019 koc et al 2019 land slide susceptibility abay et al 2019 and ranking different alternatives baffoe 2019 sharma et al 2018 based on the available literature on ahp and gis in the field of decision making for the selecting of the best region for the utilization of each pressurized irrigation system in order to attain higher efficiency water use this method was adopted in case studies in semi arid areas the application of traditional irrigation systems is very common with the increasing of drought conditions and lessening of precipitation the use of a pressurized irrigation system as a suitable alternative for a type of precision agricultural method manifests itself due to the fact that pressurized irrigation systems have less water losses and higher water productivity these irrigation methods are much more practical in drought conditions as seen in the case study carried out by the researchers the main objective of the current research is to select the most suitable pressurized irrigation system by means of ahp and gis in order to cope with drought conditions for each region the izeh plain contains different geological features including mountains and wetlands which create different physical conditions from region to region these physical conditions effect the site selection of different pressurized irrigation systems whats more the socio economic conditions of the area also effect site selection in the study region since urban and rural areas will have to deal differently with the new irrigation systems that have been implemented therefore socio economic conditions were considered as one of main criteria in the current study based on the physical and socio economic conditions of the study area different pressurized irrigation systems with different optimized operations were selected for each region through the application of ahp and gis in order to identify the most suitable region for each pressurized irrigation system 2 materials and method 2 1 characteristics of the study area the izeh plain is located at in the khuzestan province in the southwest part of iran at geographical longitude and latitude of 49ᵒ 45 to 49ᵒ 59 e and 31ᵒ 46 to 31ᵒ 57 n and encompassing an area of 11 080 5 km2 fig 1 the region has an average temperature of 30 c and the climate in the region is arid due to an annual evaporation rate of 1685 mm and 625 mm annual precipitation in the izeh plain khuzestan water and power authority 2018 the izeh plain is flat with a slope varying from 2 to 5 percent the soil texture is loamy and surface water classified as c3s1 water quality class khuzestan water and power authority 2018 during the study irrigation systems such as gun irrigation systems linear irrigation systems center pivot irrigation systems and drip irrigation systems were taken into account when selecting the most suitable sites for different irrigation systems in the izeh plain two wetlands locally known as the miangaran wetlands and the bondoun wetlands are located in the izeh plain the miangaran wetland is located 1 5 km north of the city of izeh encompassing an area of 2500 ha and the bondoun wetlands which are located 3 km south of the city encompass 1300 ha these two wetlands play an important role in environmental conservation and surface water retention the zagros mountains are located along the the northern and southern parts of the izeh plain the highest elevation of the plain is 342 m it is of note that the existing of mountainous areas will have an effect on site selection and the implementing of a suitable irrigation system 2 2 methodology overview to locate suitable sites for various irrigation systems an analytic hierarchy process ahp integrated with gis was used fig 2 shows the methodology flowchart for site selection of different pressurized irrigation systems socio economic criterion and physical criterion are the two main criteria applied in the model to determine suitable sites for each pressurized irrigation system physical criterions include five sub criteria namely crop climate water soil and topography each physical sub criterion is then classified into several sub criterions due to the variation in elevation in different parts of the study area the sub criterion related to topography was classified into elevation difference land slope sub criterion water is the main criterion for selecting an irrigation system therefore water sub criterion was classified into many sub criterion including the existence of suspended materials concentration of sodium existence of biological materials availability of water ec and ph pressurized irrigation systems especially the sprinkler type are affected by factors such as the climatic conditions of the study area wind velocity and temperature which are the two sub criterion of climate a pressurized irrigation system must be implemented and operated in appropriate soil characteristics these characteristics include soil texture and infiltration which were considered as sub criteria for soil crop conditions such as crop density crop type and crop pests are considered as crop sub criterion which can affect the operating of the pressurized irrigation systems socio economic criterion have been classified into four main sub criterion that is to say the acceptability of an irrigation system technical support requirements system costs and labour skills 3 data analysis 3 1 analytical hierarchy process and weighting in order to evaluate the suitability of a given site a weight was assigned for each sub criterion weighting expresses the criterion degree of relevance or preference relative to the others the process is achieved through the pairwise comparison between the elements for each hierarchical level saaty 1980 the pairwise comparison employed a semantic 9 point scale for the assignment of priority values 1 3 5 7 and 9 corresponding respectively to values defined as equally moderately strongly very strongly and extremely important criterion when compared with other numbers 2 4 6 and 8 are intermediate values the assignment of preference values is based on consultation with specialist and the reviewing of technical documents and published international guidelines fig 3 shows the analytical hierarchy process ahp structure for selecting a suitable irrigation system in the region 3 2 consistency ratio cr the consistency ratio controls the decision consistency for each decision matrix the quotient of consistency index to inconsistency index of a stochastic matrix of the same vector is taken as the criterion to judge the decision inconsistency in cases where the ratio is less than 0 1 the system has an acceptable consistency saaty 1980 otherwise judgments must be repeated and a new comparison matrix is created in the present study the evaluation of a decision consistency was performed for each of the matrices developed based on saaty 1980 the consistency ratio cr is defined as the quotient between the consistency index ci and the random index ri as defined in eq 1 1 cr ci ri the consistency index ci is determined using the following eq 2 2 ci λmax n n 1 where n is the criteria number and λmax is the maximum value of eigen vector the random index ri is obtained from table 1 created by oak ridge national laboratory saaty 1980 the main logic behind using ri is that the cr is a normalized value since it is divided by an arithmetic mean of random matrix consistency indices alonso and lamata 2006 consistency ratio less than 0 1 is considered acceptable if the cr was higher than 0 1 the generated weights have to be revised until the cr is less than 0 1 3 3 sub criterion layering using gis for layering each sub criterion via gis data was gathered from satellite images and official sources satellite images were used for extracting physical sub criteria maps dem slope climate and etc and official sources such as the khuzestan water and power authority kwpa were used for developing socio economic criteria maps using geo statistical tools like the kriging method most of the physical criterion were interpolated and were processed as a raster layer in order to assign the weights obtained by ahp for socio economic maps each layer was developed through the input provided by ten local socio economic experts fig 4 shows some of the physical and socio economic sub criterion layer maps extracted via gis 4 results 4 1 weights obtained by the analytical hierarchy process ahp selecting the most suitable sites for implementing different pressurized irrigation systems is carried out by calculating the weight of each criterion and sub criterion using the analytical hierarchy process ahp the weight of each criterion and sub criterion was calculated based on saaty s scale mentioned in the previous section appendix a shows the results of the calculated weights for the pressurized irrigation systems under consideration in this research appendix a reveals that the sub criterion of cost in the socio economic criterion has the highest weight as compared with other sub criteria this is because of the economic conditions of the study area which can affect the outcome of the benefit gained from implementing a pressurized irrigation system even though these systems can increase water retention and water use efficiency drip irrigation system function when activated by operating emitters therefore a drip irrigation system is more effected by the cost sub criterion a gun irrigation system has a higher weight factor in the sub criterion related to skilled

texture for the criterion related to crop it was observed that every irrigation system considered has different mechanisms for irrigation and the questionnaire provided showed that any decision made must consider crop sub criteria and the irrigation mechanisms of the irrigation system the weights and matrices of each criterion and sub criterion were calculated and applied for the site selection of the appropriate irrigation system the calculated weights were validated via a consistency ratio the consistency ratios were lower than 0 1 and the pair wise comparison matrix and the weights are therefore acceptable 4 2 spatial distribution of the calculated weights after calculating the weights of each criterion and sub criterion using ahp the weights were assigned to each related layer on the gis map to determine the most appropriate sites for the pressurized irrigation system under consideration fig 3 shows the site selection of different pressurized irrigation systems the wetlands urban centers and mountainous areas are shown in the maps and these sections do not take the evaluation of the irrigation systems into consideration according to the obtained maps class 4 is related to the low quality of the considered irrigation system classes 5 and 6 are related to moderate and good qualities respectively considering the main physical criterion and according to fig 5 a most of the mountainous areas of the izeh plain are classified as areas of high value and are suitable for implementing a drip irrigation system the socio economic conditions of the study area are significant for the implementing of the drip irrigation system therefore all the regions around the urban area are classified as areas of high value for the installing of a drip irrigation system a small mountainous area with a high slope is considered in the area categorized as low class due to its distance from the city of izeh city since it fails meet the requirement of logistics and equipment support fig 5 b shows the site selection of the center pivot irrigation system the socio economic conditions of the area under study could affect the center pivot irrigation system s efficiency based on the criteria for the center pivot irrigation system the most appropriate area selected was the mountainous area which is classified as the area of low value for this irrigation system fig 5 c shows the gun irrigation system which is affected by physical criteria more than socio economic criteria therefore mountainous areas are classified as low value regions for this particular irrigation system in the southern part of the izeh plain the regions between the mountains and wetland are classified as areas of low value due to its critical physical slope and topography conditions the regions around the city of izeh have acceptable socio economic conditions for the implementing of a solid set irrigation system and are thus classified as areas of high value fig 5 d shows a linear irrigation system according to the figure a linear irrigation system can be implemented and operated around wetlands and urban centers mountainous areas are classified as low value for this irrigation system this reveals that a linear irrigation system is affected by physical criterion more than socio economic criterion table 2 represents the percentage of specified areas for each irrigation system which reveals that drip irrigation systems and center pivot pressure irrigation systems dominate with the highest percentage of a suitable site in class 6 and 5 respectively due to the arid conditions of the study area the drip irrigation system acquires the highest percentage in class 5 and 6 and is selected as the most suitable modernized irrigation system for the area under study 5 discussion based

people and is the major dryland farming area of china chen et al 2015 limited rainfall and high evaporation constrain agricultural development in this region liu et al 2009 ye and liu 2012 conventional plowing loosens the soil and causes the soil to be overexposed to air during fallow periods leading to loss of water and rapid release of nutrients from soil organic matter that are susceptible to loss thierfelder and wall 2009 many agricultural management practices to improve crop production in dryland regions have been tested over the past few decades with one of the most successful being conservation tillage ct conservation tillage is characterized by no or minimal mechanical soil disturbance and permanent organic soil cover friedrich et al 2017 conservation tillage systems have increased in use from 5 3 106 million ha from 1990 to 2009 kassam et al 2009 although ct can reduce control of perennial weeds gill and arshad 1995 and reduce the rate of early crop growth due to lower soil temperatures in the spring gupta et al 1988 it can reduce wind erosion gao et al 2016 and water erosion bertol et al 2003 improve soil physical properties khan et al 2017 increase rainfall infiltration jakab et al 2017 reduce evaporation mitchell et al 2012 enhance water use and improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue therefore ct is regarded as an effective approach to managing agroecosystems for improved and sustained productivity wheat triticum aestivum l yield is low and unstable in the loess plateau especially in the semiarid loess plateau where soil moisture is a limiting factor for crop production wan et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 the harvested yield of spring wheat in this region is far less than potential yield ranging from 1500 to 3000 kg ha 1 huang et al 2005 wang et al 2009 yeboah et al 2016 therefore improving grain yield and maximizing wue are major goals for advancing sustainable intensification of wheat production in this region that will have great impact at local and regional scales wang et al 2018 rainfall is the only source of water for crop production in semiarid loess plateau precipitation use efficiency pue can be used as

precipitation use in ct thereby providing a theoretical basis for the study and development of ct in the semiarid loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was conducted in 2015 and 2016 based on a long term field experiment initiated in 2001 the experiment was located at the rainfed agricultural experimental station 35 28 n 104 44 e elevation 1971 m above sea level of gansu agricultural university in gansu province in northwestern china a typical semiarid and rainfed area on the western loess plateau the area is characterized by a hilly landscape and is prone to soil erosion the aeolian soil at the experimental site is locally known as huangmian gong 2001 is a calcaric cambisol according to the fao soil classification fao 1990 and is primarily used for annual crop production this soil has a sandy loam texture with 50 sand daily maximum air temperature at the experimental site can reach 38 in july while minimum air temperature can drop to 22 in january long term climatic records show that annual cumulative air temperature 10 is 2240 and annual radiation is 5930 mj m 2 with 2480 h of sunshine per year average annual evaporation at the experimental site is 1531 mm coefficient of variation 24 3 which is three to four fold greater than precipitation the wilting coefficient in 0 200 cm soil depth for spring wheat was 189 mm and the maximum soil water holding capacity was 554 mm huang et al 2008 soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil depth in 2001 was described in huang et al 2008 the initial soil properties in the experimental field are shown in table 1 huang et al 2008 annual precipitation from post harvest august through harvest july of spring wheat at the experimental site was 442 330 and 398 mm in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and for the 2001 2014 average respectively and is shown monthly in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and crop management the experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications each plot was 4 m wide 20

in this study were made from plots planted to wheat there were six treatments in the experiment including conventional tillage with no straw t no till with straw cover nts no till with no straw nt conventional tillage with straw incorporated ts conventional tillage with plastic mulch tp and no till with plastic mulch ntp tillage practices and field management are described in huang et al 2008 tillage practices for the t ts and tp treatments involved moldboard plowing to a depth of 20 cm in the fall followed by harrowing in the spring prior to sowing all residues from the previous crops were retained for the ts and nts treatments plastic mulch polyethylene colorless 0 08 mm thickness 40 cm width application is shown in figs 2 a b and c the spring wheat and pea cultivars were dingxi 40 and lvnong 2 respectively wheat was sown at a rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 in rows spaced 20 cm apart and pea was seeded at 180 kg ha 1 in rows spaced 24 cm apart all treatments were fertilized with calcium superphosphate 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 for wheat and pea and urea 105 and 20 kg n ha 1 for wheat and pea respectively at sowing the treatments with plastic mulch were sown and fertilized with a local machine figs 2a and c and the treatments with no plastic mulch were sown and fertilized with a no till drill figs 2d e and f spring wheat was sown using a no till drill on 25 march 2015 and 27 march 2016 and harvested on 1 august in 2015 and 25 july in 2016 weeds were removed by hand during the growing season and controlled with herbicides during the fallow period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil physical properties and nutrient contents soil physical properties and nutrient contents were only measured at sowing in 2015 soil bulk density was measured in a beveled stainless steel ring gregorich and carter 2007 for the 0 5 5 10 and 10 30 cm soil layers before sowing of spring wheat in 2015 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements for the surface layer 0 5 cm were determined using the single head pressure ring infiltrometer method before sowing of spring wheat in 2015 reynolds and elrick 2002 three soil cores 4 5 cm inner diameter were taken randomly within each plot from the 0 5 5 10 and 10 30 cm soil depths before sowing of spring wheat in 2015 for measurement of soil nutrient contents soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 0 mm sieve available phosphorus p was determined using the olsen method olsen 1954 dried samples weighing 5 g each were added to 50 ml of 2 m kcl shaken for 60 min and analyzed with a fiastar 5000 analyzer foss tecator sweden for nitrate n no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n soil organic carbon c concentration was determined by wet oxidation with k2cr2o7 and h2so4 nelson and sommers 1996 2 3 2 precipitation soil water content and evapotranspiration daily precipitation was measured with a rainfall canister at the experimental site soil water content was measured at one location in each plot after tillage and before sowing wheat 20 march 2015 and 26 march 2016 and after wheat harvest 28 july 2014 4 august 2015 and 26 july in 2016 using the oven drying method o kelly 2004 for the 0 5 and 5 10 cm soil layers and a time domain reflectometry soil moisture sensor trime pico iph t3 imko gmbh ettlingen germany for the 10 30 30 50 50 80 80 110 110 140 140 170 and 170 200 cm soil layers volumetric moisture content for the 0 5 and 5 10 cm soil depths was calculated by multiplying weight moisture content by the corresponding soil bulk density evapotranspiration was calculated using the following equation zhang et al 2008a 1 e t δ t i p δ t s w d r c r d where et t is evapotranspiration during the crop growth period mm i is irrigation p t is precipitation mm during the crop growth period and swd is water storage mm at the start minus that at the end of a given time period for the 0 200 cm depth r is runoff cr is capillary rise to the root zone and d is drainage from the root zone because the experiment was performed under dryland conditions no irrigation was applied to spring wheat surface runoff was considered negligible because water flow was prevented by border dikes around each plot since the groundwater was buried at a depth of 38 40 m huang et al 2010 capillary rise to the root zone and drainage from the root zone were also considered negligible li 1983 soil evaporation was measured with a micro evaporator made from polyvinylchloride tubing with a length of 150 mm internal diameter of 110 mm and external diameter of 115 mm plauborg 1995 one tube per plot was installed between two rows to remove undisturbed soil at 07 00 h with plastic film used to seal the base of the undisturbed soil differences in inter and intra row soil evaporation were considered negligible because spring wheat was in narrow rows at a high plant density and had rapid canopy coverage of the soil surface after sowing on the sampling day the soil mass of the micro evaporator was weighed using an electronic balance with a sensitivity of 0 01 g returned back to its original location in the field and measured again at 07 00 h on the following day the loss in mass was the amount of evaporation equivalent to 0 1051 mm g 1 soil inside the micro evaporator was changed every 3 d and after precipitation by emptying the soil from the tube and placing the tube in a new location in the field to ensure that soil moisture inside the micro evaporator was consistent with the surrounding soil the calculation of evaporation during a given growth period was based on the daily average evaporation measured during the growth period multiplied by the number of days during the growth period without precipitation the amount of transpiration during a growing season is the sum of that for all growth periods in the growing season using following equation eberbach et al 2011 2 t δ t e t δ t e δ t where t t is transpiration during a crop growth period et t is evapotranspiration during a crop growth period and e t is soil evaporation during a crop growth period 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation yield and precipitation use efficiency aboveground dm was measured at five growth stages of spring wheat including the seedling 9 may 2015 and 30 april 2016 tillering 24 may 2015 and 20 may 2016 jointing 7 june 2015 and 30 may 2016 flowering 25 june 2015 and 15 june 2016 and maturity 1 august 2015 and 25 july 2016 stages by harvesting all aboveground dm from a 50 cm length of row from three randomly selected rows in each plot sampled biomass was placed in an oven at 105 for 30 min and then at 80 for 48 h and then weighed after wheat reached physiological maturity the edges 0 5 m of each plot were trimmed and discarded then the entire remaining portion of each plot was harvested manually using sickles at 5 cm above the ground at the same time the number of spikes were counted from a 50 cm length of row from three randomly selected rows in each plot grains per spike was counted from 20 randomly selected spikes in each plot aboveground biomass was weighed before threshing and a subsample of aboveground biomass was collected from each plot and placed in an oven at 105 for 30 min and then at 80 for 48 h and then weighed to determine moisture content which was used to calculate dry biomass yield by before threshing grain moisture content after threshing was determined for each plot based on the mean of five measurements with a pm 8188 grain moisture meter kett electric lab tokyo japan grain yield gy was calculated at 130 g kg 1 moisture content all straw and chaff for treatments with straw retention were returned to the original plots immediately after threshing harvest index hi was calculated using following equation wang et al 2018 yin et al 2017 4 h i g y b y efficiency chain as developed by liu 1997 hsiao et al 2007 and lin et al 2019 is an effective way to analyze the process of crop water use in the field the overall efficiency of any process consisting of a chain of sequential steps is the product of the efficiencies output input ratios of each of the individual component steps hsiao et al 2007 lin et al 2019 liu 1997 biomass accumulation and the distribution of photosynthate to grain are important for yield formation but these studies did not introduce by and hi into the efficiency chain so we optimized the efficiency chain we defined pue as the ratio of gy to annual precipitation p and divided pue into five steps by means of a systematic and quantitative approach precipitation use efficiency was calculated using following equations 5 p u e g y p 6 p u e s w p e t c s w t c e t c b y t c h i 7 s w s w b p r d where pue is annual precipitation use efficiency p is annual precipitation tc is transpiration during

chicago usa analysis of variance was conducted for all dependent variables year and tillage practice were considered fixed effects and replication was considered a random effect differences among means were determined using tukey s honestly significant different test 3 results 3 1 soil physical properties and nutrient contents soil physiochemical properties were significantly affected by tillage practices following 14 yr of different tillage practices table 2 in the 0 5 cm soil depth nts had the significantly lowest bulk density and highest saturated hydraulic conductivity organic matter mineral n and available p similar responses of soil physiochemical properties to tillage practices were observed in the 5 10 and 10 30 cm soil depths 3 2 effect of tillage practices on soil water storage before sowing and after harvest soil water storage varied with tillage practice measuring time and growing season fig 3 averaged across the two seasons soil water storage before sowing with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 12 and 11 compared to t however nt ts and tp didn t significantly improve soil water storage before sowing compared to t soil water storage with conservation tillage practices was not significantly different compared to t after harvest data not shown 3 3 effect of tillage practices on water consumption of wheat field during growing season evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration during the growing season were affected by tillage practice table 3 over the two years evapotranspiration during the growing season with ntp was the highest but nts nt ts and tp were not significantly different from each other soil evaporation during the growing season with nts ts tp and ntp were significantly decreased by 14 9 48 and 47 respectively compared to t transpiration with nts tp and ntp was significantly increased by 24 34 and 59 during the growing season respectively compared to t 3 4 effect of tillage practices on biomass accumulation and grain yield tillage practice significantly affected dm of wheat fig 4 in 2015 the nts and ntp treatments significantly increased dm compared to t at all growth stages in 2016 on average dm with nts tp and ntp at all growth stages was significantly increased by 16 81 26 87 and 61 105 respectively compared to t thousand grain weight was not affected by tillage practice table 4 harvest index spikes per area grains per spike grain yield and by were significantly affected by tillage practice in 2015 spikes per area grain yield and hi with nts was significantly greater compared to the other treatments but grains per spike and by with ntp were significantly higher than those of the other treatments on average spikes per area with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 57 and 28 respectively compared to t grains per spike with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 11 and 28 respectively compared to t when compared to t grain yield with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 45 and 41 respectively and by with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 36 and 49 respectively 3 5 effect of tillage practices on precipitation use efficiency

different compared to t in 2015 2016 on average when compared to t transpiration efficiency with nts and ts was significantly increased while that with nt tp and ntp was significantly decreased precipitation use efficiency with nts ts and ntp was significantly increased compared to t while that with nt and tp did not differ compared to t in 2014 2015 table 5 in 2015 2016 when compared to t pue with nts tp and ntp was significantly increased while that with nt was significantly decreased and ts was not significantly different on average nts and ntp had the greatest pue which was 43 and 39 higher than that with t 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage practices on soil physiochemical properties and water storage in the early stage of this long term experiment nts was found to significantly reduce soil bulk density compared to t zhang et al 2008b ten years later in this research nts not only maintained the lowest soil bulk density but also had the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity soil organic matter soil mineral n and soil available p this was probably because mulching reduced the impact of rain on the soil the soil settlement had stabilized and the pores of crop root growth had been well preserved due to long term no till peng et al 2018 increased soil saturated hydraulic conductivity may have been due to decreased soil bulk density and increased soil organic matter cai et al 2012 soil water storage at sowing is of great importance for germination and seedling establishment this research found that the nts and ntp treatments significantly improved soil water storage before sowing compared to t in agreement with previous research liu et al 2009 wang et al 2012 yin et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 this was probably because nts improved soil physical properties especially saturated hydraulic conductivity compared to t thus increasing precipitation infiltration additionally the straw mulch and plastic film mulching reduced soil evaporation also in agreement with previous research bussiere 1994 chen et al 2010 chung and horton 1987 li et al 2013 meena 2018 soil water storage with nt was not significantly improved in this study but a study in israel with 237 mm of annual precipitation found that soil water storage with nt was significantly improved compared to t bonfil et al 1999 the discrepancy with the present study is likely due to substantially lower precipitation in their study wang et al wang et al 2003b found that soil water storage with ts was not significantly improved compared to t in the semiarid regions of northern china as shown in this study meanwhile zhang et al 2011 found that conventional tillage with plastic mulch did not significantly improve soil water storage before sowing compared to t in accordance with the result in this study this implies that nts can help improve soil physiochemical properties especially in the long run and store more water before sowing thereby provide better soil environment for crop germination and seedling establishment 4 2 effect of tillage practices on biomass accumulation and grain yield stored stem reserves serve as a source of carbon for grain filling in wheat cruz aguado et al 2000 therefore aboveground biomass accumulation is the basis for yield formation the ntp treatment significantly increased soil water content thus enhancing biomass accumulation which is consistent with the findings of previous studies huang et al 2008 li et al 2018 the nts treatment increased soil water content and nutrient availability and reduced soil bulk density confirming the findings from previous research cai et al 2012 li et al 2005 luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2008a as a result nts leads to significant increases in biomass accumulation which is in agreement with results from previous studies blanco canqui and lal 2007 li et al 1999 mitchell et al 2012 wang et al 2003a 2010 zhao et al 2016 however mrabet 2002 found that winter wheat by with nts was significantly reduced in morocco where the long term average growing season precipitation is 296 mm therefore by of spring wheat and winter wheat in different agroecological zones may respond differently to tillage practices high biomass accumulation under nts and ntp improved spikes per area and grains per spike and thus increased grain yield in agreement with previous studies singh and sharma 2005 su et al 2007 xie et al 2005 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 2015 however de vita et al 2007 reported that nts did not significantly affect grain yield of wheat compared to t under dryland conditions in southern italy where annual precipitation averages 200 mm in cereals a high hi under water limited conditions is essential in obtaining a high yield kang et al 2002 siddique et al 1989 our results also indicated greatly improved grain yield with nts and ntp as a result of greater biomass accumulation and a high hi 4 3 effect of tillage practices on precipitation use efficiency this research found that evapotranspiration during the growing season with ntp was the highest and that plastic mulch and stubble retention decreased soil evaporation but increased transpiration compared to t soil evaporation is ineffective water loss and reduction in soil evaporation improves water use efficiency wang et al 2010 evaporation reduction with stubble retention nts and ts compared to t in this study was likely because straw mulch increased canopy size yin et al 2016 reduced soil temperature and decelerated soil water diffusion chen et al 2010 and increased soil organic carbon liu et al 2017 which in turn increased soil water retention rawls et al 2003 plastic mulch tp and ntp significantly reduced evaporation during the growing season due to water conservation in agreement with previous studies li et al 2013 xie et al 2005 straw and plastic mulch treatments significantly improved transpiration during the growing season compared to t mainly because of increased soil water storage in the 0 30 cm soil depth huang et al 2008 wang et al 2014 thereby enhancing water uptake by wheat in this study nts and ntp obtained the highest pue in accord with previous studies peterson et al 1996 peterson and westfall 2004 wu et al 2017 this is likely because the straw and plastic mulch treatments optimized water use for example nts improved tc etc and ntp improved etc sw and tc etc which in turn enhanced biomass accumulation ultimately increasing yield these results highlight that nts and ntp treatments significantly increased pue of dryland spring wheat partially through enhancing the ratio of crop transpiration to evapotranspiration during the growing season although plastic film mulch had a similar effect as straw mulch on spring wheat productivity and pue in this research it has some disadvantages such as manual installation and removal of plastic mulch which are time consuming and labor intensive in addition large amounts of plastic film residue adversely affect the environment soil structure and crop growth because the plastic film residue prevents the penetration and flow of water within the surface layer of soil thereby reducing infiltration and affecting the water absorption of the soil li et al 2018 yan et al 2014 as a result nts is preferable to ntp for improving spring wheat productivity and pue and thus for sustainable intensification of rainfed cropping systems 5 conclusions both nts and ntp are able to increase grain yield of spring wheat and pue through optimizing the soil environment for the crop and field water use that is through increased precipitation storage efficiency farmland water consumption rate the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration crop transpiration efficiency and hi however for sustainable intensification in the long run nts is the best tillage and soil surface management practice for spring wheat production on the semi arid loess plateau of china declaration of competing interest the

assessed in this paper including conventional tillage with no straw t no till with straw cover nts no till with no straw nt conventional tillage with straw incorporated ts conventional tillage with plastic mulch tp and no till with plastic mulch ntp based on a long term experiment initiated in 2001 the impact of tillage practices on soil quality soil water storage soil evaporation biomass yield and grain yield of spring wheat were monitored in 2015 and 2016 the results show that nts improved soil quality and soil water storage before sowing no till with plastic mulch and nts increased evapotranspiration but decreased evaporation thus optimizing precipitation storage efficiency the farmland water consumption rate the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration and crop transpiration efficiency which gave rise to greater aboveground dry matter accumulation and more dry matter accumulation in grain as a result grain yield under nts and ntp was significantly increased by 45 and 41 compare to t respectively with corresponding improvements in pue of 43 and 39 therefore both nts and ntp have potential to substantially increase grain yield of spring wheat and pue

table 1 huang et al 2008 annual precipitation from post harvest august through harvest july of spring wheat at the experimental site was 442 330 and 398 mm in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and for the 2001 2014 average respectively and is shown monthly in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and crop management the experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications each plot was 4 m wide 20

in this study were made from plots planted to wheat there were six treatments in the experiment including conventional tillage with no straw t no till with straw cover nts no till with no straw nt conventional tillage with straw incorporated ts conventional tillage with plastic mulch tp and no till with plastic mulch ntp tillage practices and field management are described in huang et al 2008 tillage practices for the t ts and tp treatments involved moldboard plowing to a depth of 20 cm in the fall followed by harrowing in the spring prior to sowing all residues from the previous crops were retained for the ts and nts treatments plastic mulch polyethylene colorless 0 08 mm thickness 40 cm width application is shown in figs 2 a b and c the spring wheat and pea cultivars were dingxi 40 and lvnong 2 respectively wheat was sown at a rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 in rows spaced 20 cm apart and pea was seeded at 180 kg ha 1 in rows spaced 24 cm apart all treatments were fertilized with calcium superphosphate 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 for wheat and pea and urea 105 and 20 kg n ha 1 for wheat and pea respectively at sowing the treatments with plastic mulch were sown and fertilized with a local machine figs 2a and c and the treatments with no plastic mulch were sown and fertilized with a no till drill figs 2d e and f spring wheat was sown using a no till drill on 25 march 2015 and 27 march 2016 and harvested on 1 august in 2015 and 25 july in 2016 weeds were removed by hand during the growing season and controlled with herbicides during the fallow period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil physical properties and nutrient contents soil physical properties and nutrient contents were only measured at sowing in 2015 soil bulk density was measured in a beveled stainless steel ring gregorich and carter 2007 for the 0 5 5 10 and 10 30 cm soil layers before sowing of spring wheat in 2015 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements for the surface layer 0 5 cm were determined using the single head pressure ring infiltrometer method before sowing of spring wheat in 2015 reynolds and elrick 2002 three soil cores 4 5 cm inner diameter were taken randomly within each plot from the 0 5 5 10 and 10 30 cm soil depths before sowing of spring wheat in 2015 for measurement of soil nutrient contents soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 0 mm sieve available phosphorus p was determined using the olsen method olsen 1954 dried samples weighing 5 g each were added to 50 ml of 2 m kcl shaken for 60 min and analyzed with a fiastar 5000 analyzer foss tecator sweden for nitrate n no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n soil organic carbon c concentration was determined by wet oxidation with k2cr2o7 and h2so4 nelson and sommers 1996 2 3 2 precipitation soil water content and evapotranspiration daily precipitation was measured with a rainfall canister at the experimental site soil water content was measured at one location in each plot after tillage and before sowing wheat 20 march 2015 and 26 march 2016 and after wheat harvest 28 july 2014 4 august 2015 and 26 july in 2016 using the oven drying method o kelly 2004 for the 0 5 and 5 10 cm soil layers and a time domain reflectometry soil moisture sensor trime pico iph t3 imko gmbh ettlingen germany for the 10 30 30 50 50 80 80 110 110 140 140 170 and 170 200 cm soil layers volumetric moisture content for the 0 5 and 5 10 cm soil depths was calculated by multiplying weight moisture content by the corresponding soil bulk density evapotranspiration was calculated using the following equation zhang et al 2008a 1 e t δ t i p δ t s w d r c r d where et t is evapotranspiration during the crop growth period mm i is irrigation p t is precipitation mm during the crop growth period and swd is water storage mm at the start minus that at the end of a given time period for the 0 200 cm depth r is runoff cr is capillary rise to the root zone and d is drainage from the root zone because the experiment was performed under dryland conditions no irrigation was applied to spring wheat surface runoff was considered negligible because water flow was prevented by border dikes around each plot since the groundwater was buried at a depth of 38 40 m huang et al 2010 capillary rise to the root zone and drainage from the root zone were also considered negligible li 1983 soil evaporation was measured with a micro evaporator made from polyvinylchloride tubing with a length of 150 mm internal diameter of 110 mm and external diameter of 115 mm plauborg 1995 one tube per plot was installed between two rows to remove undisturbed soil at 07 00 h with plastic film used to seal the base of the undisturbed soil differences in inter and intra row soil evaporation were considered negligible because spring wheat was in narrow rows at a high plant density and had rapid canopy coverage of the soil surface after sowing on the sampling day the soil mass of the micro evaporator was weighed using an electronic balance with a sensitivity of 0 01 g returned back to its original location in the field and measured again at 07 00 h on the following day the loss in mass was the amount of evaporation equivalent to 0 1051 mm g 1 soil inside the micro evaporator was changed every 3 d and after precipitation by emptying the soil from the tube and placing the tube in a new location in the field to ensure that soil moisture inside the micro evaporator was consistent with the surrounding soil the calculation of evaporation during a given growth period was based on the daily average evaporation measured during the growth period multiplied by the number of days during the growth period without precipitation the amount of transpiration during a growing season is the sum of that for all growth periods in the growing season using following equation eberbach et al 2011 2 t δ t e t δ t e δ t where t t is transpiration during a crop growth period et t is evapotranspiration during a crop growth period and e t is soil evaporation during a crop growth period 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation yield and precipitation use efficiency aboveground dm was measured at five growth stages of spring wheat including the seedling 9 may 2015 and 30 april 2016 tillering 24 may 2015 and 20 may 2016 jointing 7 june 2015 and 30 may 2016 flowering 25 june 2015 and 15 june 2016 and maturity 1 august 2015 and 25 july 2016 stages by harvesting all aboveground dm from a 50 cm length of row from three randomly selected rows in each plot sampled biomass was placed in an oven at 105 for 30 min and then at 80 for 48 h and then weighed after wheat reached physiological maturity the edges 0 5 m of each plot were trimmed and discarded then the entire remaining portion of each plot was harvested manually using sickles at 5 cm above the ground at the same time the number of spikes were counted from a 50 cm length of row from three randomly selected rows in each plot grains per spike was counted from 20 randomly selected spikes in each plot aboveground biomass was weighed before threshing and a subsample of aboveground biomass was collected from each plot and placed in an oven at 105 for 30 min and then at 80 for 48 h and then weighed to determine moisture content which was used to calculate dry biomass yield by before threshing grain moisture content after threshing was determined for each plot based on the mean of five measurements with a pm 8188 grain moisture meter kett electric lab tokyo japan grain yield gy was calculated at 130 g kg 1 moisture content all straw and chaff for treatments with straw retention were returned to the original plots immediately after threshing harvest index hi was calculated using following equation wang et al 2018 yin et al 2017 4 h i g y b y efficiency chain as developed by liu 1997 hsiao et al 2007 and lin et al 2019 is an effective way to analyze the process of crop water use in the field the overall efficiency of any process consisting of a chain of sequential steps is the product of the efficiencies output input ratios of each of the individual component steps hsiao et al 2007 lin et al 2019 liu 1997 biomass accumulation and the distribution of photosynthate to grain are important for yield formation but these studies did not introduce by and hi into the efficiency chain so we optimized the efficiency chain we defined pue as the ratio of gy to annual precipitation p and divided pue into five steps by means of a systematic and quantitative approach precipitation use efficiency was calculated using following equations 5 p u e g y p 6 p u e s w p e t c s w t c e t c b y t c h i 7 s w s w b p r d where pue is annual precipitation use efficiency p is annual precipitation tc is transpiration during the crop growing season etc is evapotranspiration during the crop growing season sw is the maximum effective water storage capacity accumulated in the 0 200 cm soil layer during the annual period swb is effective water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer after harvest in the previous year r is surface runoff and d is deep drainage since the experimental site had a relatively flat and deep soil layer r and d were assumed as zero precipitation storage efficiency pse is calculated as the ratio of the maximum effective soil water storage capacity accumulated in the 0 200 cm soil layer during the annual period to annual precipitation sw p etc sw is farmland water consumption rate calculated as the ratio of evapotranspiration during the crop growing season to maximum effective soil water

transpiration efficiency te calculated as the ratio of by to crop transpiration during the growing season 2 4 statistical analysis data were analyzed at p 0 05 using spss 19 0 software ibm corp chicago usa analysis of variance was conducted for all dependent variables year and tillage practice were considered fixed effects and replication was considered a random effect differences among means were determined using tukey s honestly significant different test 3 results 3 1 soil physical properties and nutrient contents soil physiochemical properties were significantly affected by tillage practices following 14 yr of different tillage practices table 2 in the 0 5 cm soil depth nts had the significantly lowest bulk density and highest saturated hydraulic conductivity organic matter mineral n and available p similar responses of soil physiochemical properties to tillage practices were observed in the 5 10 and 10 30 cm soil depths 3 2 effect of tillage practices on soil water storage before sowing and after harvest soil water storage varied with tillage practice measuring time and growing season fig 3 averaged across the two seasons soil water storage before sowing with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 12 and 11 compared to t however nt ts and tp didn t significantly improve soil water storage before sowing compared to t soil water storage with conservation tillage practices was not significantly different compared to t after harvest data not shown 3 3 effect of tillage practices on water consumption of wheat field during growing season evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration during the growing season were affected by tillage practice table 3 over the two years evapotranspiration during the growing season with ntp was the highest but nts nt ts and tp were not significantly different from each other soil evaporation during the growing season with nts ts tp and ntp were significantly decreased by 14 9 48 and 47 respectively compared to t transpiration with nts tp and ntp was significantly increased by 24 34 and 59 during the growing season respectively compared to t 3 4 effect of tillage practices on biomass accumulation and grain yield tillage practice significantly affected dm of wheat fig 4 in 2015 the nts and ntp treatments significantly increased dm compared to t at all growth stages in 2016 on average dm with nts tp and ntp at all growth stages was significantly increased by 16 81 26 87 and 61 105 respectively compared to t thousand grain weight was not affected by tillage practice table 4 harvest index spikes per area grains per spike grain yield and by were significantly affected by tillage practice in 2015 spikes per area grain yield and hi with nts was significantly greater compared to the other treatments but grains per spike and by with ntp were significantly higher than those of the other treatments on average spikes per area with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 57 and 28 respectively compared to t grains per spike with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 11 and 28 respectively compared to t when compared to t grain yield with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 45 and 41 respectively and by with nts and ntp was significantly increased by 36 and 49 respectively 3 5 effect of tillage practices on precipitation use efficiency precipitation storage efficiency sw p was slightly different among tillage practices and nts was the highest on average table 5 averaged across the two years both etc sw and tc etc with ntp were significantly greater than those of the other treatments on average when compared to t tc etc with nts nt ts tp and ntp was significantly increased by 16 5 9 35 and 40 respectively transpiration efficiency by tc with nts and ts was significantly greater than that with other tillage practices in 2014 2015 transpiration efficiency with conservation tillage practices was not significantly different compared to t in 2015 2016 on average when compared to t transpiration efficiency with nts and ts was significantly increased while that with nt tp and ntp was significantly decreased precipitation use efficiency with nts ts and ntp was significantly increased compared to t while that with nt and tp did not differ compared to t in 2014 2015 table 5 in 2015 2016 when compared to t pue with nts tp and ntp was significantly increased while that with nt was significantly decreased and ts was not significantly different on average nts and ntp had the greatest pue which was 43 and 39 higher than that with t 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage practices on soil physiochemical properties and water storage in the early stage of this long term experiment nts was found to significantly reduce soil bulk density compared to t zhang et al 2008b ten years later in this research nts not only maintained the lowest soil bulk density but also had the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity soil organic matter soil mineral n and soil available p this was probably because mulching reduced the impact of rain on the soil the soil settlement had stabilized and the pores of crop root growth had been well preserved due to long term no till peng et al 2018 increased soil saturated hydraulic conductivity may have been due to decreased soil bulk density and increased soil organic matter cai et al 2012 soil water storage at sowing is of great importance for germination and seedling establishment this research found that the nts and ntp treatments significantly improved soil water storage before sowing compared to t in agreement with previous research liu et al 2009 wang et al 2012 yin et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 this was probably because nts improved soil physical properties especially saturated hydraulic conductivity compared to t thus increasing precipitation infiltration additionally the straw mulch and plastic film mulching reduced soil evaporation also in agreement with previous research bussiere 1994 chen et al 2010 chung and horton 1987 li et al 2013 meena 2018 soil water storage with nt was not significantly improved in this study but a study in israel with 237 mm of annual precipitation found that soil water storage with nt was significantly improved compared to t bonfil et al 1999 the discrepancy with the present study is likely due to substantially lower precipitation in their study wang et al wang et al 2003b found that soil water storage with ts was not significantly improved compared to t in the semiarid regions of northern china as shown in this study meanwhile zhang et al 2011 found that conventional tillage with plastic mulch did not significantly improve soil water storage before sowing compared to t in accordance with the result in this study this implies that nts can help improve soil physiochemical properties especially in the long run and store more water before sowing thereby provide better soil environment for crop germination and seedling establishment 4 2 effect of tillage practices on biomass accumulation and grain yield stored stem reserves serve as a source of carbon for grain filling in wheat cruz aguado et al 2000 therefore aboveground biomass accumulation is the basis for yield formation the ntp treatment significantly increased soil water content thus enhancing biomass accumulation which is consistent with the findings of previous studies huang et al 2008 li et al 2018 the nts treatment increased soil water content and nutrient availability and reduced soil bulk density confirming the findings from previous research cai et al 2012 li et al 2005 luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2008a as a result nts leads to significant increases in biomass accumulation which is in agreement with results from previous studies blanco canqui and lal 2007 li et al 1999 mitchell et al 2012 wang et al 2003a 2010 zhao et al 2016 however mrabet 2002 found that winter wheat by with nts was significantly reduced in morocco where the long term average growing season precipitation is 296 mm therefore by of spring wheat and winter wheat in different agroecological zones may respond differently to tillage practices high biomass accumulation under nts and ntp improved spikes per area and grains per spike and thus increased grain yield in agreement with previous studies singh and sharma 2005 su et al 2007 xie et al 2005 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 2015 however de vita et al 2007 reported that nts did not significantly affect grain yield of wheat compared to t under dryland conditions in southern italy where annual precipitation averages 200 mm in cereals a high hi under water limited conditions is essential in obtaining a high yield kang et al 2002 siddique et al 1989 our results also indicated greatly improved grain yield with nts and ntp as a result of greater biomass accumulation and a high hi 4 3 effect of tillage practices on precipitation use efficiency this research found that evapotranspiration during the growing season with ntp was the highest and that plastic mulch and stubble retention decreased soil evaporation but increased transpiration compared to t soil evaporation is ineffective water loss and reduction in soil evaporation improves water use efficiency wang et al 2010 evaporation reduction with stubble retention nts and ts compared to t in this study was likely because straw mulch increased canopy size yin et al 2016 reduced soil temperature and decelerated soil water diffusion chen et al 2010 and increased soil organic carbon liu et al 2017 which in turn increased soil water retention rawls et al 2003 plastic mulch tp and ntp significantly reduced evaporation during the growing season due to water conservation in agreement with previous studies li et al 2013 xie et al 2005 straw and plastic mulch treatments significantly improved transpiration during the growing season compared to t mainly because of increased soil water storage in the 0 30 cm soil depth huang et al 2008 wang et al 2014 thereby enhancing water uptake by wheat in this study nts and ntp obtained the highest pue in accord with previous studies peterson et al 1996 peterson and westfall 2004 wu et al 2017 this is likely because the straw and plastic mulch treatments optimized water use for example nts improved tc etc and ntp improved etc sw and tc etc which in turn enhanced biomass accumulation ultimately increasing yield these results highlight that nts and ntp treatments significantly increased pue of dryland spring wheat partially through enhancing the ratio of crop transpiration to evapotranspiration during the growing season although plastic film mulch had a similar effect as straw mulch on spring wheat productivity and pue in this research it has some disadvantages such as manual installation and removal of plastic mulch which are time consuming and labor intensive in addition large amounts of plastic film residue adversely affect the environment soil structure and crop growth because the plastic film residue prevents the penetration and flow of water within the surface layer of soil thereby reducing infiltration and affecting the water absorption of the soil li et al 2018 yan et al 2014 as a result nts is preferable to ntp for improving spring wheat productivity and pue and thus for sustainable intensification of rainfed cropping systems 5 conclusions both nts and ntp are able to increase grain yield of spring wheat and pue through optimizing the soil environment for the crop and field water use that is through increased precipitation storage efficiency farmland water consumption rate the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration crop transpiration efficiency and hi however for sustainable intensification in the long run nts is the best tillage and soil surface management practice for spring wheat production on the semi arid loess plateau of china declaration of competing interest the
