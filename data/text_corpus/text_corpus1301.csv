6505,an innovative approach was recently proposed to increase water depth and improve navigation in rivers by increasing overall roughness through an adaptive placement of artificial vegetation in this approach a section of the river width is covered with artificial vegetation constructed from an array of dampers that can be added or removed while maintaining sufficient width for navigational purposes the goal of the work here is to explore the mean flow and turbulent momentum transport properties of such flow in a controlled flume setting where the flow rate is steady the vegetation placement is uniform and the froude number is maintained at sub critical conditions the focus is on vegetation induced roughness alterations to the bulk flow statistics as well as the structure of turbulence impacted by the presence of such artificially engineered vegetation the canopy flow experimentally explored here differs from the well studied planar uniform emergent canopy flow because the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation areas occurs along a lateral direction instead of the vertical direction the flume experiments were conducted by partially covering the channel width with emergent artificial vegetation that is flexible and can interact with the flow the quantities studied are the equilibration distance of the flow statistics from the leading vegetation edge as such distance is essential to any engineering design moreover the mean flow and turbulence regimes at several longitudinal sections were analyzed using spectral analysis and conditional sampling to identify the main vortical structures and their contribution to momentum transport spectral analysis demonstrated that the sizes of the dominant vortices can be classified into stem scale small scale and shear scale larger scale vortices as conventional in canonical canopy flows the shear layer formed in the planar direction and its associated coherent vortices are spawned near the edge of the vegetated area in a manner analogous to a plane mixing layer quadrant analysis showed two contributions to the overall shear stress and lateral momentum exchange between the vegetated and non vegetated zone namely ejections and sweeps the measured ejection sweep contributions are short lived but significant to the overall turbulent momentum transport consistent with other canopy flow studies approximately 80 of the turbulent stress contributions at the interface occur within 30 of the time because the flume experiments were conducted at sufficiently high reynolds number and sufficiently low froude number the scalability of the experimental findings here to much larger settings encountered in engineering practice are briefly discussed keywords emergent artificial vegetation area flow resistance quadrant analysis spectral analysis turbulent structures 1 introduction resistance laws describing water movement in natural rivers covered by vegetation continue to draw research interest given their significance to a plethora of hydrological ecological and engineering applications interest in flow within artificial vegetation is now moving from the margins of laboratory research to the utility in river management and operation zdankus et al 2016 proposed that artificial vegetation can be used to control river flow and improve navigational depth by increasing resistance to flow their proposed artificial vegetation which resembles colonies of water plants with long afloat culms is environmentally friendly and convenient to construct or manufacture the use of such artificial vegetation to increase resistance in rivers poses unique scientific challenges that require further inquiry using controlled experiments to begin with the aforementioned artificial vegetation is flexible not rigid its placement in rivers results in configurations that differ from the well studied vegetation used in laboratory and field studies and the links between geometric and drag properties of such artificial vegetation are far from being understood based on the artificial vegetation type proposed by zdankus et al 2016 flume experiments are performed here to progress on these aforementioned issues the goal is to primarily explore the mean flow and turbulent structure within such artificial aquatic vegetation with a focus on momentum transport equilibration distance from the leading edge of the vegetation section where the mean longitudinal velocity gradients become small does set a minimum required vegetation length to be used in such river management conventional spectral and quadrant analyses are employed to determine sizes and lateral momentum exchange between the flow in vegetated and non vegetated areas the results here are then compared with published laboratory and numerical studies that use conventional aquatic vegetation it is envisaged that the outcome of the experiments here can be used to develop the next generation of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models and offer a bench mark data set for testing large eddy simulations les subgrid schemes for such vegetation configuration on the topic of rans one of the main novelties here is a link between ejections and sweeps responsible for momentum transport the vortical sizes identified by spectral analysis and vertical gradients of the second order flow statistics at a given location this novelty provides a new perspective on the difficult to model flux transport terms in momentum transport within and across interfaces 2 review of flow through aquatic vegetation what distinguishes flow above and within aquatic vegetation from its well studied terrestrial counterpart is the fact that aquatic vegetation can be emergent h hc or submerged h hc depending on the water depth h and vegetation height hc the flow structure of the submerged vegetation is more complex than that of the emergent vegetation beyond these two obvious length scales h hc vegetation in natural rivers does complicate the flow structure above and beyond canonical rough wall turbulent boundary layers by introducing additional length scales that depend on the drag force distribution within the vegetated elements stem diameter distance from the ground among others katul et al 2004 dunn et al 1996 järvelä 2005 kubrak et al 2008 huai et al 2018 it has been known that the mean velocity within vegetated areas is reduced due to the presence of distributed drag elements but remains finite the slow flow within vegetated elements and the fast flow in the vegetation free zone can lead to an inflection point in the mean velocity making canopy flows resemble plane mixing layers i e a free shear flow katul et al 2002 instead of canonical turbulent boundary layers i e a bounded flow pope 2000 as discussed elsewhere raupach et al 1996 ho and huerre 1984 termini 2015 most of the studies on flow within and above vegetated canopies considered rigid canopies in the case of uniform flow for submerged dense rigid vegetation e g rods three layers have been identified poggi et al 2004a ghisalberti and nepf 2009 along the vertical direction z with z 0 being the channel bottom the first layer roughly for z hc 1 2 is dominated by karman streets behind a single vegetation element rod presumably due to the lower reynolds number in this region the second layer roughly for 1 2 z hc 3 2 is dominated by kelvin helmholtz vortices produced through the aforementioned inflectional instability near the canopy interface z hc 1 at least when the vegetation is sufficiently dense the third layer roughly spanning z hc 3 2 resemble canonical turbulent boundary layer flows attached to a zero plane displacement instead of a wall the turbulent flow structures in the second layer have been examined through quadrant analysis in numerous laboratory and field studies it was found that among the four types of momentum transfer mechanisms outward and inward interactions sweeps and ejections sweeps dominate momentum transport for dense canopies vivoni 1998 poggi et al 2004b ghisalberti and nepf 2006 maltese et al 2007 righetti 2008 nezu and sanjou 2009 hopkinson 2014 analogous to air flow above terrestrial vegetation raupach and thom 1981 this conceptual picture proved effective when modeling the mean velocity and turbulent stresses in 1 d uniform flow along z though its extension to other dimensions remains a topic of inquiry in the case of dense emergent rigid vegetation covering the half width of a channel along the longitudinal direction similar to the case to be studied here white and nepf 2007 2008 found a coherent vortex structure occurring at the interface between vegetation and the bulk flow in the vegetation free zone the dominant frequency was determined using spectral analysis and the vortex development appears to be accompanied by ejections and sweeps that lead to mass and momentum exchanges between the canopy and non canopy regions ghisalberti and nepf 2006 also considered the flow through open channels partially covered by submerged rigid vegetation and found strong sweeps in the front part of the vortex with weak ejections appearing in the vortex tail flow within and over flexible vegetation began to draw significant research attention given their ubiquitous presence in natural streams unsurprisingly the flow above and within rigid and flexible vegetation was found to share some commonalities and differences for submerged flexible vegetation layered flow structure and k h vortices can form over the top of a flexible canopy in response to the mean and turbulent flow field however in contrast to rigid vegetation flexible vegetation to be used here bends or even oscillates when the flow enters a vegetated area i e a drag reduction mechanism with increased flow velocity flexible vegetation occupies one of four states such as vertical slight swinging strong and periodic vibrating monami phenomenon and stationary leaning states murota et al 1984 experiments by ghisalberti and nepf 2002 showed that the vortex frequency the strong vibration frequency of the longitudinal velocity and the swing frequency of the vegetation monami are comparable they also found that monami appeared when the vortex velocity significantly exceeded the mean velocity in the mixing layer this emerging picture about the vortical structure of flow through aquatic vegetation provides the template for analyzing the flow to be studied here to what extent the vortical structure and their contribution to momentum transport can be juxtapositioned to the setup here is explored using the flume experiments described next the aforementioned studies place the vegetation in a manner to cover the entire channel width and a substantial portion of the channel length however in the study here the focus is on a channel partially covered by flexible vegetation namely riparian systems these systems are ubiquitous in nature and river riparian vegetation interaction is a significant component of eco hydraulics research the flow structure induced by the emergent vegetation growing on the riverbank shares similar characteristics with the one induced by submerged vegetation covering the whole width of the flume both vegetation patterns cause vortex formation and mass transport between the vegetated and vegetation free zone however there are differences between them worth highlighting flexible vegetation covering riverbanks is an active component of ecosystem dynamics that impact fluvial processes mass and sediment transport and river morphology on long time scales in turn the river provides water nutrients and seeds to riverbank vegetation which depends on the hydraulic hydrological and geomorphological characteristic of the rivers allmendinger et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 studied the main interactions between rivers and vegetation on a riverbank and proposed a model demonstrating the importance of connecting fluvial morpho dynamics and riparian vegetation dynamics due to turbulence induced by the bed and vegetated edge the flow structure is significantly more complex in conditions with bankside vegetation than that with submerged vegetation for submerged flexible vegetation on a riverbank the horizontal and vertical vortices occur at the interface between the main channel area and vegetation area which enhance the mass and sediment transport between these two areas anderson et al 2006 the turbulent shear forming vortices that transfer momentum away from the bed to the banks has been thoroughly investigated in several studies reviewed elsewhere rabkova and garanina 2001 3 experimental facility and conditions the experiments were performed at the state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science in wuhan university using a 20 m long 1 m wide b and 0 4 m deep glass flume with a bed slope s 0 set to 0 01 see fig 1 a steady uniform flow was obtained by adjusting the tailgate at the end of the flume pvc polyvinyl chloride baseboards 2 m length 0 25 m width 0 01 m thickness were used to cover half of b as shown in fig 1 an 8 m long section was partially covered with artificial vegetation called dampers starting from 6 5 m away from the water entrance into the flume dampers spanned about half of the flume width thereby making the vegetation domain lveg 8 m long and 0 495 m wide the distance between two nearby vegetated elements in the longitudinal and transverse directions were 0 2 and 0 1 m respectively the coordinate system used is as follows the x axis is aligned along the longitudinal direction with x 0 set at the leading edge of the vegetation domain the y axis is the transverse direction with y 0 at the wall of the non vegetated domain the z axis is the vertical direction as before with the flume bed set to z 0 see fig 2 dampers were attached at the bottom of the flume by a thin rope and arranged in a parallel manner the streamwise velocity distribution was measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a sampling frequency of 50 hz the sampling time is 120 s for each measurement location resulting in 6000 samples per point measuring points were located at the mid depth of the flow as proxies for the depth averaged velocities namely u u d white and nepf 2007 2008 the averaged relative errors between the depth averaged velocity and mid depth velocity taken at z h 2 are below 10 for non vegetated domain and below 15 for vegetated domain where relative error for each measured point is calculated based on u dep u mid u dep 100 where udep is depth averaged velocity and umid is the velocity at z h 2 these errors are larger than the ones reported by white and nepf 2007 2008 as the vegetation here has more complex form and swings given this small error measuring the mid depth velocity and setting it to the depth average velocity is an acceptable approximation the form of artificial vegetation is different from previous laboratory vegetation studies a single damper is constructed by four hollow floats and four solid floats all dampers remain in a normal state with the forces of gravity and buoyancy see fig 3 the diameters of the hollow and solid floats are 0 04 and 0 02 m respectively the projection height of the damper changes with water depth h and the damper extends from the bottom of the bed to the water surface therefore the damper can be treated as the single emergent vegetation experiments here were carried out for three h values using such dampers as vegetation cover the experimental arrangements and key flow statistics are summarized in table 1 where q is the discharge fr u gh is a bulk froude number h is the water depth as before n is the friction coefficient at the bottom of the channel determined based on the water depth and material type so is the bed slope as before re u h υ where υ is the water kinematic viscosity is a bulk reynolds number and red u d υ where d is arithmetic mean of float diameters is a stem reynolds number 4 results and discussions the results and discussion sections are presented as follows in section 4 1 the region where the mean flow and key eddy structures are in equilibrium with the vegetated section i e minimal longitudinal gradients is identified the effective size of the region impacted by the presence of the vegetation is then delineated next the turbulent energy content and the corresponding frequency of the dominant vortices is explored along the longitudinal and lateral distances in section 4 2 with a focus on the equilibrated state away from the leading edge of the vegetation the goal of section 4 2 is to identify whether a single or multi scale vortices dominant the energy content of the measured velocity fluctuations this analysis makes use of power spectral density estimates on individual component wise velocity time series in section 4 3 the lateral momentum transporting properties of eddies is explored using conventional quadrant analysis the quadrant analysis is supplemented by a hyperbolic hole conditional sampling scheme to assess differential contributions of extreme momentum transporting events as a function of hyperbolic hole size the duration and momentum contribution of coherent structures are determined for all three configurations listed in table 1 models that link ejection sweep contributions to momentum transport are then explored the data and results in the figures are normalized using geometrical as well as flow variables unless otherwise stated the longitudinal distances or x is normalized by the length of the vegetated strip i e lveg transverse distances or y is normalized by the width of non vegetated region b 0 505 m resulting in 0 y b 1 being the non vegetated area and 1 y b 2 being vegetated area velocities are normalized by the time and area averaged velocity um q bh and reynolds stresses are normalized by a bulk friction velocity given by u b g r h s o where r h bh b 2 h is the hydraulic radius defined here based on the bulk area b h and wetted perimeter b 2h in the absence of vegetation while other normalizations that consider explicitly the vegetation are possible the one selected here is in keeping with bulk flow variables used in conventional open channel flow studies 4 1 mean flow and turbulence characteristics fig 4 presents the measured transverse distributions of the streamwise velocity u d and the development of the mixing layer with increasing distance x the measured spatial evolution of the streamwise mean velocity is normalized by the measured bulk mean velocity um as earlier noted the mixing layer appears to be contained within the width of two inflection points y 1 y 2 noted in the mean velocity distribution inside and outside vegetated areas a strictly uniform transverse distribution of mean velocity cannot be expected just before and when the flow first encounters the artificial vegetation x 0 due to upstream pressure effects originating from the blockage caused by the vegetation elements following the leading edge x 0 an adjustment region is formed that links the upstream conditions to the well equilibrated mean velocity downstream far from the leading edge the data here shows that the adjustment region appears to be characterized by three stages the first stage is the flow adjustment at the inlet of the vegetation zone i e in the vicinity of x 0 in this region streamwise velocity decreases due to the presence of a drag force introduced by the artificial vegetation the velocity difference between vegetated and non vegetated areas then produces a free shear layer at the leading edge of the vegetated area small scale vortices appear to evolve along x in this shear layer the second stage resembles a developing turbulent flow the shear layer develops and grows sufficiently to penetrate the vegetated area and the width of the mixing layer near the vegetation edge increases and eventually reaches an equilibrium with the vegetation patch size the third stage is the equilibrium region where the mean transverse velocity distribution becomes approximately homogeneous along the longitudinal direction i e u x 0 the longitudinal distance of the entire adjustment region i e from the inlet to the equilibration zone labeled as xd is of practical engineering significance this distance can inform future designs of the minimum required vegetation length to be used in river management it is also linked to dynamically similar adjustment distances in forest edge studies and to equilibration distances following a sudden change in momentum roughness length in aquatic vegetation studies rominger and nepf 2011 experimentally showed that xd varies with vegetation density for low flow blockage cases c d a b v 2 where bv 0 495 m is the width of vegetation zone in the transverse direction here c d is the drag coefficient and a is roughness density 1 x d 3 0 3 2 c d a 1 c d a b v 2 while for high flow blockage i e c d a b v 2 2 x d 7 0 4 b v for canopies vegetated and urban belcher et al 2003 and coceal and belcher 2004 indicated that for a sparse vegetation array 3 x d 3 2 1 ϕ c d a where ϕ is the solid volume fraction and ϕ 1 for all three flow configurations summarized in table 1 c d a b v 0 74 2 assuming c d 1 an estimate that is to be refined and discussed later on indicating low vegetation blockage using the aforementioned expressions x d 6 2 m is determined from rominger and nepf 2011 whereas x d 3 9 m is determined from belcher et al 2003 s result the measured length scale here is x dmeasured 4 0 m in line with belcher et al 2003 s estimates fig 4 shows the mean flow appears to be equilibrated with the vegetation for all three h values when x lveg 0 61 having determined the extent of the transition zone the vortex sizes impacting the mean flow in the equilibrium zone are now considered towards this consideration the measured transverse distributions of the normalized streamwise velocity in the equilibrium vegetated zone x lveg 0 61 are shown in fig 5 for all three cases the canonical shapes of these mean velocity distributions resemble those from classical mixing layer flows e g a hyperbolic tangent an approximate uniform portion representing the slow flow within the vegetation section e g y b 1 3 and an approximate uniform portion representing the fast flow outside the vegetated area e g y b 0 5 are evident for all three cases the mixing zone between these two near uniform mean velocity sections defines an effective vortex size and is assumed to originate from kelvin helmholtz instabilities this vortex size is commonly referred to as the shear length scale in the canopy turbulence literature raupach et al 1996 despite finding that c d a b v 2 the artificial vegetation here appears to be sufficiently dense to introduce an inflection in the mean velocity distribution leading to kelvin helmholtz instabilities i e rayleigh s inflection point theorem large momentum exchange occurs in the aforementioned shear layer near the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas i e 0 5 y b 1 3 the momentum thickness θ may be used to measure the effective width of this free shear layer its expression is given by 4 θ θ 1 θ 2 1 4 u d u δ u 2 d y where θ 1 and θ 2 are the momentum thickness components in vegetated and non vegetated areas respectively velocity u is the arithmetic mean of u d 1 and u d 2 namely u u d 1 u d 2 2 here u d 1 and u d 2 are the time averaged velocities in non vegetated and vegetated areas respectively see fig 5 the velocity difference δ u can be calculated from δ u u d 1 u d 2 the momentum thickness increases rapidly with increasing x and then reaches a constant at about x lveg 0 5 the same x position the mixing layer width nearly achieves independence from x shown in fig 6 this initially rapid development of momentum thickness θ is consistent with other flume experiments white and nepf 2007 2008 moreover the momentum thickness increases significantly with increasing water depth h as evidence here after delineating eddy sizes responsible for changes in the shape of the mean velocity distribution with longitudinal distance i e θ or δ y the properties of eddies that transport momentum are now considered the transverse distributions of the reynolds stress in the fully equilibrated zone at x lveg 0 61 for all three experimental cases are presented in fig 7 the first peak of the reynolds stress that appears at the joint area is evident and is reduced gradually toward the inner side of vegetated and non vegetated areas the second peak is inside the vegetated area and its sign is negative which is opposite to the sign of the first peak for completeness the measured distribution of u v d and u d are used to estimate the local drag coefficient for the three cases shown in fig 8 as a function of y b the method of local drag determination and a comparison of these estimates with other estimates wang et al 2015 2018 in the literature are discussed in the appendix 4 2 energetic modes and power spectral density analysis the structure of turbulence within the free shear layer fig 4 formed at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas is now explored the coherent vortex structure spreading downstream in this shear layer is the outcome of kelvin helmholtz instability and grows continuously with increasing x until reaching equilibrium x lveg 0 5 this vortex type dominates the transverse energy content and momentum transport periodic fluctuations in velocity and reynolds stress at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas are formed by such vortices fig 9 shows a representative time series of the streamwise velocity u transverse velocity v and reynolds stress at x lveg 0 61 y b 1 for case 3 reynolds stress represents the transverse momentum transport per unit area the streamwise and transverse velocities are anti correlated in time indicating strong momentum exchange at this location strong sweeps are followed by weak ejections the fact that quasi periodicity in velocities and reynolds stress are similar indicates that a dominant frequency may be defined and determined which is the main purpose of the spectral analysis next the transverse velocity fluctuations at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas are analyzed using spectral analysis the calculated frequency f is normalized by the local time averaged velocity u and momentum thickness θ x the spectral analysis used here is based on the welch method welch 1967 with hamming type windowing using matlab mathworks natick ma fig 10 presents the outcome of the spectral analysis for different downstream positions x lveg the peak in the spectral density corresponds to the dominant frequency of coherent vortical structures at the beginning of the vegetated area x lveg 0 5 the spectrum exhibits multimodal structures with three or more energetic modes fig 10 a x lveg 0 34 10 b x lveg 0 19 the spectrum along the downstream direction evolves to a state exhibiting a single dominant low frequency mode for different experimental conditions the dimensionless frequency f θ u 0 032 and much of the turbulent energy is explained by this single dominant frequency the deviation of the spectral peak for each flow condition is small 0 005 the two generation mechanisms in the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget are now explored to assess whether mechanical or wake production length scales dominate different flow regions for this purpose the shear production ps and wake production pw are computed using poggi et al 2004a b 5 p s 2 u v d d u d dy 6 p w 2 c d a u d 3 in fig 11 the measured depth averaged ps and pw are presented for the equilibrium region along the y direction i e 1 d representation after equilibration wakeproduction dominates within the vegetation section whereas shearproduction dominates at the interface and outside the vegetated areas this analysis lends support to the duel types of vortices expected here stem scale associated with wakes and stem diameter and shear scale vortices associated with kelvin helmholtz instabilities that dominate different regions the equilibrium zone at x lveg 0 61 for case 2 is now used to further investigate the effect of such vortex formation on the flow a series of instantaneous transverse velocity fluctuation v was studied at two representative transverse locations y b 1 and 1 95 that are close to the outer and inner sides of the vegetated areas where the normalized reynolds stresses reach unity at y b 1 and 0 25 at y b 1 95 near the wall side with vegetation see fig 7 fig 12 presents the variation in the power spectral density of instantaneous transverse velocity fluctuation with frequency f the dominant frequency at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y b 1 was determined as f 0 13 hz whereas the vortex dominant frequency is f 0 7 hz at the inner side of the vegetated area y b 1 95 the normalized strouhal number st is widely used to describe the relation between vortex shedding frequency and an obstacle characteristic length at least in cases where von karman streets are spawned from an obstacle or when pw dominates the st is given by 7 st fl u where f is the vortex shedding frequency which is the dominant frequency in the spectral analysis l is a characteristic length of the vortex size and u is the characteristic velocity often the approach velocity towards an obstacle is used across a wide range of reynolds number values the st is constant at 0 21 schlichting and gersten 1968 this near constant st value was independently shown to explain the peak in the velocity energy spectra within a rigid rod canopy for a wide range of rod densities poggi et al 2004b at y b 1 for case 2 i e at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated the f corresponding to the maximum energy content is determined to be approximately 0 13 hz when combining this estimate with the characteristic flow or approach velocity measured u 0 25 m s the constant strouhal number determines a characteristic vortex length of 0 4 m this calculated length agrees with the overall width of the vegetated area 0 495 m the finding here demonstrates that the vortices at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas are restricted by the width of the artificial vegetation zone even when pw and ps are both significant for another location y b 1 95 well within the vegetated zone the peak frequency f is 0 68 hz and u is about 0 1 m s thus the characteristic length l derived from st 0 21 is 0 03 m one order of magnitude smaller than the length scale determined at y b 1 the characteristic vortex length here is reasonably close to the average diameter of the individual vegetation elements this finding indicates that the vortices within the inner side of vegetated areas are unambiguously generated by pw consistent with prior results that ps pw at y b 1 95 unlike classical von karman streets the vortices formed by pw here cannot continue to grow because of collisions with other vegetated elements hence the overall width of the vegetated section sets the maximum vortex size moving beyond the energetic modes fig 12 shows that the attenuation rate of the power spectral density at high frequency decays at a rate less steep than the kolmogorov scaling 5 3 for locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence attainment of an inertial subrange or local isotropy is not likely at least for the sampling frequency and path averaging of the adv instrument used here the fact that the spectra decay at rates less steep than 5 3 is also of significance for les subgrid schemes in such schemes unresolved scales are linked to resolved scales using a scale dependent eddy viscosity that is derived to match inertial subrange scaling laws an approximate instrument white noise appears to dominate frequencies beyond 20 hz this white noise frequency is larger than any of the previously analyzed frequencies associated with characteristic vertical motion notwithstanding this noise the analysis here shows that beyond the energy injection scale the turbulence cascade does not proceed immediately following its conventional expectation from locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence towards finer scales an inertial subrange may form at frequencies beyond 20 hz though this cannot be tested here while a 5 3 scaling is not attained beyond the energy injection scale with increasing frequency an approximate f 1 power law scaling seems to emerge from the spectral analysis here typically an f 1 power law scaling in the spectrum either in f or wavenumber k is suggestive that the spectrum in this range of eddy sizes is becoming independent of the length scale producing the energy le here le may be viewed as the momentum thickness for fig 12a or the stem diameter for fig 12b depending on y b to speculate on the occurrence of a f 1 power law power law at scales smaller than le the following dimensional reasoning may be adopted because velocity variances are ultimately produced by the gravitational force driving the flow i e u b 2 then the dimensionless energy spectrum at a large and intermediate range of scales relevant to energy production i e where the majority of the variance lies may be normalized as katul et al 1995 katul and chu 1998 8 s vv k u b 2 l e f s k l e here k is a wavenumber and f s k l e is a similarity function to be determined as a function of the dimensionless wavenumber k l e if the spectrum of eddies at sizes smaller than l e become independent of l e but they have not cascaded enough to fully attained their near isotropic state given by kolmogorov s 5 3 scaling at very large f then the only way to cancel l e from both sides of this expression is to set f s k l e a e k l e whence producing a 1 power law scaling where a e is a similarity constant that may vary with h that is the 1 power law scaling is expected to occur at eddy sizes smaller than l e but much larger than eddy sizes associated with locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and these are not resolved with adv system here the range of scales that are described by a near 1 power law scaling in fig 12 appear consistent with the aforementioned analysis however this analysis must be only viewed as a plausibility argument to be further explored in future studies mainly les studies and laser doppler anemometry measurements 4 3 momentum transfer and quadrant analysis quadrant analysis was conducted for the three cases summarized in table 1 to elucidate the impact of emergent artificial vegetation and h on momentum exchange by vortices that dominate the energy spectra antonia 1981 wallace 2016 in quadrant analysis the reynolds stress has four types of contributions according to the signs of the instantaneous velocity fluctuations as shown below q1 quadrant 1 u 0 v 0 outward interaction q2 quadrant 2 u 0 v 0 ejection q3 quadrant 3 u 0 v 0 inward interaction q4 quadrant 4 u 0 v 0 sweep the four reynolds stress contributions can also be separated by a hole instead of zero the hole is formed by four hyperbolas u v g 0 u v where g0 is the threshold value see fig 13 large reynolds stress contributions in each quadrant can be determined by the threshold value g0 lu and willmarth 1973 the contribution to the reynolds stress in the qi quadrant can be expressed as 9 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t v t d t where 10 c i h 0 1 u t v t g 0 u v a n d u t v t i n t h e q u a d r a n t q i 0 o t h e r w i s e where t is the averaging time u t and v t are the instantaneous velocity fluctuations in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively and c i h 0 is the average condition the transverse distributions of s i 0 in the equilibrium zone for x lveg 0 61 and for each water depth h are presented in fig 14 in all the experimental conditions ejections and sweeps are the main contributions to the turbulent momentum flux at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas ejections and sweeps show a decreasing trend from the interface into the vegetated or non vegetated area ejections outweigh sweeps outside the vegetated area and the opposite occurs inside the vegetated area this turbulence structure is similar to that with submerged rigid vegetation poggi et al 2004a b ghisalberti and nepf 2006 fig 14 also suggests that outward and inward interactions are dominant contributions near the side wall within the vegetation area y b 1 9 the contributions of outward and inward interactions to reynolds stress are positive whereas those of sweeps and ejections are negative outward and inward interactions are larger than sweeps and injections within the vegetation area of y b 1 9 therefore the signs of reynolds stress are positive which is caused by the side wall effect and opposite to the signs of reynolds stress at the interface y b 1 fig 15 demonstrate the development of ratios of sweeps to ejections s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 and the ratios of sweeps and ejections to outward and inward interactions s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 s 3 h 0 s 1 h 0 across the flume width direction in case 2 at x lveg 0 61 i e equilibrium zone for a bivariate gaussian distribution s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 1 hence deviations from unity in s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 are due to asymmetry in the joint probability density function of the two velocity components analyzed here the shear contributions of sweeps and ejections are larger than those of outward and inward interactions in the middle of the channel with this trend reversed inside the vegetated area ratios of sweeps and ejections to outward and inward interactions s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 s 3 h 0 s 1 h 0 are different for various threshold value g0 ranging from 0 to 6 as expected for canopy flows the shear contribution proportions of sweeps and ejections become significant with increasing g0 near the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas in fig 16 the ratios are roughly the same in vegetated and non vegetated areas when compared with that near the interface fig 17 demonstrates how brief but intense vortex driven events contribute to momentum exchange with g0 changing from 0 to 6 s h 0 is the proportion of the shear contributions of sweeps and ejections larger than the threshold h 0 u v at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas and t h 0 is the ratio of sweeps and ejections to the total duration as shown 11 s h 0 s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 s 4 0 s 2 0 12 t h 0 1 t 0 t c 4 h 0 t c 2 h 0 t d t in all 3 cases nearly 80 of sweeps and ejections at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas occur within 30 of the time when s 0 1 t 0 0 7 which indicates that 30 of the total duration is occupied by the inward and outward interactions this finding is also consistent with other flume experiments on canopy flows poggi et al 2004a ghisalberti and nepf 2006 4 4 linking momentum exchange to spectral and quadrant analyses a closure model of maximum simplicity is now explored to link the aforementioned vortical sizes to certain features of momentum transport associated with the high ejection sweep contribution this model is based on third order cumulant expansion of the joint u v velocity probability density function and was proposed for turbulent flows within and above a rod canopy poggi et al 2004b the utility of this model is now explored in the context of the vegetation configuration here the ejection sweep contribution to momentum exchange was shown to be reasonably summarized by the stress fraction δ s 0 nakagawa and nezu 1977

obtained from quadrant analysis is compared against predictions from the second order closure modeled δ s 0 reasonable agreement between measurements and model calculations are found leading confidence to the determined vortical sizes contributing to ejections and sweeps it is clear that in the experiments here as well as previous field measurements katul and albertson 1998 poggi et al 2004a the stress fraction δ s 0 is a positive value within the vegetation area i e sweeps dominate momentum transfer while δ s 0 appears to be negative in the non vegetated area i e ejections dominate momentum transfer the good agreement between measured and modeled δ s 0 demonstrates a novel connection between sweeps and ejections and second order rans closure model calculations it also suggests that asymmetry in momentum exchange i e δ s 0 0 may be predicted from the gradients in second order statistics given by the eq 14 5 conclusion experiments were performed in an open channel partially covered with emergent artificial vegetation these experiments were partly motivated by the operational use of artificial vegetation to increase water depth and improve navigation in natural rivers the experiments here differ from conventional canopy flow studies where the flow is uniform and the flow statistics vary along the vertical direction the vegetation cover employed here is emergent and occupies part of the width and length of the channel such canopy placement results in flow statistics that mainly vary in the longitudinal and transverse directions at least for the purposes of momentum exchange and resistance to flow the experiments here point to the following 1 flow velocity through the vegetation area is significantly reduced but remains finite which indicates that the vegetation can increase flow resistance and then enhance overall water depth 2 the presence of vegetated and non vegetated areas leads to an inflection point in the mean velocity along the transverse direction analogous to its well studied vertical direction counterpart the mean velocity distribution adjusts along the longitudinal direction and eventually stabilizes to a quasi equilibrium shape in the transverse direction given by the x d the equilibrium transverse reynolds stress distribution reaches a maximum at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas and is appreciably reduced towards the side walls of the channel negative reynolds stress was measured on the inner side of the vegetated area which is consistent with the result of the quadrant analysis that inward and outward interactions are the dominant contributors to reynolds stress in the same zone analyzed 3 the trends of the mixing layer thickness along the main streamwise direction are the same as that of the momentum thickness these length scales grow at first and then stabilize to an equilibrium value the inflection in the transverse mean velocity leads to coherent vortex structures that resemble plane mixing layers in the shear layer the dominant frequency of this vortex was determined from spectral analysis when this frequency is normalized by the equilibrated momentum thickness and mean velocity an invariant value of 0 032 emerges for various water depths shear scale and stem scale vortices were also determined from spectral analysis and independently supported from tke production terms the former appears near the interface between vegetated and non vegetated zones whereas the latter emerges on the inner side of the vegetation area 4 sweeps and ejections are major contributions to the reynolds stress near the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas whereas inward and outward interactions are dominant contributions on the inner side of the vegetation area sweeps are more significant than ejections within the vegetated area with the relation reversed outside the vegetated area the characteristics of sweeps and ejections are brief and intense some 80 of the momentum transport occurs within 30 of the averaging interval this finding is insensitive to water depth variations 5 the work here also offers a blueprint of how to connect the spectral analysis the conditional sampling and quadrant analysis and second order closure modeling in particular it was shown that δ s 0 which measures the relative contributions of sweeps and ejections to momentum transport can be predicted from the canonical length scales in each region and transverse gradients of second moments only hence the work here shows that the asymmetry in δ s 0 recall that δ s 0 0 for a gaussian distribution may be linked to the large gradients in second moments due to the presence of vegetation acknowledgments wen xin huai and jiao zhang acknowledge support from the national

6505,an innovative approach was recently proposed to increase water depth and improve navigation in rivers by increasing overall roughness through an adaptive placement of artificial vegetation in this approach a section of the river width is covered with artificial vegetation constructed from an array of dampers that can be added or removed while maintaining sufficient width for navigational purposes the goal of the work here is to explore the mean flow and turbulent momentum transport properties of such flow in a controlled flume setting where the flow rate is steady the vegetation placement is uniform and the froude number is maintained at sub critical conditions the focus is on vegetation induced roughness alterations to the bulk flow statistics as well as the structure of turbulence impacted by the presence of such artificially engineered vegetation the canopy flow experimentally explored here differs from the well studied planar uniform emergent canopy flow because the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation areas occurs along a lateral direction instead of the vertical direction the flume experiments were conducted by partially covering the channel width with emergent artificial vegetation that is flexible and can interact with the flow the quantities studied are the equilibration distance of the flow statistics from the leading vegetation edge as such distance is essential to any engineering design moreover the mean flow and turbulence regimes at several longitudinal sections were analyzed using spectral analysis and conditional sampling to identify the main vortical structures and their contribution to momentum transport spectral analysis demonstrated that the sizes of the dominant vortices can be classified into stem scale small scale and shear scale larger scale vortices as conventional in canonical canopy flows the shear layer formed in the planar direction and its associated coherent vortices are spawned near the edge of the vegetated area in a manner analogous to a plane mixing layer quadrant analysis showed two contributions to the overall shear stress and lateral momentum exchange between the vegetated and non vegetated zone namely ejections and sweeps the measured ejection sweep contributions are short lived but significant to the overall turbulent momentum transport consistent with other canopy flow studies approximately 80 of the turbulent stress contributions at the interface occur within 30 of the time because the flume experiments were conducted at sufficiently high reynolds number and sufficiently low froude number the scalability of the experimental findings here to much larger settings encountered in engineering practice are briefly discussed keywords emergent artificial vegetation area flow resistance quadrant analysis spectral analysis turbulent structures 1 introduction resistance laws describing water movement in natural rivers covered by vegetation continue to draw research interest given their significance to a plethora of hydrological ecological and engineering applications interest in flow within artificial vegetation is now moving from the margins of laboratory research to the utility in river management and operation zdankus et al 2016 proposed that artificial vegetation can be used to control river flow and improve navigational depth by increasing resistance to flow their proposed artificial vegetation which resembles colonies of water plants with long afloat culms is environmentally friendly and convenient to construct or manufacture the use of such artificial vegetation to increase resistance in rivers poses unique scientific challenges that require further inquiry using controlled experiments to begin with the aforementioned artificial vegetation is flexible not rigid its placement in rivers results in configurations that differ from the well studied vegetation used in laboratory and field studies and the links between geometric and drag properties of such artificial vegetation are far from being understood based on the artificial vegetation type proposed by zdankus et al 2016 flume experiments are performed here to progress on these aforementioned issues the goal is to primarily explore the mean flow and turbulent structure within such artificial aquatic vegetation with a focus on momentum transport equilibration distance from the leading edge of the vegetation section where the mean longitudinal velocity gradients become small does set a minimum required vegetation length to be used in such river management conventional spectral and quadrant analyses are employed to determine sizes and lateral momentum exchange between the flow in vegetated and non vegetated areas the results here are then compared with published laboratory and numerical studies that use conventional aquatic vegetation it is envisaged that the outcome of the experiments here can be used to develop the next generation of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models and offer a bench mark data set for testing large eddy simulations les subgrid schemes for such vegetation configuration on the topic of rans one of the main novelties here is a link between ejections and sweeps responsible for momentum transport the vortical sizes identified by spectral analysis and vertical gradients of the second order flow statistics at a given location this novelty provides a new perspective on the difficult to model flux transport terms in momentum transport within and across interfaces 2 review of flow through aquatic vegetation what distinguishes flow above and within aquatic vegetation from its well studied terrestrial counterpart is the fact that aquatic vegetation can be emergent h hc or submerged h hc depending on the water depth h and vegetation height hc the flow structure of the submerged vegetation is more complex than that of the emergent vegetation beyond these two obvious length scales h hc vegetation in natural rivers does complicate the flow structure above and beyond canonical rough wall turbulent boundary layers by introducing additional length scales that depend on the drag force distribution within the vegetated elements stem diameter distance from the ground among others katul et al 2004 dunn et al 1996 järvelä 2005 kubrak et al 2008 huai et al 2018 it has been known that the mean velocity within vegetated areas is reduced due to the presence of distributed drag elements but remains finite the slow flow within vegetated elements and the fast flow in the vegetation free zone can lead to an inflection point in the mean velocity making canopy flows resemble plane mixing layers i e a free shear flow katul et al 2002 instead of canonical turbulent boundary layers i e a bounded flow pope 2000 as discussed elsewhere raupach et al 1996 ho and huerre 1984 termini 2015 most of the studies on flow within and above vegetated canopies considered rigid canopies in the case of uniform flow for submerged dense rigid vegetation e g rods three layers have been identified poggi et al 2004a ghisalberti and nepf 2009 along the vertical direction z with z 0 being the channel bottom the first layer roughly for z hc 1 2 is dominated by karman streets behind a single vegetation element rod presumably due to the lower reynolds number in this region the second layer roughly for 1 2 z hc 3 2 is dominated by kelvin helmholtz vortices produced through the aforementioned inflectional instability near the canopy interface z hc 1 at least when the vegetation is sufficiently dense the third layer roughly spanning z hc 3 2 resemble canonical turbulent boundary layer flows attached to a zero plane displacement instead of a wall the turbulent flow structures in the second layer have been examined through quadrant analysis in numerous laboratory and field studies it was found that among the four types of momentum transfer mechanisms outward and inward interactions sweeps and ejections sweeps dominate momentum transport for dense canopies vivoni 1998 poggi et al 2004b ghisalberti and nepf 2006 maltese et al 2007 righetti 2008 nezu and sanjou 2009 hopkinson 2014 analogous to air flow above terrestrial vegetation raupach and thom 1981 this conceptual picture proved effective when modeling the mean velocity and turbulent stresses in 1 d uniform flow along z though its extension to other dimensions remains a topic of inquiry in the case of dense emergent rigid vegetation covering the half width of a channel along the longitudinal direction similar to the case to be studied here white and nepf 2007 2008 found a coherent vortex structure occurring at the interface between vegetation and the bulk flow in the vegetation free zone the dominant frequency was determined using spectral analysis and the vortex development appears to be accompanied by ejections and sweeps that lead to mass and momentum exchanges between the canopy and non canopy regions ghisalberti and nepf 2006 also considered the flow through open channels partially covered by submerged rigid vegetation and found strong sweeps in the front part of the vortex with weak ejections appearing in the vortex tail flow within and over flexible vegetation began to draw significant research attention given their ubiquitous presence in natural streams unsurprisingly the flow above and within rigid and flexible vegetation was found to share some commonalities and differences for submerged flexible vegetation layered flow structure and k h vortices can form over the top of a flexible canopy in response to the mean and turbulent flow field however in contrast to rigid vegetation flexible vegetation to be used here bends or even oscillates when the flow enters a vegetated area i e a drag reduction mechanism with increased flow velocity flexible vegetation occupies one of four states such as vertical slight swinging strong and periodic vibrating monami phenomenon and stationary leaning states murota et al 1984 experiments by ghisalberti and nepf 2002 showed that the vortex frequency the strong vibration frequency of the longitudinal velocity and the swing frequency of the vegetation monami are comparable they also found that monami appeared when the vortex velocity significantly exceeded the mean velocity in the mixing layer this emerging picture about the vortical structure of flow through aquatic vegetation provides the template for analyzing the flow to be studied here to what extent the vortical structure and their contribution to momentum transport can be juxtapositioned to the setup here is explored using the flume experiments described next the aforementioned studies place the vegetation in a manner to cover the entire channel width and a substantial portion of the channel length however in the study here the focus is on a channel partially covered by flexible vegetation namely riparian systems these systems are ubiquitous in nature and river riparian vegetation interaction is a significant component of eco hydraulics research the flow structure induced by the emergent vegetation growing on the riverbank shares similar characteristics with the one induced by submerged vegetation covering the whole width of the flume both vegetation patterns cause vortex formation and mass transport between the vegetated and vegetation free zone however there are differences between them worth highlighting flexible vegetation covering riverbanks is an active component of ecosystem dynamics that impact fluvial processes mass and sediment transport and river morphology on long time scales in turn the river provides water nutrients and seeds to riverbank vegetation which depends on the hydraulic hydrological and geomorphological characteristic of the rivers allmendinger et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 studied the main interactions between rivers and vegetation on a riverbank and proposed a model demonstrating the importance of connecting fluvial morpho dynamics and riparian vegetation dynamics due to turbulence induced by the bed and vegetated edge the flow structure is significantly more complex in conditions with bankside vegetation than that with submerged vegetation for submerged flexible vegetation on a riverbank the horizontal and vertical vortices occur at the interface between the main channel area and vegetation area which enhance the mass and sediment transport between these two areas anderson et al 2006 the turbulent shear forming vortices that transfer momentum away from the bed to the banks has been thoroughly investigated in several studies reviewed elsewhere rabkova and garanina 2001 3 experimental facility and conditions the experiments were performed at the state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science in wuhan university using a 20 m long 1 m wide b and 0 4 m deep glass flume with a bed slope s 0 set to 0 01 see fig 1 a steady uniform flow was obtained by adjusting the tailgate at the end of the flume pvc polyvinyl chloride baseboards 2 m length 0 25 m width 0 01 m thickness were used to cover half of b as shown in fig 1 an 8 m long section was partially covered with artificial vegetation called dampers starting from 6 5 m away from the water entrance into the flume dampers spanned about half of the flume width thereby making the vegetation domain lveg 8 m long and 0 495 m wide the distance between two nearby vegetated elements in the longitudinal and transverse directions were 0 2 and 0 1 m respectively the coordinate system used is as follows the x axis is aligned along the longitudinal direction with x 0 set at the leading edge of the vegetation domain the y axis is the transverse direction with y 0 at the wall of the non vegetated domain the z axis is the vertical direction as before with the flume bed set to z 0 see fig 2 dampers were attached at the bottom of the flume by a thin rope and arranged in a parallel manner the streamwise velocity distribution was measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a sampling frequency of 50 hz the sampling time is 120 s for each measurement location resulting in 6000 samples per point measuring points were located at the mid depth of the flow as proxies for the depth averaged velocities namely u u d white and nepf 2007 2008 the averaged relative errors between the depth averaged velocity and mid depth velocity taken at z h 2 are below 10 for non vegetated domain and below 15 for vegetated domain where relative error for each measured point is calculated based on u dep u mid u dep 100 where udep is depth averaged velocity and umid is the velocity at z h 2 these errors are larger than the ones reported by white and nepf 2007 2008 as the vegetation here has more complex form and swings given this small error measuring the mid depth velocity and setting it to the depth average velocity is an acceptable approximation the form of artificial vegetation is different from previous laboratory vegetation studies a single damper is constructed by four hollow floats and four solid floats all dampers remain in a normal state with the forces of gravity and buoyancy see fig 3 the diameters of the hollow and solid floats are 0 04 and 0 02 m respectively the projection height of the damper changes with water depth h and the damper extends from the bottom of the bed to the water surface therefore the damper can be treated as the single emergent vegetation experiments here were carried out for three h values using such dampers as vegetation cover the experimental arrangements and key flow statistics are summarized in table 1 where q is the discharge fr u gh is a bulk froude number h is the water depth as before n is the friction coefficient at the bottom of the channel determined based on the water depth and material type so is the bed slope as before re u h υ where υ is the water kinematic viscosity is a bulk reynolds number and red u d υ where d is arithmetic mean of float diameters is a stem reynolds number 4 results and discussions the results and discussion sections are presented as follows in section 4 1 the region where the mean flow and key eddy structures are in equilibrium with the vegetated section i e minimal longitudinal gradients is identified the effective size of the region impacted by the presence of the vegetation is then delineated next the turbulent energy content and the corresponding frequency of the dominant vortices is explored along the longitudinal and lateral distances in section 4 2 with a focus on the equilibrated state away from the leading edge of the vegetation the goal of section 4 2 is to identify whether a single or multi scale vortices dominant the energy content of the measured velocity fluctuations this analysis makes use of power spectral density estimates on individual component wise velocity time series in section 4 3 the lateral momentum transporting properties of eddies is explored using conventional quadrant analysis the quadrant analysis is supplemented by a hyperbolic hole conditional sampling scheme to assess differential contributions of extreme momentum transporting events as a function of hyperbolic hole size the duration and momentum contribution of coherent structures are determined for all three configurations listed in table 1 models that link ejection sweep contributions to momentum transport are then explored the data and results in the figures are normalized using geometrical as well as flow variables unless otherwise stated the longitudinal distances or x is normalized by the length of the vegetated strip i e lveg transverse distances or y is normalized by the width of non vegetated region b 0 505 m resulting in 0 y b 1 being the non vegetated area and 1 y b 2 being vegetated area velocities are normalized by the time and area averaged velocity um q bh and reynolds stresses are normalized by a bulk friction velocity given by u b g r h s o where r h bh b 2 h is the hydraulic radius defined here based on the bulk area b h and wetted perimeter b 2h in the absence of vegetation while other normalizations that consider explicitly the vegetation are possible the one selected here is in keeping with bulk flow variables used in conventional open channel flow studies 4 1 mean flow and turbulence characteristics fig 4 presents the measured transverse distributions of the streamwise velocity u d and the development of the mixing layer with increasing distance x the measured spatial evolution of the streamwise mean velocity is normalized by the measured bulk mean velocity um as earlier noted the mixing layer appears to be contained within the width of two inflection points y 1 y 2 noted in the mean velocity distribution inside and outside vegetated areas a strictly uniform transverse distribution of mean velocity cannot be expected just before and when the flow first encounters the artificial vegetation x 0 due to upstream pressure effects originating from the blockage caused by the vegetation elements following the leading edge x 0 an adjustment region is formed that links the upstream conditions to the well equilibrated mean velocity downstream far from the leading edge the data here shows that the adjustment region appears to be characterized by three stages the first stage is the flow adjustment at the inlet of the vegetation zone i e in the vicinity of x 0 in this region streamwise velocity decreases due to the presence of a drag force introduced by the artificial vegetation the velocity difference between vegetated and non vegetated areas then produces a free shear layer at the leading edge of the vegetated area small scale vortices appear to evolve along x in this shear layer the second stage resembles a developing turbulent flow the shear layer develops and grows sufficiently to penetrate the vegetated area and the width of the mixing layer near the vegetation edge increases and eventually reaches an equilibrium with the vegetation patch size the third stage is the equilibrium region where the mean transverse velocity distribution becomes approximately homogeneous along the longitudinal direction i e u x 0 the longitudinal distance of the entire adjustment region i e from the inlet to the equilibration zone labeled as xd is of practical engineering significance this distance can inform future designs of the minimum required vegetation length to be used in river management it is also linked to dynamically similar adjustment distances in forest edge studies and to equilibration distances following a sudden change in momentum roughness length in aquatic vegetation studies rominger and nepf 2011 experimentally showed that xd varies with vegetation density for low flow blockage cases c d a b v 2 where bv 0 495 m is the width of vegetation zone in the transverse direction here c d is the drag coefficient and a is roughness density 1 x

vegetation array 3 x d 3 2 1 ϕ c d a where ϕ is the solid volume fraction and ϕ 1 for all three flow configurations summarized in table 1 c d a b v 0 74 2 assuming c d 1 an estimate that is to be refined and discussed later on indicating low vegetation blockage using the aforementioned expressions x d 6 2 m is determined from rominger and nepf 2011 whereas x d 3 9 m is determined from belcher et al 2003 s result the measured length scale here is x dmeasured 4 0 m in line with belcher et al 2003 s estimates fig 4 shows the mean flow appears to be equilibrated with the vegetation for all three h values when x lveg 0 61 having determined the extent of the transition zone the vortex sizes impacting the mean flow in the equilibrium zone are now considered towards this consideration the measured transverse distributions of the normalized streamwise velocity in the equilibrium vegetated zone x lveg 0 61 are shown in fig 5 for all three cases the canonical shapes of these mean velocity distributions resemble those from classical mixing layer flows e g a hyperbolic tangent an approximate uniform portion representing the slow flow within the vegetation section e g y b 1 3 and an approximate uniform portion representing the fast flow outside the vegetated area e g y b 0 5 are evident for all three cases the mixing zone between these two near uniform mean velocity sections defines an effective vortex size and is assumed to originate from kelvin helmholtz instabilities this vortex size is commonly referred to as the shear length scale in the canopy turbulence literature raupach et al 1996 despite finding that c d a b v 2 the artificial vegetation here appears to be sufficiently dense to introduce an inflection in the mean velocity distribution leading to kelvin helmholtz instabilities i e rayleigh s inflection point theorem large momentum exchange occurs in the aforementioned shear layer near the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas i e 0 5 y b 1 3 the momentum thickness θ may be used to measure the effective width of this free shear layer its expression is given by 4 θ θ 1 θ 2 1 4 u d u δ u 2 d y where θ 1 and θ 2 are the momentum thickness components in vegetated and non vegetated areas respectively velocity u is the arithmetic mean of u d 1 and u d 2 namely u u d 1 u d 2 2 here u d 1 and u d 2 are the time averaged velocities in non vegetated and vegetated areas respectively see fig 5 the velocity difference δ u can be calculated from δ u u d 1 u d 2 the momentum thickness increases rapidly with increasing x and then reaches a constant at about x lveg 0 5 the same x position the mixing layer width nearly achieves independence from x shown in fig 6 this initially rapid development of momentum thickness θ is consistent with other flume experiments white and nepf 2007 2008 moreover the momentum thickness increases significantly with increasing water depth h as evidence here after delineating eddy sizes responsible for changes in the shape of the mean velocity distribution with longitudinal distance i e θ or δ y the properties of eddies that transport momentum are now considered the transverse distributions of the reynolds stress in the fully equilibrated zone at x lveg 0 61 for all three experimental cases are presented in fig 7 the first peak of the reynolds stress that appears at the joint area is evident and is reduced gradually toward the inner side of vegetated and non vegetated areas the second peak is inside the vegetated area and its sign is negative which is opposite to the sign of the first peak for completeness the measured distribution of u v d and u d are used to estimate the local drag coefficient for the three cases shown in fig 8 as a function of y b the method of local drag determination and a comparison of these estimates with other estimates wang et al 2015 2018 in the literature are discussed in the appendix 4 2 energetic modes and power spectral density analysis the structure of turbulence within the free shear layer fig 4 formed at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas is now explored the coherent vortex structure spreading downstream in this shear layer is the outcome of kelvin helmholtz instability and grows continuously with increasing x until reaching equilibrium x lveg 0 5 this vortex type dominates the transverse energy content and momentum transport periodic fluctuations in velocity and reynolds stress at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas are formed by such vortices fig 9 shows a representative time series of the streamwise velocity u transverse velocity v and reynolds stress at x lveg 0 61 y b 1 for case 3 reynolds stress represents the transverse momentum transport per unit area the streamwise and transverse velocities are anti correlated in time indicating strong momentum exchange at this location strong sweeps are followed by weak ejections the fact that quasi periodicity in velocities and reynolds stress are similar indicates that a dominant frequency may be defined and determined which is the main purpose of the spectral analysis next the transverse velocity fluctuations at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas are analyzed using spectral analysis the calculated frequency f is normalized by the local time averaged velocity u and momentum thickness θ x the spectral analysis used here is based on the welch method welch 1967 with hamming type windowing using matlab mathworks natick ma fig 10 presents the outcome of the spectral analysis for different downstream positions x lveg the peak in the spectral density corresponds to the dominant frequency of coherent vortical structures at the beginning of the vegetated area x lveg 0 5 the spectrum exhibits multimodal structures with three or more energetic modes fig 10 a x lveg 0 34 10 b x lveg 0 19 the spectrum along the downstream direction evolves to a state exhibiting a single dominant low frequency mode for different experimental conditions the dimensionless frequency f θ u 0 032 and much of the turbulent energy is explained by this single dominant frequency the deviation of the spectral peak for each flow condition is small 0 005 the two generation mechanisms in the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget are now explored to assess whether mechanical or wake production length scales dominate different flow regions for this purpose the shear production ps and wake production pw are computed using poggi et al 2004a b 5 p s 2 u v d d u d dy 6 p w 2 c d a u d 3 in fig 11 the measured depth averaged ps and pw are presented for the equilibrium region along the y direction i e 1 d representation after equilibration wakeproduction dominates within the vegetation section whereas shearproduction dominates at the interface and outside the vegetated areas this analysis lends support to the duel types of vortices expected here stem scale associated with wakes and stem diameter and shear scale vortices associated with kelvin helmholtz instabilities that dominate different regions the equilibrium zone at x lveg 0 61 for case 2 is now used to further investigate the effect of such vortex formation on the flow a series of instantaneous transverse velocity fluctuation v was studied at two representative transverse locations y b 1 and 1 95 that are close to the outer and inner sides of the vegetated areas where the normalized reynolds stresses reach unity at y b 1 and 0 25 at y b 1 95 near the wall side with vegetation see fig 7 fig 12 presents the variation in the power spectral density of instantaneous transverse velocity fluctuation with frequency f the dominant frequency at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y b 1 was determined as f 0 13 hz whereas the vortex dominant frequency is f 0 7 hz at the inner side of the vegetated area y b 1 95 the normalized strouhal number st is widely used to describe the relation between vortex shedding frequency and an obstacle characteristic length at least in cases where von karman streets are spawned from an obstacle or when pw dominates the st is given by 7 st fl u where f is the vortex shedding frequency which is the dominant frequency in the spectral analysis l is a characteristic length of the vortex size and u is the characteristic velocity often the approach velocity towards an obstacle is used across a wide range of reynolds number values the st is constant at 0 21 schlichting and gersten 1968 this near constant st value was independently shown to explain the peak in the velocity energy spectra within a rigid rod canopy for a wide range of rod densities poggi et al 2004b at y b 1 for case 2 i e at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated the f corresponding to the maximum energy content is determined to be approximately 0 13 hz when combining this estimate with the characteristic flow or approach velocity measured u 0 25 m s the constant strouhal number determines a characteristic vortex length of 0 4 m this calculated length agrees with the overall width of the vegetated area 0 495 m the finding here demonstrates that the vortices at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas are restricted by the width of the artificial vegetation zone even when pw and ps are both significant for another location y b 1 95 well within the vegetated zone the peak frequency f is 0 68 hz and u is about 0 1 m s thus the characteristic length l derived from st 0 21 is 0 03 m one order of magnitude smaller than the length scale determined at y b 1 the characteristic vortex length here is reasonably close to the average diameter of the individual vegetation elements this finding indicates that the vortices within the inner side of vegetated areas are unambiguously generated by pw consistent with prior results that ps pw at y b 1 95 unlike classical von karman streets the vortices formed by pw here cannot continue to grow because of collisions with other vegetated elements hence the overall width of the vegetated section sets the maximum vortex size moving beyond the energetic modes fig 12 shows that the attenuation rate of the power spectral density at high frequency decays at a rate less steep than the kolmogorov scaling 5 3 for locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence attainment of an inertial subrange or local isotropy is not likely at least for the sampling frequency and path averaging of the adv instrument used here the fact that the spectra decay at rates less steep than 5 3 is also of significance for les subgrid schemes in such schemes unresolved scales are linked to resolved scales using a scale dependent eddy viscosity that is derived to match inertial subrange scaling laws an approximate instrument white noise appears to dominate frequencies beyond 20 hz this white noise frequency is larger than any of the previously analyzed frequencies associated with characteristic vertical motion notwithstanding this noise the analysis here shows that beyond the energy injection scale the turbulence cascade does not proceed immediately following its conventional expectation from locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence towards finer scales an inertial subrange may form at frequencies beyond 20 hz though this cannot be tested here while a 5 3 scaling is not attained beyond the energy injection scale with increasing frequency an approximate f 1 power law scaling seems to emerge from the spectral analysis here typically an f 1 power law scaling in the spectrum either in f or wavenumber k is suggestive that the spectrum in this range of eddy sizes is becoming independent of the length scale producing the energy le here le may be viewed as the momentum thickness for fig 12a or the stem diameter for fig 12b depending on y b to speculate on the occurrence of a f 1 power law power law at scales smaller than le the following dimensional reasoning may be adopted because velocity variances are ultimately produced by the gravitational force driving the flow i e u b 2 then the dimensionless energy spectrum at a large and intermediate range of scales relevant to energy production i e where the majority of the variance lies may be normalized as katul et al 1995 katul and chu 1998 8 s vv k u b 2 l e f s k l e here k is a wavenumber and f s k l e is a similarity function to be determined as a function of the dimensionless wavenumber k l e if the spectrum of eddies at sizes smaller than l e become independent of l e but they have not cascaded enough to fully attained their near isotropic state given by kolmogorov s 5 3 scaling at very large f then the only way to cancel l e from both sides of this expression is to set f s k l e a e k l e whence producing a 1 power law scaling where a e is a similarity constant that may vary with h that is the 1 power law scaling is expected to occur at eddy sizes smaller than l e but much larger than eddy sizes associated with locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and these are not resolved with adv system here the range of scales that are described by a near 1 power law scaling in fig 12 appear consistent with the aforementioned analysis however this analysis must be only viewed as a plausibility argument to be further explored in future studies mainly les studies and laser doppler anemometry measurements 4 3 momentum transfer and quadrant analysis quadrant analysis was conducted for the three cases summarized in table 1 to elucidate the impact of emergent artificial vegetation and h on momentum exchange by vortices that dominate the energy spectra antonia 1981 wallace 2016 in quadrant analysis the reynolds stress has four types of contributions according to the signs of the instantaneous velocity fluctuations as shown below q1 quadrant 1 u 0 v 0 outward interaction q2 quadrant 2 u 0 v 0 ejection q3 quadrant 3 u 0 v 0 inward interaction q4 quadrant 4 u 0 v 0 sweep the four reynolds stress contributions can also be separated by a hole instead of zero the hole is formed by four hyperbolas u v g 0 u v where g0 is the threshold value see fig 13 large reynolds stress contributions in each quadrant can be determined by the threshold value g0 lu and willmarth 1973 the contribution to the reynolds stress in the qi quadrant can be expressed as 9 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t v t d t where 10 c i h 0 1 u t v t g 0 u v a n d u t v t i n t h e q u a d r a n t q i 0 o t h e r w i s e where t is the averaging time u t and v t are the instantaneous velocity fluctuations in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively and c i h 0 is the average condition the transverse distributions of s i 0 in the equilibrium zone for x lveg 0 61 and for each water depth h are presented in fig 14 in all the experimental conditions ejections and sweeps are the main contributions to the turbulent momentum flux at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas ejections and sweeps show a decreasing trend from the interface into the vegetated or non vegetated area ejections outweigh sweeps outside the vegetated area and the opposite occurs inside the vegetated area this turbulence structure is similar to that with submerged rigid vegetation poggi et al 2004a b ghisalberti and nepf 2006 fig 14 also suggests that outward and inward interactions are dominant contributions near the side wall within the vegetation area y b 1 9 the contributions of outward and inward interactions to reynolds stress are positive whereas those of sweeps and ejections are negative outward and inward interactions are larger than sweeps and injections within the vegetation area of y b 1 9 therefore the signs of reynolds stress are positive which is caused by the side wall effect and opposite to the signs of reynolds stress at the interface y b 1 fig 15 demonstrate the development of ratios of sweeps to ejections s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 and the ratios of sweeps and ejections to outward and inward interactions s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 s 3 h 0 s 1 h 0 across the flume width direction in case 2 at x lveg 0 61 i e equilibrium zone for a bivariate gaussian distribution s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 1 hence deviations from unity in s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 are due to asymmetry in the joint probability density function of the two velocity components analyzed here the shear contributions of sweeps and ejections are larger than those of outward and inward interactions in the middle of the channel with this trend reversed inside the vegetated area ratios of sweeps and ejections to outward and inward interactions s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 s 3 h 0 s 1 h 0 are different for various threshold value g0 ranging from 0 to 6 as expected for canopy flows the shear contribution proportions of sweeps and ejections become significant with increasing g0 near the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas in fig 16 the ratios are roughly the same in vegetated and non vegetated areas when compared with that near the interface fig 17 demonstrates how brief but intense vortex driven events contribute to momentum exchange with g0 changing from 0 to 6 s h 0 is the proportion of the shear contributions of sweeps and ejections larger than the threshold h 0 u v at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas and t h 0 is the ratio of sweeps and ejections to the total duration as shown 11 s h 0 s 4 h 0 s 2 h 0 s 4 0 s 2 0 12 t h 0 1 t 0 t c 4 h 0 t c 2 h 0 t d t in all 3 cases nearly 80 of sweeps and ejections at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas occur within 30 of the time when s 0 1 t 0 0 7 which indicates that 30 of the total duration is occupied by the inward and outward interactions this finding is also consistent with other flume experiments on canopy flows poggi et al 2004a ghisalberti and nepf 2006 4 4 linking momentum exchange to spectral and quadrant analyses a closure model of maximum simplicity is now explored to link the aforementioned vortical sizes to certain features of momentum transport associated with the high ejection sweep contribution this model is based on third order cumulant expansion of the joint u v velocity probability density function and was proposed for turbulent flows within and above a rod canopy poggi et al 2004b the utility of this model is now explored in the context of the vegetation configuration here the ejection sweep contribution to momentum exchange was shown to be reasonably summarized by the stress fraction δ s 0 nakagawa and nezu 1977 raupach 1981 given by 13 δ s 0 u v d 4 u v d 2 u v d where u v d i u v d is the stress fraction in quadrant i i 1 2 3 4 a second order rans closure model prediction for δ s 0 is derived elsewhere poggi et al 2004b and given as 14 δ s 0 1 2 2 π q λ 1 u v d 1 σ u u u d y 2 σ v u v d y where σ s s s d is the time and depth averaged standard deviation of an arbitrary flow variable s q u i u i d is the turbulent velocity scale λ 1 b 1 l eff is the length scale where b 1 u q is a closure coefficient and l eff is the effective or master length scale of the closure model the expression of length scale at various horizontal distance y is now derived from the spectral analysis findings inside the vegetation area y b 1 5 hereafter referred to as region i the spectral analysis shows that the turbulence generation is mainly produced by stem scale vortices near the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas 0 5 y b 1 5 hereafter referred to as region ii the peak of the reynold stress appears and is explained by shear scale vortices for y b 0 5 hereafter referred to as region iii the length scale is given by a standard boundary layer length scale for the synthetic vegetation

obtained from quadrant analysis is compared against predictions from the second order closure modeled δ s 0 reasonable agreement between measurements and model calculations are found leading confidence to the determined vortical sizes contributing to ejections and sweeps it is clear that in the experiments here as well as previous field measurements katul and albertson 1998 poggi et al 2004a the stress fraction δ s 0 is a positive value within the vegetation area i e sweeps dominate momentum transfer while δ s 0 appears to be negative in the non vegetated area i e ejections dominate momentum transfer the good agreement between measured and modeled δ s 0 demonstrates a novel connection between sweeps and ejections and second order rans closure model calculations it also suggests that asymmetry in momentum exchange i e δ s 0 0 may be predicted from the gradients in second order statistics given by the eq 14 5 conclusion experiments were performed in an open channel partially covered with emergent artificial vegetation these experiments were partly motivated by the operational use of artificial vegetation to increase water depth and improve navigation in natural rivers the experiments here differ from conventional canopy flow studies where the flow is uniform and the flow statistics vary along the vertical direction the vegetation cover employed here is emergent and occupies part of the width and length of the channel such canopy placement results in flow statistics that mainly vary in the longitudinal and transverse directions at least for the purposes of momentum exchange and resistance to flow the experiments here point to the following 1 flow velocity through the vegetation area is significantly reduced but remains finite which indicates that the vegetation can increase flow resistance and then enhance overall water depth 2 the presence of vegetated and non vegetated areas leads to an inflection point in the mean velocity along the transverse direction analogous to its well studied vertical direction counterpart the mean velocity distribution adjusts along the longitudinal direction and eventually stabilizes to a quasi equilibrium shape in the transverse direction given by the x d the equilibrium transverse reynolds stress distribution reaches a maximum at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas and is appreciably reduced towards the side walls of the channel negative reynolds stress was measured on the inner side of the vegetated area which is consistent with the result of the quadrant analysis that inward and outward interactions are the dominant contributors to reynolds stress in the same zone analyzed 3 the trends of the mixing layer thickness along the main streamwise direction are the same as that of the momentum thickness these length scales grow at first and then stabilize to an equilibrium value the inflection in the transverse mean velocity leads to coherent vortex structures that resemble plane mixing layers in the shear layer the dominant frequency of this vortex was determined from spectral analysis when this frequency is normalized by the equilibrated momentum thickness and mean velocity an invariant value of 0 032 emerges for various water depths shear scale and stem scale vortices were also determined from spectral analysis and independently supported from tke production terms the former appears near the interface between vegetated and non vegetated zones whereas the latter emerges on the inner side of the vegetation area 4 sweeps and ejections are major contributions to the reynolds stress near the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas whereas inward and outward interactions are dominant contributions on the inner side of the vegetation area sweeps are more significant than ejections within the vegetated area with the relation reversed outside the vegetated area the characteristics of sweeps and ejections are brief and intense some 80 of the momentum transport occurs within 30 of the averaging interval this finding is insensitive to water depth variations 5 the work here also offers a blueprint of how to connect the spectral analysis the conditional sampling and quadrant analysis and second order closure modeling in particular it was shown that δ s 0 which measures the relative contributions of sweeps and ejections to momentum transport can be predicted from the canonical length scales in each region and transverse gradients of second moments only hence the work here shows that the asymmetry in δ s 0 recall that δ s 0 0 for a gaussian distribution may be linked to the large gradients in second moments due to the presence of vegetation acknowledgments wen xin huai and jiao zhang acknowledge support from the national

6506,human activities have exerted influential effects on the evolution of channels in river deltas throughout the world in recent decades in this study the adjustment processes of deltaic channels in the pearl river delta prd in response to diverse human interventions were examined during the 1960s 2010s changes in the channel geometries i e cross and longitudinal sections and at a station hydraulic geometry indicate that channel evolution in the prd can be divided into three periods since the 1960s corresponding to stepwise changes in the hydrological processes in the prd during the 1960s 1980s period channel topography showed slight change mainly resulting from the variations in the water and sediment inputs and hence at a station hydraulic geometry also displayed insignificant change such a kind evolution indicates a negligible impact from human interventions and an insignificant change in the hydrological processes in the prd from the1990s to the early 2000s the deltaic channels were substantially deepened mainly due to large scale sand excavation occurred in the prd and changes in at a station hydraulic geometry reveal an increase in the changing rate of the velocity with the discharge but a decrease for water depth and channel area in response to channel deepening the water level decreased but the tidal range increased at the makou and sanshui stations during this period furthermore uneven down cutting of the riverbed also significantly altered the divided water and sediment ratios in the prd after the prohibition of sand excavation i e mid 2000s although sediment reduction caused by dam construction was favorable for the further incision of deltaic channels the incision magnitude was considerably decreased in addition we observe a relatively slight change in at a station hydraulic geometry these results indicate an adjustment stage for the deltaic channels during this period correspondingly the divided water and sediment ratios showed insignificantly change in the prd as did the water level and the tidal range the results obtained from this study may help to set scientific guidelines for sustainable water management strategies for flood control embankment protection water and sediment regulation and prevention of salt water intrusion in the prd and other river deltas worldwide that are subject to strong human interventions keywords channel evolution hydraulic geometry sediment regime alternation sand excavation river deltas 1 introduction river deltas are important zones that support large human populations and productive ecosystems e g syvitski et al 2009 dai et al 2014 best 2019 the evolution of a deltaic channel is closely related to flood prevention and bank protection which sustains the safety of the river delta ecosystem in reality channel adjustment continuously occurs in response to natural forcing and human interferences e g dai et al 2013 brunier et al 2014 mei et al 2018a however in recent decades human interventions have been the key driver for deltaic channel evolution syvitski et al 2005 syvitski and saito 2007 day et al 2016 zhou et al 2017b which brings a series of uncertainties to prediction of channel adjustments calle et al 2017 nowadays channel responses in the river deltas to human interventions have received worldwide concerns in the context of global changes dai et al

yangtze river delta due to the riverine sediment reduction after the closure of three gorges dam similarly zheng et al 2018 observed that qingshuigou channel in the yellow river delta was eroded caused by the implementation of the water and sediment regulation scheme since 2002 in addition human activities such as sand excavation bank protection engineering and waterway regulation have considerably affected the river channel morphology surian and rinaldi 2003 li et al 2007 luo et al 2007 brunier et al 2014 brunier et al 2014 claimed that riverbed mining was responsible for depth increase of the mekong and bassac river channels in the mekong delta from 1998 to 2008 pye and blott 2014 reported channels in some uk estuaries adjusted quickly to human interferences including embanking land claim dredging etc luan et al 2016 and wei et al 2017 considered that estuarine engineering projects had exerted influential impacts on the morphological evolution of estuarine channels in the yangtze river delta the impact of human interventions on river channels should be expressed by the changes in channel morphology previous studies have indicated that river channels are continuously adjusted through changes in the channel depth velocity and width to changes in the channel morphology pietsch and nanson 2011 modrick and georgakakos 2014 nelson et al 2015 jia et al 2017 however diverse human interventions can exert different effects on the channel morphology consequently channel adjustment should show different patterns therefore exploring the change patterns in the deltaic channel morphology in response to human interventions is scientifically important for the management of river deltas the pearl river delta prd is located in south china and is adjacent to the south china sea scs the prd consists of many connected river networks and is well known as one of the most complicated river deltas in world since the 1980s the prd has become one of the fastest economically developing and urbanizing regions both domestically and globally currently the prd is an important zone for building the guangdong hong kong marco greater bay area which is a major strategy for the development of china in the last 30 years intensive human interventions have strongly disturbed the natural evolution of the river channel in the prd e g lu et al 2007 luo et al 2007 zheng et al 2014 tan et al 2016 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2018b on one hand dam constructions in the pearl river basin have reduced the sediment load from upstream by approximately 40 since the 1990s liu et al 2017 tan et al 2017 on the other hand sand excavation in the prd has significantly resulted in the down cutting of the riverbed of the deltaic channels lu et al 2007 luo et al 2007 according to luo et al 2007 more than 8 7 108 m3 of sand were excavated from 1986 to 2003 in the prd resulting in average down cutting depths of 0 59 1 7 m 0 34 4 43 m and 1 77 6 48 m in the main channels of the west river north river and east river respectively these changes in the river channels have caused environmental problems in the prd including salt water intrusion and bank collapse luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2014 since the 2000s authorities have expressed deep concerns on the environmental impacts caused by sand excavation on the prd and have established regulations and policies to prohibit sand excavation in the prd luo et al 2007 liu et al 2014 as such the magnitude of sand excavation in the prd has been weakened since the early 2000s however new dams in the pearl river basin were constructed after the early 2000s liu et al 2014 it is clear that the evolution of the prd has been under new circumstances post 2000s therefore it is urgent to explore the impacts of human activities on the channel adjustment in different stages to maintain the channel stability of the prd previous studies mainly focused on the channel evolution of the prd caused by sand excavation before the 2000s e g lu et al 2007 luo et al 2007 zheng et al 2014 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a in particular some studies examined morphological responses of subaqueous prd resulted from human interventions after 1990s zhang et al 2015b wu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 after the prohibition of sand excavation i e after early 2000s the channels in the prd may be self adjusted due to its resilience dai et al 2015 calle et al 2017 hoitink et al 2017 however fewer studies examined the channel adjustment in the subaerial prd in response to human activities after 1990s which can affect the characteristics of sediment delivered into the subaqueous delta tan et al 2016 dai et al 2018 it is necessary to explore adjustment patterns of deltaic channels in the prd under the new circumstances therefore this study examined the geomorphic evolution of river channels based on the long term series of the elevation of the cross section and the channel topography in the prd from the 1960s to the 2010s the objectives of this study are 1 to explore the channel adjustment of the river channels in response to diverse human interventions in different periods 2 to quantify the impact of human interventions on the channel adjustment and 3 to discuss the implications of the channel change on the hydrological processes in the prd our study will lead to a better understanding of the adjustment process of deltaic channels and its mechanism under the impacts of human interventions and natural factors and will provide scientific implications for bank protection and water resources exploitation in the river delta 2 study area the pearl river originates on the yunnan plateau and flows eastwards to the scs with a length of 2400 km and a basin area of 450 000 km2 fig 1 a as the second largest river in terms of water discharge the pearl river annually delivers approximately 2823 108 m3 yr of water discharge and 72 4 106 t yr of sediment load into the south china sea liu et al 2014 average annual precipitation in the river basin was about 1378 mm yr and show insignificant changing trend from 1950s to 2000s liu et al 2017 approximately 80 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the wet season from april to september in response to the summer monsoon the pearl river basin is dictated by a monsoon climate and approximately 80 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the wet season from april to september in response to the summer monsoon therefore more than 80 of the water and 90 of the sediment in the pearl river are concentrated during the wet season from 1964 to 2009 the population of river basin has greatly increased from 100 million to 230 million and hence human activities especially dam construction in the upstream of prd have been dramatically intensified wu et al 2012 the pearl river is a complicated water system and is mainly composed of three tributaries i e the west river the north river and the east river the three tributaries form the deltaic plain with an area of 9750 km2 before flowing into the scs which is well known as the prd the prd is filled with connective river networks i e the west north and east river networks fig 1b among the three river networks the west river and the north river contribute more than 90 of the water discharge and sediment load in the prd moreover the water and sediment discharges from the west river and north river basins converge are redistributed by the sixianjiao channel and then enter into the west river network and the north river network via the makou and sanshui stations respectively fig 1b as a transition between land and sea the prd is influenced by fluvial dynamics and tidal dynamics however the prd is mostly dominated by fluvial dynamics especially in the upper regions of the prd since the 1980s the population of prd have boomed with increasing from 18 21 million in 1980 to 42 90 million in 2000 in order to satisfying the demand of rapid economic development and urbanization in the prd sand in the river channels were excavated since the mid 1980s however the governmental agencies have prohibited sand excavation in the prd due to its environment problems since the early 2000s luo et al 2007 3 data and methods 3 1 data we collected data on the monthly and annual water discharge q sediment load s and suspended sediment concentration ssc at gauging stations in the upper river basin i e gaoyao and shijiao stations and in the prd i e makou and sanshui stations from 1960 to 2016 in addition we also calculated the sediment transport coefficient i e the ratio of ssc to water discharge stc at gauging stations see fig 1a b to describe the water and sediment regime makou and sanshui are the most important stations since they comprise the two sole hydrological stations in the prd which control the water and sediment discharges entering into the prd and scs zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015a therefore systemic surveying of the water level water surface width flow velocity and geometric shapes such as water depth bed elevation and cross sectional area of the cross sections at the makou and sanshui stations has been conducted since the 1960s it is noted that the location of the makou cross section of measuring the elevation of the riverbed changed after 1998 in this study the cross section of makou i before 1998 is located upstream at a distance of approximately 200 m from makou ii after 1998 in this study we collected the time series of these data from 1960 to 2016 to examine the processes of channel adjustment in addition monthly annual water level and the annual tidal range in the prd i e makou and sanshui stations were also involved in this study these data were derived from the hydrological yearbooks of the pearl river the water bureau of guangdong province wbgp and the bulletins of chinese river sediment complied by the ministry of water resources in china mwrc 2000 2016 the quality and reliability of these data were checked and calibrated by the water conservancy department before they are released in addition the channel hypsography i e elevation data in 1962 1977 1999 2005 and 2014 across the prd at a chart scale of 1 5000 was collected to study the morphological changes in the river channels these data provided by the guangdong waterway bureau and the guangdong hydropower planning and design institute were converted to be relative to the pearl river datum using the arcgis software each dataset in different years was interpolated to a grid with 50 m 50 m cells using the kriging interpolation method which can ensure a good quality of interpolation depth and usually applied in analysing morphological changes brunier et al 2014 wei et al 2017 mei et al 2018b then we selected several cross sections with a distance of 1 km from the makou and sanshui stations in the main west river and north river channels the locations of the cross sections are shown in figs s1 and s2 in the supporting information respectively and obtained the elevation data of the cross sections using the slice tools in the arcgis software the lowest elevation of the cross section represents the thalweg elevation of the river channels see figs s3 and s4 in the supporting information 3 2 methods 3 2 1 at a station hydraulic geometry relation at a station hydraulic geometry exponents were widely applied to predict the alluvial channel behaviour or to discriminate different types of channel cross sections or patterns stewardson 2005 pietsch and nanson 2011 konsoer et al 2013 gleason and wang 2015 for the prd cross sections at makou and sanshui stations were usually selected to examined morphological changes zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015a in this study at a station hydraulic geometry relations at these two stations are used to differentiate the channel s morphological adjustment to human interventions in the prd the hydraulic geometry relations are expressed as the following forms of the power function leopold and maddock 1953 1 w aq b d cq f v kq m where q is the water discharge w d and v are the width depth and velocity of the river channel respectively a c and k are coefficients that indicate the geometry size and flow speed of a cross section and b f and m are the exponents of the channel width depth and velocity respectively which indicate the change rate of the hydraulic variables w d and v with a changing discharge respectively 3 2 2 reconstruction of channel geometry channel evolution is mainly affected by the flow and sediment regime in the river a close relationship exists between the channel geometry and stc which is a comprehensive parameter representing the flow and sediment regime ma et al 2012 zhou et al 2017a furthermore previous studies have revealed that changes in the channel geometry are closely related to previous hydrological conditions xia et al 2014 zhou et al 2017a to reconstruct the channel geometry we explored the relationship between the channel geometry i e cross sectional area and water depth and stc c of the different previous years written as 2 c fn 1 n σ i 1 n c fi 3 g α c fn β where g is the channel geometry parameter c fn is the average stc of the previous n years c fi is the stc of the ith year α is a coefficient and β is an exponent based on the tests of n in different years the correlation degree between the channel geometry i e channel area and water depth and the stc of the previous 5 years was the largest 4 results 4 1 alternations in the flow and sediment regime in the prd fig 2 shows the temporal changes in the water discharge sediment load ssc and stc at the makou and sanshui stations from 1960 to 2016 the water discharge series at makou station shows an insignificant decreasing trend since 1960 and the average water discharge in the 2010s only decreased by 3 9 when compared to that in the 1960s fig 2a however the sediment load ssc and stc series show a significant decreasing trend since the 1960s with a decrease of 73 2 71 9 and 70 8 in the 2010s when compared with those in the 1960s respectively in addition we observe a stepwise decrease of the water discharge and sediment load after 1994 and that of the ssc and stc after 1991 fig 2a and 2b for the sanshui station the water discharge series shows a significant increasing trend since 1960 with an increase of 66 3 from the 1960s to the 2010s additionally a significant increase in the water discharge occurred since 1991 fig 2c however the sediment load ssc and stc series show a decreasing trend since 1960 with a decrease of 32 4 56 4 and 73 8 from the 1960s to the 2010s respectively in addition the sediment load increased from 1991 to 1997 but decreased since 1998 and the ssc and stc began to decrease in 1991 fig 2d 4 2 temporal changes in the geometric evolution of the deltaic channel 4 2 1 channel thalweg changes fig 3 shows the temporal changes in the thalweg difference in the deltaic channels in the west river delta and north river delta in different periods for the west river channel the thalweg difference along the river between 1962 and 1977 indicates that 44 0 of the investigated channel sections were dominated by siltation and 56 of the investigated channels were eroded the average value of elevation of the eroded channels was lowered by 1 0 m from 1977 to 1999 69 of the investigated channel sections were eroded with the mean value of elevation lowered by 2 5 m furthermore the proportion of the eroded channel section increased to 86 and the elevation of the eroded channel was lowered down by an average of 3 2 m from 1999 to 2005 although 85 of the investigated channel sections were still being eroded the mean lowered value of the elevation of the eroded channel decreased to 2 1 m from 2005 to 2014 from 1962 to 1999 almost all of the thalweg differences in the deltaic channels of the north river delta were negative indicating that the entire river channel was being eroded the thalweg elevation of the entire river channel was lowered by an average of 7 0 m from 1962 to 1999 after 1999 the positive value of the thalweg difference occurred in the lower deltaic channel from 1999 to 2005 and the thalweg difference alternated between positive and negative values along the entire channel from 2005 to 2014 furthermore the mean thalweg elevation of the eroded channels were lowered down by an average of 3 2 m and 3 0 m from 1999 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2014 respectively temporal changes in the thalweg elevation of the deltaic channels indicate that significant down cutting of the river channel occurred from 1990s to 2005 furthermore the down cutting of the river channel during this period was uneven and the largest lowered value of the thalweg elevation of the west and north rivers channel reached more than 10 m after 2005 although the deltaic channels were dominated by erosion the magnitude and scope of the erosion in the prd decreased 4 2 2 cross sectional changes the makou and sanshui hydrological stations located at the apex of the prd control the redistribution of water and sediment discharge entering into the prd luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 the geomorphic shape of the cross sections at both stations have been altered by human interventions fig 4 in this study evolutions of the cross sections at both stations were examined to reveal the processes of channel adjustment from 1965 to 2016 we selected three parameters including the cross sectional area mean water depth and wdr i e width to depth ratio of the river channel to describe the evolution of the cross sections at both stations the temporal changes in the three parameters of the cross sections at the makou and sanshui station can be divided into three phases since the 1960s the three parameters had insignificant changes from the 1960s to 1992 indicating a dynamic equilibrium state from 1997 to 2006 the cross sectional area and water depth began to increase and the wdr showed a decrease indicating the occurrence of erosion and an evolution towards being narrower and deeper from 2006 to 2016 the three parameters switched to slightly changing indicating a new adjustment state similarly the three parameters of cross sections at the sanshui stations remained unchanged from 1965 to 1982 after 1982 the cross sectional area and water depth began to increase and the wdr began to decrease it is clear that the cross section eroded with evolving towards being narrower and deeper since 2004 the evolution of the cross section evolved towards an adjustment state and the cross sectional area and water depth slightly increased and the wdr almost remained unchanged from 2004 to 2016 it is clear that the erosion of the cross section at the sanshui station occurred earlier than that at the makou station and the adjustment state of cross section at the sanshui station came earlier than that at the makou station 4 2 3 changes in the at a station hydraulic geometry the geometric shape of a river channel is the result of both the interaction influence and the adjustment between the water flow and the riverbed and is affected by the flow and sediment regime in the river channel morphology the at a station hydraulic geometry relation can reflect the river channel behaviour and the types of channel cross sections ma et al 2012 in this study we examined the hydraulic geometry exponents at the makou and sanshui stations to identify the river channel adjustment in the prd with the results shown in fig 5 the geometry exponents at the makou station show that m f b and m f b over the study period the results indicate that the changing rate of the velocity with the water discharge is the greatest followed by the depth and then the width in general the hydraulic geometry exponents at the makou station show a relatively insignificant change since 1960 however the value of f shows an increasing trend from 1990 to 1993 and the value of m shows a decreasing trend during this period indicating an increase in the changing rate of depth with the discharge from 1993 to 2005 the value of f decreased but the value of m increased indicating an increase in the changing rate of the velocity with the discharge additionally the value of m and f changed slightly from 2005 to 2016 which indicates an adjustment state generally the geometry exponents at the sanshui station also show that the changing rate of the velocity with the water discharge is the greatest over the study period except in 1994 and that the width was comparable to that with the depth for the sanshui station the values of f b and m changed insignificantly before the early 1980s the values of f and b show an increasing trend but the value of m shows a decreasing trend from the mid 1980s to 1994 and the values of f and b switched to decreasing but the value of mincreased from 1994 to 2005 after 2005 the value of b continued to decrease and the value of m increased continually however the value of f changed slightly these results indicated that the mean depth of the river channel remained stable and the adjustment of river channel in response to the water discharge was reflected by a velocity change from 2005 to 2016 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of human interventions on channel evolution 5 1 1 human interventions in the upper river basins previous studies indicated that changes in the water and sediment regime were important factors influencing channel evolution e g wang et al 2010 dai and liu 2013 nelson et al 2015 the water and sediment discharges from the upper pearl river basin converge and then are redistributed by the sixianjiao channel fig 1 for the pearl river human interventions in the river basin can influence the deltaic channel evolution by affecting the water and sediment input in the prd liu et al 2014 therefore temporal changes in the water and sediment discharges in the upper west river basin i e gaoyao station and the upper north river basin i e shijiao station were examined from 1960 to 2016 fig 6 in general the temporal changes in the water discharge sediment load ssc and stc series in the prd i e makou and sanshui stations corresponded well to their changes in the river basins from 1960 to 2016 fig 6a and fig 6c show that the water discharge series in the west river and the north river basins exhibit an insignificant changing trend but the sediment load ssc and stc series in the west river and the north river basins show a decreasing trend beginning in 1960 in addition similar to their changes in the prd the sediment load ssc and stc in the west river and north river basins increased from the 1960s to the 1980s fig 6b and fig 6d according to previous studies e g zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2014 the area of eroded soil in the pearl river increased by more than 1 5 104 km2 from 1954 to 1988 corresponding to 38 9 of eroded soil in 1954 during this period deforestation dominated the changes in the sediment discharge liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018b and resulted in a sediment increase in the river basin correspondingly the evolution of the river channels in the prd remained relatively stable fig 3 and fig 4 since the 1990s many large dams and reservoirs were constructed in the pearl river basins see table s1 in the supporting information and more than 9000 reservoirs had been built by the late 2000s with a total storage capacity of 894 108 m3 which represents approximately 31 7 of the pearl river s annual water discharge liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 during this period the impacts of dam construction were dominating and resulted in the continuous decrease in the sediment discharge since the 1990s liu et al 2017 which aggravated the erosion of the river channel fig 3 and fig 4 similar results can be detected in the yangtze river delta although the entire yangtze river delta has not shown corresponding erosion to sediment reduction caused by the operation of the three gorges dam dai et al 2014 the erosion in the deltaic channels in the inner estuary side were observed luan et al 2016 mei et al 2018b therefore special attentions on the river basin management need be paid in future 5 1 2 sand excavation in the prd large scale sand excavation in the prd began in the mid 1980s and boomed in the early 1990s luo et al 2007 according to luo et al 2007 more than 8 7 108 m3 of sand was excavated from the mainstream in the prd sand excavations have exerted influential impacts on the evolution of the deltaic channels in the prd which is particularly true in the 1990s on one hand the magnitude of the down cutting of the deltaic cannel was higher than that of natural evolution on the other hand the magnitude of the down cutting of the deltaic cannel was uneven across the prd fig 3 as a result the deltaic channel evolved towards being deeper and narrower in addition due to the earlier time of sand excavation in the north river delta compared to that in the west river delta luo et al 2007 liu et al 2014 the down cutting of the deltaic channels in the north river delta occurred earlier than that in the west river delta fig 4 furthermore in response to sudden down cutting of the river channel in the early 1990s changes in the at a station hydraulic geometry at the two stations indicate that the response of the river channels to the water discharge was reflected by the channel area and depth after the early 1990s the velocity changed rapidly accompanied by changes in the water discharge the manning equation indicates that the velocity is dependent on the channel slope and hydraulic radius increasing the slope and depth can result in an increase in velocity zhang et al 2015a it is clear that the depth increase caused by sand excavations led to a rapid increase in velocity since the early 2000s authorities have begun to establish regulations and policies to ban sand excavation activities luo et al 2007 it is clear that the morphological evolution of the longitude section and cross section of the river channels in the prd recovered to a slow change during this period fig 3 and fig 4 in addition changes in the at a station hydraulic geometry at the makou and sanshui stations also show a slow changing pattern fig 5 especially for the width and depth exponents these results indicated that the evolution of the river channel in the prd entered into an adjustment state after the prohibition of sand excavation after 2005 5 2 quantifying the impacts of human interventions according to the above results changes in the water and sediment regime and the effect of sand excavation were the two main factors affecting the channel evolution in the prd wherein changes in the water and sediment regime can be reflected by variations in the stc to evaluate the contributions of two factors on the channel evolution in different periods we selected two important cross sections in the prd as the investigated objects which consisted of relatively continuously series from 1965 to 2016 in this study due to relatively fewer impacts of two factors before 1992 and 1982 for the cross sections at the makou and sanshui stations we examined the relationship between the channel geometry and stc before 1992 and 1982 for the makou station and sanshui station which was considered to be the baseline relationship then the channel geometries i e cross sectional area and water depth after 1992 and 1982 for the makou station and sanshui station were respectively reconstructed based on the above relationship with the results shown in fig 7 it is noted that the difference in the channel geometries between the reconstructed period and baseline period represents changes caused by the variation of the stc and the difference between the reconstructed value and measured value in different periods indicates changes caused mainly by sand excavation for the cross section of the makou station the average reconstructed cross sectional area and water depth were 11014 3 m2 and 15 4 m respectively from 1997 to 1998 which were 1270 6 m2 and 1 73 m more than those in the baseline period respectively changes in the stc and sand excavation contributed 45 5 and 54 5 to the total changes in the cross sectional area and 46 1 and 53 9 to the total changes of the water depth respectively for the cross section at the sanshui station the observed channel geometry i e cross sectional area and water depth was larger than the reconstructed values since 1984 and the difference between the observed and reconstructed values was significantly enlarged since 1998 during the period of 1984 1996 the total changes in the cross sectional area and water depth were 349 9 m2 and 0 91 m and more than 90 of their changes were caused by sand excavation from 1998 to 2016 the impacts of sand excavations on the channel evolution were weakened and sand excavations contributed 55 9 and 41 0 to the total changes in the cross sectional area and the water depth respectively changes in the stc contributed 59 0 to the total changes in the water depth during this period which have outweighed the contribution of the impacts of sand excavation 5 3 hydrological implications of channel evolution 5 3 1 adjustment in redistribution of water and sediment discharges the waters flowing from the west river and the north river converge and then are redistributed by the sixianjiao channel the major portion of the water enters the west river delta through the makou station and the rest flows into the north river delta via the sanshui station fig 1 alterations in the redistribution of water discharge were one of the major causes of change in the hydrological processes in the prd which posed a serious threat to water resource management and hazard prevention luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 geomorphic changes in the deltaic channels have affected the divided water ratio dwr and the divided sediment ratio dsr in both the west river delta and north river delta luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 fig 8 shows that the values of the dwr at the makou station were more than 80 before 1993 ranging from 81 1 to 92 8 with an average value of 85 6 sand excavation began in the north river delta in the mid 1980s which was earlier than that in the west river delta therefore cutting down of the riverbed at the sanshui station occurred earlier than that at makou station fig 4 furthermore the changes in the thalweg elevation of deltaic channels were more significant in the north river delta than that in the west river delta from 1962 to 1999 fig 3 uneven down cutting of the riverbed in the north river delta and west river delta have resulted in changes in the dwr and dsr at makou and sanshui stations since the early 1990s the dwr at the makou station decreased significantly after 1993 with an average value of 78 0 from 1993 to 2016 conversely the average dwr at sanshui station increased from 14 4 during the period of 1960 1992 to 22 0 during the period of 1993 2016 similar to the changes in the dwr the average dsr at makou station decreased from 90 2 during the period of 1960 1992 to 79 4 during the period of 1993 2016 in addition the riverbed at makou station began to erode in 1997 and the thalweg elevation decreased significantly from 1999 to 2005 therefore although the dwr at the makou station shows a decreasing trend from 1993 to 1996 it increased from 1997 to 2016 and the average dwr at the makou station increased from 72 3 to 78 1 from 1993 1996 to 1997 2016 the change in the dsr did not synchronize with that in the dwr at both stations the dsr at the makou station shows an increasing trend but that at the sanshui station displays a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2016 such a phenomenon resulted from the fact that the sediment concentration in the north river basin i e shijiao station was higher than that in the west river basin i e gaoyao station after 2010 fig 6 then the sediment loads from upstream converged and were redistributed by the sixianjiao channel which caused an increase in ssc in the west river delta i e makou station 5 3 2 adjustment in the water level discharge relationship the relationship between the water level and discharge can provide scientific guidelines for flood prevention and water resources management in the river delta luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015a the change in the water level is affected by the water discharge of the rivers in the absence of human interventions zhang et al 2009 the water level corresponded well with the water discharge at the makou and sanshui stations before the 1990s the relationship between the cumulative water level and cumulative water discharge revealed the alternation in the relationship between the water level and water discharge at the makou and sanshui stations after 1997 and 1994 respectively see fig s5 in the supporting information such changes were mainly caused by the incision of the riverbed at the makou and sanshui stations after 1997 and 1994 respectively therefore the curving between the water level and discharge can be divided into three periods fig 9 a and b in general the water discharge at the makou station shows a relatively insignificant decreasing trend from the 1960s to 2010s although its dwr decreased significantly after the early 1990s however the curves showing the stage discharge displayed a significantly stepwise decrease since 1960 in response to the down cutting of the riverbed at the makou station this indicates that the water level corresponding to the same discharge decreased and such a phenomenon was evidently at the high water stage although the water discharge at the sanshui station shows a significant increase beginning in the early 1990s similar significantly stepwise falling curves were detected since 1960 corresponding well to the erosion of the riverbed it is clear that the occurrence of the falling water level came earlier at the sanshui station than that at the makou station and the falling magnitude of the water level at the sanshui station seems larger than that at the makou station in addition the slope of the fitting curve between the stage and discharge at the makou and sanshui stations during 2005 2016 was smaller compared to that from 1990s to 2005 the result revealed the small change of the water level corresponding to the same discharge from 2005 to 2016 which was mainly the result of the gentle adjustment of the riverbed during this period 5 3 3 adjustment in the residual water level slope similarly in fig 9c and fig 9d we observed a remarkable reduction of the residual water level slope along the main courses of the west river and the north river denglongshan makou representing the west river and sanshanjiao sanshui representing the north river see fig 1 the underlying mechanism is mainly due to the substantial deepening of main channels e g cai et al 2018 it was shown that the residual water level slope is primarily balanced by the residual friction term in the momentum equation e g sassi and hoitink 2013 hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 consequently the consistent reduction of the residual water level slope indicates that the effective frictional effect experienced by the oceanic tidal waves is also reduced which may substantially enhance the tidal dynamics for the entire prd especially during the dry season 5 3 4 adjustment in the tidal range it is important to note that the alternation of tidal dynamics in the river delta may cause a series of environment problems such as freshwater withdrawal navigation conditions and water quality issues etc zhang et al 2010 zheng et al 2014 cai et al 2018 fig 10 shows the temporal changes in the annual tide range which is an important variable representing tidal dynamics at the makou and sanshui stations from 1960 to 2016 it can be clearly observed that the annual tide range at both stations remained unchanged before the 1990s however the tidal dynamics in the prd were substantially altered in the 1990s with a remarkably increase in the tidal range such an alternation was mainly due to the incision of deltaic channels in the prd caused by sand excavations which resulted in an increase in the channel capacity these results contributed to an increase in the tidal prism and were favourable for the progradation of tide waves into the prd the underlying mechanism can be primarily attributed to a reduction of the residual water level which is shown in fig 9c and fig 9d the enhancement in the tidal dynamics caused a serious brackish water intrusion in the 1990s which threatened water resources in the prd luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 however the tide ranges at the makou and sanshui stations have shown a slight decrease since 2005 during this period the deltaic channels were in a new adjustment stage after banning sand excavation in the early 2000s so a slight decrease in the tidal range was possible due to the increase in the water discharge in the prd after 2010 fig 2a and fig 2c 5 3 5 implications for sustainable water managements river deltas are important ecosystems and among the most stressed and degraded natural systems in the global context day et al 2016 hoitink et al 2017 best 2019 it was shown that deltaic environments have dramatically changed since the 20th century in response to intensive human activities e g syvitski et al 2009 therefore deltaic sustainability especially the geomorphic sustainability has attracted worldwide attentions our study indicates a gradual incision of deltaic channels in the prd caused by sand excavation and dam construction since the 1990s which has exerted a considerable impact on the deltaic sustainability although water lever reduction due to channel deepening can make the deltas far away from flood inundation channel deepening can increase susceptibility to bank erosion and further result in bank collapse in the river delta brunier et al 2014 therefore more attentions should be paid to sustain bank stability and bank protection in future such as sand excavation control and embankment reinforcement in addition this study reveals an increase in tidal dynamics caused by channel incision in the prd in combination with a relative sea level rise in the outer bay area in recent decades consequently saline water intrusion in the prd is likely to be enhanced in future which may cause serious water resource crisis in the prd some measures have been proposed to prevent saline water intrusion especially during the dry season when freshwater discharge is low such as storing freshwater discharge during the wet season and discharging them into the estuary when saltine water intrudes liu et al 2018a furthermore water conflict occurs in the prd due to the unbalance between the water resources distribution and the water demand for economic development and agriculture production water transfers and diversions is regarded as an effective measure to solve such a problem our results on the redistribution of water and sediment flux in the prd can provide scientific guidelines for water reallocation in future furthermore the evolution of many deltaic channels in the global river deltas has been altered by human interventions such as the yangtze river delta dai et al 2015 mei et al 2018b yellow river delta wang et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 and the mekong delta brunier et al 2014 thus the results obtained from this study may shed new light on improving the sustainable water management in other river deltas worldwide that are subject to large scale human interventions 6 conclusions stepwise adjustment processes of the deltaic channels in the prd since the 1960s in response to human interventions were analysed the evolution of the deltaic channels in the prd was mainly divided into three periods from the 1960s to the 1980s the sediment discharges increased and the channel dimensions and at a station hydraulic exponents of river channels in the prd showed a slight change from the 1990s to the early 2000s significant down cutting occurred in the cross sections and the thalweg elevation of the longitude section furthermore the occurrence time of down cutting in the north river delta was earlier than that in the west river delta and the magnitude of down cutting in the north river delta was larger than that in the west river delta during this period such changes in the deltaic channels were mainly caused by sand excavations for example sand excavations caused more than 50 of the changes in the area and water depth of the cross sections at makou and sanshui since the early 2000s even though sand excavations have been banned the sediment load decreased significantly due to dam construction which aggravated the incision of deltaic channels in the prd however the incision magnitude decreased in response to the evolution phase of the deltaic channel the hydrological regime also showed a stepwise change in the prd due to the uneven down cutting of the deltaic channels the divided water and sediment ratios in the north river delta increased after 1993 in addition the water levels in the prd fell and the tidal range increased in response to the incision of the riverbed in the prd since the early 1990s after banning sand excavations in the prd in the early 2000s hydrological factors including the divided water and sediment ratios water level and tidal range have shown slight changes this study will lead to a better understanding of the adjustment process of deltaic channels and their mechanisms under the impacts of human interventions and climate change and will provide scientific implications for bank protection and water resources exploitation in river deltas declaration of interests none declared

6506,human activities have exerted influential effects on the evolution of channels in river deltas throughout the world in recent decades in this study the adjustment processes of deltaic channels in the pearl river delta prd in response to diverse human interventions were examined during the 1960s 2010s changes in the channel geometries i e cross and longitudinal sections and at a station hydraulic geometry indicate that channel evolution in the prd can be divided into three periods since the 1960s corresponding to stepwise changes in the hydrological processes in the prd during the 1960s 1980s period channel topography showed slight change mainly resulting from the variations in the water and sediment inputs and hence at a station hydraulic geometry also displayed insignificant change such a kind evolution indicates a negligible impact from human interventions and an insignificant change in the hydrological processes in the prd from the1990s to the early 2000s the deltaic channels were substantially deepened mainly due to large scale sand excavation occurred in the prd and changes in at a station hydraulic geometry reveal an increase in the changing rate of the velocity with the discharge but a decrease for water depth and channel area in response to channel deepening the water level decreased but the tidal range increased at the makou and sanshui stations during this period furthermore uneven down cutting of the riverbed also significantly altered the divided water and sediment ratios in the prd after the prohibition of sand excavation i e mid 2000s although sediment reduction caused by dam construction was favorable for the further incision of deltaic channels the incision magnitude was considerably decreased in addition we observe a relatively slight change in at a station hydraulic geometry these results indicate an adjustment stage for the deltaic channels during this period correspondingly the divided water and sediment ratios showed insignificantly change in the prd as did the water level and the tidal range the results obtained from this study may help to set scientific guidelines for sustainable water management strategies for flood control embankment protection water and sediment regulation and prevention of salt water intrusion in the prd and other river deltas worldwide that are subject to strong human interventions keywords channel evolution hydraulic geometry sediment regime alternation sand excavation river deltas 1 introduction river deltas are important zones that support large human populations and productive ecosystems e g syvitski et al 2009 dai et al 2014 best 2019 the evolution of a deltaic channel is closely related to flood prevention and bank protection which sustains the safety of the river delta ecosystem in reality channel adjustment continuously occurs in response to natural forcing and human interferences e g dai et al 2013 brunier et al 2014 mei et al 2018a however in recent decades human interventions have been the key driver for deltaic channel evolution syvitski et al 2005 syvitski and saito 2007 day et al 2016 zhou et al 2017b which brings a series of uncertainties to prediction of channel adjustments calle et al 2017 nowadays channel responses in the river deltas to human interventions have received worldwide concerns in the context of global changes dai et al 2015 tan et al 2016 blom et al 2017 bi et al 2019 best 2019 sediment and water supply are fundamental boundary conditions that control channel dynamics mueller and pitlick 2013 shaw et al 2013 mueller and pitlick 2014 nelson et al 2015 dean et al 2016 ahn et al 2017 human interventions such as dam construction water soil prevention and deforestation in catchments can affect the river delta evolution via altering the flow and sediment regimes walling and fang 2003 walling 2006 meade and moody 2010 wang et al 2011 kondolf et al 2014 dai et al 2016 best 2019 and it is particularly true for dam operation syvitski et al 2009 wang et al 2011 dai and liu 2013 yang et al 2014 brunier et al 2014 for example mei et al 2018b reported the erosion in the upper reach of the north channel in the yangtze river delta due to the riverine sediment reduction after the closure of three gorges dam similarly zheng et al 2018 observed that qingshuigou channel in the yellow river delta was eroded caused by the implementation of the water and sediment regulation scheme since 2002 in addition human activities such as sand excavation bank protection engineering and waterway regulation have considerably affected the river channel morphology surian and rinaldi 2003 li et al 2007 luo et al 2007 brunier et al 2014 brunier et al 2014 claimed that riverbed mining was responsible for depth increase of the mekong and bassac river channels in the mekong delta from 1998 to 2008 pye and blott 2014 reported channels in some uk estuaries adjusted quickly to human interferences including embanking land claim dredging etc luan et al 2016 and wei et al 2017 considered that estuarine engineering projects had exerted influential impacts on the morphological evolution of estuarine channels in the yangtze river delta the impact of human interventions on river channels should be expressed by the changes in channel morphology previous studies have indicated that river channels are continuously adjusted through changes in the channel depth velocity and width to changes in the channel morphology pietsch and nanson 2011 modrick and georgakakos 2014 nelson et al 2015 jia et al 2017 however diverse human interventions can exert different effects on the channel morphology consequently channel adjustment should show different patterns therefore exploring the change patterns in the deltaic channel morphology in response to human interventions is scientifically important for the management of river deltas the pearl river delta prd is located in south china and is adjacent to the south china sea scs the prd consists of many connected river networks and is well known as one of the most complicated river deltas in world since the 1980s the prd has become one of the fastest economically developing and urbanizing regions both domestically and globally currently the prd is an important zone for building the guangdong hong kong marco greater bay area which is a major strategy for the development of china in the last 30 years intensive human interventions have strongly disturbed the natural evolution of the river channel in the prd e g lu et al 2007 luo et al 2007 zheng et al 2014 tan et al 2016 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2018b on one hand dam constructions in the pearl river basin have reduced the sediment load from upstream by approximately 40 since the 1990s liu et al 2017 tan et al 2017 on the other hand sand excavation in the prd has significantly resulted in the down cutting of the riverbed of the deltaic channels lu et al 2007 luo et al 2007 according to luo et al 2007 more than 8 7 108 m3 of sand were excavated from 1986 to 2003 in the prd resulting in average down cutting depths of 0 59 1 7 m 0 34 4 43 m and 1 77 6 48 m in the main channels of the west river north river and east river respectively these changes in the river channels have caused environmental problems in the prd including salt water intrusion and bank collapse luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2014 since the 2000s authorities have expressed deep concerns on the environmental impacts caused by sand excavation on the prd and have established regulations and policies to prohibit sand excavation in the prd luo et al 2007 liu et al 2014 as such the magnitude of sand excavation in the prd has been weakened since the early 2000s however new dams in the pearl river basin were constructed after the early 2000s liu et al 2014 it is clear that the evolution of the prd has been under new circumstances post 2000s therefore it is urgent to explore the impacts of human activities on the channel adjustment in different stages to maintain the channel stability of the prd previous studies mainly focused on the channel evolution of the prd caused by sand excavation before the 2000s e g lu et al 2007 luo et al 2007 zheng et al 2014 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a in particular some studies examined morphological responses of subaqueous prd resulted from human interventions after 1990s zhang et al 2015b wu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 after the prohibition of sand excavation i e after early 2000s the channels in the prd may be self adjusted due to its resilience dai et al 2015 calle et al 2017 hoitink et al 2017 however fewer studies examined the channel adjustment in the subaerial prd in response to human activities after 1990s which can affect the characteristics of sediment delivered into the subaqueous delta tan et al 2016 dai et al 2018 it is necessary to explore adjustment patterns of deltaic channels in the prd under the new circumstances therefore this study examined the geomorphic evolution of river channels based on the long term series of the elevation of the cross section and the channel topography in the prd from the 1960s to the 2010s the objectives of this study are 1 to explore the channel adjustment of the river channels in response to diverse human interventions in different periods 2 to quantify the impact of human interventions on the channel adjustment and 3 to discuss the implications of the channel change on the hydrological processes in the prd our study will lead to a better understanding of the adjustment process of deltaic channels and its mechanism under the impacts of human interventions and natural factors and will provide scientific implications for bank protection and water resources exploitation in the river delta 2 study area the pearl river originates on the yunnan plateau and flows eastwards to the scs with a length of 2400 km and a basin area of 450 000 km2 fig 1 a as the second largest river in terms of water discharge the pearl river annually delivers approximately 2823 108 m3 yr of water discharge and 72 4 106 t yr of sediment load into the south china sea liu et al 2014 average annual precipitation in the river basin was about 1378 mm yr and show insignificant changing trend from 1950s to 2000s liu et al 2017 approximately 80 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the wet season from april to september in response to the summer monsoon the pearl river basin is dictated by a monsoon climate and approximately 80 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the wet season from april to september in response to the summer monsoon therefore more than 80 of the water and 90 of the sediment in the pearl river are concentrated during the wet season from 1964 to 2009 the population of river basin has greatly increased from 100 million to 230 million and hence human activities especially dam construction in the upstream of prd have been dramatically intensified wu et al 2012 the pearl river is a complicated water system and is mainly composed of three tributaries i e the west river the north river and the east river the three tributaries form the deltaic plain with an area of 9750 km2 before flowing into the scs which is well known as the prd the prd is filled with connective river networks i e the west north and east river networks fig 1b among the three river networks the west river and the north river contribute more than 90 of the water discharge and sediment load in the prd moreover the water and sediment discharges from the west river and north river basins converge are redistributed by the sixianjiao channel and then enter into the west river network and the north river network via the makou and sanshui stations respectively fig 1b as a transition between land and sea the prd is influenced by fluvial dynamics and tidal dynamics however the prd is mostly dominated by fluvial dynamics especially in the upper regions of the prd since the 1980s the population of prd have boomed with increasing from 18 21 million in 1980 to 42 90 million in 2000 in order to satisfying the demand of rapid economic development and urbanization in the prd sand in the river channels were excavated since the mid 1980s however the governmental agencies have prohibited sand excavation in the prd due to its environment problems since the early 2000s luo et al 2007 3 data and methods 3 1 data we collected data on the monthly and annual water discharge q sediment load s and suspended sediment concentration ssc at gauging stations in the upper river basin i e gaoyao and shijiao stations and in the prd i e makou and sanshui stations from 1960 to 2016 in addition we also calculated the sediment transport coefficient i e the ratio of ssc to water discharge stc at gauging stations see fig 1a b to describe the water and sediment regime makou and sanshui are the most important stations since they comprise the two sole hydrological stations in the prd which control the water and sediment discharges entering into the prd and scs zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015a therefore systemic surveying of the water level water surface width flow velocity and geometric shapes such as water depth bed elevation and cross sectional area of the cross sections at the makou and sanshui stations has been conducted since the 1960s it is noted that the location of the makou cross section of measuring the elevation of the riverbed changed after 1998 in this study the cross section of makou i before 1998 is located upstream at a distance of approximately 200 m from makou ii after 1998 in this study we collected the time series of these data from 1960 to 2016 to examine the processes of channel adjustment in addition monthly annual water level and the annual tidal range in the prd i e makou and sanshui stations were also involved in this study these data were derived from the hydrological yearbooks of the pearl river the water bureau of guangdong province wbgp and the bulletins of chinese river sediment complied by the ministry of water resources in china mwrc 2000 2016 the quality and reliability of these data were checked and calibrated by the water conservancy department before they are released in addition the channel hypsography i e elevation data in 1962 1977 1999 2005 and 2014 across the prd at a chart scale of 1 5000 was collected to study the morphological changes in the river channels these data provided by the guangdong waterway bureau and the guangdong hydropower planning and design institute were converted to be relative to the pearl river datum using the arcgis software each dataset in different years was interpolated to a grid with 50 m 50 m cells using the kriging interpolation method which can ensure a good quality of interpolation depth and usually applied in analysing morphological changes brunier et al 2014 wei et al 2017 mei et al 2018b then we selected several cross sections with a distance of 1 km from the makou and sanshui stations in the main west river and north river channels the locations of the cross sections are shown in figs s1 and s2 in the supporting information respectively and obtained the elevation data of the cross sections using the slice tools in the arcgis software the lowest elevation of the cross section represents the thalweg elevation of the river channels see figs s3 and s4 in the supporting information 3 2 methods 3 2 1 at a station hydraulic geometry relation at a station hydraulic geometry exponents were widely applied to predict the alluvial channel behaviour or to discriminate different types of channel cross sections or patterns stewardson 2005 pietsch and nanson 2011 konsoer et al 2013 gleason and wang 2015 for the prd cross sections at makou and sanshui stations were usually selected to examined morphological changes zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015a in this study at a station hydraulic geometry relations at these two stations are used to differentiate the channel s morphological adjustment to human interventions in the prd the hydraulic geometry relations are expressed as the following forms of the power function leopold and maddock 1953 1 w aq b d cq f v kq m where q is the water discharge w d and v are the width depth and velocity of the river channel respectively a c and k are coefficients that indicate the geometry size and flow speed of a cross section and b f and m are the exponents of the channel width depth and velocity respectively which indicate the change rate of the hydraulic variables w d and v with a changing discharge respectively 3 2 2 reconstruction of channel geometry channel evolution is mainly affected by the flow and sediment regime in the river a close relationship exists between the channel geometry and stc which is a comprehensive parameter representing the flow and sediment regime ma et al 2012 zhou et al 2017a furthermore previous studies have revealed that changes in the channel geometry are closely related to previous hydrological conditions xia et al 2014 zhou et al 2017a to reconstruct the channel geometry we explored the relationship between the channel geometry i e cross sectional area and water depth and stc c of the different previous years written as 2 c fn 1 n σ i 1 n c fi 3 g α c fn β where g is the channel geometry parameter c fn is the average stc of the previous n years c fi is the stc of the ith year α is a coefficient and β is an exponent based on the tests of n in different years the correlation degree between the channel geometry i e channel area and water depth and the stc of the previous 5 years was the largest 4 results 4 1 alternations in the flow and sediment regime in the prd fig 2 shows the temporal changes in the water discharge sediment load ssc and stc at the makou and sanshui stations from 1960 to 2016 the water discharge series at makou station shows an insignificant decreasing trend since 1960 and the average water discharge in the 2010s only decreased by 3 9 when compared to that in the 1960s fig 2a however the sediment load ssc and stc series show a significant decreasing trend since the 1960s with a decrease of 73 2 71 9 and 70 8 in the 2010s when compared with those in the 1960s respectively in addition we observe a stepwise decrease of the water discharge and sediment load after 1994 and that of the ssc and stc after 1991 fig 2a and 2b for the sanshui station the water discharge series shows a significant increasing trend since 1960 with an increase of 66 3 from the 1960s to the 2010s additionally a significant increase in the water discharge occurred since 1991 fig 2c however the sediment load ssc and stc series show a decreasing trend since 1960 with a decrease of 32 4 56 4 and 73 8 from the 1960s to the 2010s respectively in addition the sediment load increased from 1991 to 1997 but decreased since 1998 and the ssc and stc began to decrease in 1991 fig 2d 4 2 temporal changes in the geometric evolution of the deltaic channel 4 2 1 channel thalweg changes fig 3 shows the temporal changes in the thalweg difference in the deltaic channels in the west river delta and north river delta in different periods for the west river channel the thalweg difference along the river between 1962 and 1977 indicates that 44 0 of the investigated channel sections were dominated by siltation and 56 of the investigated channels were eroded the average value of elevation of the eroded channels was lowered by 1 0 m from 1977 to 1999 69 of the investigated channel sections were eroded with the mean value of elevation lowered by 2 5 m furthermore the proportion of the eroded channel section increased to 86 and the elevation of the eroded channel was lowered down by an average of 3 2 m from 1999 to 2005 although 85 of the investigated channel sections were still being eroded the mean lowered value of the elevation of the eroded channel decreased to 2 1 m from 2005 to 2014 from 1962 to 1999 almost all of the thalweg differences in the deltaic channels of the north river delta were negative indicating that the entire river channel was being eroded the thalweg elevation of the entire river channel was lowered by an average of 7 0 m from 1962 to 1999 after 1999 the positive value of the thalweg difference occurred in the lower deltaic channel from 1999 to 2005 and the thalweg difference alternated between positive and negative values along the entire channel from 2005 to 2014 furthermore the mean thalweg elevation of the eroded channels were lowered down by an average of 3 2 m and 3 0 m from 1999 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2014 respectively temporal changes in the thalweg elevation of the deltaic channels indicate that significant down cutting of the river channel occurred from 1990s to 2005 furthermore the down cutting of the river channel during this period was uneven and the largest lowered value of the thalweg elevation of the west and north rivers channel reached more than 10 m after 2005 although the deltaic channels were dominated by erosion the magnitude and scope of the erosion in the prd decreased 4 2 2 cross sectional changes the makou and sanshui hydrological stations located at the apex of the prd control the redistribution of water and sediment discharge entering into the prd luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 the geomorphic shape of the cross sections at both stations have been altered by human interventions fig 4 in this study evolutions of the cross sections at both stations were examined to reveal the processes of channel adjustment from 1965 to 2016 we selected three parameters including the cross sectional area mean water depth and wdr i e width to depth ratio of the river channel to describe the evolution of the cross sections at both stations the temporal changes in the three parameters of the cross sections at the makou and sanshui station can be divided into three phases since the 1960s the three parameters had insignificant changes from the 1960s to 1992 indicating a dynamic equilibrium state from 1997 to 2006 the cross sectional area and water depth began to increase and the wdr showed a decrease indicating the occurrence of erosion and an evolution towards being narrower and deeper from 2006 to 2016 the three parameters switched to slightly changing indicating a new adjustment state similarly the three parameters of cross sections at the sanshui stations remained unchanged from 1965 to 1982 after 1982 the cross sectional area and water depth began to increase and the wdr began to decrease it is clear that the cross section eroded with evolving towards being narrower and deeper since 2004 the evolution of the cross section evolved towards an adjustment state and the cross sectional area and water depth slightly increased and the wdr almost remained unchanged from 2004 to 2016 it is clear that the erosion of the cross section at the sanshui station occurred earlier than that at the makou station and the adjustment state of cross section at the sanshui station came earlier than that at the makou station 4 2 3 changes in the at a station hydraulic geometry the geometric shape of a river channel is the result of both the interaction influence and the adjustment between the water flow and the riverbed and is affected by the flow and sediment regime in the river channel morphology the at a station hydraulic geometry relation can reflect the river channel behaviour and the types of channel cross sections ma et al 2012 in this study we examined the hydraulic geometry exponents at the makou and sanshui stations to identify the river channel adjustment in the prd with the results shown in fig 5 the geometry exponents at the makou station show that m f b and m f b over the study period the results indicate that the changing rate of the velocity with the water discharge is the greatest followed by the depth and then the width in general the hydraulic geometry exponents at the makou station show a relatively insignificant change since 1960 however the value of f shows an increasing trend from 1990 to 1993 and the value of m shows a decreasing trend during this period indicating an increase in the changing rate of depth with the discharge from 1993 to 2005 the value of f decreased but the value of m increased indicating an increase in the changing rate of the velocity with the discharge additionally the value of m and f changed slightly from 2005 to 2016 which indicates an adjustment state generally the geometry exponents at the sanshui station also show that the changing rate of the velocity with the water discharge is the greatest over the study period except in 1994 and that the width was comparable to that with the depth for the sanshui station the values of f b and m changed insignificantly before the early 1980s the values of f and b show an increasing trend but the value of m shows a decreasing trend from the mid 1980s to 1994 and the values of f and b switched to decreasing but the value of mincreased from 1994 to 2005 after 2005 the value of b continued to decrease and the value of m increased continually however the value of f changed slightly these results indicated that the mean depth of the river channel remained stable and the adjustment of river channel in response to the water discharge was reflected by a velocity change from 2005 to 2016 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of human interventions on channel evolution 5 1 1 human interventions in the upper river basins previous studies indicated that changes in the water and sediment regime were important factors influencing channel evolution e g wang et al 2010 dai and liu 2013 nelson et al 2015 the water and sediment discharges from the upper pearl river basin converge and then are redistributed by the sixianjiao channel fig 1 for the pearl river human interventions in the river basin can influence the deltaic channel evolution by affecting the water and sediment input in the prd liu et al 2014 therefore temporal changes in the water and sediment discharges in the upper west river basin i e gaoyao station and the upper north river basin i e shijiao station were examined from 1960 to 2016 fig 6 in general the temporal changes in the water discharge sediment load ssc and stc series in the prd i e makou and sanshui stations corresponded well to their changes in the river basins from 1960 to 2016 fig 6a and fig 6c show that the water discharge series in the west river and the north river basins exhibit an insignificant changing trend but the sediment load ssc and stc series in the west river and the north river basins show a decreasing trend beginning in 1960 in addition similar to their changes in the prd the sediment load ssc and stc in the west river and north river basins increased from the 1960s to the 1980s fig 6b and fig 6d according to previous studies e g zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2014 the area of eroded soil in the pearl river increased by more than 1 5 104 km2 from 1954 to 1988 corresponding to 38 9 of eroded soil in 1954 during this period deforestation dominated the changes in the sediment discharge liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018b and resulted in a sediment increase in the river basin correspondingly the evolution of the river channels in the prd remained relatively stable fig 3 and fig 4 since the 1990s many large dams and reservoirs were constructed in the pearl river basins see table s1 in the supporting information and more than 9000 reservoirs had been built by the late 2000s with a total storage capacity of 894 108 m3 which represents approximately 31 7 of the pearl river s annual water discharge liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 during this period the impacts of dam construction were dominating and resulted in the continuous decrease in the sediment discharge since the 1990s liu et al 2017 which aggravated the erosion of the river channel fig 3 and fig 4 similar results can be detected in the yangtze river delta although the entire yangtze river delta has not shown corresponding erosion to sediment reduction caused by the operation of the three gorges dam dai et al 2014 the erosion in the deltaic channels in the inner estuary side were observed luan et al 2016 mei et al 2018b therefore special attentions on the river basin management need be paid in future 5 1 2 sand excavation in the prd large scale sand excavation in the prd began in the mid 1980s and boomed in the early 1990s luo et al 2007 according to luo et al 2007 more than 8 7 108 m3 of sand was excavated from the mainstream in the prd sand excavations have exerted influential impacts on the evolution of the deltaic channels in the prd which is particularly true in the 1990s on one hand the magnitude of the down cutting of the deltaic cannel was higher than that of natural evolution on the other hand the magnitude of the down cutting of the deltaic cannel was uneven across the prd fig 3 as a result the deltaic channel evolved towards being deeper and narrower in addition due to the earlier time of sand excavation in the north river delta compared to that in the west river delta luo et al 2007 liu et al 2014 the down cutting of the deltaic channels in the north river delta occurred earlier than that in the west river delta fig 4 furthermore in response to sudden down cutting of the river channel in the early 1990s changes in the at a station hydraulic geometry at the two stations indicate that the response of the river channels to the water discharge was reflected by the channel area and depth after the early 1990s the velocity changed rapidly accompanied by changes in the water discharge the manning equation indicates that the velocity is dependent on the channel slope and hydraulic radius increasing the slope and depth can result in an increase in velocity zhang et al 2015a it is clear that the depth increase caused by sand excavations led to a rapid increase in velocity since the early 2000s authorities have begun to establish regulations and policies to ban sand excavation activities luo et al 2007 it is clear that the morphological evolution of the longitude section and cross section of the river channels in the prd recovered to a slow change during this period fig 3 and fig 4 in addition changes in the at a station hydraulic geometry at the makou and sanshui stations also show a slow changing pattern fig 5 especially for the width and depth exponents these results indicated that the evolution of the river channel in the prd entered into an adjustment state after the prohibition of sand excavation after 2005 5 2 quantifying the impacts of human interventions according to the above results changes in the water and sediment regime and the effect of sand excavation were the two main factors affecting the channel evolution in the prd wherein changes in the water and sediment regime can be reflected by variations in the stc to evaluate the contributions of two factors on the channel evolution in different periods we selected two important cross sections in the prd as the investigated objects which consisted of relatively continuously series from 1965 to 2016 in this study due to relatively fewer impacts of two factors before 1992 and 1982 for the cross sections at the makou and sanshui stations we examined the relationship between the channel geometry and stc before 1992 and 1982 for the makou station and sanshui station which was considered to be the baseline relationship then the channel geometries i e cross sectional area and water depth after 1992 and 1982 for the makou station and sanshui station were respectively reconstructed based on the above relationship with the results shown in fig 7 it is noted that the difference in the channel geometries between the reconstructed period and baseline period represents changes caused by the variation of the stc and the difference between the reconstructed value and measured value in different periods indicates changes caused mainly by sand excavation for the cross section of the makou station the average reconstructed cross sectional area and water depth were 11014 3 m2 and 15 4 m respectively from 1997 to 1998 which were 1270 6 m2 and 1 73 m more than those in the baseline period respectively changes in the stc and sand excavation contributed 45 5 and 54 5 to the total changes in the cross sectional area and 46 1 and 53 9 to the total changes of the water depth respectively for the cross section at the sanshui station the observed channel geometry i e cross sectional area and water depth was larger than the reconstructed values since 1984 and the difference between the observed and reconstructed values was significantly enlarged since 1998 during the period of 1984 1996 the total changes in the cross sectional area and water depth were 349 9 m2 and 0 91 m and more than 90 of their changes were caused by sand excavation from 1998 to 2016 the impacts of sand excavations on the channel evolution were weakened and sand excavations contributed 55 9 and 41 0 to the total changes in the cross sectional area and the water depth respectively changes in the stc contributed 59 0 to the total changes in the water depth during this period which have outweighed the contribution of the impacts of sand excavation 5 3 hydrological implications of channel evolution 5 3 1 adjustment in redistribution of water and sediment discharges the waters flowing from the west river and the north river converge and then are redistributed by the sixianjiao channel the major portion of the water enters the west river delta through the makou station and the rest flows into the north river delta via the sanshui station fig 1 alterations in the redistribution of water discharge were one of the major causes of change in the hydrological processes in the prd which posed a serious threat to water resource management and hazard prevention luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 geomorphic changes in the deltaic channels have affected the divided water ratio dwr and the divided sediment ratio dsr in both the west river delta and north river delta luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 fig 8 shows that the values of the dwr at the makou station were more than 80 before 1993 ranging from 81 1 to 92 8 with an average value of 85 6 sand excavation began in the north river delta in the mid 1980s which was earlier than that in the west river delta therefore cutting down of the riverbed at the sanshui station occurred earlier than that at makou station fig 4 furthermore the changes in the thalweg elevation of deltaic channels were more significant in the north river delta than that in the west river delta from 1962 to 1999 fig 3 uneven down cutting of the riverbed in the north river delta and west river delta have resulted in changes in the dwr and dsr at makou and sanshui stations since the early 1990s the dwr at the makou station decreased significantly after 1993 with an average value of 78 0 from 1993 to 2016 conversely the average dwr at sanshui station increased from 14 4 during the period of 1960 1992 to 22 0 during the period of 1993 2016 similar to the changes in the dwr the average dsr at makou station decreased from 90 2 during the period of 1960 1992 to 79 4 during the period of 1993 2016 in addition the riverbed at makou station began to erode in 1997 and the thalweg elevation decreased significantly from 1999 to 2005 therefore although the dwr at the makou station shows a decreasing trend from 1993 to 1996 it increased from 1997 to 2016 and the average dwr at the makou station increased from 72 3 to 78 1 from 1993 1996 to 1997 2016 the change in the dsr did not synchronize with that in the dwr at both stations the dsr at the makou station shows an increasing trend but that at the sanshui station displays a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2016 such a phenomenon resulted from the fact that the sediment concentration in the north river basin i e shijiao station was higher than that in the west river basin i e gaoyao station after 2010 fig 6 then the sediment loads from upstream converged and were redistributed by the sixianjiao channel which caused an increase in ssc in the west river delta i e makou station 5 3 2 adjustment in the water level discharge relationship the relationship between the water level and discharge can provide scientific guidelines for flood prevention and water resources management in the river delta luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015a the change in the water level is affected by the water discharge of the rivers in the absence of human interventions zhang et al 2009 the water level corresponded well with the water discharge at the makou and sanshui stations before the 1990s the relationship between the cumulative water level and cumulative water discharge revealed the alternation in the relationship between the water level and water discharge at the makou and sanshui stations after 1997 and 1994 respectively see fig s5 in the supporting information such changes were mainly caused by the incision of the riverbed at the makou and sanshui stations after 1997 and 1994 respectively therefore the curving between the water level and discharge can be divided into three periods fig 9 a and b in general the water discharge at the makou station shows a relatively insignificant decreasing trend from the 1960s to 2010s although its dwr decreased significantly after the early 1990s however the curves showing the stage discharge displayed a significantly stepwise decrease since 1960 in response to the down cutting of the riverbed at the makou station this indicates that the water level corresponding to the same discharge decreased and such a phenomenon was evidently at the high water stage although the water discharge at the sanshui station shows a significant increase beginning in the early 1990s similar significantly stepwise falling curves were detected since 1960 corresponding well to the erosion of the riverbed it is clear that the occurrence of the falling water level came earlier at the sanshui station than that at the makou station and the falling magnitude of the water level at the sanshui station seems larger than that at the makou station in addition the slope of the fitting curve between the stage and discharge at the makou and sanshui stations during 2005 2016 was smaller compared to that from 1990s to 2005 the result revealed the small change of the water level corresponding to the same discharge from 2005 to 2016 which was mainly the result of the gentle adjustment of the riverbed during this period 5 3 3 adjustment in the residual water level slope similarly in fig 9c and fig 9d we observed a remarkable reduction of the residual water level slope along the main courses of the west river and the north river denglongshan makou representing the west river and sanshanjiao sanshui representing the north river see fig 1 the underlying mechanism is mainly due to the substantial deepening of main channels e g cai et al 2018 it was shown that the residual water level slope is primarily balanced by the residual friction term in the momentum equation e g sassi and hoitink 2013 hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 consequently the consistent reduction of the residual water level slope indicates that the effective frictional effect experienced by the oceanic tidal waves is also reduced which may substantially enhance the tidal dynamics for the entire prd especially during the dry season 5 3 4 adjustment in the tidal range it is important to note that the alternation of tidal dynamics in the river delta may cause a series of environment problems such as freshwater withdrawal navigation conditions and water quality issues etc zhang et al 2010 zheng et al 2014 cai et al 2018 fig 10 shows the temporal changes in the annual tide range which is an important variable representing tidal dynamics at the makou and sanshui stations from 1960 to 2016 it can be clearly observed that the annual tide range at both stations remained unchanged before the 1990s however the tidal dynamics in the prd were substantially altered in the 1990s with a remarkably increase in the tidal range such an alternation was mainly due to the incision of deltaic channels in the prd caused by sand excavations which resulted in an increase in the channel capacity these results contributed to an increase in the tidal prism and were favourable for the progradation of tide waves into the prd the underlying mechanism can be primarily attributed to a reduction of the residual water level which is shown in fig 9c and fig 9d the enhancement in the tidal dynamics caused a serious brackish water intrusion in the 1990s which threatened water resources in the prd luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 however the tide ranges at the makou and sanshui stations have shown a slight decrease since 2005 during this period the deltaic channels were in a new adjustment stage after banning sand excavation in the early 2000s so a slight decrease in the tidal range was possible due to the increase in the water discharge in the prd after 2010 fig 2a and fig 2c 5 3 5 implications for sustainable water managements river deltas are important ecosystems and among the most stressed and degraded natural systems in the global context day et al 2016 hoitink et al 2017 best 2019 it was shown that deltaic environments have dramatically changed since the 20th century in response to intensive human activities e g syvitski et al 2009 therefore deltaic sustainability especially the geomorphic sustainability has attracted worldwide attentions our study indicates a gradual incision of deltaic channels in the prd caused by sand excavation and dam construction since the 1990s which has exerted a considerable impact on the deltaic sustainability although water lever reduction due to channel deepening can make the deltas far away from flood inundation channel deepening can increase susceptibility to bank erosion and further result in bank collapse in the river delta brunier et al 2014 therefore more attentions should be paid to sustain bank stability and bank protection in future such as sand excavation control and embankment reinforcement in addition this study reveals an increase in tidal dynamics caused by channel incision in the prd in combination with a relative sea level rise in the outer bay area in recent decades consequently saline water intrusion in the prd is likely to be enhanced in future which may cause serious water resource crisis in the prd some measures have been proposed to prevent saline water intrusion especially during the dry season when freshwater discharge is low such as storing freshwater discharge during the wet season and discharging them into the estuary when saltine water intrudes liu et al 2018a furthermore water conflict occurs in the prd due to the unbalance between the water resources distribution and the water demand for economic development and agriculture production water transfers and diversions is regarded as an effective measure to solve such a problem our results on the redistribution of water and sediment flux in the prd can provide scientific guidelines for water reallocation in future furthermore the evolution of many deltaic channels in the global river deltas has been altered by human interventions such as the yangtze river delta dai et al 2015 mei et al 2018b yellow river delta wang et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 and the mekong delta brunier et al 2014 thus the results obtained from this study may shed new light on improving the sustainable water management in other river deltas worldwide that are subject to large scale human interventions 6 conclusions stepwise adjustment processes of the deltaic channels in the prd since the 1960s in response to human interventions were analysed the evolution of the deltaic channels in the prd was mainly divided into three periods from the 1960s to the 1980s the sediment discharges increased and the channel dimensions and at a station hydraulic exponents of river channels in the prd showed a slight change from the 1990s to the early 2000s significant down cutting occurred in the cross sections and the thalweg elevation of the longitude section furthermore the occurrence time of down cutting in the north river delta was earlier than that in the west river delta and the magnitude of down cutting in the north river delta was larger than that in the west river delta during this period such changes in the deltaic channels were mainly caused by sand excavations for example sand excavations caused more than 50 of the changes in the area and water depth of the cross sections at makou and sanshui since the early 2000s even though sand excavations have been banned the sediment load decreased significantly due to dam construction which aggravated the incision of deltaic channels in the prd however the incision magnitude decreased in response to the evolution phase of the deltaic channel the hydrological regime also showed a stepwise change in the prd due to the uneven down cutting of the deltaic channels the divided water and sediment ratios in the north river delta increased after 1993 in addition the water levels in the prd fell and the tidal range increased in response to the incision of the riverbed in the prd since the early 1990s after banning sand excavations in the prd in the early 2000s hydrological factors including the divided water and sediment ratios water level and tidal range have shown slight changes this study will lead to a better understanding of the adjustment process of deltaic channels and their mechanisms under the impacts of human interventions and climate change and will provide scientific implications for bank protection and water resources exploitation in river deltas declaration of interests none declared

6507,the purpose of this study is to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employed for flood forecasting developing a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts has not been adequately addressed yet in this study first a weather research and forecasting wrf model was used to forecast the heavy precipitation in kan basin iran ensemble storms were forecasted using five cumulus schemes including kain fritsch betts miller janjic grell 3d ensemble multi scale kain fritsch and grell devenyi ensemble cumulus scheme then a bayesian networks bn was developed to estimate the flood peak using the atmospheric ensemble forecasts finally a fuzzy topsis the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution model was prepared for making decisions for flood warning scenarios considering all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainty associated with them assessment of the proposed flood warning system was examined for various scenarios it showed that when a significantly high probability was assigned to a warning level that level had the maximum closeness coefficient and consequently chosen as a warning level yet if the probability was distributed equally between some warning levels the flood warning system acts cautiously since the decision making model allocated the highest rank to the stronger warning level regarding the reasonable results of this study applying the fuzzy topsis model to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts is recommended to apply in similar catchments for addressing the uncertainties keywords bayesian networks ensemble flood forecasting flood warning fuzzy topsis wrf model 1 introduction quantifying the uncertainties of flood forecasting is becoming increasingly essential for operational purposes komma et al 2007 furthermore as atmospheric forecasts are used for flood forecasting their uncertainties should be considered in the flood forecasting dietrich et al 2009b in order to address these uncertainties many operational flood forecasting systems are increasingly moving towards the application of ensemble flood forecasts rather than single deterministic forecasts cloke and pappenberger 2009 various approaches have been presented to forecast atmospheric ensemble forecasts including perturbing the input parameters of the model perturbing the initial conditions using multi model ensembles and using different parameterization schemes yang et al 2012 numerical weather prediction nwp models are used for atmospheric forecasting the spatial resolution of nwp models is sometimes too coarse to consider the physical processes including momentum heat and humidity turbulence fluxes and thus these phenomena have to be parameterized in these models shrivastava et al 2014 generate an ensemble or set of different forecasts of atmospheric processes differed by using various parameterization schemes is the standard method of addressing the parameterization uncertainty one of the most important parameterization schemes in rainfall forecasting is the cumulus parameterization nasrollahi et al 2012 nwp models often use cumulus parameterization schemes cps to address the effects of cumulus clouds which are not represented in the modelling as they are much smaller than the model grid size pennelly et al 2014 the weather research and forecasting wrf model has been widely applied for atmospheric research and operational forecasting the wrf model has different physical parameterization schemes including cps nasrollahi et al 2012 common cps are kain fritsch kf kain and fritsch 1990 betts miller janjic bmj janjić 1994 grell 3d ensemble gr3d grell 1993 multi scale kain fritsch mskf zheng et al 2016 and grell devenyi ensemble gde grell and dévényi 2002 each cumulus parameterization has its unique structure and complexity which may have a great effect on the precipitation simulations accordingly various sensitivity analyses of the wrf parameterizations have been carried out in different areas of the world klein et al 2015 guoqiang et al 2007 compared the continuous precipitation process forecasted with the results obtained by the wrf model the comparison results displayed that the kf scheme was better than the bm betts miller scheme in summer time pennelly et al 2014 employed the wrf model to simulate precipitation in alberta canada the results reveal that the kain fritsch and explicit cumulus parameterization schemes were the most accurate schemes application of the wrf model to simulate six storm events in china by tian et al 2017 showed that the bmj scheme was unsuitable for rainfall simulation in their study area therefore the accuracy of nwp models results can be quite dependent on the cumulus parameterization used in the study ensemble meteorological forecasting is widely combined with a hydrological model to forecast flood events li et al 2017 combined the wrf model with a hydrological model for ensemble flood forecasting in china according to obtained results the simulated floods were rational and could benefit the flood management because of its longer lead time rogelis and werner 2018 evaluated the potential of nwp models for flood warning in tropical mountainous watersheds the results showed that the flow forecasts by a hydrological model added value to the flood early warning systems although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employing in flood forecasting around the world developing a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts has not adequately addressed yet for instance limited studies reported how flood hydrographs can be converted into warning decisions during a flood event e g using of threshold exceedance abebe and price 2005 developed a decision support system for a flood early warning in two urban areas in italy and greece they proposed several flood threshold levels and estimated the magnitude and the probability of flood employing the number of exceeding ensemble members for each flood threshold dietrich et al 2009b used a subset of the super ensemble and the quantile of the forecasted flow ensemble which was a good predictor for particular warning levels yang et al 2016 developed an early flood warning system in taiwan applying integrating ensemble rainfall forecasts rainfall thresholds and a real time data assimilation process to evaluate the possibility of flood alerts other conceptions of deriving a single i e deterministic type warning indicator from ensemble forecasts are weighting ensemble members including bayesian model averaging bma by raftery et al 2005 getting machine learning by doycheva et al 2016 and decreasing ensemble members to produce a multi model super or sub ensemble dietrich et al 2009a in the mentioned studies only a few effective criteria such as the probability of flood occurrence and vulnerability of the area were considered for flood warning decision making and other effective criteria including flood warning costs flood economic damages the population at risk and expected cost of false warnings were ignored in flood warning decisions likewise the uncertainty of different criteria has been ignored in the decision making of flood warning the present research tries to provide a flood warning system addressing all effective criteria and uncertainty associated with them since the false warnings may cause distrust of the inhabitants one of the main problems in ensemble flood warning is estimation of the flood peak discharge magnitude and the probability of flood occurrence for an ensemble of hydrographs with a large spread of forecasted flood peaks in accordance to this problem bayesian network bn was employed in this study to estimate the flood peak magnitude in an ensemble forecasting moreover a fuzzy topsis the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution model has been used to incorporate different criteria in flood warning decision making 2 methodology 2 1 study area the present study was conducted for the kan basin tehran iran over the past several decades heavy rainfalls have caused flood events and huge damage in this basin the catchment area is 197 km2 located between 35 46 n to 35 58 n latitudes and 51 10 e to 51 23 e longitudes the average annual precipitation is 600 mm and the average slope of the basin is approximately 42 4 in the present study the assessment of heavy rainfall was carried out on the emamzadeh davood rainfall station moreover the flood assessment was performed on sulaghan hydrometric station located downstream of the study area shown in fig 1 the present study was conducted on 14 historical storms the data sample set is relatively small in this study due to the following reasons 1 ncep gfs fnl data are available from 2000 onwards on the website 2 during the above mentioned period there are small numbers of observed flood events in the study area because of the location of the kan river basin in semi arid regions and experienced long drought period with fewer flood events fig 2 shows the main steps of the proposed flood warning system in the present study according to this flowchart the heavy rainfalls are forecasted using the wrf model peak flood is forecasted using a bn model and a flood warning system is developed using the fuzzy topsis model 2 2 wrf model the wrf model is a next generation s medium range weather and research forecasting model that can simulate weather processes from cloud scale to synoptic scale all precipitation simulations in this study were conducted with the advanced research wrf wrf arw version 3 8 the initial and lateral boundary conditions are extracted from national centers for environmental prediction ncep global forecast system gfs the data are 6 hourly global analysis at 0 5 horizontal resolution the noah land surface model chen and dudhia 2001 as well as the yonsei university ysu planetary boundary layer scheme hong et al 2006 were used as the physic schemes other applied physics schemes are rapid radiative transfer model rrtm longwave radiation scheme mlawer et al 1997 the dudhia shortwave radiation model dudhia 1989 and the wrf single moment wsm 3 class microphysics scheme hong et al 2004 because of the importance of cumulus parameterization in rainfall and hydrological analysis a meteorological ensemble was created by using five cumulus schemes including betts miller janjic bmj kain fritsch kf grell 3d ensemble gr3d multi scale kain fritsch mskf and grell devenyi ensemble gde figure 3 illustrates the domains setup using an inter active nested domain inside the parent domain the temporal resolution of wrf is 1 h and horizontal resolution of nested domains are 45 km 15 km and 5 km respectively the inner domain covers the study basin and only the meteorological information from this domain was used in the present study since increasing of lead time leads to decreasing the accuracy of numerical weather model sikder and hossain 2016 all precipitation forecasts were conducted one day before the event the nearest neighbor interpolation was used to assign a predicted rainfall value to the rain gage 2 3 bayesian network a bayesian network bn was employed in this study to forecast the peak flood based on the meteorological ensemble forecasts a bn model is a probabilistic graphical model that consists of a set of variables nodes and their probabilistic conditional independencies encoded in its arrows correa et al 2009 a node represents a random variable and an arrow shows dependency independency of a node on other nodes the arrow starts from a casual or predictor event of the parent node and connects to an outcome event of the child node or predicting node the relationship between various nodes is defined in a conditional probability based on prior information or data and statistically observed correlations sharma and goyal 2016 a graph containing nodes and arrows is called bn structure bs there are many possible structures for a set of data the purpose of structure learning is to determine the best structure which maximizes the conditional probability p bs d where bs is the bn structure and d is the given data sharma and goyal 2016 some common structure learning algorithms are the k2 algorithm cooper and herskovits 1992 and mcmc algorithm madigan et al 1995 in the present study the relationships between child and parent nodes are known so bs can be easily defined the flood peak is a child node that is influenced by some parent nodes including atmospheric ensemble forecasts the base flow of the river and antecedent rainfall so the bs is known the catchment s antecedent moisture represents the relative wetness prior to a flood event and it can have a significant influence on overall flood response because of the lack of antecedent moisture data in the study area antecedent rainfall was used instead of it ten different scenarios presented in table 8 were developed using different combinations of predictors once the structure was defined it was necessary to know how strong the relationship is among the variables that were realized by using the quantitative component of the bn aguilera et al 2011 the joint probability pb among the variables can be defined as the product of the local conditional distributions so that 1 p b x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p b x i x i 1 x n in a bn a node xi is independent of all other nodes except its parents πi sharma and goyal 2016 a simple example of bn is presented in fig 4 the joint probability for this simple network can be defined as eq 2 2 p x 1 x 2 x 3 p x 1 p x 2 x 1 p x 3 x 1 x 2 bayesian network conditional probability tables cpts can be learned trained by using parameter learning algorithms including expectation maximization markov chain monte carlo methods such as gibbs sampling and gradient descent methods reed and mengshoel 2014 in the present study expectation maximization em was applied for bayesian network parameter learning that is an iterative method that performs a number of iterations each of which calculates the logarithm of the probability of the data given the current joint probability distribution this quantity is known as the log likelihood and the algorithm tries to maximize likelihood estimators bergmann and kopp 2009 the hugin software version 8 3 were used to develop the probabilistic bayesian network structure final step is the validation in which the accuracy of the trained bn model is evaluated using assessment criteria in the present study mean absolute relative error mare was used for performance assessment of the model as given in the following equation 3 mare 1 n o i f i o i where o i is the observed value f i is forecasted value and n is the total number of data sets it should be noted that 70 of the available data is allocated for training and the remaining 30 data are used for validation considering the relatively small sample size in the study area we proposed using the bayesian network that is less sensitive to small data set size in comparison with other forecasting models zhang and bivens 2007 2 4 flood warning system an effective flood warning system should be based on all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainty associated with them in this study a multi criteria decision making mcdm model was applied to determine the flood warning level we proposed a fuzzy topsis model to develop a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts that were employed to find the best flood warning level among different alternatives using various decision criteria including probability of flood occurrence flood warning costs flood economic damages population at risk expected cost of false warning and expected human losses of missed warnings under uncertainty condition four warning levels were considered as the decision alternatives as defined in table 1 2 5 effective criteria in decision making 2 5 1 probability of flood occurrence as discussed earlier in section 2 3 the flood peaks were forecasted using the most accurate scenario of the bn model it should be noted that the forecasted flood peak by each scenario is a crisp value to address the uncertainty in forecasting of flood peaks the forecasted flood peak by the most accurate scenario was considered as the middle value of the fuzzy number and the upper and lower bounds of fuzzy numbers were determined according to the minimum and maximum forecasted flood peaks among the output of different scenarios of using bn models a membership value is assigned to the members using the triangular membership function for this purpose a membership value of one was assigned to the middle value of fuzzy number and zero was assigned to the upper and lower bounds fuzzy numbers an example of a hypothetical flood peak and the triangular membership is presented in fig 5 q25 shows the 25 year flood which is representative for low warning level the other warning levels have been also showed similarly in the figure the probability of a warning level was estimated by dividing the area enclosed by upper and lower bounds of that level by the total area under the fuzzy triangle it should be noted probability of a warning level was estimated as a crisp number for example the probability of the high warning level was calculated using the following equation 4 p q 100 200 a 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 2 5 2 populations at risk the integration of land use and flood mapping was used to identify the population at risk in a flooded area the population at risk was calculated by multiplying the flooded area by population density in the study area according to the field investigation of the study area the buildings are mostly one to three floors so the population density corresponding to one and three floor buildings was respectively used to get upper and lower uncertainty bounds of the population at risk 2 5 3 flood warning costs warning cost includes transporting the people under flood risk to a safe place temporary re locating of them for two days since the uncertainty of transporting and the food is negligible only the uncertainty of temporary re locating was addressed here 2 5 4 flood economic damages it includes damages to buildings and orchards in flood zones the overlaying of land use map and flood zoning map was used to identify the buildings at risk in flood zones percentage of buildings damage was calculated using the depth damage functions as shown in table 2 flood damage on buildings was calculated using the following equation 5 l b a p d that l b is flood damage on buildings a is the area of buildings at risk m2 p is the house building price per square meter iranian rial m2 and d is a percentage of building damage since the building materials are different the upper and lower bounds of price were estimated according to the civil engineering experts judgments the construction price of each square meter of the building was considered ten million iranian rials irr with 20 uncertainty in order to calculate the flood damage to orchards the overlaying of land use map and flood zoning map was used to identify the flood damages on orchards percentage and yield of different type of orchards in the study area are presented in table 3 the percentage of damage to agricultural products depends on the depth and duration of submergence according to table 4 damage percentage of orchards was estimated finally the damage to orchards was calculated using the following equation 6 l o i 1 n a i r i p i d i 1000 that a i is the area of orchards hectare r i is the yield of products ton per hectare p i is the price of one kilogram of products irr d i is percentage of damage and i refers to different type of orchards 2 5 5 expected cost of corrupted warnings corrupted warning includes two kind of warning false warning and missed warning false warning mean forecast shows the occurrence of the flood but it does not occur false warnings can cause extra costs to notify and relocate residents on the other hand missed warnings missing warning of occurred floods can cause economic damages in the case of missed warnings economic damages arise in the unwarned flooded area in this case study personal property of residents was estimated between 10 and 30 million irr for each resident expected cost formula for different warning levels presented in table 5 that ci is warning costs of ith warning level di is economic damages fi is the probability occurrence of ith warning level for instance expected cost formula for medium warning level in table 5 is described as following if a medium flood with f 2 probability is announced f 1 f 3 a n d f 4 are probability of low high and extreme warning levels therefore three different status of corrupted warnings may occur as following component 1 an extreme flood leads to economic damages equal to the area between protected personal property in medium level and extreme level d 4 d 2 since the probability of the extreme level is equal to f 4 the expected damages of this component is equal to f 4 d 4 d 2 component 2 a high flood leads to economic damages equal to the area between protected personal property in medium level and high level d 3 d 2 since the probability of the high level is equal to f 3 the expected damages of this component is equal to f 3 d 3 d 2 component 3 a low flood leads to extra costs equal to the area between warning costs in medium and low levels c 2 c 1 since the probability of the low level is equal to f 1 the expected extra costs is equal to f 1 c 2 c 1 finally the total expected costs are achieved by integration of the three components 2 5 6 the expected human losses of missed warnings for the cases of missed warnings expected human losses were calculated using the populations at risk living in between flooded area of forecasted warning level and occurred flood as shown in table 6 where p i is populations at risk in i th warning level and f i is the probability occurrence of i th warning level 2 6 fuzzy topsis for flood decision making since the effective criteria in flood warning can have different importance for decision making a fuzzy topsis model was employed to develop a flood warning decision model considering all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainties associated with it pairwise comparisons matrix was defined by the expert committee and the criteria weight vector was calculated using the saaty s method the fuzzy topsis model was proposed for ranking the warning alternatives fuzzy topsis model adapted from wang and chang 2007 as the following steps step 1 in order to avoid the arbitrary selection of the weights the matrix was constructed using the consensus of the expert committee with the scale of integers between 1 and 9 among all expert s values the minimum maximum and average of all expert s values were considered as the lower band upper band and the middle of the fuzzy triangular numbers step 2 the weighting of effective criteria was determined using saaty s method the readers are referred to the saaty 1987 7 w w 1 w 2 w n where w is the weight vector of criteria and w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 are triangular fuzzy numbers step 3 the fuzzy matrix is constructed for m warning alternatives and n criteria for making a decision the decision matrix can be established as 8 d x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn where x ij a ij b ij c ij is triangular fuzzy number step 4 the fuzzy decision matrix was normalized to avoid the effect of scale and unit of members in the decision matrix the linear scale transformation was applied to transform the various criteria scales into comparable scales banihabib and shabestari 2017 the normalized fuzzy decision matrix for benefit criteria and cost criteria can be respectively represented as equations 10 and 11 9 r ij a ij c j b ij c j c ij c j where c j max c ij 10 r ij a j c ij a j b ij a j a ij where a j min a ij step 5 weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix was determined the weighted normalized decision matrix was defined as follows 11 v ij r ij w j where w j represents the weight of criterion cj step 6 the fuzzy positive ideal solution and fuzzy negative ideal solution were calculated as follows 12 a v 1 v 2 v n 13 a v 1 v 2 v n where v j max v ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v j min v ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n since the positive triangular fuzzy numbers take the value in the interval 0 1 v j a n d v j can be defined as follows v j 1 1 1 and v j 0 0 0 step 7 the distances of each alternative from fuzzy positive and negative ideal solutions were computed as 14 s i i 1 n d v ij v j i 1 2 m 15 s i i 1 n d v ij v j i 1 2 m step 8 closeness coefficient was calculated as 16 cc i s i s i s i i 1 2 m step 9 in this step according to the values of the closeness coefficients the flood warning alternatives can be ranked starting from the highest values and ending with the lowest value 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the wrf model wrf was verified based on comparison of the wrf forecasted precipitation and gauged precipitation the verified wrf model was applied to simulate 14 historical rainfall events the obtained simulation results are depicted in fig 6 according to this figure the wrf model was able to capture the heavy precipitation in most events however the wrf model overestimates or underestimates the accumulated precipitation for some events since no cumulus scheme is likely to perform best for the entire events statistical criteria are required to evaluate the overall performance to make a further comparison the accuracy of accumulated precipitation of the 14 flood events was computed using mare and the results shown in table 7 it can be seen that the wrf accumulated precipitation has a lower mare for applying the kf scheme and a higher mare for applying the mskf scheme the kf scheme simulates convective rainfalls more accurately because the scheme conserves mass while using the parameterization of convective downdrafts as well as using convective available potential energy as part of the closure assumptions pennelly et al 2014 3 2 verification of the bayesian network model in order to estimate flood peak the wrf ensemble precipitations were fed into the bayesian network model ten different scenarios were developed using various combinations of predictors in bn in all of the scenarios flood peaks are the forecasted variables the proposed bayesian network model in the present study provides the forecasted flood peaks in a mountainous basin such as kan basin with low floodplain storage the peak flow magnitude is not reduced along the river hence we can use the peak flood instead of whole flood hydrograph to estimate the flood damage the accuracy of the bn model for the validation data set was assessed by mare and r2 as shown in table 8 the comparison between scenario no 1 and no 2 showed that the bn model driven from hourly rainfall outperformed the one using accumulated rainfall as the predictor in small basins such as kan basin with a time of concentration of 180 min cumulative precipitation does not represent rainfall time variation on the flood forecast and maximum hourly rainfall provides better outcomes therefore the maximum hourly rainfall was used in combinations of other predictor variables in the scenarios moreover comparing scenario no 9 and 5 shows that there is no significant decrease in accuracy by deleting the mskf scheme while deleting the kf scheme in scenario no 6 significantly decreased the accuracy consequently mskf is the least accurate cumulus scheme and kf is the most accurate cumulus parameterization scheme in the study area other researches have also shown similar results on precipitation prediction pennelly et al 2014 liang et al 2004 according to scenario no 5 in table 8 the best results were achieved by applying all cumulus schemes in this scenario mare was calculated 0 076 for the validation data set the coefficient of determination denoted by r2 is another measure that was used to assess the accuracy of the scenarios it can be seen from table 8 that is also close to unity the proposed bn structure of this scenario is composed of eight nodes as displayed in fig 7 the wrf ensemble precipitations antecedent rainfall and base flow of the river are the parent nodes and peak flow magnitude is the child node fig 7 also shows that base flow of the river is influenced by antecedent rainfall despite the small sample size of this study the results show that the bayesian network is an efficient method to forecast the flood peak based on weather ensemble forecasts and it is suited for flood forecasting in case of small data set size 3 3 effective criteria in flood warning due to lack of historical rainfall with high return period rainfalls during the study period it was not possible to simulate a high variability of the return periods hence the simulated floods in the present study have a return period of 25 years with 100 probability for low warning level thus some artificial storms were produced using back simulation capability of the bn model this is explained as follows an example of a forecasted flood by using the bn model and its upper and lower uncertainty bands is presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the lower and upper bounds of the uncertainty are 25 36 and 57 42 m3 s respectively in this research membership value of 1 was assigned to the forecasted flood peak using predicted value in scenario no 5 the most accurate scenario in bn and 0 was assigned to those scenarios that forecasted the maximum and minimum flood peak among all scenarios it can also be seen that the upper band is less than a 25 year flood so the probability of low warning level is 100 in order to evaluate the flood warning system for more cases the bn backward simulation was used to produce some artificial storm events in such a way that they have different flood peaks so the flood warning system can be evaluated on different warning levels as presented in fig 8 b c d the backward simulation approach was used starting from the flood peak and working contrary to direction of arcs to produce the predictor nodes and then the forward simulation approached was again employed by various combinations of predictors to estimate the uncertainty bands of flood peak the probability of different warning levels for forecasted floods was estimated by dividing the area enclosed by upper and lower bounds to the total area under the fuzzy triangle which is presented in table 9 the other effective criteria in flood warning decision making in flood warning system were estimated as follows population at risk flood warning costs and flood economic damages were estimated for different warning levels as shown in table 10 kan river s cross sections are nearly v shaped and there is not much difference between flood mappings for different return periods accordingly there is no significant difference between populations at risk in different return periods in the studied area this can also be found that the flood warning costs and flood economic damages have increased slightly with increasing of floods return periods since according to current river regulations in iran the building construction in riverbed flooded by 25 year flood is illegal banihabib 2016 banihabib et al 2015 the flood economic damages of unauthorized buildings in riverbed were neglected and therefore it is calculated zero for low warning level as shown in table 10 the expected cost of corrupted warnings and expected human losses were calculated for four forecasted flood events according to their probability of warning levels table 11 since these criteria are a function of the probability of different flood warning levels as shown in table 5 and 6 for the flood no 1 the probability of low warning level is 100 according to the presented formulas in table 5 the expected cost of corrupted warnings of the low warning level is a function of the probability of other flood warning levels since other flood warning levels have a probability of zero this flood does not cost for the low warning level table 11 there are some reasons why expected human losses listed in table 11 may display zero as mentioned earlier expected human losses at each warning level is a function of the probability of three other flood warning levels therefore in table 11 the expected human losses associated with that warning level will be zero if a flood warning level has a zero probability of occurring besides in cases of occurrence a warning level lower than the forecasted warning level the residents are relocated in the safe place and human losses cannot be expected 3 4 weighting flood warning criteria ahp was used to weight effective criteria using triangular fuzzy numbers as shown in table 12 a triangular fuzzy percentage weight was assigned to each criterion between 0 and 100 which represents the importance of the criterion as given in the last column of table 12 a higher weight of the criterion means more priority or more impact than other criteria for warning decision since the probability of flood occurrence affects the other criteria such as the expected cost of false warning and expected human losses this criterion has the most importance and the highest weight was assigned to it 3 5 decision making on warning levels in this research fuzzy topsis method was employed to make a decision on flood warning level the closeness coefficient and the rankings of alternatives were determined for four forecasted flood events as shown in table 13 the purpose of the present decision making is to determine the best alternative among all warning levels the purpose of the ranking of alternatives in the present study is to find the best warning level alternative and an order of other alternatives does not provide any decision rule for the warning for flood no 1 the low warning level with the highest closeness coefficient is the best alternative since the probability of low warning level was estimated at 100 it is rational to choose this warning level as the best alternative by using the decision making for the flood no 2 medium warning level has the highest probability it is clear from the results of the last two columns in table 13 that medium warning level with the closeness coefficient of 1 78 is the best alternative as well since high and extreme warning levels cannot possibly happen and have a probability of zero as shown in table 13 so selecting the medium warning level describes the rational decision for the flood no 3 although the highest forecasted probability is for the medium warning level the probability of high warning level is not zero hence it can be seen that high warning level is in the first rank according to results of table 13 it can be concluded that when the probability is distributed between different warning levels in case of a higher probability for stronger warning level such as flood no 2 and no 4 the highest closeness coefficient will be achieved for the stronger warning level as the best alternative but in case of a higher probability for milder warning level the best alternative will generally depend on other effective criteria in order to broaden our understanding of the decision making behavior there is a need for sensitivity analysis results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the next section 3 6 sensitivity analysis on the decision making of flood warning level since the uncertainty was addressed in estimating the effective criteria in multi criteria decision making a sensitivity analysis was used only to determine how different values of probability of flood warning levels impact on decision making behavior the results of sensitivity analysis for different scenarios are given in table 14 in the scenarios number 1 to 4 the probability of a specific flood warning level is 100 percent the result shows that warning level with 100 percent probability was the selected warning level which has the highest closeness coefficient scenarios number 5 to 8 were defined for a situation that the probability of one warning level is significantly higher than other warning levels in these scenarios an 80 probability was assigned to a warning level and the remaining 20 were assigned equally to the higher and lower warning level it is clear from table 14 that warning level with 80 percent probability is the selected warning level which has the highest closeness coefficient in scenarios number 9 to 12 a 60 probability was assigned to a warning level and the remaining 40 were assigned equally to the higher and lower warning level the results of scenarios number 10 to 12 showed that the warning level which is most likely to occur is at the highest rank and has the highest closeness coefficient but in scenarios number 9 although the low warning level has the highest probability of occurrence the medium warning level with 40 percent probability is the best alternative therefore it seems that when the probability is distributed between different warning levels the decision making model acts cautiously by selecting the stronger level as the best alternative to ensure this result scenarios number 13 to 16 were defined so that the probability is distributed equally between two or more warning levels which in all of them the stronger warning level is the first ranked alternative as shown in table 14 considering all the scenarios it could be concluded that assuming a significantly higher probability for a warning level compared to the other warning levels the decision making model proposes it as a warning level however if the probability is distributed equally between some warning levels the decision making model allocates a higher rank to the stronger warning level and in other words the flood warning system acts cautiously in this case 4 conclusions this study proposed a decision making model for determining flood warning level based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts according to knowledge of the authors this is the first attempt to provide a flood warning system considering the ensemble forecasts and all effective criteria and uncertainty associated with them the results showed that the wrf model was able to capture the heavy precipitation in most events while there is an overestimation or underestimation of the accumulated precipitation in a couple of cases while the details of the application of the wrf model are out of the purpose of the present study possible reasons of the precipitation error were reported by other authors including errors in the lateral boundary conditions ochoa et al 2014 poor representation of the topography ochoa et al 2014 and select of convective treatment microphysics and planetary boundary layer jankov et al 2005 in order to improve the forecasted rainfalls running the wrf model using the perturbing the initial conditions and also using the different microphysical schemes are suggested as the future works the atmospheric ensemble forecasts were fed into the bayesian networks bn to estimate the flood peak mare was calculated 0 076 for validation dataset in bayesian network and verified that the bn is an efficient method to forecast the flood peak based on weather ensemble forecasts and it is suited for flood forecasting in case of small data set size finally the results showed that the selected warning level by the fuzzy topsis model was strongly dependent on the probability distribution of flood warning levels and this is why the addressing of uncertainties in estimation of probability distribution is significant the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that in the scenarios that were given or granted a significantly high probability higher than 60 at a warning level compared to other levels the frequent level has the highest rating however in the flood events where the occurrence probability was equally distributed between different warning levels the decision making model had assigned a higher rating to the stronger warning level in another words the flood warning system acts cautiously it was also showed that fuzzy topsis is well suited for flood warning modeling based on ensemble forecasts according to the reasonable results of this study applying the proposed fuzzy topsis model to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts can be proposed in similar catchments for considering the uncertainties and selecting flood warning level

6507,the purpose of this study is to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employed for flood forecasting developing a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts has not been adequately addressed yet in this study first a weather research and forecasting wrf model was used to forecast the heavy precipitation in kan basin iran ensemble storms were forecasted using five cumulus schemes including kain fritsch betts miller janjic grell 3d ensemble multi scale kain fritsch and grell devenyi ensemble cumulus scheme then a bayesian networks bn was developed to estimate the flood peak using the atmospheric ensemble forecasts finally a fuzzy topsis the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution model was prepared for making decisions for flood warning scenarios considering all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainty associated with them assessment of the proposed flood warning system was examined for various scenarios it showed that when a significantly high probability was assigned to a warning level that level had the maximum closeness coefficient and consequently chosen as a warning level yet if the probability was distributed equally between some warning levels the flood warning system acts cautiously since the decision making model allocated the highest rank to the stronger warning level regarding the reasonable results of this study applying the fuzzy topsis model to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts is recommended to apply in similar catchments for addressing the uncertainties keywords bayesian networks ensemble flood forecasting flood warning fuzzy topsis wrf model 1 introduction quantifying the uncertainties of flood forecasting is becoming increasingly essential for operational purposes komma et al 2007 furthermore as atmospheric forecasts are used for flood forecasting their uncertainties should be considered in the flood forecasting dietrich et al 2009b in order to address these uncertainties many operational flood forecasting systems are increasingly moving towards the application of ensemble flood forecasts rather than single deterministic forecasts cloke and pappenberger 2009 various approaches have been presented to forecast atmospheric ensemble forecasts including perturbing the input parameters of the model perturbing the initial conditions using multi model ensembles and using different parameterization schemes yang et al 2012 numerical weather prediction nwp models are used for atmospheric forecasting the spatial resolution of nwp models is sometimes too coarse to consider the physical processes including momentum heat and humidity turbulence fluxes and thus these phenomena have to be parameterized in these models shrivastava et al 2014 generate an ensemble or set of different forecasts of atmospheric processes differed by using various parameterization schemes is the standard method of addressing the parameterization uncertainty one of the most important parameterization schemes in rainfall forecasting is the cumulus parameterization nasrollahi et al 2012 nwp models often use cumulus parameterization schemes cps to address the effects of cumulus clouds which are not represented in the modelling as they are much smaller than the model grid size pennelly et al 2014 the weather research and forecasting wrf model has been widely applied for atmospheric research and operational forecasting the wrf model has different physical parameterization schemes including cps nasrollahi et al 2012 common cps are kain fritsch kf kain and fritsch 1990 betts miller janjic bmj janjić 1994 grell 3d ensemble gr3d grell 1993 multi scale kain fritsch mskf zheng et al 2016 and grell devenyi ensemble gde grell and dévényi 2002 each cumulus parameterization has its unique structure and complexity which may have a great effect on the precipitation simulations accordingly various sensitivity analyses of the wrf parameterizations have been carried out in different areas of the world klein et al 2015 guoqiang et al 2007 compared the continuous precipitation process forecasted with the results obtained by the wrf model the comparison results displayed that the kf scheme was better than the bm betts miller scheme in summer time pennelly et al 2014 employed the wrf model to simulate precipitation in alberta canada the results reveal that the kain fritsch and explicit cumulus parameterization schemes were the most accurate schemes application of the wrf model to simulate six storm events in china by tian et al 2017 showed that the bmj scheme was unsuitable for rainfall simulation in their study area therefore the accuracy of nwp models results can be quite dependent on the cumulus parameterization used in the study ensemble meteorological forecasting is widely combined with a hydrological model to forecast flood events li et al 2017 combined the wrf model with a hydrological model for ensemble flood forecasting in china according to obtained results the simulated floods were rational and could benefit the flood management because of its longer lead time rogelis and werner 2018 evaluated the potential of nwp models for flood warning in tropical mountainous watersheds the results showed that the flow forecasts by a hydrological model added value to the flood early warning systems although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employing in flood forecasting around the world developing a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts has not adequately addressed yet for instance limited studies reported how flood hydrographs can be converted into warning decisions during a flood event e g using of threshold exceedance abebe and price 2005 developed a decision support system for a flood early warning in two urban areas in italy and greece they proposed several flood threshold levels and estimated the magnitude and the probability of flood employing the number of exceeding ensemble members for each flood threshold dietrich et al 2009b used a subset of the super ensemble and the quantile of the forecasted flow ensemble which was a good predictor for particular warning levels yang et al 2016 developed an early flood warning system in taiwan applying integrating ensemble rainfall forecasts rainfall thresholds and a real time data assimilation process to evaluate the possibility of flood alerts other conceptions of deriving a single i e deterministic type warning indicator from ensemble forecasts are weighting ensemble members including bayesian model averaging bma by raftery et al 2005 getting machine learning by doycheva et al 2016 and decreasing ensemble members to produce a multi model super or sub ensemble dietrich et al 2009a in the mentioned studies only a few effective criteria such as the probability of flood occurrence and vulnerability of the area were considered for flood warning decision making and other effective criteria including flood warning costs flood economic damages the population at risk and expected cost of false warnings were ignored in flood warning decisions likewise the uncertainty of different criteria has been ignored in the decision making of flood warning the present research tries to provide a flood warning system addressing all effective criteria and uncertainty associated with them since the false warnings may cause distrust of the inhabitants one of the main problems in ensemble flood warning is estimation of the flood peak discharge magnitude and the probability of flood occurrence for an ensemble of hydrographs with a large spread of forecasted flood peaks in accordance to this problem bayesian network bn was employed in this study to estimate the flood peak magnitude in an ensemble forecasting moreover a fuzzy topsis the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution model has been used to incorporate different criteria in flood warning decision making 2 methodology 2 1 study area the present study was conducted for the kan basin tehran iran over the past several decades heavy rainfalls have caused flood events and huge damage in this basin the catchment area is 197 km2 located between 35 46 n to 35 58 n latitudes and 51 10 e to 51 23 e longitudes the average annual precipitation is 600 mm and the average slope of the basin is approximately 42 4 in the present study the assessment of heavy rainfall was carried out on the emamzadeh davood rainfall station moreover the flood assessment was performed on sulaghan hydrometric station located downstream of the study area shown in fig 1 the present study was conducted on 14 historical storms the data sample set is relatively small in this study due to the following reasons 1 ncep gfs fnl data are available from 2000 onwards on the website 2 during the above mentioned period there are small numbers of observed flood events in the study area because of the location of the kan river basin in semi arid regions and experienced long drought period with fewer flood events fig 2 shows the main steps of the proposed flood warning system in the present study according to this flowchart the heavy rainfalls are forecasted using the wrf model peak flood is forecasted using a bn model and a flood warning system is developed using the fuzzy topsis model 2 2 wrf model the wrf model is a next generation s medium range weather and research forecasting model that can simulate weather processes from cloud scale to synoptic scale all precipitation simulations in this study were conducted with the advanced research wrf wrf arw version 3 8 the initial and lateral boundary conditions are extracted from national centers for environmental prediction ncep global forecast system gfs the data are 6 hourly global analysis at 0 5 horizontal resolution the noah land surface model chen and dudhia 2001 as well as the yonsei university ysu planetary boundary layer scheme hong et al 2006 were used as the physic schemes other applied physics schemes are rapid radiative transfer model rrtm longwave radiation scheme mlawer et al 1997 the dudhia shortwave radiation model dudhia 1989 and the wrf single moment wsm 3 class microphysics scheme hong et al 2004 because of the importance of cumulus parameterization in rainfall and hydrological analysis a meteorological ensemble was created by using five cumulus schemes including betts miller janjic bmj kain fritsch kf grell 3d ensemble gr3d multi scale kain fritsch mskf and grell devenyi ensemble gde figure 3 illustrates the domains setup using an inter active nested domain inside the parent domain the temporal resolution of wrf is 1 h and horizontal resolution of nested domains are 45 km 15 km and 5 km respectively the inner domain covers the study basin and only the meteorological information from this domain was used in the present study since increasing of lead time leads to decreasing the accuracy of numerical weather model sikder and hossain 2016 all precipitation forecasts were conducted one day before the event the nearest neighbor interpolation was used to assign a predicted rainfall value to the rain gage 2 3 bayesian network a bayesian network bn was employed in this study to forecast the peak flood based on the meteorological ensemble forecasts a bn model is a probabilistic graphical model that consists of a set of variables nodes and their probabilistic conditional independencies encoded in its arrows correa et al 2009 a node represents a random variable and an arrow shows dependency independency of a node on other nodes the arrow starts from a casual or predictor event of the parent node and connects to an outcome event of the child node or predicting node the relationship between various nodes is defined in a conditional probability based on prior information or data and statistically observed correlations sharma and goyal 2016 a graph containing nodes and arrows is called bn structure bs there are many possible structures for a set of data the purpose of structure learning is to determine the best structure which maximizes the conditional probability p bs d where bs is the bn structure and d is the given data sharma and goyal 2016 some common structure learning algorithms are the k2 algorithm cooper and herskovits 1992 and mcmc algorithm madigan et al 1995 in the present study the relationships between child and parent nodes are known so bs can be easily defined the flood peak is a child node that is influenced by some parent nodes including atmospheric ensemble forecasts the base flow of the river and antecedent rainfall so the bs is known the catchment s antecedent moisture represents the relative wetness prior to a flood event and it can have a significant influence on overall flood response because of the lack of antecedent moisture data in the study area antecedent rainfall was used instead of it ten different scenarios presented in table 8 were developed using different combinations of predictors once the structure was defined it was necessary to know how strong the relationship is among the variables that were realized by using the quantitative component of the bn aguilera et al 2011 the joint probability pb among the variables can be defined as the product of the local conditional distributions so that 1 p b x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p b x i x i 1 x n in a bn a node xi is independent of all other nodes except its parents πi sharma and goyal 2016 a simple example of bn is presented in fig 4 the joint probability for this simple network can be defined as eq 2 2 p x 1 x 2 x 3 p x 1 p x 2 x 1 p x 3 x 1 x 2 bayesian network conditional probability tables cpts can be learned trained by using parameter learning algorithms including expectation maximization markov chain monte carlo methods such as gibbs sampling and gradient descent methods reed and mengshoel 2014 in the present study expectation maximization em was applied for bayesian network parameter learning that is an iterative method that performs a number of iterations each of which calculates the logarithm of the probability of the data given the current joint probability distribution this quantity is known as the log likelihood and the algorithm tries to maximize likelihood estimators bergmann and kopp 2009 the hugin software version 8 3 were used to develop the probabilistic bayesian network structure final step is the validation in which the accuracy of the trained bn model is evaluated using assessment criteria in the present study mean absolute relative error mare was used for performance assessment of the model as given in the following equation 3 mare 1 n o i f i o i where o i is the observed value f i is forecasted value and n is the total number of data sets it should be noted that 70 of the available data is allocated for training and the remaining 30 data are used for validation considering the relatively small sample size in the study area we proposed using the bayesian network that is less sensitive to small data set size in comparison with other forecasting models zhang and bivens 2007 2 4 flood warning system an effective flood warning system should be based on all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainty associated with them in this study a multi criteria decision making mcdm model was applied to determine the flood warning level we proposed a fuzzy topsis model to develop a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts that were employed to find the best flood warning level among different alternatives using various decision criteria including probability of flood occurrence flood warning costs flood economic damages population at risk expected cost of false warning and expected human losses of missed warnings under uncertainty condition four warning levels were considered as the decision alternatives as defined in table 1 2 5 effective criteria in decision making 2 5 1 probability of flood occurrence as discussed earlier in section 2 3 the flood peaks were forecasted using the most accurate scenario of the bn model it should be noted that the forecasted flood peak by each scenario is a crisp value to address the uncertainty in forecasting of flood peaks the forecasted flood peak by the most accurate scenario was considered as the middle value of the fuzzy number and the upper and lower bounds of fuzzy numbers were determined according to the minimum and maximum forecasted flood peaks among the output of different scenarios of using bn models a membership value is assigned to the members using the triangular membership function for this purpose a membership value of one was assigned to the middle value of fuzzy number and zero was assigned to the upper and lower bounds fuzzy numbers an example of a hypothetical flood peak and the triangular membership is presented in fig 5 q25 shows the 25 year flood which is representative for low warning level the other warning levels have been also showed similarly in the figure the probability of a warning level was estimated by dividing the area enclosed by upper and lower bounds of that level by the total area under the fuzzy triangle it should be noted probability of a warning level was estimated as a crisp number for example the probability of the high warning level was calculated using the following equation 4 p q 100 200 a 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 2 5 2 populations at risk the integration of land use and flood mapping was used to identify the population at risk in a flooded area the population at risk was calculated by multiplying the flooded area by population density in the study area according to the field investigation of the study area the buildings are mostly one to three floors so the population density corresponding to one and three floor buildings was respectively used to get upper and lower uncertainty bounds of the population at risk 2 5 3 flood warning costs warning cost includes transporting the people under flood risk to a safe place temporary re locating of them for two days since the uncertainty of transporting and the food is negligible only the uncertainty of temporary re locating was addressed here 2 5 4 flood economic damages it includes damages to buildings and orchards in flood zones the overlaying of land use map and flood zoning map was used to identify the buildings at risk in flood zones percentage of buildings damage was calculated using the depth damage functions as shown in table 2 flood damage on buildings was calculated using the following equation 5 l b a p d that l b is flood damage on buildings a is the area of buildings at risk m2 p is the house building price per square meter iranian rial m2 and d is a percentage of building damage since the building materials are different the upper and lower bounds of price were estimated according to the civil engineering experts judgments the construction price of each square meter of the building was considered ten million iranian rials irr with 20 uncertainty in order to calculate the flood damage to orchards the overlaying of land use map and flood zoning map was used to identify the flood damages on orchards percentage and yield of different type of orchards in the study area are presented in table 3 the percentage of damage to agricultural products depends on the depth and duration of submergence according to table 4 damage percentage of orchards was estimated finally the damage to orchards was calculated using the following equation 6 l o i 1 n a i r i p i d i 1000 that a i is the area of orchards hectare r i is the yield of products ton per hectare p i is the price of one kilogram of products irr d i is percentage of damage and i refers to different type of orchards 2 5 5 expected cost of corrupted warnings corrupted warning includes two kind of warning false warning and missed warning false warning mean forecast shows the occurrence of the flood but it does not occur false warnings can cause extra costs to notify and relocate residents on the other hand missed warnings missing warning of occurred floods can cause economic damages in the case of missed warnings economic damages arise in the unwarned flooded area in this case study personal property of residents was estimated between 10 and 30 million irr for each resident expected cost formula for different warning levels presented in table 5 that ci is warning costs of ith warning level di is economic damages fi is the probability occurrence of ith warning level for instance expected cost formula for medium warning level in table 5 is described as following if a medium flood with f 2 probability is announced f 1 f 3 a n d f 4 are probability of low high and extreme warning levels therefore three different status of corrupted warnings may occur as following component 1 an extreme flood leads to economic damages equal to the area between protected personal property in medium level and extreme level d 4 d 2 since the probability of the extreme level is equal to f 4 the expected damages of this component is equal to f 4 d 4 d 2 component 2 a high flood leads to economic damages equal to the area between protected personal property in medium level and high level d 3 d 2 since the probability of the high level is equal to f 3 the expected damages of this component is equal to f 3 d 3 d 2 component 3 a low flood leads to extra costs equal to the area between warning costs in medium and low levels c 2 c 1 since the probability of the low level is equal to f 1 the expected extra costs is equal to f 1 c 2 c 1 finally the total expected costs are achieved by integration of the three components 2 5 6 the expected human losses of missed warnings for the cases of missed warnings expected human losses were calculated using the populations at risk living in between flooded area of forecasted warning level and occurred flood as shown in table 6 where p i is populations at risk in i th warning level and f i is the probability occurrence of i th warning level 2 6 fuzzy topsis for flood decision making since the effective criteria in flood warning can have different importance for decision making a fuzzy topsis model was employed to develop a flood warning decision model considering all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainties associated with it pairwise comparisons matrix was defined by the expert committee and the criteria weight vector was calculated using the saaty s method the fuzzy topsis model was proposed for ranking the warning alternatives fuzzy topsis model adapted from wang and chang 2007 as the following steps step 1 in order to avoid the arbitrary selection of the weights the matrix was constructed using the consensus of the expert committee with the scale of integers between 1 and 9 among all expert s values the minimum maximum and average of all expert s values were considered as the lower band upper band and the middle of the fuzzy triangular numbers step 2 the weighting of effective criteria was determined using saaty s method the readers are referred to the saaty 1987 7 w w 1 w 2 w n where w is the weight vector of criteria and w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 are triangular fuzzy numbers step 3 the fuzzy matrix is constructed for m warning alternatives and n criteria for making a decision the decision matrix can be established as 8 d x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn where x ij a ij b ij c ij is triangular fuzzy number step 4 the fuzzy decision matrix was normalized to avoid the effect of scale and unit of members in the decision matrix the linear scale transformation was applied to transform the various criteria scales into comparable scales banihabib and shabestari 2017 the normalized fuzzy decision matrix for benefit criteria and cost criteria can be respectively represented as equations 10

alternatives can be ranked starting from the highest values and ending with the lowest value 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the wrf model wrf was verified based on comparison of the wrf forecasted precipitation and gauged precipitation the verified wrf model was applied to simulate 14 historical rainfall events the obtained simulation results are depicted in fig 6 according to this figure the wrf model was able to capture the heavy precipitation in most events however the wrf model overestimates or underestimates the accumulated precipitation for some events since no cumulus scheme is likely to perform best for the entire events statistical criteria are required to evaluate the overall performance to make a further comparison the accuracy of accumulated precipitation of the 14 flood events was computed using mare and the results shown in table 7 it can be seen that the wrf accumulated precipitation has a lower mare for applying the kf scheme and a higher mare for applying the mskf scheme the kf scheme simulates convective rainfalls more accurately because the scheme conserves mass while using the parameterization of convective downdrafts as well as using convective available potential energy as part of the closure assumptions pennelly et al 2014 3 2 verification of the bayesian network model in order to estimate flood peak the wrf ensemble precipitations were fed into the bayesian network model ten different scenarios were developed using various combinations of predictors in bn in all of the scenarios flood peaks are the forecasted variables the proposed bayesian network model in the present study provides the forecasted flood peaks in a mountainous basin such as kan basin with low floodplain storage the peak flow magnitude is not reduced along the river hence we can use the peak flood instead of whole flood hydrograph to estimate the flood damage the accuracy of the bn model for the validation data set was assessed by mare and r2 as shown in table 8 the comparison between scenario no 1 and no 2 showed that the bn model driven from hourly rainfall outperformed the one using accumulated rainfall as the predictor in small basins such as kan basin with a time of concentration of 180 min cumulative precipitation does not represent rainfall time variation on the flood forecast and maximum hourly rainfall provides better outcomes therefore the maximum hourly rainfall was used in combinations of other predictor variables in the scenarios moreover comparing scenario no 9 and 5 shows that there is no significant decrease in accuracy by deleting the mskf scheme while deleting the kf scheme in scenario no 6 significantly decreased the accuracy consequently mskf is the least accurate cumulus scheme and kf is the most accurate cumulus parameterization scheme in the study area other researches have also shown similar results on precipitation prediction pennelly et al 2014 liang et al 2004 according to scenario no 5 in table 8 the best results were achieved by applying all cumulus schemes in this scenario mare was calculated 0 076 for the validation data set the coefficient of determination denoted by r2 is another measure that was used to assess the accuracy of the scenarios it can be seen from table 8 that is also close to unity the proposed bn structure of this scenario is composed of eight nodes as displayed in fig 7 the wrf ensemble precipitations antecedent rainfall and base flow of the river are the parent nodes and peak flow magnitude is the child node fig 7 also shows that base flow of the river is influenced by antecedent rainfall despite the small sample size of this study the results show that the bayesian network is an efficient method to forecast the flood peak based on weather ensemble forecasts and it is suited for flood forecasting in case of small data set size 3 3 effective criteria in flood warning due to lack of historical rainfall with high return period rainfalls during the study period it was not possible to simulate a high variability of the return periods hence the simulated floods in the present study have a return period of 25 years with 100 probability for low warning level thus some artificial storms were produced using back simulation capability of the bn model this is explained as follows an example of a forecasted flood by using the bn model and its upper and lower uncertainty bands is presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the lower and upper bounds of the uncertainty are 25 36 and 57 42 m3 s respectively in this research membership value of 1 was assigned to the forecasted flood peak using predicted value in scenario no 5 the most accurate scenario in bn and 0 was assigned to those scenarios that forecasted the maximum and minimum flood peak among all scenarios it can also be seen that the upper band is less than a 25 year flood so the probability of low warning level is 100 in order to evaluate the flood warning system for more cases the bn backward simulation was used to produce some artificial storm events in such a way that they have different flood peaks so the flood warning system can be evaluated on different warning levels as presented in fig 8 b c d the backward simulation approach was used starting from the flood peak and working contrary to direction of arcs to produce the predictor nodes and then the forward simulation approached was again employed by various combinations of predictors to estimate the uncertainty bands of flood peak the probability of different warning levels for forecasted floods was estimated by dividing the area enclosed by upper and lower bounds to the total area under the fuzzy triangle which is presented in table 9 the other effective criteria in flood warning decision making in flood warning system were estimated as follows population at risk flood warning costs and flood economic damages were estimated for different warning levels as shown in table 10 kan river s cross sections are nearly v shaped and there is not much difference between flood mappings for different return periods accordingly there is no significant difference between populations at risk in different return periods in the studied area this can also be found that the flood warning costs and flood economic damages have increased slightly with increasing of floods return periods since according to current river regulations in iran the building construction in riverbed flooded by 25 year flood is illegal banihabib 2016 banihabib et al 2015 the flood economic damages of unauthorized buildings in riverbed were neglected and therefore it is calculated zero for low warning level as shown in table 10 the expected cost of corrupted warnings and expected human losses were calculated for four forecasted flood events according to their probability of warning levels table 11 since these criteria are a function of the probability of different flood warning levels as shown in table 5 and 6 for the flood no 1 the probability of low warning level is 100 according to the presented formulas in table 5 the expected cost of corrupted warnings of the low warning level is a function of the probability of other flood warning levels since other flood warning levels have a probability of zero this flood does not cost for the low warning level table 11 there are some reasons why expected human losses listed in table 11 may display zero as mentioned earlier expected human losses at each warning level is a function of the probability of three other flood warning levels therefore in table 11 the expected human losses associated with that warning level will be zero if a flood warning level has a zero probability of occurring besides in cases of occurrence a warning level lower than the forecasted warning level the residents are relocated in the safe place and human losses cannot be expected 3 4 weighting flood warning criteria ahp was used to weight effective criteria using triangular fuzzy numbers as shown in table 12 a triangular fuzzy percentage weight was assigned to each criterion between 0 and 100 which represents the importance of the criterion as given in the last column of table 12 a higher weight of the criterion means more priority or more impact than other criteria for warning decision since the probability of flood occurrence affects the other criteria such as the expected cost of false warning and expected human losses this criterion has the most importance and the highest weight was assigned to it 3 5 decision making on warning levels in this research fuzzy topsis method was employed to make a decision on flood warning level the closeness coefficient and the rankings of alternatives were determined for four forecasted flood events as shown in table 13 the purpose of the present decision making is to determine the best alternative among all warning levels the purpose of the ranking of alternatives in the present study is to find the best warning level alternative and an order of other alternatives does not provide any decision rule for the warning for flood no 1 the low warning level with the highest closeness coefficient is the best alternative since the probability of low warning level was estimated at 100 it is rational to choose this warning level as the best alternative by using the decision making for the flood no 2 medium warning level has the highest probability it is clear from the results of the last two columns in table 13 that medium warning level with the closeness coefficient of 1 78 is the best alternative as well since high and extreme warning levels cannot possibly happen and have a probability of zero as shown in table 13 so selecting the medium warning level describes the rational decision for the flood no 3 although the highest forecasted probability is for the medium warning level the probability of high warning level is not zero hence it can be seen that high warning level is in the first rank according to results of table 13 it can be concluded that when the probability is distributed between different warning levels in case of a higher probability for stronger warning level such as flood no 2 and no 4 the highest closeness coefficient will be achieved for the stronger warning level as the best alternative but in case of a higher probability for milder warning level the best alternative will generally depend on other effective criteria in order to broaden our understanding of the decision making behavior there is a need for sensitivity analysis results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the next section 3 6 sensitivity analysis on the decision making of flood warning level since the uncertainty was addressed in estimating the effective criteria in multi criteria decision making a sensitivity analysis was used only to determine how different values of probability of flood warning levels impact on decision making behavior the results of sensitivity analysis for different scenarios are given in table 14 in the scenarios number 1 to 4 the probability of a specific flood warning level is 100 percent the result shows that warning level with 100 percent probability was the selected warning level which has the highest closeness coefficient scenarios number 5 to 8 were defined for a situation that the probability of one warning level is significantly higher than other warning levels in these scenarios an 80 probability was assigned to a warning level and the remaining 20 were assigned equally to the higher and lower warning level it is clear from table 14 that warning level with 80 percent probability is the selected warning level which has the highest closeness coefficient in scenarios number 9 to 12 a 60 probability was assigned to a warning level and the remaining 40 were assigned equally to the higher and lower warning level the results of scenarios number 10 to 12 showed that the warning level which is most likely to occur is at the highest rank and has the highest closeness coefficient but in scenarios number 9 although the low warning level has the highest probability of occurrence the medium warning level with 40 percent probability is the best alternative therefore it seems that when the probability is distributed between different warning levels the decision making model acts cautiously by selecting the stronger level as the best alternative to ensure this result scenarios number 13 to 16 were defined so that the probability is distributed equally between two or more warning levels which in all of them the stronger warning level is the first ranked alternative as shown in table 14 considering all the scenarios it could be concluded that assuming a significantly higher probability for a warning level compared to the other warning levels the decision making model proposes it as a warning level however if the probability is distributed equally between some warning levels the decision making model allocates a higher rank to the stronger warning level and in other words the flood warning system acts cautiously in this case 4 conclusions this study proposed a decision making model for determining flood warning level based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts according to knowledge of the authors this is the first attempt to provide a flood warning system considering the ensemble forecasts and all effective criteria and uncertainty associated with them the results showed that the wrf model was able to capture the heavy precipitation in most events while there is an overestimation or underestimation of the accumulated precipitation in a couple of cases while the details of the application of the wrf model are out of the purpose of the present study possible reasons of the precipitation error were reported by other authors including errors in the lateral boundary conditions ochoa et al 2014 poor representation of the topography ochoa et al 2014 and select of convective treatment microphysics and planetary boundary layer jankov et al 2005 in order to improve the forecasted rainfalls running the wrf model using the perturbing the initial conditions and also using the different microphysical schemes are suggested as the future works the atmospheric ensemble forecasts were fed into the bayesian networks bn to estimate the flood peak mare was calculated 0 076 for validation dataset in bayesian network and verified that the bn is an efficient method to forecast the flood peak based on weather ensemble forecasts and it is suited for flood forecasting in case of small data set size finally the results showed that the selected warning level by the fuzzy topsis model was strongly dependent on the probability distribution of flood warning levels and this is why the addressing of uncertainties in estimation of probability distribution is significant the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that in the scenarios that were given or granted a significantly high probability higher than 60 at a warning level compared to other levels the frequent level has the highest rating however in the flood events where the occurrence probability was equally distributed between different warning levels the decision making model had assigned a higher rating to the stronger warning level in another words the flood warning system acts cautiously it was also showed that fuzzy topsis is well suited for flood warning modeling based on ensemble forecasts according to the reasonable results of this study applying the proposed fuzzy topsis model to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts can be proposed in similar catchments for considering the uncertainties and selecting flood warning level

6508,water security has become a priority for adaptive policy and measures taken in response to climate change around the world this is an opportunity and a challenge for the taiwan government to establish a climate resilient water supply portfolio to ensure water security this study incorporated the costs of water production intermittency and carbon dioxide emission reduction as well as the currently available water sources and how they will be affected by climate change and applied optimal control theory to establish a cost effective model to plan a long term 2031 climate resilient water supply portfolio for taiwan the study then uses the penghu area as an empirical case study for this water supply portfolio the results showed that desalination will become the major source of water accounting for 71 81 of the water supply by 2031 however this high proportion of desalination water will result in a significant increase in the unit cost of water production and the carbon footprint therefore water demand management is also needed and is recommended to ensure sustainable water resources in the penghu area keywords climate change optimal control water supply portfolio penghu area 1 introduction in the face of climate change the united nations un has repeatedly requested governments to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the problem and also to respond proactively to address the issue of water security specifically ipcc 2014 recommends that global water resource governing bodies reinforce their adaptive measures and in particular invest in scientific prediction risk management and impact assessment studies on changes in the surface water supply in the meantime they should conserve underground water resources for future demand at the same time the un proposed a set of sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030 which include direct connections to water supply such as related to drinking water water quality and water recycling water use efficiency integrated water resource management and water related ecosystems to achieve these goals key strategies involve development and maintenance of infrastructure for storage supply and storage as well as managing demand including through water use efficiency improvements improving the resilience of the water supply system and investing in infrastructure will become the main challenges for water resource governing bodies the issue of resilience of the water supply system has received worldwide attention in the international literature and it can be divided into three categories 1 the impact assessment of water resource under climate change xu 2000 vörösmarty et al 2000 kundzewicz et al 2008 these studies discussed the changes of precipitation or runoff under different rising temperature scenarios and the extent of water resources scarcity 2 adaptation plans and empirical research pahl wostl 2007 dessai and hulme 2007 mulangu and kraybill 2015 these studies designed frameworks to establish water resources management plans under climate change for certain areas 3 the application of hydro economic models to water resources management draper et al 2003 harou et al 2009 borgomeo et al 2016 these studies determine optimal water management plans based on minimizing cost or maximizing benefits by considering both hydrological and economic conditions the core of these approaches was the economic value of water resource which may change with time and different users these approaches can be applied to evaluate the water allocation between different sectors the choice between facilities installations and demand management conjunction use of surface subsurface water etc although taiwan experiences abundant precipitation it is nevertheless categorized as having a water shortage the average annual precipitation in taiwan is about 2 467 mm 2 6 times the world average 973 mm however because of the small land area and the dense population the annual precipitation per capita is only around 4 074 m3 which is less than one fifth of the world average 21 796 m3 yang 2010 under the impact of climate change water security will become increasingly challenging and this issue has attracted the attention of local scholars zheng et al 2017 predicted that by the end of the 21st century the number of typhoons affecting taiwan will have decreased which will result in a diminished water supply as a result water security in central and south taiwan and its offshore islands will be impacted hsu and chen 2017 highlighted the predicted change in the weather fronts by the end of the 21st century in winter fronts over taiwan are predicted to decrease slightly in frequency while those over the east of japan and taiwan will increase in spring fronts over taiwan and south china will decrease in frequency lower levels of weather front activity may also lead to diminished water resources in taiwan alternatively higher levels of front activity would increase the precipitation volume during the monsoon season which would raise the level of difficulty in devising and adopting adaptive strategies to climate change the above studies demonstrate that climate change does indeed pose the threat of increased risks associated with water supply in taiwan therefore it is essential that the water resource governing authority considers our sources of domestic water including river abstraction reservoir water groundwater desalinated water and recycled water and develops a water supply system that incorporates climate resilience based on the characteristics of the various types of water resources in response to climate change the government set a supply target of 20 billion tons of water in the year 2013 in short a water resource planning and management policy in line with the principle of supply dictates demand has been established this study is based on the following five principles of water supply as set out by the un 1 reliability of the water supply system 2 economic feasibility commercialized water supply technology and stable supply costs 3 affordability of water for the public 4 environmental friendliness low wastewater and carbon emissions 5 social acceptability biodiversity conservation provision of environmental flow optimal control theory is used to assess the effect of various factors of the optimal water supply portfolio the penghu area is used as a case study all the available water resources in penghu have limitations and the water supply portfolio for this area in 2031 is assessed in a worst case scenario which can be used to inform the government s policy making decisions while the model developed is new it is based on general concepts of cost minimization and solved using hamiltonian and lagrangian functions as is common in hydro economic literature the modelling of costs involved is most similar to lee et al 2016 molinos senante et al 2014 and jenkins et al 2004 this analysis pays special attention to desalination which is an important alternative water supply to respond to climate change but carbon footprint of seawater reverse osmosis desalination 0 4 6 7 kg co2e m3 is generally larger than water reuse systems 0 1 2 4 kg co2e m3 cornejo et al 2014 this indicates that the carbon dioxide cost of desalination is a key factor for water supply portfolio planning 2 the optimal water supply portfolio 2 1 theoretical model at present taiwan s domestic water supply comprises primarily surface water groundwater and desalinated water offshore islands although the development of diversified resources such as recycled water from wastewater treatment plants and rainwater harvesting systems are actively being promoted however there are restrictions on the use of recycled water reclaimed water resources development act 2015 and the water quality standards for various applications are yet to be established by the central government and the industry authorities rainwater harvesting systems are still occurring on only a small scale and few storage devices have yet been installed therefore these two types of water resources are not considered in the current study the objectives for the model were set as follows 1 time horizon the year 2031 was set as the end of the model 2 water supply portfolio diversified development investment to ensure a reliable water supply including the development of surface water and groundwater sources and the construction of desalination plants and facilities 3 water security ensure that the annual water supply is no less than the planned water demand while the intake of available surface water and groundwater is affected by hydrogeological conditions and climate change which reflects water security 4 water supply characteristics consider the intermittency cost of water supply which reflects reliability 5 carbon dioxide emission cost consider the carbon dioxide emission cost associated with water production which represents the cost of reducing the carbon footprint of water production 2 1 1 volume of supplied and raw water this study considers three types of water resources surface water q 1 t groundwater q 2 t and desalinated water q 3 t to generate a sufficient water supply it is necessary to obtain raw water from the environment including surface water f 1 t groundwater f 2 t and

the water supply which reflects the reliability of each water resource if for example the precipitation volume decreases such that available surface water groundwater becomes insufficient and alternative water resources such as transfer from other regions or short term increases in production at desalination plants are required additional costs will be incurred this study assumes a reliable supply of desalinated water so there is no intermittency cost associated with that source i e φ 3 0 the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions p ai a it is equal to the unit price of reduction p ai multiplied by the amount of reduction a it the cost of carbon dioxide emissions is the carbon price p ei multiplied by the net amount of carbon emissions e it this is used to reflect the environmental cost in this study the prices of carbon p ei raw water p fi and carbon emissions reduction p ai are assumed to be exogenous and constant 2 1 3 equation of capital accumulation this study considers the capital reserve k it of the three types of water resource to represent the water supply capacity the capital accumulation equation for type i water resource in the tth period is expressed in eq 3 3 k it i it δ i k it i 1 3 where k it is the accumulated capital reserve for the ith type of water resource in the tth period i it is the investment in the ith type of water resource in the tth period and δ i the capital depreciation rate for the ith type of water resource assumed to be constant it is assumed that in addition to being a function of raw water input water production is also a function of the capital reserve i e q it f it k it and that this is a quasi concave function i e q it k it 0 and 2 q it k it 2 0 2 1 4 water resource security assuming the water demand

water supply is permitted to only satisfy a fraction of the total projected water demand this reflects the reliability of the water supply system while capturing either long term demand management actions or the ability to reduce demand in the short term during droughts through restrictions on certain types of water use or the implementation of increased prices 2 1 5 net carbon dioxide

actively adopted and the net emissions e it are therefore lower assuming the goal for the upper limit of carbon dioxide emissions for the water resources department in the target year 2031 is e t the carbon emission rate must satisfy the following to achieve this goal 6 t 0 t i 1 3 e it e t 2 1 6 total water supply goal the water supply goal is taken as given the government has specified that the

economic significance of the solution assuming the economic system specifically the shadow price of water capital reaches a steady state which gives m i 0 eq 14 can be re arranged as follows 18 q i k

since e oi is assumed to be constant in this study θ 2 t 0 t e 0 i t θ 2 e 0 i it can be seen from eq 13 that θ 2 p ai p ei t substituting this into eq 12 gives the equation for the optimal fuel level

that converts nominal cost into real cost it can be seen from eq 20 that measures for reducing carbon emissions consider the carbon price optimal raw water input is thus affected by the carbon emissions coefficient which is in turn affected by the carbon price 2 3 factors affecting the optimal water supply portfolio to quantify the water supply and resources portfolio this study assumes

meaning that the input factors have an equal output elasticity the rest of the parameters are set as described below 3 1 1 study period the year 2031 is the endpoint of the study period to understand changes in the arrangement of water resources over time the intermediate results for 2021 2023 and 2026 are also examined henceforward the four years are referred to as focal years 3 1 2 raw water cost p fi the penghu area is an archipelago of 90 islands and islets in the taiwan strait due to the location small populations and scarcity of water resources the raw water cost in the penghu area is higher than that of other cities like taipei city of taiwan as a result the taiwan water corporation has suffered financial losses in the penghu area over many years based on reports published by the taiwan water corporation 2006 2011 2015 chen 2010 and kung 2015 2016 this study assumes the following raw water cost for three types of water resource in the penghu area reservoir water 0 41 cubic meter groundwater 0 49 cubic meter desalinated water 1 43 cubic meter since groundwater comes from deep wells extracting it requires more power than extracting reservoir water with an associated increase in cost water desalination requires reverse osmosis systems which results in a relatively high cost for desalinated water 3 1 3 carbon emissions coefficient e 0 i a comprehensive carbon footprint calculation for all of taiwan s water resource facilities is still lacking though some estimates exist for specific facilities the water resources agency ministry of economic affairs assessed the greenhouse gas emissions from infrastructure at four water reservoirs huang 2013 the carbon footprint of water from these reservoirs was in the range 2 0 24 4 kgco2e m3 thus the carbon footprint of water reservoirs in different regions can differ by an order of magnitude based on an input output lifecycle assessment fan 2012 estimated emissions of 9 6 kgco2e m3 for water production at kinmen seawater desalination plant and 0 19 kgco2e m3 for fong yuan water treatment plant there is as yet no such assessment for raw water extracted as groundwater a carbon footprint is affected by various factors including the scale of a facility the region in which it is located and the type of technology it uses results from individual case studies therefore cannot be applied to other similar facilities by using the same set of coefficients for each type of facility at present the carbon footprint of water produced by the taiwan water corporation is presented as co2 emissions per unit supplied water the formula is total co2 from electricity consumed total co2 from fuel consumed total water supply although this cannot fully capture the carbon footprint of the water production cycle the information required for this calculation is readily available and the result can at least be used as a basis for comparison and analysis therefore the current study has used this formula and it obtained the power charges and information on water supply from all water sources from the report titled profit and loss analysis for the penghu operation taiwan water corporation 2011 the carbon emissions coefficients thus calculated for the three types of water source in the penghu area are as follows reservoir water 0 610 kgco2e m3 groundwater 1 012 kgco2e m3 desalinated water 2 286 kgco2e m3 3 1 4 net depreciated cost according to the abovementioned profit and loss analysis report taiwan water corporation 2006 2011 the net depreciated cost for various water production technologies is as follows reservoir water 1 624 7 m3 groundwater 1 956 1 m3 desalinated water 6 584 3 m3 3 1 5 parameters for hydrological conditions kung 2015 gives the water usage structure in the penghu area as shown in fig 1 water resources in this area consist mainly of surface water and groundwater both originating from precipitation in that report annual runoff was derived using runoff coefficients based on land use data annual infiltration and recharge volume was estimated using the water balance model developed in the report integrated groundwater conservation strategy and planning in the penghu area prepared by the water resources planning institute water resources agency ministry of economic affairs huang 2012 these calculations indicate that the annual precipitation is approximately 120 17 million cubic meters of which 45 evapotranspiration 46 becomes runoff and 9 infiltrates in reservoirs evaporation is even greater accounting for about 60 the percentage of precipitation that cannot become reservoir water is therefore set as 60 based on the same report about 43 of the total annual recharge flows out to the sea as a result of aquifer structure high permeability this water notably helps prevent sea water intrusion and therefore cannot be extracted this value is therefore used to represent the percentage of precipitation that cannot be converted into groundwater the groundwater supply in penghu in wet average and dry years is presented in table 1 according to kung 2015 huang 2016 pointed out that due to a severe groundwater salinization problem in the penghu area while still ensuring that the public s water requirements are met the water authority should reduce its reliance on groundwater for the purpose of groundwater conservation groundwater should be seen as a backup water source for use in emergencies only in line with the groundwater conservation target for the penghu area this study assumes that from 2021 to 2031 the usage of groundwater will gradually decrease the safe yield of 1 17 million cubic meters in dry year is set as the upper limit for groundwater withdrawal in 2031 which is about 64 of groundwater supply capacity in the last three years for eqs 22 24 the hydrological condition parameters for the water production capacity factor of various water sources are therefore set as follows percentage of precipitation that cannot be converted into reservoir water α 1 60 evaporation and infiltration environmental flow percentage μ 0 there are no rivers in penghu percentage of infiltration that cannot be converted into groundwater α 2 43 boundary efflux groundwater conservation ratio η increasing over time with 16 32 48 and 64 for 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 respectively 3 2 climate change parameters the ipcc in its fourth assessment report ar4 described climate change over the last 100 years and the possible effects of lasting warming over the next 100 years since the publication of that report the taiwan ministry of science and technology originally the national science council has been actively promoting domestic climate change projections and impact studies this includes statistical and dynamical downscaling simulations and applications the derivation of daily and hourly data required for hydrology and agriculture and modular tools according to research published by the ministry of science and technology 2016 and the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 the effects of climate change on taiwan s water resources in the near future 2016 2035 will cause monthly precipitation to decrease by approximately 20 30 there was not much monthly variability between the various representative concentration pathways rcps however by the end of the century 2081 2100 the predicted change in precipitation based on rcp8 5 was approximately 50 while that based on rcp4 5 was about 30 a time series change simulation based on a single scenario rcp8 5 predicted that the average precipitation during 2021 2041 could increase by up to 75 74 or decrease by up to 38 78 the purpose of this study is to identify the optimal water supply portfolio in the worst case therefore in selecting the climate change scenario to be used based on rcp8 5 precipitation is predicted to decrease under the impact of climate change for the four focal years 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 it is assumed that the percentage reduction in available water resource β i increases over time and is set at 20 22 25 and 30 respectively capturing the expected progression of the impact of climate change the hydrological condition parameters and climate change parameters are summarized in table 2 these will be used to calculate the optimal distribution of various water resources 3 3 water supply and carbon emissions targets 3 3 1 water supply target according to the water supply and demand analysis by kung 2015 the water demand in the penghu area in the years 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 will be 11 07 11 06 11 04 and 11 00 million cubic meters per year respectively although the population and tourism are projected to continue to rise water use efficiency is expected to improve i e leakage rates will be reduced and as a result the total water demand is predicted to drop slightly 3 3 2 carbon emissions target the departmental mitigation measures outlined in the intended nationally determined contribution environmental protection administration executive yuan 2015 involve seven departments energy industry buildings and households the service industry transport agriculture and waste management notably the water resources department does not feature and lacks a specific emissions target the bureau of energy in the ministry of economic affairs proposed the penghu low carbon island project 2011 this proposal features five types of improvement designed to turn penghu into a low carbon tourism island namely renewable energy energy saving green transport green building and resource recycling the aims of the resource recycling include full utilization of water resources reduction of solid waste and organic recycling again there is no specific target for reducing carbon emissions associated with water provision since the water resources department is not the primary sector responsible for carbon emissions the present study refers to the penghu low carbon island project and uses the principle of no further increase in carbon emissions as the basis of the carbon emissions target for the water resources department based on data in huang 2016 and the raw water emissions coefficient previously derived the volume of water produced and the associated carbon emissions in the penghu area in 2015 are calculated and presented in table 3 the total annual water supply is 10 78 million cubic meters and total carbon emissions are 17 85 kgco2e the average carbon emission per unit water supply is thus 1 66 kgco2e m3 if we assume that in the four focal years the percentage of water supplied by each type of source is the same as that in 2015 the total carbon emissions in these years can be calculated based on the average emissions per unit water supply and used as a business as usual bau scenario table 4 as water supply gradually decreases year by year total carbon emissions also decrease in this bau scenario which complies with the assumptions of the study if in the future different water supply portfolios lead to increasing carbon emissions additional emissions reduction activities a t 0 will be required which will affect the optimal water supply portfolio this study assumes that carbon dioxide mitigation is offset by purchasing carbon credits the unit cost of carbon reduction p at is set at 5 euros per ton of co2e the average market price of the eu carbon market in 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimal water supply portfolio for the penghu area based on carbon emissions per unit water produced the total carbon emissions are estimated for the four focal years the reduction in carbon emissions and the associated costs are also calculated relative to the bau scenario using the various parameter settings outlined above this study uses eqs 22 24 to calculate the optimal water portfolio as shown in table 5 and fig 2 desalinated water is already the main source of water in the penghu area and according to the portfolio its contribution should increase from 60 55 in 2021 to 71 81 in 2031 the seawater desalination facilities will therefore need to be able to supply 7 898 million cubic meters per year 21 638 cubic meters per day cmd as the percentage contributed by desalinated water increases the water production and carbon reduction costs both rise resulting in higher water supply costs by 2031 the cost per unit water supplied reaches 1 147 per cubic meter at present the seawater desalination plant for the penghu area has a design water supply capacity of approximately 17 350 cmd it is anticipated that after the second desalination plant in magong is completed by the end of may 2018 the combined capacity of the two plants will be 21 350 cmd this is just under the optimal quantity of desalinated water estimated in this study to be required by 2031 upgrades or new desalination plants therefore might be still needed the optimal contribution of groundwater gradually decreases under the impact of climate change and the groundwater conservation goal from 21 48 in 2021 to 9 55 in 2031 the amount of water supplied from groundwater decreases to 1 05 million cubic meters about 90 of the safe yield in a drought year ensuring that the groundwater conservation target is met reservoir water is also predicted to be affected by climate change however while the contribution of groundwater drops and the cost of desalinated water increases the theoretical optimal contribution of reservoir water remains at about 18 this represents a volume of about 2 million cubic meters 5 479 cmd according to kung 2015 this is about 94 of the water supply capacity of the reservoirs in the penghu area this result indicates that the model tends to limit the usage of surface water due to its increased variability under climate change between wet and dry years in penghu area water supplied by desalination plants has the highest carbon emissions coefficient so when the share of desalinated water increases from 2021 to 2031 total carbon emissions also increase relative to the bau scenario since it is not possible to increase the contribution of the other water sources additional carbon emissions reduction measures are required such as purchasing carbon offsets according to our calculations to satisfy the emissions limit in the bau scenario emissions must be reduced by 0 607 1 032 1 531 and 2 151 million kgco2 in 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 respectively in eqs 22 24 since p ai 0 the contributions of the three water resources changes however the unit cost now needs to account for the cost of purchasing carbon offsets based on this the unit cost for 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 is calculated to be 1 043 m3 1 072 m3 1 106 m3 and 1 148 m3 respectively indicating a pattern of annual increases this study divides the unit cost into two parts the water production cost and the carbon reduction cost the unit water production cost is the main cost and the carbon reduction cost accounts for a lower percentage when the cost of carbon offsets is low however as the contribution of desalinated water increases the unit emissions reduction cost will also increase 4 2 parameter sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 parameters of hydrology and climate change in the current model percentage of precipitation that can be converted into reservoir water 1 α 1 or groundwater 1 α 2 are potentially uncertain and could change in future other hydrological parameters are externally specified constants because of the physical characteristics in penghu area it is difficult to alter the infiltration or efflux of groundwater through engineering on the other hand the usage rate of reservoir water might decrease due to siltation or pollution problems or it can be increased by reducing evaporation through artificial measures in section 4 1 the optimal water supply portfolio was designed using α 1 0 6 here we test the effect of setting α 1 to 0 5 or 0 7 for sensitivity analysis changing about 17 it can be seen from table 6 that when α 1 decreases to 0 5 the optimal usage of reservoir water increases and the contribution of groundwater and desalinated water decreases this is consistent with the model setup since reservoir water has a lower cost so when its availability increases its optimal contribution to the water supply also increases desalinated seawater has a higher cost than groundwater so optimal percentage of the water supply contributed by desalinated water decreases more than that of groundwater overall the unit cost of water decreases in contrast when the percentage of precipitation that cannot be converted to reservoir water increases α 1 0 7 the contribution of groundwater and desalinated water both go up with desalinated water going up more than groundwater this is associated with an increase in the overall unit cost to assess the impact of climate change on the optimal water resource distribution the climate change parameter β i is varied between 0 and 50 and the optimal contribution of each of the three water resources in the target year 2031 is recalculated table 7 it can be seen from the contribution of desalinated water and the average supply cost under the different scenarios that the optimal contribution of reservoir water and groundwater decreases under the impact of climate change while that of desalinated water gradually increases to compare the variation in the contributions to the water supply when the climate change parameter increases from 0 to 10 the percentage of water contributed by desalination increases by 3 73 when the climate change parameter increases to 50 the contribution of desalinated water increases by 21 90 in terms of emissions reduction relative to the bau scenario when the climate change parameter is set to 0 carbon emissions need to be reduced by 0 84 million kgco2e when it is set to 50 emissions must be reduced by 3 22 million kgco2e which is approximately 3 8 times more 4 2 2 parameter of carbon emissions target to understand the effect of change in the carbon emissions target on the unit cost of emissions reduction the cost is recalculated according to four carbon emissions scenarios bau minus 5 10 15 and 20 table 8 in 2031 for example reducing carbon emissions by an additional 5 will increase the unit cost of emissions reduction by 42 5 if emissions were reduced by an additional 20 the unit cost would increase by 170 1 it can thus be seen that as the emissions target becomes stricter the unit cost of emissions reduction increases but it is about 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the cost per unit water produced due to small emission coefficient 4 3 influence of long term demand management based on the results mentioned above the feasible water supply portfolios of penghu area are limited because the water resource is scarce if we are assessing this situation merely from the perspective of ensuring an adequate water supply under climate change the penghu area can only achieve water security by investing in seawater desalination plants however this will impose a greater financial burden on the public or will require a national subsidy and cause more damage to the environment through greater carbon emissions taking water sustainability into consideration as well demand management should be employed in the future to reduce the demand for water to explore the influence of either short or long term demand management on the water supply portfolio we determine the optimal portfolios for two scenarios where the demands of each focal year are reduced to 90 and 80 respectively the results are shown in table 9 and table 10 the share of desalinated water shows a noteworthy reduction in 2031 it decreases from 71 81 to 68 72 and 65 88 when the demand reduces to 90 and 80 respectively the capacity of present seawater desalination plants is able to supply the demand of 2031 in both scenarios and no investment in new plants is needed the carbon emission decreases 10 and 20 and the unit cost decreases 2 7 and 5 14 the shares of reservoir water and groundwater are close to the results of table 5 the results indicate that the demand management can help to decrease the amount of desalinated water environmental impact and unit cost of producing water however this does not consider the unit cost of demand reduction the study of huang 2012 showed that the main measure of demand management in penghu area is to reduce the non revenue water nrw of potable water supply system by applying the district metering area dma method morrison et al 2007 savić and ferrari 2014 to locate the leakages and prioritize renewal of pipelines the measure can reduce 7 35 of total demand but the unit cost of this measure is 3 61 m3 which is much higher than that of desalinated water 4 4 limitations in section 4 2 only a single parameter is considered in each sensitivity analysis because this study aims to recognize the effect of each parameter in the model assuming other parameter values are unchanged in reality different climate change scenarios might disturb hydrological conditions as well the further study can investigate multiple parameters to discover their interaction and influence in the model in section 4 3 the water supply authority may prefer investing desalinated water based on its lower cost on the other hand the scenario of climate change in this study is selected as the worst case rcp8 5 in the conservative view of point the desalination plants may be over invested if the change in climate is less drastic than what is projected under rcp 8 5 the uncertainty of climate change will affect the decision of adaptation measures and the tradeoff between water supply investment and demand management in penghu area needs more certain information and comprehensive studies for example quantifying the potential for regret due to overinvestment and robust and adaptive strategies that could be used as a result maier et al 2016 according to the limitations of this study we suggested to expand the theoretical model in the future incorporating the effects of demand management strategies such as water saving measures changes in the demand for water for various purposes and varying the price of water the decision to omit rainwater harvesting and recycled water may also be revisited in future 5 conclusions this study applied optimal control theory and developed a theoretical model that minimizes economic cost by incorporating the impact of climate change and the costs of water production intermittency and carbon emissions to estimate the optimal water supply portfolio for four different times in the future it considers meeting water supply needs carbon emissions targets and water security needs at the same time under a range of hydrological conditions and degrees of climate change impact for long term water supply planning the results of this research are highly policy relevant this study shows a scenario of climate resilience water supply portfolio which will provide a reference to investigate the adequacy of the status of water supply and inform further planning the optimal water supply portfolio was developed so as to minimize supply costs the case study reveals that desalinated seawater will be the main supply source in the worst case scenario and that its contribution to the total water supply will gradually increase from 60 55 by 2021 to 71 81 by 2031 this raises the unit cost of water and the associated carbon emissions under the impact of climate change and taking into account conservation targets the contribution of groundwater decreases over time although affected by climate change because of the diminishing contribution of groundwater and the relatively high cost of desalinated water the contribution of reservoir water remains roughly unchanged at around 18 the penghu area can only meet its water demand by investing in more seawater desalination plants this will lead to increases in supply costs and carbon emissions imposing a greater financial burden on the public or requiring a national subsidy and causing more damage to the environment through greater carbon emissions it is therefore recommended that demand management should be employed in the future to reduce the demand for water and that water utilization should be diversified through technological development it is through these management strategies that a sustainable water supply can be achieved and that more specific and feasible adaptive measures can be devised the theoretical model does still have a number of limitations a more comprehensive evaluation of a water resource adaptation strategy can thus be conducted which will further inform policy making declaration of interest statement none 
6508,water security has become a priority for adaptive policy and measures taken in response to climate change around the world this is an opportunity and a challenge for the taiwan government to establish a climate resilient water supply portfolio to ensure water security this study incorporated the costs of water production intermittency and carbon dioxide emission reduction as well as the currently available water sources and how they will be affected by climate change and applied optimal control theory to establish a cost effective model to plan a long term 2031 climate resilient water supply portfolio for taiwan the study then uses the penghu area as an empirical case study for this water supply portfolio the results showed that desalination will become the major source of water accounting for 71 81 of the water supply by 2031 however this high proportion of desalination water will result in a significant increase in the unit cost of water production and the carbon footprint therefore water demand management is also needed and is recommended to ensure sustainable water resources in the penghu area keywords climate change optimal control water supply portfolio penghu area 1 introduction in the face of climate change the united nations un has repeatedly requested governments to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the problem and also to respond proactively to address the issue of water security specifically ipcc 2014 recommends that global water resource governing bodies reinforce their adaptive measures and in particular invest in scientific prediction risk management and impact assessment studies on changes in the surface water supply in the meantime they should conserve underground water resources for future demand at the same time the un proposed a set of sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030 which include direct connections to water supply such as related to drinking water water quality and water recycling water use efficiency integrated water resource management and water related ecosystems to achieve these goals key strategies involve development and maintenance of infrastructure for storage supply and storage as well as managing demand including through water use efficiency improvements improving the resilience of the water supply system and investing in infrastructure will become the main challenges for water resource governing bodies the issue of resilience of the water supply system has received worldwide attention in the international literature and it can be divided into three categories 1 the impact assessment of water resource under climate change xu 2000 vörösmarty et al 2000 kundzewicz et al 2008 these studies discussed the changes of precipitation or runoff under different rising temperature scenarios and the extent of water resources scarcity 2 adaptation plans and empirical research pahl wostl 2007 dessai and hulme 2007 mulangu and kraybill 2015 these studies designed frameworks to establish water resources management plans under climate change for certain areas 3 the application of hydro economic models to water resources management draper et al 2003 harou et al 2009 borgomeo et al 2016 these studies determine optimal water management plans based on minimizing cost or maximizing benefits by considering both hydrological and economic conditions the core of these approaches was the economic value of water resource which may change with time and different users these approaches can be applied to evaluate the water allocation between different sectors the choice between facilities installations and demand management conjunction use of surface subsurface water etc although taiwan experiences abundant precipitation it is nevertheless categorized as having a water shortage the average annual precipitation in taiwan is about 2 467 mm 2 6 times the world average 973 mm however because of the small land area and the dense population the annual precipitation per capita is only around 4 074 m3 which is less than one fifth of the world average 21 796 m3 yang 2010 under the impact of climate change water security will become increasingly challenging and this issue has attracted the attention of local scholars zheng et al 2017 predicted that by the end of the 21st century the number of typhoons affecting taiwan will have decreased which will result in a diminished water supply as a result water security in central and south taiwan and its offshore islands will be impacted hsu and chen 2017 highlighted the predicted change in the weather fronts by the end of the 21st century in winter fronts over taiwan are predicted to decrease slightly in frequency while those over the east of japan and taiwan will increase in spring fronts over taiwan and south china will decrease in frequency lower levels of weather front activity may also lead to diminished water resources in taiwan alternatively higher levels of front activity would increase the precipitation volume during the monsoon season which would raise the level of difficulty in devising and adopting adaptive strategies to climate change the above studies demonstrate that climate change does indeed pose the threat of increased risks associated with water supply in taiwan therefore it is essential that the water resource governing authority considers our sources of domestic water including river abstraction reservoir water groundwater desalinated water and recycled water and develops a water supply system that incorporates climate resilience based on the characteristics of the various types of water resources in response to climate change the government set a supply target of 20 billion tons of water in the year 2013 in short a water resource planning and management policy in line with the principle of supply dictates demand has been established this study is based on the following five principles of water supply as set out by the un 1 reliability of the water supply system 2 economic feasibility commercialized water supply technology and stable supply costs 3 affordability of water for the public 4 environmental friendliness low wastewater and carbon emissions 5 social acceptability biodiversity conservation provision of environmental flow optimal control theory is used to assess the effect of various factors of the optimal water supply portfolio the penghu area is used as a case study all the available water resources in penghu have limitations and the water supply portfolio for this area in 2031 is assessed in a worst case scenario which can be used to inform the government s policy making decisions while the model developed is new it is based on general concepts of cost minimization and solved using hamiltonian and lagrangian functions as is common in hydro economic literature the modelling of costs involved is most similar to lee et al 2016 molinos senante et al 2014 and jenkins et al 2004 this analysis pays special attention to desalination which is an important alternative water supply to respond to climate change but carbon footprint of seawater reverse osmosis desalination 0 4 6 7 kg co2e m3 is generally larger than water reuse systems 0 1 2 4 kg co2e m3 cornejo et al 2014 this indicates that the carbon dioxide cost of desalination is a key factor for water supply portfolio planning 2 the optimal water supply portfolio 2 1 theoretical model at present taiwan s domestic water supply comprises primarily surface water groundwater and desalinated water offshore islands although the development of diversified resources such as recycled water from wastewater treatment plants and rainwater harvesting systems are actively being promoted however there are restrictions on the use of recycled water reclaimed water resources development act 2015 and the water quality standards for various applications are yet to be established by the central government and the industry authorities rainwater harvesting systems are still occurring on only a small scale and few storage devices have yet been installed therefore these two types of water resources are not considered in the current study the objectives for the model were set as follows 1 time horizon the year 2031 was set as the end of the model 2 water supply portfolio diversified development investment to ensure a reliable water supply including the development of surface water and groundwater sources and the construction of desalination plants and facilities 3 water security ensure that the annual water supply is no less than the planned water demand while the intake of available surface water and groundwater is affected by hydrogeological conditions and climate change which reflects water security 4 water supply characteristics consider the intermittency cost of water supply which reflects reliability 5 carbon dioxide emission cost consider the carbon dioxide emission cost associated with water production which represents the cost of reducing the carbon footprint of water production 2 1 1 volume of supplied and raw water this study considers three types of water resources surface water q 1 t groundwater q 2 t and desalinated water q 3 t to generate a sufficient water supply it is necessary to obtain raw water from the environment including surface water f 1 t groundwater f 2 t and

the water supply which reflects the reliability of each water resource if for example the precipitation volume decreases such that available surface water groundwater becomes insufficient and alternative water resources such as transfer from other regions or short term increases in production at desalination plants are required additional costs will be incurred this study assumes a reliable supply of desalinated water so there is no intermittency cost associated with that source i e φ 3 0 the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions p ai a it is equal to the unit price of

study considers the capital reserve k it of the three types of water resource to represent the water supply capacity the capital accumulation equation for type i water resource in the tth period is expressed in eq 3 3 k it i it δ i k it i 1 3 where k it is the accumulated capital reserve for the ith type of water resource in the tth period i it is the investment in the ith type of water resource

water supply is permitted to only satisfy a fraction of the total projected water demand this reflects the reliability of the water supply system while capturing either long term demand management actions or the ability to reduce demand in the short term during droughts through restrictions on certain types of water use or the implementation of increased prices 2 1 5 net carbon dioxide

economic significance of the solution assuming the economic system specifically the shadow price of water capital reaches a steady state which gives m i 0 eq 14 can be re arranged as follows 18 q i k

that converts nominal cost into real cost it can be seen from eq 20 that measures for reducing carbon emissions consider the carbon price optimal raw water input is thus affected by the carbon

the penghu area this study gathers in situ information for the model and considers possible scenarios for certain parameters the water resource technology parameter γ is set to 0 5 for simplicity meaning that the input factors have an equal output elasticity the rest of the parameters are set as described below 3 1 1 study period the year 2031 is the endpoint of the study period to understand changes in the arrangement of water resources over time the intermediate results for 2021 2023 and 2026 are also examined henceforward the four years are referred to as focal years 3 1 2 raw water cost p fi the penghu area is an archipelago of 90 islands and islets in the taiwan strait due to the location small populations and scarcity of water resources the raw water cost in the penghu area is higher than that of other cities like taipei city of taiwan as a result the taiwan water corporation has suffered financial losses in the penghu area over many years based on reports published by the taiwan water corporation 2006 2011 2015 chen 2010 and kung 2015 2016 this study assumes the following raw water cost for three types of water resource in the penghu area reservoir water 0 41 cubic meter groundwater 0 49 cubic meter desalinated water 1 43 cubic meter since groundwater comes from deep wells extracting it requires more power than extracting reservoir water with an associated increase in cost water desalination requires reverse osmosis systems which results in a relatively high cost for desalinated water 3 1 3 carbon emissions coefficient e 0 i a comprehensive carbon footprint calculation for all of taiwan s water resource facilities is still lacking though some estimates exist for specific facilities the water resources agency ministry of economic affairs assessed the greenhouse gas emissions from infrastructure at four water reservoirs huang 2013 the carbon footprint of water from these reservoirs was in the range 2 0 24 4 kgco2e m3 thus the carbon footprint of water reservoirs in different regions can differ by an order of magnitude based on an input output lifecycle assessment fan 2012 estimated emissions of 9 6 kgco2e m3 for water production at kinmen seawater desalination plant and 0 19 kgco2e m3 for fong yuan water treatment plant there is as yet no such assessment for raw water extracted as groundwater a carbon footprint is affected by various factors including the scale of a facility the region in which it is located and the type of technology it uses results from individual case studies therefore cannot be applied to other similar facilities by using the same set of coefficients for each type of facility at present the carbon footprint of water produced by the taiwan water corporation is presented as co2 emissions per unit supplied water the formula is total co2 from electricity consumed total co2 from fuel consumed total water supply although this cannot fully capture the carbon footprint of the water production cycle the information required for this calculation is readily available and the result can at least be used as a basis for comparison and analysis therefore the current study has used this formula and it obtained the power charges and information on water supply from all water sources from the report titled profit and loss analysis for the penghu operation taiwan water corporation 2011 the carbon emissions coefficients thus calculated for the three types of water source in the penghu area are as follows reservoir water 0 610 kgco2e m3 groundwater 1 012 kgco2e m3 desalinated water 2 286 kgco2e m3 3 1 4 net depreciated cost according to the abovementioned profit and loss analysis report taiwan water corporation 2006 2011 the net depreciated cost for various water production technologies is as follows reservoir water 1 624 7 m3 groundwater 1 956 1 m3 desalinated water 6 584 3 m3 3 1 5 parameters for hydrological conditions kung 2015 gives the water usage structure in the penghu area as shown in fig 1 water resources in this area consist mainly of surface water and groundwater both originating from precipitation in that report annual runoff was derived using runoff coefficients based on land use data annual infiltration and recharge volume was estimated using the water balance model developed in the report integrated groundwater conservation strategy and planning in the penghu area prepared by the water resources planning institute water resources agency ministry of economic affairs huang 2012 these calculations indicate that the annual precipitation is approximately 120 17 million cubic meters of which 45 evapotranspiration 46 becomes runoff and 9 infiltrates in reservoirs evaporation is even greater accounting for about 60 the percentage of precipitation that cannot become reservoir water is therefore set as 60 based on the same report about 43 of the total annual recharge flows out to the sea as a result of aquifer structure high permeability this water notably helps prevent sea water intrusion and therefore cannot be extracted this value is therefore used to represent the percentage of precipitation that cannot be converted into groundwater the groundwater supply in penghu in wet average and dry years is presented in table 1 according to kung 2015 huang 2016 pointed out that due to a severe groundwater salinization problem in the penghu area while still ensuring that the public s water requirements are met the water authority should reduce its reliance on groundwater for the purpose of groundwater conservation groundwater should be seen as a backup water source for use in emergencies only in line with the groundwater conservation target for the penghu area this study assumes that from 2021 to 2031 the usage of groundwater will gradually decrease the safe yield of 1 17 million cubic meters in dry year is set as the upper limit for groundwater withdrawal in 2031 which is about 64 of groundwater supply capacity in the last three years for eqs 22 24 the hydrological condition parameters for the water production capacity factor of various water sources are therefore set as follows percentage of precipitation that cannot be converted into reservoir water α 1 60 evaporation and infiltration environmental flow percentage μ 0 there are no rivers in penghu percentage of infiltration that cannot be converted into groundwater α 2 43 boundary efflux groundwater conservation ratio η increasing over time with 16 32 48 and 64 for 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 respectively 3 2 climate change parameters the ipcc in its fourth assessment report ar4 described climate change over the last 100 years and the possible effects of lasting warming over the next 100 years since the publication of that report the taiwan ministry of science and technology originally the national science council has been actively promoting domestic climate change projections and impact studies this includes statistical and dynamical downscaling simulations and applications the derivation of daily and hourly data required for hydrology and agriculture and modular tools according to research published by the ministry of science and technology 2016 and the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 the effects of climate change on taiwan s water resources in the near future 2016 2035 will cause monthly precipitation to decrease by approximately 20 30 there was not much monthly variability between the various representative concentration pathways rcps however by the end of the century 2081 2100 the predicted change in precipitation based on rcp8 5 was approximately 50 while that based on rcp4 5 was about 30 a time series change simulation based on a single scenario rcp8 5 predicted that the average precipitation during 2021 2041 could increase by up to 75 74 or decrease by up to 38 78 the purpose of this study is to identify the optimal water supply portfolio in the worst case therefore in selecting the climate change scenario to be used based on rcp8 5 precipitation is predicted to decrease under the impact of climate change for the four focal years 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 it is assumed that the percentage reduction in available water resource β i increases over time and is set at 20 22 25 and 30 respectively capturing the expected progression of the impact of climate change the hydrological condition parameters and climate change parameters are summarized in table 2 these will be used to calculate the optimal distribution of various water resources 3 3 water supply and carbon emissions targets 3 3 1 water supply target according to the water supply and demand analysis by kung 2015 the water demand in the penghu area in the years 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 will be 11 07 11 06 11 04 and 11 00 million cubic meters per year respectively although the population and tourism are projected to continue to rise water use efficiency is expected to improve i e leakage rates will be reduced and as a result the total water demand is predicted to drop slightly 3 3 2 carbon emissions target the departmental mitigation measures outlined in the intended nationally determined contribution environmental protection administration executive yuan 2015 involve seven departments energy industry buildings and households the service industry transport agriculture and waste management notably the water resources department does not feature and lacks a specific emissions target the bureau of energy in the ministry of economic affairs proposed the penghu low carbon island project 2011 this proposal features five types of improvement designed to turn penghu into a low carbon tourism island namely renewable energy energy saving green transport green building and resource recycling the aims of the resource recycling include full utilization of water resources reduction of solid waste and organic recycling again there is no specific target for reducing carbon emissions associated with water provision since the water resources department is not the primary sector responsible for carbon emissions the present study refers to the penghu low carbon island project and uses the principle of no further increase in carbon emissions as the basis of the carbon emissions target for the water resources department based on data in huang 2016 and the raw water emissions coefficient previously derived the volume of water produced and the associated carbon emissions in the penghu area in 2015 are calculated and presented in table 3 the total annual water supply is 10 78 million cubic meters and total carbon emissions are 17 85 kgco2e the average carbon emission per unit water supply is thus 1 66 kgco2e m3 if we assume that in the four focal years the percentage of water supplied by each type of source is the same as that in 2015 the total carbon emissions in these years can be calculated based on the average emissions per unit water supply and used as a business as usual bau scenario table 4 as water supply gradually decreases year by year total carbon emissions also decrease in this bau scenario which complies with the assumptions of the study if in the future different water supply portfolios lead to increasing carbon emissions additional emissions reduction activities a t 0 will be required which will affect the optimal water supply portfolio this study assumes that carbon dioxide mitigation is offset by purchasing carbon credits the unit cost of carbon reduction p at is set at 5 euros per ton of co2e the average market price of the eu carbon market in 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimal water supply portfolio for the penghu area based on carbon emissions per unit water produced the total carbon emissions are estimated for the four focal years the reduction in carbon emissions and the associated costs are also calculated relative to the bau scenario using the various parameter settings outlined above this study uses eqs 22 24 to calculate the optimal water portfolio as shown in table 5 and fig 2 desalinated water is already the main source of water in the penghu area and according to the portfolio its contribution should increase from 60 55 in 2021 to 71 81 in 2031 the seawater desalination facilities will therefore need to be able to supply 7 898 million cubic meters per year 21 638 cubic meters per day cmd as the percentage contributed by desalinated water increases the water production and carbon reduction costs both rise resulting in higher water supply costs by 2031 the cost per unit water supplied reaches 1 147 per cubic meter at present the seawater desalination plant for the penghu area has a design water supply capacity of approximately 17 350 cmd it is anticipated that after the second desalination plant in magong is completed by the end of may 2018 the combined capacity of the two plants will be 21 350 cmd this is just under the optimal quantity of desalinated water estimated in this study to be required by 2031 upgrades or new desalination plants therefore might be still needed the optimal contribution of groundwater gradually decreases under the impact of climate change and the groundwater conservation goal from 21 48 in 2021 to 9 55 in 2031 the amount of water supplied from groundwater decreases to 1 05 million cubic meters about 90 of the safe yield in a drought year ensuring that the groundwater conservation target is met reservoir water is also predicted to be affected by climate change however while the contribution of groundwater drops and the cost of desalinated water increases the theoretical optimal contribution of reservoir water remains at about 18 this represents a volume of about 2 million cubic meters 5 479 cmd according to kung 2015 this is about 94 of the water supply capacity of the reservoirs in the penghu area this result indicates that the model tends to limit the usage of surface water due to its increased variability under climate change between wet and dry years in penghu area water supplied by desalination plants has the highest carbon emissions coefficient so when the share of desalinated water increases from 2021 to 2031 total carbon emissions also increase relative to the bau scenario since it is not possible to increase the contribution of the other water sources additional carbon emissions reduction measures are required such as purchasing carbon offsets according to our calculations to satisfy the emissions limit in the bau scenario emissions must be reduced by 0 607 1 032 1 531 and 2 151 million kgco2 in 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 respectively in eqs 22 24 since p ai 0 the contributions of the three water resources changes however the unit cost now needs to account for the cost of purchasing carbon offsets based on this the unit cost for 2021 2023 2026 and 2031 is calculated to be 1 043 m3 1 072 m3 1 106 m3 and 1 148 m3 respectively indicating a pattern of annual increases this study divides the unit cost into two parts the water production cost and the carbon reduction cost the unit water production cost is the main cost and the carbon reduction cost accounts for a lower percentage when the cost of carbon offsets is low however as the contribution of desalinated water increases the unit emissions reduction cost will also increase 4 2 parameter sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 parameters of hydrology and climate change in the current model percentage of precipitation that can be converted into reservoir water 1 α 1 or groundwater 1 α 2 are potentially uncertain and could change in future other hydrological parameters are externally specified constants because of the physical characteristics in penghu area it is difficult to alter the infiltration or efflux of groundwater through engineering on the other hand the usage rate of reservoir water might decrease due to siltation or pollution problems or it can be increased by reducing evaporation through artificial measures in section 4 1 the optimal water supply portfolio was designed using α 1 0 6 here we test the effect of setting α 1 to 0 5 or 0 7 for sensitivity analysis changing about 17 it can be seen from table 6 that when α 1 decreases to 0 5 the optimal usage of reservoir water increases and the contribution of groundwater and desalinated water decreases this is consistent with the model setup since reservoir water has a lower cost so when its availability increases its optimal contribution to the water supply also increases desalinated seawater has a higher cost than groundwater so optimal percentage of the water supply contributed by desalinated water decreases more than that of groundwater overall the unit cost of water decreases in contrast when the percentage of precipitation that cannot be converted to reservoir water increases α 1 0 7 the contribution of groundwater and desalinated water both go up with desalinated water going up more than groundwater this is associated with an increase in the overall unit cost to assess the impact of climate change on the optimal water resource distribution the climate change parameter β i is varied between 0 and 50 and the optimal contribution of each of the three water resources in the target year 2031 is recalculated table 7 it can be seen from the contribution of desalinated water and the average supply cost under the different scenarios that the optimal contribution of reservoir water and groundwater decreases under the impact of climate change while that of desalinated water gradually increases to compare the variation in the contributions to the water supply when the climate change parameter increases from 0 to 10 the percentage of water contributed by desalination increases by 3 73 when the climate change parameter increases to 50 the contribution of desalinated water increases by 21 90 in terms of emissions reduction relative to the bau scenario when the climate change parameter is set to 0 carbon emissions need to be reduced by 0 84 million kgco2e when it is set to 50 emissions must be reduced by 3 22 million kgco2e which is approximately 3 8 times more 4 2 2 parameter of carbon emissions target to understand the effect of change in the carbon emissions target on the unit cost of emissions reduction the cost is recalculated according to four carbon emissions scenarios bau minus 5 10 15 and 20 table 8 in 2031 for example reducing carbon emissions by an additional 5 will increase the unit cost of emissions reduction by 42 5 if emissions were reduced by an additional 20 the unit cost would increase by 170 1 it can thus be seen that as the emissions target becomes stricter the unit cost of emissions reduction increases but it is about 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the cost per unit water produced due to small emission coefficient 4 3 influence of long term demand management based on the results mentioned above the feasible water supply portfolios of penghu area are limited because the water resource is scarce if we are assessing this situation merely from the perspective of ensuring an adequate water supply under climate change the penghu area can only achieve water security by investing in seawater desalination plants however this will impose a greater financial burden on the public or will require a national subsidy and cause more damage to the environment through greater carbon emissions taking water sustainability into consideration as well demand management should be employed in the future to reduce the demand for water to explore the influence of either short or long term demand management on the water supply portfolio we determine the optimal portfolios for two scenarios where the demands of each focal year are reduced to 90 and 80 respectively the results are shown in table 9 and table 10 the share of desalinated water shows a noteworthy reduction in 2031 it decreases from 71 81 to 68 72 and 65 88 when the demand reduces to 90 and 80 respectively the capacity of present seawater desalination plants is able to supply the demand of 2031 in both scenarios and no investment in new plants is needed the carbon emission decreases 10 and 20 and the unit cost decreases 2 7 and 5 14 the shares of reservoir water and groundwater are close to the results of table 5 the results indicate that the demand management can help to decrease the amount of desalinated water environmental impact and unit cost of producing water however this does not consider the unit cost of demand reduction the study of huang 2012 showed that the main measure of demand management in penghu area is to reduce the non revenue water nrw of potable water supply system by applying the district metering area dma method morrison et al 2007 savić and ferrari 2014 to locate the leakages and prioritize renewal of pipelines the measure can reduce 7 35 of total demand but the unit cost of this measure is 3 61 m3 which is much higher than that of desalinated water 4 4 limitations in section 4 2 only a single parameter is considered in each sensitivity analysis because this study aims to recognize the effect of each parameter in the model assuming other parameter values are unchanged in reality different climate change scenarios might disturb hydrological conditions as well the further study can investigate multiple parameters to discover their interaction and influence in the model in section 4 3 the water supply authority may prefer investing desalinated water based on its lower cost on the other hand the scenario of climate change in this study is selected as the worst case rcp8 5 in the conservative view of point the desalination plants may be over invested if the change in climate is less drastic than what is projected under rcp 8 5 the uncertainty of climate change will affect the decision of adaptation measures and the tradeoff between water supply investment and demand management in penghu area needs more certain information and comprehensive studies for example quantifying the potential for regret due to overinvestment and robust and adaptive strategies that could be used as a result maier et al 2016 according to the limitations of this study we suggested to expand the theoretical model in the future incorporating the effects of demand management strategies such as water saving measures changes in the demand for water for various purposes and varying the price of water the decision to omit rainwater harvesting and recycled water may also be revisited in future 5 conclusions this study applied optimal control theory and developed a theoretical model that minimizes economic cost by incorporating the impact of climate change and the costs of water production intermittency and carbon emissions to estimate the optimal water supply portfolio for four different times in the future it considers meeting water supply needs carbon emissions targets and water security needs at the same time under a range of hydrological conditions and degrees of climate change impact for long term water supply planning the results of this research are highly policy relevant this study shows a scenario of climate resilience water supply portfolio which will provide a reference to investigate the adequacy of the status of water supply and inform further planning the optimal water supply portfolio was developed so as to minimize supply costs the case study reveals that desalinated seawater will be the main supply source in the worst case scenario and that its contribution to the total water supply will gradually increase from 60 55 by 2021 to 71 81 by 2031 this raises the unit cost of water and the associated carbon emissions under the impact of climate change and taking into account conservation targets the contribution of groundwater decreases over time although affected by climate change because of the diminishing contribution of groundwater and the relatively high cost of desalinated water the contribution of reservoir water remains roughly unchanged at around 18 the penghu area can only meet its water demand by investing in more seawater desalination plants this will lead to increases in supply costs and carbon emissions imposing a greater financial burden on the public or requiring a national subsidy and causing more damage to the environment through greater carbon emissions it is therefore recommended that demand management should be employed in the future to reduce the demand for water and that water utilization should be diversified through technological development it is through these management strategies that a sustainable water supply can be achieved and that more specific and feasible adaptive measures can be devised the theoretical model does still have a number of limitations a more comprehensive evaluation of a water resource adaptation strategy can thus be conducted which will further inform policy making declaration of interest statement none 
6509,transportation of carbon and nitrogen during rainfall events is highly important within karst ecosystems and has particular relevance to understand decoupling relation between carbon and nitrogen cycles the ability of the karst ecosystem to sequester carbon is currently unknown but has potential to be an important residual terrestrial carbon sink we hypothesis that the runoff response to rainfall events will vary according to whether the slope belongs to karst area and carbon and nitrogen have imbalanced outputs response to runoff hence a series of in situ simulated rainfall experiments at three sites two karst slopes with different carbonate matrixes and one non karst slope without a carbonate matrix were conducted in a typical karst zone in southwest china we measured runoff discharge and dissolved carbon and nitrogen during the experiments the results show that the total runoff discharge increased positively with rainfall intensity with the carbonate matrix making an important contribution to rainfall reallocation the dissolved carbon loss from runoff plots is much higher than the dissolved nitrogen with the dissolved c n revealing the decoupling relation of carbon and nitrogen cycles in this critical karst zone this initial carbon migrated by runoff at catchment scale is critical to carbon budgets in rivers furthermore nitrogen leaching from the system is crucial as a nitrogen shortage at karst area in southwest china keywords dissolved carbon nitrogen transport simulated rainfall karst 1 introduction carbonate terrains that include karst ecosystems

limit the ecosystem is still under debate davidson and howarth 2007 nitrogen fertilizer can significantly increase c sequestration of grassland soils compared to compound fertilizer which suggests the importance relation between c and n transformation in ecosystems fornara et al 2013 gao et al 2013 assessed the coupling relationships between c n and water cycles in different ecosystems and derived a conceptual framework with respect to c storage in terrestrial ecosystems gao et al 2012 2013 coupling relationships in karst ecosystems are relatively sensitive to change compared to other terrestrial ecosystems marin et al 2015 gao et al 2018 2019 the majority of research in chinese karst systems has focused on soil loss and erosion and nutrient loss using laboratory experiments dai et al 2015 in situ rainfall simulation experiments by contrast could provide data on the ecosystem processes in the karst critical zone yang et al 2012 found a dilution effect on ph under high intensity rainfall but an increase in soil co2 and considered co2 and rainfall as major factors of the hydrochemical variations in the epikarst zone quantitative study on both c and n loss from soil coupling with runoff especially subsurface runoff is difficult but significant to ecosystem stability the abundant carbonate of the parent rocks could significantly influence c and n migration and ph of runoff wang et al 2016a b furthermore the interactions between rainfall recharge and karst soils could be more intense than other ecosystems because the unconfined aquifers in eogenetic carbonate rocks and soils have a high aquifer matrix porosity that expedites water flow overall we hypothesis that the runoff response to rainfall events will vary according to whether the slope belongs to karst area and the decoupling relation of carbon and nitrogen response to runoff in this paper we investigate how c n stoichiometry and ph changes of both surface and subsurface runoff change under in different rainfall conditions using rainfall simulations in karst and non karst regions of southwest china we consider the results in relation to ecological restoration and potential threats to the karst ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and runoff plots a simulated rainfall experiment was conducted at three sloping sites in guizhou province southwest china shawan sw chenqi cq and

applied to any of the plots for a year runoff plots were constructed one week in advance of the experiments at each study site three contiguous replicated rectangular plots with an active area of 1 89 m2 1 66 1 16 0 6 m were constructed parallel with the slope angle on the mid slope fig 2 b four sides of each plot were excavated down to 60 cm or to the bedrock at where the soil depth is less than 60 cm with a width of 20 cm fig 2b the ditches then were filled with concrete except the downslope side to prevent the water from outside flow into the plot the remaining downslope edge was filled with concrete to 5 cm depth and coated with polymer cement waterproof coating an exit hole 8 cm internal diameter was linked to a pvc with steel wire strengthened hose to collect subsurface flow the depth of the confining underlying subsurface catchment groove was 60 cm fig 2a a permeable stratum made up of crushed granite rocks packed in nylon gauze was built above the subsurface catchment groove the upper layer of the permeable stratum was the surface catchment groove stabilized with concrete the surface catchment groove was 10 cm lower than the plots and also connected with a pvc hose to collect surface runoff two large buckets were used to sample the total surface and subsurface runoff brackets were surrounded by absorbent flannel to insulate from wind effects fig 2b 2 2 simulated rainfall strategy a customized rainfall simulator nljy 10 nanjing nanlin electronic co ltd nanjing china included a cistern water pump system controller and rainfall generator the height of sprinkler nozzles was 3 0 m above the ground surface and the diameter of three nozzles were 1 2 and 3 mm respectively the uniformity of raindrops was 86 manufacturer specification the frame was surrounded by wind barriers and an automated pulse type hyetometer wuhan zhongke nenghui technoogy development co ltd nhjyl42bp china was used to measure rainfall intensity fig 2b based on the eroded rainfall intensity in guizhou karst area is about 10 to 50 mm h 1 zhang et al 2014 and the pre test of runoff discharge under different rainfall intensities the simulated rainfall experiments were conducted at five different intensities 30 mm h 1 45 mm h 1 70 mm h 1 90 mm h 1 and 120 mm h 1 on each plot each rainfall simulation lasted for 60 min in total 45 formal simulated rainfall events were conducted across the three sites a minimum interval of 24 h between each rain event was set at each individual plot 2 3 soil properties measurements cutting rings with volume of 100 cm2 diameter of 50 46 mm height of 50 mm were used to sample soil cores of three layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 50 cm at each site gently and soil cores were dried in an oven at 105 c for 48 h soil bulk density was calculated based on soil cores weight before and after drying soils sampled in three layers were air dried and stored after passing through 2 00 mm sieve for soil properties analysis total c tc and total n tn contents of soil were measured by combustion using a vario max cn elemental analyser elementar germany soil organic carbon soc was determined with colorimetric method at 590 nm uv 1700 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan after oxidized with 0 800 mol l 1 k2cr2o7 and 98 h2so4 at 98 for 1 h soil inorganic carbon sic was calculated by subtracting soc from tc nitrate no3 n and ammonium nh4

samples 100 ml of surface and subsurface runoff were collected during the rainfall simulation the first eight samples were collected at intervals between 1 and 3 min after runoff yielding and last two samples were collected every 3 min after the rain stopped total surface and subsurface runoff samples were collected by two buckets and then sampled the same as runoff sample during the rain process respectively the water used as rain was sampled each rainfall as a blank sample the total runoff volume of both surface and subsurface flow and sampling time was recorded to calculate the absolute runoff a water quality meter ultrameter ii myron l company usa was used to determine ph in the field in the laboratory all samples were filtered by mixed cellulose ester 0 45 μm jiuding gaoke co ltd china under vacuum before storing at 4 c dissolved total n dtn nitrate no3 n and ammonia nh3 n were measured using a segmented continuous flow analyzer futura alliance france total dissolved carbon dc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic were determined using a vario toc analyzer vario toc cube elementar germany dissolved organic carbon doc was calculated by subtraction 2 5 data analysis c n ratio of soils was calculated as tc tn both dc dn and doc nitrate ratio doc no3 of water samples are calculated absolute runoff was calculated using the following equation 1 r v ts where r is runoff modulus m3 s 1 km 2 t is the sampling time s v is the sampling runoff volume ml during the sampling period s is the active plot area m2 dic export load was estimated by eq 2 2 l dic 1000 c c 0 d s s where ldic

factor analysis of variance anova was employed to detect the difference of dc dic doc dn no3 n and nh4 n between different rainfall intensities all statistical analyses were performed using spss 21 0

cm had lowest sic in soil profile at three sites except for subsoil 20 50 cm at sw cn ratio of other soils varied within 11 28 16 17 particle size analysis showed that different depth layers contain non uniform soil particles clay particles showed a decreasing trend and sand particles showed an increasing trend with soil depth increase at sw and htp while an inverse trend is true at cq table 1 soil below 10 cm at sw contains some cracked gravel from dolomite rock weathering which contributes to a considerable large bulk density and much of sand particles 3 2 absolute runoff discharge and ph there was no surface runoff yield when the rainfall intensity was below 30 mm h the absolute runoff was correlated with rainfall intensity with the exception of surface flow at cq and subsurface flow at htp fig 3 the runoff discharge of surface and subsurface flow were opposite at cq compared to the htp plots fig 3 subsurface flow increased sharply and was positively correlated with rainfall intensity at sw and cq in comparison subsurface flow at htp was much lower and showed no difference between different rainfall intensities surface runoff depth was largest at htp and smallest at cq htp sw cq p 0 05 when rainfall intensity exceeded 70 mm h 1 subsurface runoff was greatest at cq and least at htp cq sw htp p 0 05 the lag time tl between commencing rainfall and runoff starting decreased while rainfall increased in intensity fig 3 tl of both surface and subsurface runoff was 5 min when rainfall intensity was 45 mm h and greater at htp at sw and cq tls were significantly bigger than that at htp when rainfall intensity was varied from 45 mm h to 90 mm h surface and subsurface flow ph showed a decreasing trend during rainfall when rainfall intensity was greater than 45 mm h surface runoff ph showed no significant difference but the order of subsurface runoff ph from low to high was cq sw htp p 0 05 fig 4 runoff ph ranged from 8 0 to 10 0 with the exception of the subsurface flow at htp during an initial rainfall intensity of 30 mm h 1 fig 4b runoff ph significantly decreased with increasing rainfall intensity at sw and htp when rainfall intensity was less than 70 mm h 1 p 0 05 however there was no significant trend when rainfall intensity exceeded 70 mm h 1 which may be attributed to a dilution effect the ph of simulated rain water at sw cq and htp did not differ widely and was 7 73 7 45 and 7 64 respectively 3 3 runoff c content and the correlation with ph dic was the dominant form of dc in all water samples as doc was generally below 5 0 mg l dic was above 25 0 mg l except that in subsurface runoff at htp at sw and cq plots dc and dic concentrations in both surface and subsurface flow were significantly greater than that in rainfall p 0 01 fig 5 one way anova analysis showed significant differences in dic under different rainfall intensities rainfall intensity had little influence on dic concentrations in surface flows in sw and cq plots whilst at htp plots dic concentrations in surface flow decreased significantly fig 6 a although dic concentrations showed no trend under different rainfall intensities c loss load demonstrated significant correlations with the amounts of rainfall fig 6b therefore it is runoff discharge that dominates c loss runoff ph at sw and cq plots showed a range from 8 3 to 8 9 while the plots at htp had a larger range from 8 3 to 9 8 fig 7 runoff ph always increased compared to rainfall ph simultaneously dic content in runoff increased compared with rainfall apart from subsurface runoff at htp overall dic contents in subsurface runoff were significantly lower than in surface runoff p 0 05 at sw p 0 01 at cq and htp fig 7 3 4 runoff n content and coefficient of c n stoichiometry nitrate no3 n was the dominant form of n leaching in soil and nh4 n output concentration in runoff was low 0 2 mg l 1 fig 8 a during rainfall no3 n concentration showed a decreasing trend with the exception of subsurface flow at htp overall no3 n concentration in runoff significantly increased compared to rainfall at all three sites p 0 01 at sw and cq p 0 05 at htp with the increase in rainfall intensity no3 n significantly decreased at cq and htp p 0 05 fig 8b which mainly due to dilution and n leaching from soil dc dn at sw and cq plots were significantly higher than htp p 0 01 fig 9 at htp plots there was more dc in surface flow than subsurface flow dc dn was increased in runoff compared to rain at sw fig 9 the increased dc dn further indicated that more c was exported from the plots than n dc may be absorbed by the deep soil during water percolation at htp because that surface and subsurface flow samples lay either side of the rainfall dc dn fig 9 generally dc dn in surface runoff was increased compared with subsurface runoff at certain ph at sw and htp doc no3 was smaller than dc dn at all plots doc no3 was around 1 1 line at sw and cq while the ratios at htp were lower than 1 1 line except one point fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 runoff distribution on karst slope is different from non karst at sw and cq most of the runoff consisted of subsurface runoff compared to htp where the majority of runoff consisted of surface runoff the porous karst topography allows a high rate of infiltration and a rapid water movement through the underground conduit network an empirical unary power function performed well on fitting of correlation between soil bulk density and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity which is known as a quantitative expression of soil ability to transmit water under a given hydraulic gradient ferrer julià et al 2004 soil bulk density indicates as great variability in soil profile at karst slopes in this study table 1 which made it unavailable to predict soil saturated hydraulic conductivity surface runoff trigger patterns could generally be classified as saturation excess runoff infiltration excess runoff or a mixture of both ford and william 2007 generally saturation excess runoff occurs primarily in the hillslopes but infiltration excess runoff in the depression of karst areas in southwest china fu et al 2015b surface soil layer and soil rock interface were two critical control factors subsurface runoff at sw and cq could be seen as a soil rock interfacial flow when infiltrated water reached to soil rock interface epi karst it aggregated and generated interfacial flow which was then gathered by the underground catchment groove this could be the dominant way of subsurface runoff which is similar to a karst spring at htp water could percolate down to deeper soil or saturated zone as there was no rock barrier at the 60 cm depth remaining water exuded from soil and flowed into underground catchment groove accordingly subsurface runoff at htp was much less than at the other two sites which suggests that karst slopes can change the rainfall reallocation and cause large amount of water discharged from subsurface 4 2 dic in runoff is a source of c sink in the karst zone dic influences water ph within a certain range according to eq 3 dic is mainly present as hco3 at ph of 8 3 and co3 2 concentration will raise if the ph is over 8 4 in water dic in runoff may be the main factor of inducing the ph increase compared to rainwater dic in surface runoff was more than in subsurface runoff while the sic content in topsoil was not the largest in soil profile table 1 at sw and cq both surface runoff and subsurface runoff bring out net dic from the slope soil at htp where subsurface runoff was minor and dic in subsurface runoff was less than in rainwater dic immobilized by soil when water percolated downwards and showed a net absorption status by soil karst rock weathering expressed in eqs 3 5 is an important character of karst dynamics system jiang and yuan 1999 ford and william 2007 yuan and zhang 2008 eqs 4 and 5 show limestone and dolomite rock weathering mechanism respectively 3 hco 3 h h 2 o co 3 2 4 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2 hco 3 5 camg co 3 2 2 co 2 2 h 2 o ca 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 both rock weathering and soil erosion can cause large amount of c to be dissolved into water and this may alter co2 fluxes exchanged with the atmosphere yue et al 2016 carbonate rock weathering is regarded as a strong way of sequestrating c from the atmosphere liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 song et al 2017b both dic concentrations in runoff at sw and cq increased showed an initial source of c in karst surface and subsurface water system whereas dic in subsurface runoff decreased at htp may indicate that soil had an immobilization of c in runoff which might attribute to relatively low c content in soil at htp despite many studies have also propose that carbonate weathering may not lead to a stable c sink larson 2011 curl 2012 groves et al 2012 abundant evidences have proofed that the final destination of the product hco3 in water may be assimilated by aquatic organisms liu et al 2010 de montety et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2013 photosynthetic uptake of dic by aquatic organisms and sedimentation of biological residue make up the so called biological pump liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2013 demonstrated biogeochemical processes such as co2 production photosynthesis and respiration have a non negligible influence on karst c cycle by monitoring dic no3 and δ13c in karst pool water during daytime and nighttime separately the diel biogeochemical cycles on carbonate equilibrium in ichetucknee karst system demonstrated that subaquatic plant metabolism and associated carbonate precipitation limited dissolved carbon export and thus constitute a natural sink of carbon de montety et al 2011 and at watershed scale khadka et al 2014 found that lower catchment underlain by carbonate rocks liberate less co2 to the atmosphere than the upper catchment underlain by confining siliciclastic sediments of santa fe river located in northcentral florida usa therefore high content dic in karst water is known as an effective c sink and the dic export from karst slopes is the source of dic in runoff or karst underground rivers the high level of dic in runoff without significant decrease during the 5 times simulated rainfall at two karst sites may imply a rapid response of equilibrium in soil solution it is only need several hours for calcite attaining dissolution equilibrium at an open system with 0 03 vol in atmosphere of co2 or 1 vol co2 in soil merkel and planer friedrich 2005 therefore the rapid kinetic of karst dissolution is expected to make a constant supplement of dic in runoff karst kinetics of carbonate dissolution coupled with the aquatic photosynthetic dic uptake potentially contribute about 94 of the global carbon weathering sink liu and zhao 2000 liu et al 2011 4 3 c n ratio in runoff reveals a decoupling characteristic different with c that have a constant source from carbonate rock weathering n have a definite source from precipitation in the karst area of southwest china though c n ratios were larger than 11 0 in all soils dc dn ratios in runoff were smaller than 9 0 generally and both surface and subsurface runoff had larger dc dn ratios than blank dc dn ratios in rainwater at sw and cq and this also true for surface runoff at htp fig 9 doc no3 ratios in runoff were close to 1 1 at sw and cq and were generally smaller than 1 1 at htp it means that dic played a dominate role on c n in karst runoff carbon sequestrated by karst water mainly owe to dic in karst streams and rivers and in particular the underground river jiang et al 2013 based on the coupling relationships between c n and water gao et al 2012 suggest a healthy threshold for carbon storage in the ecosystem and due to the negative feedback mechanism carbon sequestration may have negative impacts on forest ecosystem health wang and cao 2011 afforestation projects in china at arid and semiarid regions consumed too much water and then reduced vegetation cover conversely wang and cao 2011 in our case large amount of c loss with subsurface runoff may have potential ecosystem risks other nutrients n and p dissolved in runoff also have a substantial loss from karst ecosystem and that may be concealed by c n loss heavily through transporting with surface and subsurface runoff at karst area no3 concentration in conduit fed spring should decrease during storm flow because of dilution by the storm water vesper et al 2001 which is also demonstrated by our results but there was no significant decreasing trend of dic with rainfall intensity increasing at all slopes fig 6a previous study have evaluated the annual n loss from karst soil in china as 1 05 1 67 tg n year 1 during 1951 to 2014 song et al 2017a without consideration of n loss accompany with runoff wang et al 2016a b suggested rock outcrops could redistribute water and organic carbon and nutrients include n to nearby soil patches in karst area in china in their estimation the amount of water received by soil patches is exposed as twice as much precipitation when the outcrop rock reaches 70 of the surface wang et al 2016a such a heavy water input to soil patches may result in a large amount of runoff and nutrients loss which will greatly reduce the availability of the water and nutrient from rock outcrops to soil patches sun et al 2018 miao et al 2016 2015 4 4 potential impacts of acid rain to karst ecosystem in china in subtropical zone in china acid precipitation consisted of dissolved sulfur dioxide so2 and nitrogen oxides nox has a significant impacts of carbonate rock weathering chen et al 2012a b according to eqs 6 and 7 hco3 was released heavily without c sequestration from atmosphere in other words acid precipitation will greatly stimulate carbonate weathering yan et al 2011 li et al 2014 6 ca 1 x mg x co 3 hno 3 1 x ca 2 xmg 2 no 3 hco 3 7 2 ca 1 x mg x co 3 h 2 so 4 1 x ca 2 2 xmg 2 so 2 4 2 hco 3 enhanced n deposition and inappropriate chemical n fertilizer in southwestern china liu et al 2013 liang et al 2005 may aggravate carbonate weathering han et al 2011 noted that rainfall ph ranges from 4 1 to 7 2 with a mean ph value of 4 9 in guiyang china acid rainfall may cause a serious imbalance on the fragile karst ecosystem soil respiration soil microbial biomass and litter decomposition rates were significantly decreased by the simulated acid rain treatments at a monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest at dinghushan in southern china wu et al 2016 in consideration of neutralization such an effect of acid precipitation may cause serious carbonate rock weathering and then aggravate disorder of karst ecosystem 5 conclusions karst slopes are not only eroded by rainfall or runoff but also output potential unstable coupling with the dominant subsurface runoff subsurface runoff at karst slopes is the dominant discharge way of rainfall and is much more than that at non karst slopes soil surface and soil rock interface are the crucial boundaries control the rain reallocation carbonate rock weathering and c and n leaching into subsurface runoff which may break up the balance of natural ecosystem due to the long term physical process if the quality of downstream water exceed the ecological niche of some specific organisms further hydrologic characteristics and model needs to be figured out for forecasting underlying risk carbonate rock weathering and constant n loss may induce substantial imbalance of karst ecosystem and the thresholds or equilibration of the terrestrial water c and n needs to consider in consideration of n limitation and n leaching the appropriate timing and amount of fertilizer needs prudent evaluation on agricultural activity in the end the potential risk may be underestimated without considering acid precipitation on karst ecosystem in southwest china declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

6509,transportation of carbon and nitrogen during rainfall events is highly important within karst ecosystems and has particular relevance to understand decoupling relation between carbon and nitrogen cycles the ability of the karst ecosystem to sequester carbon is currently unknown but has potential to be an important residual terrestrial carbon sink we hypothesis that the runoff response to rainfall events will vary according to whether the slope belongs to karst area and carbon and nitrogen have imbalanced outputs response to runoff hence a series of in situ simulated rainfall experiments at three sites two karst slopes with different carbonate matrixes and one non karst slope without a carbonate matrix were conducted in a typical karst zone in southwest china we measured runoff discharge and dissolved carbon and nitrogen during the experiments the results show that the total runoff discharge increased positively with rainfall intensity with the carbonate matrix making an important contribution to rainfall reallocation the dissolved carbon loss from runoff plots is much higher than the dissolved nitrogen with the dissolved c n revealing the decoupling relation of carbon and nitrogen cycles in this critical karst zone this initial carbon migrated by runoff at catchment scale is critical to carbon budgets in rivers furthermore nitrogen leaching from the system is crucial as a nitrogen shortage at karst area in southwest china keywords dissolved carbon nitrogen transport simulated rainfall karst 1 introduction carbonate terrains that include karst ecosystems

dissolution falkowski et al 2000 khadka et al 2014 liu et al 2010 gao et al 2016 karst areas in southwest china cover 5 4 105 km2 and are mainly distributed in four provinces yunnan guizhou sichuan and guangxi and the direct controlled municipality of chongqing karst landscapes are defined by distinctive hydrology and landforms that arise from a combination of high rock solubility and well developed secondary porosity fracture ford and william 2007 rainfall reallocation and runoff yield patterns thus show distinct differences between karst and non karst landscapes peng and wang 2012

unsaturated zone in karst comprises the soil the epikarst zone and the transmission zone williams 2008 surface runoff is usually a minor component of the hydrological cycle accounting for 5 of precipitation losses from karst hillslopes due to high secondary porosity in unsaturated zone williams 2008 gregory et al 2009 chen et al 2012a b peng and wang 2012 the kinetics of dissolution and precipitation reactions of carbonate minerals are distinct features of karst systems merkel and planer friedrich 2005 ford and william 2007 the co3 2 co2 h2o mixed system could effectively uptake co2 form atmospheric making understanding carbon cycling in karst watersheds more challenging than in siliciclastic systems khadka et al 2014 song et al 2017b carbonate and silicate catchments are significantly different with respect to the transport of dissolved c and co2degassing from water outflows and indicates that carbonate terrains may mitigate terrestrial c losses to the atmosphere khadka et al 2014 subsurface flows often emerge as karst springs due to the unique landform and shallow soils the interface of soil and rock referred to the epikarst zone is defined as the uppermost layer of carbonate rock which is vulnerable to chemical or physical erosion bicalhoet al 2012 fu et al 2015a we thus expect to find characteristics of c and nutrient e g nitrogen n migration and

a conceptual framework with respect to c storage in terrestrial ecosystems gao et al 2012 2013 coupling relationships in karst ecosystems are relatively sensitive to change compared to other terrestrial ecosystems marin et al 2015 gao et al 2018 2019 the majority of research in chinese karst systems has focused on soil loss and erosion and nutrient loss using laboratory experiments dai et al 2015 in situ rainfall simulation experiments by contrast could provide data on the ecosystem processes in the karst critical zone yang et al 2012 found a dilution effect on ph under high intensity rainfall but an increase in soil co2 and considered co2 and rainfall as major factors of the hydrochemical variations in the epikarst zone quantitative study on both c and n loss from soil coupling with runoff especially subsurface runoff is difficult but significant to ecosystem stability the abundant carbonate of the parent rocks could significantly influence c and n migration and ph of runoff wang et al 2016a b furthermore the interactions between rainfall recharge and karst soils could be more intense than other ecosystems because the unconfined aquifers in eogenetic carbonate rocks and soils have a high aquifer matrix porosity that expedites water flow overall we hypothesis that the runoff response to rainfall events will vary according to whether the slope belongs to karst area and the decoupling relation of carbon and nitrogen response to runoff in this paper we investigate how c n stoichiometry and ph changes of both surface and subsurface runoff change under in different rainfall conditions using rainfall simulations in karst and non karst regions of southwest china we consider the results in relation to ecological restoration and potential threats to the karst

across the three sites a minimum interval of 24 h between each rain event was set at each individual plot 2 3 soil properties measurements cutting rings with volume of 100 cm2 diameter of 50 46 mm

samples 100 ml of surface and subsurface runoff were collected during the rainfall simulation the first eight samples were collected at intervals between 1 and 3 min after runoff yielding and last two samples were collected every 3 min after the rain stopped total surface and subsurface runoff samples were collected by two buckets and then sampled the same as runoff sample during the rain process respectively the water used as rain was sampled each rainfall as a blank sample the total runoff volume of both surface and subsurface flow and sampling time was recorded to calculate the absolute

cm had lowest sic in soil profile at three sites except for subsoil 20 50 cm at sw cn ratio of other soils varied within 11 28 16 17 particle size analysis showed that different depth layers contain non uniform soil particles clay particles showed a decreasing trend and sand particles showed an increasing trend with soil depth increase at sw and htp while an inverse trend is true at cq table 1 soil below 10 cm at sw contains some cracked gravel from dolomite rock weathering which contributes to a considerable large bulk density and much of sand particles 3 2 absolute runoff discharge and ph there was no surface runoff yield when the rainfall intensity was below 30 mm h the absolute runoff was correlated with rainfall intensity with the exception of surface flow at cq and subsurface flow at htp fig 3 the runoff discharge of surface and subsurface flow were opposite at cq compared to the htp plots fig 3 subsurface flow increased sharply and was positively correlated with rainfall intensity at sw and cq in comparison subsurface flow at htp was much lower and showed no difference between different rainfall intensities surface runoff depth was largest at htp and smallest at cq htp sw cq p 0 05 when rainfall intensity exceeded 70 mm h 1 subsurface runoff was greatest at cq and least at htp cq sw htp p 0 05 the lag time tl between commencing rainfall and runoff starting decreased while rainfall increased in intensity fig 3 tl of both surface and subsurface runoff was 5 min when rainfall intensity was 45 mm h and greater at htp at sw and cq tls were significantly bigger than that at htp when rainfall intensity was varied from 45 mm h to 90 mm h surface and subsurface flow ph showed a decreasing trend during rainfall when rainfall intensity was greater than 45 mm h surface runoff ph showed no significant difference but the order of subsurface runoff ph from low to high was cq sw htp p 0 05 fig 4 runoff ph ranged from 8 0 to 10 0 with the exception of the subsurface flow at htp during an initial rainfall intensity of 30 mm h 1 fig 4b runoff ph significantly decreased with increasing rainfall intensity at sw and htp when rainfall intensity was less than 70 mm h 1 p 0 05 however there was no significant trend when rainfall intensity exceeded 70 mm h 1 which may be attributed to a dilution effect the ph of simulated rain water at sw cq and htp did not differ widely and was 7 73 7 45 and 7 64 respectively 3 3 runoff c content and the correlation with ph dic was the dominant form of dc in all water samples as doc was generally below 5 0 mg l dic was above 25 0 mg l except that in subsurface runoff at htp at sw and cq plots dc and dic concentrations in both surface and subsurface flow were significantly greater than that in rainfall p 0 01 fig 5 one way anova analysis showed significant differences in dic under different rainfall intensities rainfall intensity had little influence on dic concentrations in surface flows in sw and cq plots whilst at htp plots dic concentrations in surface flow decreased significantly fig 6 a although dic concentrations showed no trend under different rainfall intensities c loss load demonstrated significant correlations with the amounts of rainfall fig 6b therefore it is runoff discharge that dominates c loss runoff ph at sw and cq plots showed a range from 8 3 to 8 9 while the plots at htp had a larger range from 8 3 to 9 8 fig 7 runoff ph always increased compared to rainfall ph simultaneously dic content in runoff increased compared with rainfall apart from subsurface runoff at htp overall dic contents in subsurface runoff were significantly lower than in surface runoff p 0 05 at sw p 0 01 at cq and htp fig 7 3 4 runoff n content and coefficient of c n stoichiometry nitrate no3 n was the dominant form of n leaching in soil and nh4 n output concentration in runoff was low 0 2 mg l 1 fig 8 a during rainfall no3 n concentration showed a decreasing trend with the exception of subsurface flow at htp overall no3 n concentration in runoff significantly increased compared to rainfall at all three sites p 0 01 at sw and cq p 0 05 at htp with the increase in rainfall intensity no3 n significantly decreased at cq and htp p 0 05 fig 8b which mainly due to dilution and n leaching from soil dc dn at sw and cq plots were significantly higher than htp p 0 01 fig 9 at htp plots there was more dc in surface flow than subsurface flow dc dn was increased in runoff compared to rain at sw fig 9 the increased dc dn further indicated that more c was exported from the plots than n dc may be absorbed by the deep soil during water percolation at htp because that surface and subsurface flow samples lay either side of the rainfall dc dn fig 9 generally dc dn in surface runoff was increased compared with subsurface runoff at certain ph at sw and htp doc no3 was smaller than dc dn at all plots doc no3 was around 1 1 line at sw and cq while the ratios at htp were lower than 1 1 line except one point fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 runoff distribution on karst slope is different from non karst at sw and cq most of the runoff consisted of subsurface runoff compared to htp where the majority of runoff consisted of surface runoff the porous karst topography allows a high rate of infiltration and a rapid water movement through the underground conduit network an empirical unary power function performed well on fitting of correlation between soil bulk density and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity which is known as a quantitative expression of soil ability to transmit water under a given hydraulic gradient ferrer julià et al 2004 soil bulk density indicates as great variability in soil profile at karst slopes in this study table 1 which made it unavailable to predict soil saturated hydraulic conductivity surface runoff trigger patterns could generally be classified as saturation excess runoff infiltration excess runoff or a mixture of both ford and william 2007 generally saturation excess runoff occurs primarily in the hillslopes but infiltration excess runoff in the depression of karst areas in southwest china fu et al 2015b surface soil layer and soil rock interface were two critical control factors subsurface runoff at sw and cq could be seen as a soil rock interfacial flow when infiltrated water reached to soil rock interface epi karst it aggregated and generated interfacial flow which was then gathered by the underground catchment groove this could be the dominant way of subsurface runoff which is similar to a karst spring at htp water could percolate down to deeper soil or saturated zone as there was no rock barrier at the 60 cm depth remaining water exuded from soil and flowed into underground catchment groove accordingly subsurface runoff at htp was much less than at the other two sites which suggests that karst slopes can change the rainfall reallocation and cause large amount of water discharged from subsurface 4 2 dic in runoff is a source of c sink in the karst zone dic influences water ph within a certain range according to eq 3 dic is mainly present as hco3 at ph of 8 3 and co3 2 concentration will raise if the ph is over 8 4 in water dic in runoff may be the main factor of inducing the ph increase compared to rainwater dic in surface runoff was more than in subsurface runoff while the sic content in topsoil was not the largest in soil profile table 1 at sw and cq both surface runoff and subsurface runoff bring out net dic from the slope soil at htp where subsurface runoff was minor and dic in subsurface runoff was less than in rainwater dic immobilized by soil when water percolated downwards and showed a net absorption status by soil karst rock weathering expressed in eqs 3 5 is an important character of karst dynamics system jiang and yuan 1999 ford and william 2007 yuan and zhang 2008 eqs 4 and 5 show limestone and dolomite rock weathering mechanism respectively 3 hco 3 h h 2 o co 3 2 4 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2 hco 3 5 camg co 3 2 2 co 2 2 h 2 o ca 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 both rock weathering and soil erosion can cause large amount of c to be dissolved into water and this may alter co2 fluxes exchanged with the atmosphere yue et al 2016 carbonate rock weathering is regarded as a strong way of sequestrating c from the atmosphere liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 song et al 2017b both dic concentrations in runoff at sw and cq increased showed an initial source of c in karst surface and subsurface water system whereas dic in subsurface runoff decreased at htp may indicate that soil had an immobilization of c in runoff which might attribute to relatively low c content in soil at htp despite many studies have also propose that carbonate weathering may not lead to a stable c sink larson 2011 curl 2012 groves et al 2012 abundant evidences have proofed that the final destination of the product hco3 in water may be assimilated by aquatic organisms liu et al 2010 de montety et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2013 photosynthetic uptake of dic by aquatic organisms and sedimentation of biological residue make up the so called biological pump liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2013 demonstrated biogeochemical processes such as co2 production photosynthesis and respiration have a non negligible influence on karst c cycle by monitoring dic no3 and δ13c in karst pool water during daytime and nighttime separately the diel biogeochemical cycles on carbonate equilibrium in ichetucknee karst system demonstrated that subaquatic plant metabolism and associated carbonate precipitation limited dissolved carbon export and thus constitute a natural sink of carbon de montety et al 2011 and at watershed scale khadka et al 2014 found that lower catchment underlain by carbonate rocks liberate less co2 to the atmosphere than the upper catchment underlain by confining siliciclastic sediments of santa fe river located in northcentral florida usa therefore high content dic in karst water is known as an effective c sink and the dic export from karst slopes is the source of dic in runoff or karst underground rivers the high level of dic in runoff without significant decrease during the 5 times simulated rainfall at two karst sites may imply a rapid response of equilibrium in soil solution it is only need several hours for calcite attaining dissolution equilibrium at an open system with 0 03 vol in atmosphere of co2 or 1 vol co2 in soil merkel and planer friedrich 2005 therefore the rapid kinetic of karst dissolution is expected to make a constant supplement of dic in runoff karst kinetics of carbonate dissolution coupled with the aquatic photosynthetic dic uptake potentially contribute about 94 of the global carbon weathering sink liu and zhao 2000 liu et al 2011 4 3 c n ratio in runoff reveals a decoupling characteristic different with c that have a constant source from carbonate rock weathering n have a definite source from precipitation in the karst area of southwest china though c n ratios were larger than 11 0 in all soils dc dn ratios in runoff were smaller than 9 0 generally and both surface and subsurface runoff had larger dc dn ratios than blank dc dn ratios in rainwater at sw and cq and this also true for surface runoff at htp fig 9 doc no3 ratios in runoff were close to 1 1 at sw and cq and were generally smaller than 1 1 at htp it means that dic played a dominate role on c n in karst runoff carbon sequestrated by karst water mainly owe to dic in karst streams and rivers and in particular the underground river jiang et al 2013 based on the coupling relationships between c n and water gao et al 2012 suggest a healthy threshold for carbon storage in the ecosystem and due to the negative feedback mechanism carbon sequestration may have negative impacts on forest ecosystem health wang and cao 2011 afforestation projects in china at arid and semiarid regions consumed too much water and then reduced vegetation cover conversely wang and cao 2011 in our case large amount of c loss with subsurface runoff may have potential ecosystem risks other nutrients n and p dissolved in runoff also have a substantial loss from karst ecosystem and that may be concealed by c n loss heavily through transporting with surface and subsurface runoff at karst area no3 concentration in conduit fed spring should decrease during storm flow because of dilution by the storm water vesper et al 2001 which is also demonstrated by our results but there was no significant decreasing trend of dic with rainfall intensity increasing at all slopes fig 6a previous study have evaluated the annual n loss from karst soil in china as 1 05 1 67 tg n year 1 during 1951 to 2014 song et al 2017a without consideration of n loss accompany with runoff wang et al 2016a b suggested rock outcrops could redistribute water and organic carbon and nutrients include n to nearby soil patches in karst area in china in their estimation the amount of water received by soil patches is exposed as twice as much precipitation when the outcrop rock reaches 70 of the surface wang et al 2016a such a heavy water input to soil patches may result in a large amount of runoff and nutrients loss which will greatly reduce the availability of the water and nutrient from rock outcrops to soil patches sun et al 2018 miao et al 2016 2015 4 4 potential impacts of acid rain to karst ecosystem in china in subtropical zone in china acid precipitation consisted of dissolved sulfur dioxide so2 and nitrogen oxides nox has a significant impacts of carbonate rock weathering chen et al 2012a b according to eqs 6 and 7 hco3 was released heavily without c sequestration from atmosphere in other words acid precipitation will greatly stimulate carbonate weathering yan et al 2011 li et al 2014 6 ca 1 x mg x co 3 hno 3 1 x ca 2 xmg 2 no 3 hco 3 7 2 ca 1 x mg x co 3 h 2 so 4 1 x ca 2 2 xmg 2 so 2 4 2 hco 3 enhanced n deposition and inappropriate chemical n fertilizer in southwestern china liu et al 2013 liang et al 2005 may aggravate carbonate weathering han et al 2011 noted that rainfall ph ranges from 4 1 to 7 2 with a mean ph value of 4 9 in guiyang china acid rainfall may cause a serious imbalance on the fragile karst ecosystem soil respiration soil microbial biomass and litter decomposition rates were significantly decreased by the simulated acid rain treatments at a monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest at dinghushan in southern china wu et al 2016 in consideration of neutralization such an effect of acid precipitation may cause serious carbonate rock weathering and then aggravate disorder of karst ecosystem 5 conclusions karst slopes are not only eroded by rainfall or runoff but also output potential unstable coupling with the dominant subsurface runoff subsurface runoff at karst slopes is the dominant discharge way of rainfall and is much more than that at non karst slopes soil surface and soil rock interface are the crucial boundaries control the rain reallocation carbonate rock weathering and c and n leaching into subsurface runoff which may break up the balance of natural ecosystem due to the long term physical process if the quality of downstream water exceed the ecological niche of some specific organisms further hydrologic characteristics and model needs to be figured out for forecasting underlying risk carbonate rock weathering and constant n loss may induce substantial imbalance of karst ecosystem and the thresholds or equilibration of the terrestrial water c and n needs to consider in consideration of n limitation and n leaching the appropriate timing and amount of fertilizer needs prudent evaluation on agricultural activity in the end the potential risk may be underestimated without considering acid precipitation on karst ecosystem in southwest china declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing
