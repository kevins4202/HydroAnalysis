20185,air lubrication adopting repetitive bubble injection was examined in a facility of high speed turbulent channel flow the bulk water velocity in the channel was controlled from 5 0 to 7 0 m s resulting in a channel reynolds number re m 105 and friction reynolds number re τ 103 bubbles were injected with gas flow rates periodically fluctuating at frequencies of 1 0 6 0 hz in the upstream section of the channel in the downstream of the channel a periodic pattern of bubble distributions and a periodic fluctuation of wall shear stress were observed at a frequency coinciding to the frequency of bubble injection measurements of the wall shear stress show that the ratio of the time averaged drag reduction was improved by the repetitive bubble injection relative to the conventional method of continuous bubble injection the largest ratio was obtained at a frequency of 2 0 hz under this condition the ratio of the drag reduction per unit volume of injected gas was almost twice that

turbulent channel flow gas liquid two phase flow void wave abbreviations bdr bubbly drag reduction cbi continuous bubble injection rbi repetitive bubble injection 1 introduction gas injection in turbulent boundary layers for reducing hydrodynamic friction produces highly complex physics of multiphase fluid dynamics because of high reynolds and weber numbers realized in a thin boundary layer in the ship research field gas injection for frictional drag reduction is called air lubrication technology and has long been studied since the first demonstration by mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 for a submergible body murai 2014 summarized previous studies and classified the performance and mechanism of air lubrication technology by bubble size and flow speed this technology is now called bubbly drag reduction bdr in academic papers the generation of gas film like large bubbles reduces most frictional drag by insulating water flow from the wall gokcay et al 2004 matveev 2007 ceccio 2010 mäkiharju et al 2013 the use of microbubbles results in a high efficiency of drag reduction per unit gas volume by alternating coherent structures in turbulent flows hassan et al 2005 zhen and hassan 2006 murai et al 2008 hara et al 2011 watamura et al 2013 park et al 2019 the implementation of these bdr technologies however requires specific devices for bubble injection i e the stabilization of large bubbles needs cavities along the wall whereas the generation of microbubbles consumes much power in applications of high speed flows simple gas injection through small holes or thin slits arranged on walls generates bubbles of intermediate size i e submillimeter to centimeter bubbles depending on the flow speed and the gas flow rate of the bubble injection sanders et al 2006 kitagawa et al 2019 an important aspect of the practical use of bdr is the net power saving achieved through the bubble injection i e the power saving due to drag reduction considering the power consumed in bubble generation sea trials resulted in a net power saving of 5 for a 120 m long ship kodama et al 2008 and 12 for a 162 m long ship mizokami et al 2010 using gas blowers to inject bubbles to reduce the energy spent in the gas injection kumagai et al 2015 developed a hydrofoil bubble generator sea trials in which this device was installed on an 85 m long ship achieved a net power saving of approximately 10 a recent study on the device demonstrated its effectiveness for long ships under high speed conditions murai et al 2020 note that slow down of the ship speed always brings drag reduction and fuel saving frohnapfel et al 2012 this simple principle is involved in on going projects toward low co2 emission however the longer time spent for shipping adds the operation cost and a solution to reduce drag available for a wide range of flow speed is essential to improve the net power saving the authors group has focused on the enhancement of drag reduction by utilizing the fluctuation of the local void fraction in bubbly flows as illustrated in fig 1 in the conventional method of bdr termed continuous bubble injection cbi bubbles are injected at constant gas flow rates the time averaged drag reduction ratio is thus dealt with as a function of the time averaged bulk void fraction in the flow fig 1 a previous experimental results e g murai et al 2007 park et al 2015 show the existence of a critical void fraction α c for reducing drag at a void fraction lower than α c bubbles rather enhance turbulence which should be avoided in actual application we apply repetitive bubble injection rbi by controlling the gas flow rate of the bubble injection to periodically fluctuate the fluctuation of the instantaneous local void fraction in rbi is considered to induce a transient response of the drag fig 1 b time lag δ lag between peaks of the local void fraction and the local drag reduction and duration of drag reduction δ dr after running out of the local void fraction are predicted to exist in this context the applicability of rbi needs to be compared with that of cbi under various flow conditions much detailed experimental information is available for cbi such as the reductions of the turbulence intensity and reynolds shear stress due to the presence of bubbles e g gabillet et al 2002 kitagawa et al 2005 murai et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 park et al 2016 observed the spontaneous emergence of spatiotemporal fluctuations of the local void fraction termed void waves in bubbly turbulent boundary layers that developed along a flat bottom model ship this observation was theoretically supported with the derivation of a void wave equation from two fluid model equations importantly drag reduction largely increases with the emergence of void waves park et al 2018 the emergence originates from local bubble clustering oishi et al 2019 and the sliding motion of bubbles affected by the wettability of the wall surface kitagawa et al 2019 the wave frequency is therefore naturally given and cannot be controlled on the basis of the above discussion we investigate rbi at a variable frequency providing an additional controllable parameter for bdr technology for a turbulent channel flow at a flow speed lower than 2 m s park et al 2015 confirmed that the time averaged drag reduction ratio obtained by rbi was higher than that obtained with cbi similarly tanaka et al 2020 demonstrated the superiority of rbi over cbi for a flat bottom model ship at flow speeds up to 3 m s the advantage of rbi however has only been confirmed in turbulent flows of relatively low velocity under 3 m s whereas the practical speed of marine vessels is 5 8 m s 10 15 knots this doubling of speed results in quadruple shear stress and half the buoyancy effect on bubbles in the dimensionless parameter space murai 2014 these differences greatly affect the reynolds froude and weber numbers simultaneously in addition to the strouhal number of rbi the flow condition enters the unknown domain in these parameters in the present study the drag reduction due to rbi was experimentally investigated at flow speeds of 5 7 m s for the first time in a horizontal turbulent channel flow it should be noted that the turbulent channel flows have differences between the turbulent boundary layers beneath ships e g the absence of streamwise flow development a thinner boundary layer and a stronger shear stress along the wall surface with understanding these differences bubbly drag reduction has been experimentally investigated using horizontal channel flow facilities to date e g guin et al 1996 kato et al 1999 kodama et al 2000 moriguchi and kato 2002 kitagawa et al 2005 the drag reduction in such bubbly channel flows can be interpreted as a local equilibrium state giving hints to understand the phenomena observed in spatially developing boundary layers e g sanders et al 2006 elbing et al 2008 qin et al 2017 tanaka et al 2020 in the present study a shear stress sensor directly measured the local wall shear stress acting on the top wall of the channel additionally an optical visualization was carried out using a high speed line scanning camera to obtain the distribution of bubbles a series of repetition frequencies of the rbi were examined offering new insight into turbulent boundary layer control using the periodic fluctuation of the local void fraction 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental apparatus experiments were conducted in a facility fig 2 a of the national maritime research institute tokyo japan the facility could achieve a mean flow speed up to 12 m s in its test section of a horizontal channel made of fully transparent acrylic resin the inner dimensions of the channel were a streamwise length of 3 0 m height of 20 mm and width of 100 mm the x y and z coordinates in fig 2 respectively denote the streamwise distance from the inlet of the channel vertical distance from the top wall and spanwise direction a pump circulated tap water as the test fluid in the channel a flow rate meter pressure meter and thermometer were installed after the pump for measurement of the water bubbles were injected at x 1 1 m through a metal plate with 315 holes of 0 5 mm in diameter fig 2 b air was supplied to a buffer chamber fixed on the metal plate from a compressor through a pressure regulator gas tank and isothermal chamber a pulsatile gas flow rate control system developed by tokyo gas cooperation takeuchi and kagawa 2013 was used the control system comprised a gas thermometer two pressure sensors an electromagnetic valve and a gas flow meter this system could regulate both constant gas flow rates and periodically fluctuating gas flow rates up to 20 hz in repetition frequency in the present experiments the periodic fluctuations imposed by the system had sinusoidal waveforms as shown in fig 3 the instantaneous minimum flow rate was set to zero and the instantaneous maximum flow rate was double the time averaged gas flow rate q g the injected bubbles were removed from the test fluid in a tank placed at the end of the test section although velocity profiles of the liquid phase and bubbles were not measured in the present experiments we can refer to the results of experiments conducted by kitagawa et al 2005 where cbi was examined in high speed 5 0 m s turbulent flows in the same facility as used for the present experiments 2 2 experimental conditions the side view observation of the channel revealed that bubbles in the channel concentrated near the upper wall immediately after the position of bubble injection x 1 1 m see fig 2 b the bubbles then dispersed vertically depending on liquid turbulence during their downstream migration snapshots of the bubbly channel flow at x 2 0 m in front of the measurement region with various mean flow speeds are shown in fig 4 at the lowest speed fig 4 a injected bubbles advected in the upper region such that the bottom border of the bubbly layer was located around the center of the channel at mid range speeds fig 4 b and c the bubbly layer widened toward the bottom wall finally the bubbly layer occupied the whole height of the channel at a speed higher than 8 m s fig 4 d this wholly dispersed state was not targeted in the present experiments because it is regarded as internal two phase flow different from the geometry of bdr for ships we thus examined three water flow rates i e q l 1 0 10 2 1 2 10 2 and 1 4 10 2 m3 s corresponding to bulk velocities of 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 m s respectively the experiments were conducted for six conditions of q g for each condition of q l the ranges of q g are listed in table 1 the water and gas flow rates determine the superficial velocity and volumetric ratio of air to the total mixture 1 u q l q g h w 2 α q g q l q g where h and w are respectively the height and width of the channel α is used in this paper as the estimation of the bulk void fraction because the velocities of water and bubbles are approximately the same in high speed turbulent channel flows kitagawa et al 2005 the water flow rate was kept constant owing to its limited controllability regardless of the variation in the gas flow rate resulting in a change in u of several percent with increasing α the superficial velocity gives the reynolds number according to 3 r e m u h ν l where ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the water at the experimental temperature which ranged from 21 9 to 27 7 c for each combination of re m and α the repetition frequency f was set from 1 0 to 6 0 hz the following strouhal number is defined as the dimensionless frequency of rbi as a reference 4 s t f h u which ranged from 0 3 10 2 to 2 3 10 2 the instantaneous water flow rate gas flow rate and other quantities were simultaneously recorded by a multi channel data logger at a sampling rate of 100 hz the time averages of these values were calculated for a period of 60 s i e averages were taken over 6000 data points 2 3 measurement techniques a line scanning camera xcm20125gig nippon electro sensory devices co ltd japan was installed at x 2 7 m to observe the bubble distribution in the channel the camera captured images of 1 1024 pixels for 1 9 s at a frame rate of 5 2 mhz the pixel array was set parallel to the spanwise direction of the channel and had a spatial resolution of 0 11 mm pixel the local wall shear stress was directly measured using a shear stress sensor s10w 2s capacity of 250 n m2 ssk co ltd japan attached on the upper wall of the channel at x 2 1 m the sensor was a mechanical force gauge with a 10 mm diameter sensing plate and had a temporal resolution of 20 hz we calibrated the shear stress data using measurements of the water temperature and water flow rate and a formula of the wall shear stress for single phase flow 5 τ 0 c f0 1 2 ρ l u 2 where ρ l and c f 0 are respectively the water density and friction coefficient the friction coefficient of a single phase turbulent channel flow in a fully developed state was predicted using dean s empirical law 6 c f0 0 073 r e m 1 4 the time averaged values of the measured water temperature and flow rate gave corresponding ρ l u and re m an appropriate offset of the sensor signal for the calibration was then evaluated using the difference between the raw measurement results of the shear stress and τ 0 calculated from eqs 5 and 6 in the calibration of the wall shear stress the estimated measurement error was 11 17 for the liquid single phase flows for bubbly flows the appropriate offset was determined by the mean value of the offsets in single phase flow measurements carried out immediately before and after each bubbly flow measurement using the wall shear stress after the calibration τ the time averaged drag reduction ratio was defined as 7 d r 1 τ τ 0 where τ is the time averaged wall shear stress τ 0 was calculated using eqs 5 and 6 and u of the bubbly flow to consider the increment of the wall shear stress due to acceleration of the liquid phase by bubble injection equation 7 thus assumes the same velocity between the liquid single phase flow and the bubbly flow to evaluate the drag reduction since τ is normalized by τ 0 in eq 7 the influence of the prediction employing eq 6 is cancelled out for the evaluation of the drag reduction performance the wall shear stress in the single phase flows was measured more than 50 times for individual re m to validate the reproducibility of the sensor signal the standard deviation of the time averaged shear stress after the calibration was less than 1 among the repeated trials in the single phase flows the friction reynolds number 8 r e τ h 2 ν l τ 0 ρ ranged from 2 5 103 to 3 4 103 depending on the water flow rate 3 measurements of cbi as reference data drag reduction by the rbi was evaluated in comparison with cbi in the present study in advance of the experiments on rbi cbi expressed as f 0 with the same re m and α as for the rbi was examined a sample of timeline images obtained in the cbi is shown in fig 5 a bubbles appear as white areas owing to light reflection from a light emitting diode panel mounted on the upstream side of the camera see fig 2 a fig 5 b is an enlarged image of fig 5 a around the spanwise center of the channel the bubble shapes can be clearly recognized by their bright outlines owing to the sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution of the camera because each bubble passed the scanning line of the camera in less than 0 5 ms as shown in fig 5 b interfaces of the individual bubbles are a little blurred as an indicator of the bubble size the mean spanwise width of bubbles d z was measured for 100 randomly selected samples in the images the mean width was around 1 0 mm and it slightly decreased with re m as shown in fig 6 sanders et al 2006 proposed the maximum stable bubble size d max in a turbulent flow 9 d max σ 2 ρ l 3 5 κ y u τ 3 2 5 where σ and κ are the interfacial tension and von kármán constant the good correspondence of d z and d max is shown by dashed lines in fig 6 where y 8 0 mm is used in eq 9 the bubble size is seen to be naturally determined by fragmentation and coalescence in the turbulent flows the cbi resulted in dr 0 for all conditions of re m and α as shown in fig 7 to compare the drag reduction ratio between the present experiments and previous studies we summarize reports of bdr using horizontal channels and flat plates in table 2 here representative results for bubble sizes similar to those of the present bubbles were selected the present results are confirmed to be reasonable with some previous studies obtaining greater values of dr owing to differences in experimental conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 relationship between fluctuation of the void fraction and fluctuation of the wall shear stress representative examples of timeline images captured by the high speed line scanning camera are shown in fig 8 for the conditions of re m 1 4 105 and α 3 4 periodic patterns of the bubble distribution comprising several large bubble crowds are observed in the images the images confirm that the bubble size in the rbi is independent of the repetition frequency f and almost the same as that in the cbi the timeline images were processed by thresholding to detect areas of the gas phase for each instantaneous spanwise frame we calculated the gas area ratio as the projection void fraction β in the central 89 pixels which corresponds to the downstream location of the sensing plate of the sensor waveforms of β are shown in fig 9 a the waveforms at f 1 0 and 2 0 hz fluctuate from zero to unity owing to the clearly separated bubble crowds fig 8 a and b linear spectra of β were acquired by fourier transform of the time series of approximately 105 data points using the rectangular window and shown in fig 9 b in each spectrum the highest peak appears at the control frequency of the rbi f indicated by a triangular symbol the maximum intensity at the peak i β max denotes the amplitude of the original waveform at the frequency f i β max is confirmed to vary depending on f we also see the development of a harmonic component i e 2f see fig 9 b for all rbi i β max is presented in fig 10 the dependence of i β max on f is similar among all re m in that i β max intensifies around f 2 0 hz and becomes lowest at f 4 0 hz we confirmed by the same analysis of the cbi that i β max at f 4 0 hz is equal to or a little larger than i β max in the cbi conversely even the intermediate i β max occurring at f 3 0 5 0 and 6 0 hz indicates the inducement of the strong fluctuation of the void fraction by the rbi i β max becomes large with increasing α at re m 1 1 105 while no such tendency is found at other re m at re m 1 4 105 and 1 7 105 there is a prominent development of a harmonic component instead the fluctuation of the void fraction induces the fluctuation of the wall shear stress τ as shown in fig 11 a the periodicity of the fluctuation holds regularly at f 1 0 3 0 hz resulting in clear peaks at the frequency identical to f in the linear spectra as shown in fig 11 b at f 4 0 6 0 hz the periodicity irregularly disappears owing to the occasional abatement of fluctuation as circled in fig 11 a in the absence of periodicity bubble distributions are supposed to be scattered by turbulent dispersion at a high repetition frequency however the linear spectra of the wall shear stress still have clear peaks at a frequency coinciding with the repetition frequency f the maximum intensity in the spectra i τ max indicates the amplitude of the original waveform at the controlled frequency of the rbi because the largest peak appears at f as shown in fig 12 i τ max at the same f increases with α at re m 1 1 105 and 1 4 105 while it is almost constant against α at re m 1 7 105 at re m 1 7 105 a harmonic component in the spectra tends to develop instead the intensity i τ max increases around f 2 0 hz and becomes small at f 4 0 hz for all re m as shown in fig 12 relating to a similar dependence of i β max on f the relationship between i β max and i τ max for different conditions of re m and α is shown in fig 13 fig 13 a indicates i τ max increases depending on i β max at re m 1 1 105 oishi et al 2020 experimentally observed temporal correlation of projection void fraction and local wall shear stress in bubbly channel flows this knowledge supports the increase of i τ max with i β max found in fig 13 a at re m 1 4 105 and 1 7 105 the correlation between i β max and i τ max decreases at the same f as shown in fig 13 b and c a comparison of conditions resulting in the lowest i β max and highest i β max i e f 4 0 6 0 hz and f 2 0 hz respectively reveals that i τ max increases with i β max a larger fluctuation of the wall shear stress is induced by generating larger fluctuation of the temporal void fraction in the present high speed turbulent channel flows as previously mentioned either or both of i β max and i τ max is constant against α at re m 1 4 105 and 1 7 105 owing to the prominent development of the hormonic components the non linear effect of gas liquid two phase turbulent flows can induce the development though it hardly showed simple dependence on the experimental parameters re m α and f further detailed investigation of the bubbly flow is needed to clarify the correlation between the fluctuation of the void fraction and the fluctuation of the wall shear stress 4 2 promotion of drag reduction by rbi the time averaged drag reduction ratio dr of the rbi under different conditions of re m α and f is shown in fig 14 at re m 1 4 105 fig 14 b a maximum drag reduction of 12 is obtained the drag reduction increases with α as in the case of cbi see fig 7 the dependence of dr on α is attributed to the reasons commonly discussed in previous studies on cbi e g ceccio 2010 murai 2014 moreover the repetition frequency of the rbi affects dr the drag reduction becomes largest at f 2 0 hz and smallest at f 4 0 hz we find that dr fig 14 b and i τ max fig 12 b have the similar dependence on f at f 1 0 4 0 hz at f 5 0 and 6 0 hz however dr increases with the repetition frequency though i τ max decreases at re m 1 1 105 the same dependence of dr on α and f is found as shown in fig 14 a although the variation in dr with f is unclear at the lowest value of α 1 3 it becomes prominent with increasing α at the highest flow speed i e re m 1 7 105 the dependence of dr on f is similar to that for the lower re m when α 4 4 5 2 while dr intensifies at f 4 0 hz when α 5 4 as shown in fig 14 c moreover the increase in dr with α is small especially at f 1 0 3 0 hz we evaluate the promotion of drag reduction due to rbi compared with cbi at the same re m and α 10 δ d r r e m α f d r r e m α f d r r e m α 0 as shown in fig 15 the maximum δdr obtained at re m α f 1 4 105 3 4 2 0 hz is 5 2 this value is comparable to the base dr due to cbi therefore the drag reduction ratio is nearly doubled by rbi under this condition the authors group park et al 2015 reported the similar superiority of the rbi in terms of the drag reduction ratio in turbulent channel flows but at lower velocities this previous experiment clarified the promotion of drag reduction by periodic passage of bubbles was higher than the repetitive blowing of liquid into the channel flow in the present experiment δdr decreases with increasing α at re m 1 7 105 and it is less sensitive to α at re m 1 1 105 and 1 4 105 this indicates the disappearance of the effect that promotes drag reduction under the conditions of lower re m a reason for the disappearance of the effect is the difference in the vertical bubble distribution in the channel flows the bubbly layer of the rbi periodically becomes thicker than that of the cbi see fig 4 which is associated with the fluctuating gas flow rate and it periodically reaches the bottom wall at re m 1 7 105 as xu et al 2002 found in their numerical study on cbi the spatial evolution of the void fraction distribution largely contributes to the enhancement of the drag reduction this suggests that the confinement of the wavy advecting bubbly layer by the bottom wall depresses the promotion of the drag reduction by the rbi the mechanism of bdr is explained by two factors the modification of turbulence and the decrease in mean fluid density α represents the effect of the drag reduction originating from the latter factor to clarify the contribution of the turbulence modification by the rbi we evaluate the friction coefficient c f expressed as 11 c f 2 τ 1 α ρ l u 2 the minimum values of c f among different conditions of f at common re m and α are shown in fig 16 a as the optimal result of the rbi where c f of the cbi is also plotted for comparison the decrease in c f due to the rbi clearly denotes the stronger depression of turbulence relative to the cbi as common results of the cbi and rbi c f c f0 linearly decreases indicating intensification of the effect of the turbulence modification with increasing α at the same re m at re m 1 1 105 and 1 4 105 the slope of c f c f0 against α appears similar for the cbi and rbi at re m 1 7 105 however the slope is more gradual for the rbi and c f for the rbi likely becomes equivalent to that for the cbi at higher α the discrepancy in c f c f0 between the cbi and rbi at common re m and α is largest at re m 1 4 105 the discrepancy is small at re m 1 1 105 and decreases with α at re m 1 7 105 owing to the difference in slope the results of c f indicate that there is an optimal re m at which the effect of turbulence modification by rbi is intensified in the turbulent channel flow we evaluate the efficiency of the drag reduction per unit gas volume using a gain factor murai 2014 as the sensitivity to the void fraction 12 g d r α the largest values of g among the common re m and α conditions are shown in fig 16 b g is obviously increased by the rbi compared with the cbi under all re m and α conditions at re m 1 4 105 especially g for the rbi is twice that for the cbi this clearly shows the improvement in the efficiency of drag reduction when adopting rbi 4 3 discussion of the optimal frequency of rbi the present results show that the optimal frequency f opt of the rbi for promoting drag reduction is 2 0 hz for common re m and α the corresponding strouhal number st is less than 1 0 10 2 this indicates that the time scale of the optimal rbi is considerably larger than the inertia time scale of the channel flow simply defined by h u we infer that there is another factor determining f opt and discuss the possible candidates in this section the void wave equation derived by park et al 2016 indicates that the drag reduction correlates to the development of the spatial distribution of the local void fraction this supports the correspondence of f opt and the frequency where i β max was intensified see fig 10 in previous experiments on rbi conducted by tanaka et al 2020 the fluctuation of the local void fraction was found to persist for a long distance at repetition frequencies lower than the frequency of the spontaneously emerging void waves in cbi from these results we deduce that f opt is related to the spontaneous frequency in cbi the spontaneous frequency f s falls into frequencies of several flow instabilities as discussed by park et al 2018 the frequency of the gravity wave due to the vertical density stratification of dρ dy is estimated as 13 f s 1 2 π 1 ρ d ρ d y g 1 2 π α g h where h is the half height of the channel under the present experimental conditions the frequency of the gravity wave is 0 5 hz f s 1 2 hz this range is on the same order as f opt 2 0 hz however gravity waves hardly arise in the present high speed flows where the froude number 14 f r u g h is larger than 15 as the next candidate the richardson wave is known to emerge even in such high froude number flow through the existence of a diffused density interface in shear flows the upper limit of the frequency of the richardson wave in bubbly flow is estimated as 15 f s max v δ u h where v and δ are respectively the mean fluid velocity of bubbly flows and the thickness of the density interface park et al 2018 in the case of the present channel flows f s max is 500 700 hz and the frequency range of the richardson wave covers f opt another factor possibly determining the optimal frequency is the streamwise length required for the redevelopment of the turbulent channel flow after the passage of bubble swarms on the basis of the hydraulic entrance length of duct flow mccomas 1967 fully development of turbulent flows requires a streamwise distance λ which is approximately scaled as 16 λ h c f0 λ can be used also to roughly estimate the streamwise redevelopment length of the channel flow i e the recovery distance so called λ has a corresponding frequency 17 f λ u λ here u is selected for the velocity scale as a primary bulk quantity of the channel flow alternatively the velocity might be replaced with the flow speed of a point around 10 wall units from the wall if universal log law stands however the law would not stand for unsteady bubbly two phase boundary layer in the present experiments f λ is approximately 2 5 hz say f λ f opt on the basis of this correspondence of frequencies the optimal drag reduction due to rbi is deduced by the relationship between the instantaneous local void fraction and instantaneous drag reduction ratio at a stationary position as illustrated in fig 17 once a bubble swarm passes i e the local void fraction increases the drag reduction effect continues for a duration 1 f opt 1 f λ before the next passage of the bubble swarms at f f opt the successive bubble swarm arrive at the expiration of the drag reduction induced by the passage of the former bubble swarm fig 17 a at f f opt however the next swarm passes after the expiration of the drag reduction yielding a period in which there is no drag reduction fig 17 b this clearly decreases the time averaged drag reduction ratio relative to the case of f f opt in the case that f f opt the frequent passage of bubble swarms entirely alternates the flow fig 17 c and the flow does not recover to the single phase turbulent state anywhere in the channel the wall shear stress loses the expected transient response to the local void fraction see fig 1 b resulting in a drag reduction analogous to that of the cbi this leads to a higher time averaged drag reduction ratio at f f opt compared with f f opt for the same α because the level of turbulence suppression during passage of a bubble swarm depends on f the exact recovery distance may vary with f simultaneously drag reduction by the swarm of bubbles elongates the recovery distance thus finding the theoretical optimal frequency is a matter of two way interaction to be further investigated 5 conclusions we investigated the drag reduction due to rbi in high speed horizontal turbulent channel flows with water velocity of 5 7 m s corresponding to re m 1 1 105 1 7 105 the size of bubbles was approximately 1 0 mm the bubbles were injected into the channel flow with periodically fluctuating gas flow rates in the rbi the bubble distribution in the channel was visualized using a line scanning camera the periodicity in the temporal variation of the projection void fraction calculated from the sequential images was confirmed to coincide with the repetition frequency of the bubble injection the wall shear stress acting on the top wall of the channel was directly measured using a shear stress sensor the rbi induced the periodic fluctuation of the wall shear stress at a frequency identical to the repetition frequency the time averaged drag reduction ratio was increased by applying the rbi compared with the conventional cbi at the same estimated bulk void fraction in the channel flow we found that the rbi at a repetition frequency of 2 0 hz tended to promote the drag reduction most effectively and at most doubled the drag reduction ratio relative to the cbi in terms of the promotion of drag reduction the friction coefficient was lower than that of the cbi indicating the stronger depression of turbulence owing to the decrease in the wall friction coefficient the efficiency of the drag reduction per unit gas volume improved especially at re m 1 4 105 the high efficiency of drag reduction due to rbi was demonstrated in the high speed turbulent flows we introduced several factors determining the optimal frequency of rbi the frequency based on the recovery length of turbulent channel flows was judged the most attributable to the experimental results of the optimal frequency i e 2 0 hz the

20185,air lubrication adopting repetitive bubble injection was examined in a facility of high speed turbulent channel flow the bulk water velocity in the channel was controlled from 5 0 to 7 0 m s resulting in a channel reynolds number re m 105 and friction reynolds number re τ 103 bubbles were injected with gas flow rates periodically fluctuating at frequencies of 1 0 6 0 hz in the upstream section of the channel in the downstream of the channel a periodic pattern of bubble distributions and a periodic fluctuation of wall shear stress were observed at a frequency coinciding to the frequency of bubble injection measurements of the wall shear stress show that the ratio of the time averaged drag reduction was improved by the repetitive bubble injection relative to the conventional method of continuous bubble injection the largest ratio was obtained at a frequency of 2 0 hz under this condition the ratio of the drag reduction per unit volume of injected gas was almost twice that

turbulent boundary layers for reducing hydrodynamic friction produces highly complex physics of multiphase fluid dynamics because of high reynolds and weber numbers realized in a thin boundary layer in the ship research field gas injection for frictional drag reduction is called air lubrication technology and has long been studied since the first demonstration by mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 for a submergible body murai 2014 summarized previous studies and classified the performance and mechanism of air lubrication technology by bubble size and flow speed this technology is now called bubbly drag reduction bdr in academic papers the generation of gas film like large bubbles reduces most frictional drag by insulating water flow from the wall gokcay et al 2004 matveev 2007 ceccio 2010 mäkiharju et al 2013 the use of microbubbles results in a high efficiency of drag reduction per unit gas volume by alternating coherent structures in turbulent flows hassan et al 2005 zhen and hassan 2006 murai et al 2008 hara et al 2011 watamura et al 2013 park et al 2019 the implementation of these bdr technologies however requires specific devices for bubble injection i e the stabilization of large bubbles needs cavities along the wall whereas the generation of microbubbles consumes much power in applications of high speed flows simple gas injection through small holes or thin slits arranged on walls generates bubbles of intermediate size i e submillimeter to centimeter bubbles depending on the flow speed and the gas flow rate of the bubble injection sanders et al 2006 kitagawa et al 2019 an important aspect of the practical use of bdr is the net power saving achieved through the bubble injection i e the power saving due to drag reduction considering the power consumed in bubble generation sea trials resulted in a net power saving of 5 for a 120 m long ship kodama et al 2008 and 12 for a 162 m long ship mizokami et al 2010 using gas blowers to inject bubbles to reduce the energy spent in the gas injection kumagai et al 2015 developed a hydrofoil bubble generator sea trials in which this device was installed on an 85 m long ship achieved a net power saving of approximately 10 a recent study on the device demonstrated its effectiveness for long ships under high speed conditions murai et al 2020 note that slow down of the ship speed always brings drag reduction and fuel saving frohnapfel et al 2012 this simple principle is involved in on going projects toward low co2 emission however the longer time spent for shipping adds the operation cost and a solution to reduce drag available for a wide range of flow speed is essential to improve the net power saving the authors group has focused on the enhancement of drag reduction by utilizing the fluctuation of the local void fraction in bubbly flows as illustrated in fig 1 in the conventional method of bdr termed continuous bubble injection cbi bubbles are injected at constant gas flow rates the time averaged drag reduction ratio is thus dealt with as a function of the time averaged bulk void fraction in the flow fig 1 a previous experimental results e g murai et al 2007 park et al 2015 show the existence of a critical void fraction α c for reducing drag at a void fraction lower than α c bubbles rather enhance turbulence which should be avoided in actual application we apply repetitive bubble injection rbi by controlling the gas flow rate of the bubble injection to periodically fluctuate the fluctuation of the instantaneous local void fraction in rbi is considered to induce a transient response of the drag fig 1 b time lag δ lag between peaks of the local void fraction and the local drag reduction and duration of drag reduction δ dr after running out of the local void fraction are predicted to exist in this context the applicability of rbi needs to be compared with that of cbi under various flow conditions much detailed experimental information is available for cbi such as the reductions of the turbulence intensity and reynolds shear stress due to the presence of bubbles e g gabillet et al 2002 kitagawa et al 2005 murai et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 park et al 2016 observed the spontaneous emergence of spatiotemporal fluctuations of the local void fraction termed void waves in bubbly turbulent boundary layers that developed along a flat bottom model ship this observation was theoretically supported with the derivation of a void wave equation from two fluid model equations importantly drag reduction largely increases with the emergence of void waves park et al 2018 the emergence originates from local bubble clustering oishi et al 2019 and the sliding motion of bubbles affected by the wettability of the wall surface kitagawa et al 2019 the wave frequency is therefore naturally given and cannot be controlled on the basis of the above discussion we investigate rbi at a variable frequency providing an additional controllable parameter for bdr technology for a turbulent channel flow at a flow speed lower than 2 m s park et al 2015 confirmed that the time averaged drag reduction ratio obtained by rbi was higher than that obtained with cbi similarly tanaka et al 2020 demonstrated the superiority of rbi over cbi for a flat bottom model ship at flow speeds up to 3 m s the advantage of rbi however has only been confirmed in turbulent flows of relatively low velocity under 3 m s whereas the practical speed of marine vessels is 5 8 m s 10 15 knots this doubling of speed results in quadruple shear stress and half the buoyancy effect on bubbles in the dimensionless parameter space murai 2014 these differences greatly affect the reynolds froude and weber numbers simultaneously in addition to the strouhal number of rbi the flow condition enters the unknown domain in these parameters in the present study the drag reduction due to rbi was experimentally investigated at flow speeds of 5 7 m s for the first time in a horizontal turbulent channel flow it should be noted that the turbulent channel flows have differences between the turbulent boundary layers beneath ships e g the absence of streamwise flow development a thinner boundary layer and a stronger shear stress along the wall surface with understanding these differences bubbly drag reduction has been experimentally investigated using horizontal channel flow facilities to date e g guin et al 1996 kato et al 1999 kodama et al 2000 moriguchi and kato 2002 kitagawa et al 2005 the drag reduction in such bubbly channel flows can be interpreted as a local equilibrium state giving hints to understand the phenomena observed in spatially developing boundary layers e g sanders et al 2006 elbing et al 2008 qin et al 2017 tanaka et al 2020 in the present study a shear stress sensor directly measured the local wall shear stress acting on the top wall of the channel additionally an optical visualization was carried out using a high speed line scanning camera to obtain the distribution of bubbles a series of repetition frequencies of the rbi were examined offering new insight into turbulent boundary layer control using the periodic fluctuation of the local void fraction 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental apparatus experiments were conducted in a facility fig 2 a of the national maritime research institute tokyo japan the facility could achieve a mean flow speed up to 12 m s in its test section of a horizontal channel made of fully transparent acrylic resin the inner dimensions of the channel were a streamwise length of 3 0 m height of 20 mm and width of 100 mm the x y and z coordinates in fig 2 respectively denote the streamwise distance from the inlet of the channel vertical distance from the top wall and spanwise direction a pump circulated tap water as the test fluid in the channel a flow rate meter pressure meter and thermometer were installed after the pump for measurement of the water bubbles were injected at x 1 1 m through a metal plate with 315 holes of 0 5 mm in diameter fig 2 b air was supplied to a buffer chamber fixed on the metal plate from a compressor through a pressure regulator gas tank and isothermal chamber a pulsatile gas flow rate control system developed by tokyo gas cooperation takeuchi and kagawa 2013 was used the control system comprised a gas thermometer two pressure sensors an electromagnetic valve and a gas flow meter this system could regulate both constant gas flow rates and periodically fluctuating gas flow rates up to 20 hz in repetition frequency in the present experiments the periodic fluctuations imposed by the system had sinusoidal waveforms as shown in fig 3 the instantaneous minimum flow rate was set to zero and the instantaneous maximum flow rate was double the time averaged gas flow rate q g the injected bubbles were removed from the test fluid in a tank placed at the end of the test section although velocity profiles of the liquid phase and bubbles were not measured in the present experiments we can refer to the results of experiments conducted by kitagawa et al 2005 where cbi was examined in high speed 5 0 m s turbulent flows in the same facility as used for the present experiments 2 2 experimental conditions the side view observation of the channel revealed that bubbles in the channel concentrated near the upper wall immediately after the position of bubble injection x 1 1 m see fig 2 b the bubbles then dispersed vertically depending on liquid turbulence during their downstream migration snapshots of the bubbly channel flow at x 2 0 m in front of the measurement region with various mean flow speeds are shown in fig 4 at the lowest speed fig 4 a injected bubbles advected in the upper region such that the bottom border of the bubbly layer was located around the center of the channel at mid range speeds fig 4 b and c the bubbly layer widened toward the bottom wall finally the bubbly layer occupied the whole height of the channel at a speed higher than 8 m s fig 4 d this wholly dispersed state was not targeted in the present experiments because it is regarded as internal two phase flow different from the geometry of bdr for ships we thus examined three water flow rates i e q l 1 0 10 2 1 2 10 2 and 1 4 10 2 m3 s corresponding to bulk velocities of 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 m s respectively the experiments were conducted for six conditions of q g for each condition of q l the ranges of q g are listed in table 1 the water and gas flow rates determine the superficial velocity and volumetric ratio of air to the total mixture 1 u q l q g h w 2 α q g q l q g where h and w are respectively the height and width of the channel α is used in this paper as the estimation of the bulk void fraction because the velocities of water and bubbles are approximately the same in high speed turbulent channel flows kitagawa et al 2005 the water flow rate was kept constant owing to its limited controllability regardless of the variation in the gas flow rate resulting in a change in u of several percent with increasing α the superficial velocity gives the reynolds number according to 3 r e m u h ν l where ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the water at the experimental temperature which ranged from 21 9 to 27 7 c for each combination of re m and α the repetition frequency f was set from 1 0 to 6 0 hz the following strouhal number is defined as the dimensionless frequency of rbi as a reference 4 s t f h u which ranged from 0 3 10 2 to 2 3 10 2 the instantaneous water flow rate gas flow rate and other quantities were simultaneously recorded by a multi channel data logger at a sampling rate of 100 hz the time averages of these values were calculated for a period of 60 s i e averages were taken over 6000 data points 2 3 measurement techniques a line scanning camera xcm20125gig nippon electro sensory devices co ltd japan was installed at x 2 7 m to observe the bubble distribution in the channel the camera captured images of 1 1024 pixels for 1 9 s at a frame rate of 5 2 mhz the pixel array was set parallel to the spanwise direction of the channel and had a spatial resolution of 0 11 mm pixel the local wall shear stress was directly measured using a shear stress sensor s10w 2s capacity of 250 n m2 ssk co ltd japan attached on the upper wall of the channel at x 2 1 m the sensor was a mechanical force gauge with a 10 mm diameter sensing plate and had a temporal resolution of 20 hz we calibrated the shear stress data using measurements of the water temperature and water flow rate and a formula of the wall shear stress for single phase flow 5 τ 0 c f0 1 2 ρ l u 2 where ρ l and c f 0 are respectively the water density and friction coefficient the friction coefficient of a single phase turbulent channel flow in a fully developed state was predicted using dean s empirical law 6 c f0 0 073 r e m 1 4 the time averaged values of the measured water temperature and flow rate gave corresponding ρ l u and re m an appropriate offset of the sensor signal for the calibration was then evaluated using the difference between the raw measurement results of the shear stress and τ 0 calculated from eqs 5 and 6 in the calibration of the wall shear stress the estimated measurement error was 11 17 for the liquid single phase flows for bubbly flows the appropriate offset was determined by the mean value of the offsets in single phase flow measurements carried out immediately before and after each bubbly flow measurement using the wall shear stress after the calibration τ the time averaged drag reduction ratio was defined as 7 d r 1 τ τ 0 where τ is the time averaged wall shear stress τ 0 was calculated using eqs 5 and 6 and u of the bubbly flow to consider the increment of the wall shear stress due to acceleration of the liquid phase by bubble injection equation 7 thus assumes the same velocity between the liquid single phase flow and the bubbly flow to evaluate the drag reduction since τ is normalized by τ 0 in eq 7 the influence of the prediction employing eq 6 is cancelled out for the evaluation of the drag reduction performance the wall shear stress in the single phase flows was measured more than 50 times for individual re m to validate the reproducibility of the sensor signal the standard deviation of the time averaged shear stress after the calibration was less than 1 among the repeated trials in the single phase flows the friction reynolds number 8 r e τ h 2 ν l τ 0 ρ ranged from 2 5 103 to 3 4 103 depending on the water flow rate 3 measurements of cbi as reference data drag reduction by the rbi was evaluated in comparison with cbi in the present study in advance of the experiments on rbi cbi expressed as f 0 with the same re m and α as for the rbi was examined a sample of timeline images obtained in the cbi is shown in fig 5 a bubbles appear as white areas owing to light reflection from a light emitting diode panel mounted on the upstream side of the camera see fig 2 a fig 5 b is an enlarged image of fig 5 a around the spanwise center of the channel the bubble shapes can be clearly recognized by their bright outlines owing to the sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution of the camera because each bubble passed the scanning line of the camera in less than 0 5 ms as shown in fig 5 b interfaces of the individual bubbles are a little blurred as an indicator of the bubble size the mean spanwise width of bubbles d z was measured for 100 randomly selected samples in the images the mean width was around 1 0 mm and it slightly decreased with re m as shown in fig 6 sanders et al 2006 proposed the maximum stable bubble size d max in a turbulent flow 9 d max σ 2 ρ l 3 5 κ y u τ 3 2 5 where σ and κ are the interfacial tension and von kármán constant the good correspondence of d z and d max is shown by dashed lines in fig 6 where y 8 0 mm is used in eq 9 the bubble size is seen to be naturally determined by fragmentation and coalescence in the turbulent flows the cbi resulted in dr 0 for all conditions of re m and α as shown in fig 7 to compare the drag reduction ratio between the present experiments and previous studies we summarize reports of bdr using horizontal channels and flat plates in table 2 here representative results for bubble sizes similar to those of the present bubbles were selected the present results are confirmed to be reasonable with some previous studies obtaining greater values of dr owing to differences in experimental conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 relationship between fluctuation of the void fraction and fluctuation of the wall shear stress representative examples of timeline images captured by the high speed line scanning camera are shown in fig 8 for the conditions of re m 1 4 105 and α 3 4 periodic patterns of the bubble distribution comprising several large bubble crowds are observed in the images the images confirm that the bubble size in the rbi is independent of the repetition frequency f and almost the same as that in the cbi the timeline images were processed by thresholding to detect areas of the gas phase for each instantaneous spanwise frame we calculated the gas area ratio as the projection void fraction β in the central 89 pixels which corresponds to the downstream location of the sensing plate of the sensor waveforms of β are shown in fig 9 a the waveforms at f 1 0 and 2 0 hz fluctuate from zero to unity owing to the clearly separated bubble crowds fig 8 a and b linear spectra of β were acquired by fourier transform of the time series of approximately 105 data points using the rectangular window and shown in fig 9 b in each spectrum the highest peak appears at the control frequency of the rbi f indicated by a triangular symbol the maximum intensity at the peak i β max denotes the amplitude of the original waveform at the frequency f i β max is confirmed to vary depending on f we also see the development of a harmonic component i e 2f see fig 9 b for all rbi i β max is presented in fig 10 the dependence of i β max on f is similar among all re m in that i β max intensifies around f 2 0 hz and becomes lowest at f 4 0 hz we confirmed by the same analysis of the cbi that i β max at f 4 0 hz is equal to or a little larger than i β max in the cbi conversely even the intermediate i β max occurring at f 3 0 5 0 and 6 0 hz indicates the inducement of the strong fluctuation of the void fraction by the rbi i β max becomes large with increasing α at re m 1 1 105 while no such tendency is found at other re m at re m 1 4 105 and 1 7 105 there is a prominent development of a harmonic component instead the fluctuation of the void fraction induces the fluctuation of the wall shear stress τ as shown in fig 11 a the periodicity of the fluctuation holds regularly at f 1 0 3 0 hz resulting in clear peaks at the frequency identical to f in the linear spectra as shown in fig 11 b at f 4 0 6 0 hz the periodicity irregularly disappears owing to the occasional abatement of fluctuation as circled in fig 11 a in the absence of periodicity bubble distributions are supposed to be scattered by turbulent dispersion at a high repetition frequency however the linear spectra of the wall shear stress still have clear peaks at a frequency coinciding with the repetition frequency f the maximum intensity in the spectra i τ max indicates the amplitude of the original waveform at the controlled frequency of the rbi because the largest peak appears at f as shown in fig 12 i τ max at the same f increases with α at re m 1 1 105 and 1 4 105 while it is almost constant against α at re m 1 7 105 at re m 1 7 105 a harmonic component in the spectra tends to develop instead the intensity i τ max increases around f 2 0 hz and becomes small at f 4 0 hz for all re m as shown in fig 12 relating to a similar dependence of i β max on f the relationship between i β max and i τ max for different conditions of re m and α is shown in fig 13 fig 13 a indicates i τ max increases depending on i β max at re m 1 1 105 oishi et al 2020 experimentally observed temporal correlation of projection void fraction and local wall shear stress in bubbly channel flows this knowledge supports the increase of i τ max with i β max found in fig 13 a at re m 1 4 105 and 1 7 105 the correlation between i β max and i τ max decreases at the same f as shown in fig 13 b and c a comparison of conditions resulting in the lowest i β max and highest i β max i e f 4 0 6 0 hz and f 2 0 hz respectively reveals that i τ max increases with i β max a larger fluctuation of the wall shear stress is induced by generating larger fluctuation of the temporal void fraction in the present high speed turbulent channel flows as previously mentioned either or both of i β max and i τ max is constant against α at re m 1 4 105 and 1 7 105 owing to the prominent development of the hormonic components the non linear effect of gas liquid two phase turbulent flows can induce the development though it hardly showed simple dependence on the experimental parameters re m α and f further detailed investigation of the bubbly flow is needed to clarify the correlation between the fluctuation of the void fraction and the fluctuation of the wall shear stress 4 2 promotion of drag reduction by rbi the time averaged drag reduction ratio dr of the rbi under different conditions of re m α and f is shown in fig 14 at re m 1 4 105 fig 14 b a maximum drag reduction of 12 is obtained the drag reduction increases with α as in the case of cbi see fig 7 the dependence of dr on α is attributed to the reasons commonly discussed in previous studies on cbi e g ceccio 2010 murai 2014 moreover the repetition frequency of the rbi affects dr the drag reduction becomes largest at f 2 0 hz and smallest at f 4 0 hz we find that dr fig 14 b and i τ max fig 12 b have the similar dependence on f at f 1 0 4 0 hz at f 5 0 and 6 0 hz however dr increases with the repetition frequency though i τ max decreases at re m 1 1 105 the same dependence of dr on α and f is found as shown in fig 14 a although the variation in dr with f is unclear at the lowest value of α 1 3 it becomes prominent with increasing α at the highest flow speed i e re m 1 7 105 the dependence of dr on f is similar to that for the lower re m when α 4 4 5 2 while dr intensifies at f 4 0 hz when α 5 4 as shown in fig 14 c moreover the increase in dr with α is small especially at f 1 0 3 0 hz we evaluate the promotion of drag reduction due to rbi compared with cbi at the same re m and α 10 δ d r r e m α f d r r e m α f d r r e m α 0 as shown in fig 15 the maximum δdr obtained at re m α f 1 4 105 3 4 2 0 hz is 5 2 this value is comparable to the base dr due to cbi therefore the drag reduction ratio is nearly doubled by rbi under this condition the authors group park et al 2015 reported the similar superiority of the rbi in terms of the drag reduction ratio in turbulent channel flows but at lower velocities this previous experiment clarified the promotion of drag reduction by periodic passage of bubbles was higher than the repetitive blowing of liquid into the channel flow in the present experiment δdr decreases with increasing α at re m 1 7 105 and it is less sensitive to α at re m 1 1 105 and 1 4 105 this indicates the disappearance of the effect that promotes drag reduction under the conditions of lower re m a reason for the disappearance of the effect is the difference in the vertical bubble distribution in the channel flows the bubbly layer of the rbi periodically becomes thicker than that of the cbi see fig 4 which is associated with the fluctuating gas flow rate and it periodically reaches the bottom wall at re m 1 7 105 as xu et al 2002 found in their numerical study on cbi the spatial evolution of the void fraction distribution largely contributes to the enhancement of the drag reduction this suggests that the confinement of the wavy advecting bubbly layer by the bottom wall depresses the promotion of the drag reduction by the rbi the mechanism of bdr is explained by two factors the modification of turbulence and the decrease in mean fluid density α represents the effect of the drag reduction originating from the latter factor to clarify the contribution of the turbulence modification by the rbi we evaluate the friction coefficient c f expressed as 11 c f 2 τ 1 α ρ l u 2 the minimum values of c f among different conditions of f at common re m and α are shown in fig 16 a as the optimal result of the rbi where c f of the cbi is also plotted for comparison the decrease in c f due to the rbi clearly denotes the stronger depression of turbulence relative to the cbi as common results of the cbi and rbi c f c f0 linearly decreases indicating intensification of the effect of the turbulence modification with increasing α at the same re m at re m 1 1 105 and 1 4 105 the slope of c f c f0 against α appears similar for the cbi and rbi at re m 1 7 105 however the slope is more gradual for the rbi and c f for the rbi likely becomes equivalent to that for the cbi at higher α the discrepancy in c f c f0 between the cbi and rbi at common re m and α is largest at re m 1 4 105 the discrepancy is small at re m 1 1 105 and decreases with α at re m 1 7 105 owing to the difference in slope the results of c f indicate that there is an optimal re m at which the effect of turbulence modification by rbi is intensified in the turbulent channel flow we evaluate the efficiency of the drag reduction per unit gas volume using a gain factor murai 2014 as the sensitivity to the void fraction 12 g d r α the largest values of g among the common re m and α conditions are shown in fig 16 b g is obviously increased by the rbi compared with the cbi under all re m and α conditions at re m 1 4 105 especially g for the rbi is twice that for the cbi this clearly shows the improvement in the efficiency of drag reduction when adopting rbi 4 3 discussion of the optimal frequency of rbi the present results show that the optimal frequency f opt of the rbi for promoting drag reduction is 2 0 hz for common re m and α the corresponding strouhal number st is less than 1 0 10 2 this indicates that the time scale of the optimal rbi is considerably larger than the inertia time scale of the channel flow simply defined by h u we infer that there is another factor determining f opt and discuss the possible candidates in this section the void wave equation derived by park et al 2016 indicates that the drag reduction correlates to the development of the spatial distribution of the local void fraction this supports the correspondence of f opt and the frequency where i β max was intensified see fig 10 in previous experiments on rbi conducted by tanaka et al 2020 the fluctuation of the local void fraction was found to persist for a long distance at repetition frequencies lower than the frequency of the spontaneously emerging void waves in cbi from these results we deduce that f opt is related to the spontaneous frequency in cbi the spontaneous frequency f s falls into frequencies of several flow instabilities as discussed by park et al 2018 the frequency of the gravity wave due to the vertical density stratification of dρ dy is estimated as 13 f s 1 2 π 1 ρ d ρ d y g 1 2 π α g h where h is the half height of the channel under the present experimental conditions the frequency of the gravity wave is 0 5 hz f s 1 2 hz this range is on the same order as f opt 2 0 hz however gravity waves hardly arise in the present high speed flows where the froude number 14 f r u g h is larger than 15 as the next candidate the richardson wave is known to emerge even in such high froude number flow through the existence of a diffused density interface in shear flows the upper limit of the frequency of the richardson wave in bubbly flow is estimated as 15 f s max v δ u h where v and δ are respectively the mean fluid velocity of bubbly flows and the thickness of the density interface park et al 2018 in the case of the present channel flows f s max is 500 700 hz and the frequency range of the richardson wave covers f opt another factor possibly determining the optimal frequency is the streamwise length required for the redevelopment of the turbulent channel flow after the passage of bubble swarms on the basis of the hydraulic entrance length of duct flow mccomas 1967 fully development of turbulent flows requires a streamwise distance λ which is approximately scaled as 16 λ h c f0 λ can be used also to roughly estimate the streamwise redevelopment length of the channel flow i e the recovery distance so called λ has a corresponding frequency 17 f λ u λ here u is selected for the velocity scale as a primary bulk quantity of the channel flow alternatively the velocity might be replaced with the flow speed of a point around 10 wall units from the wall if universal log law stands however the law would not stand for unsteady bubbly two phase boundary layer in the present experiments f λ is approximately 2 5 hz say f λ f opt on the basis of this correspondence of frequencies the optimal drag reduction due to rbi is deduced by the relationship between the instantaneous local void fraction and instantaneous drag reduction ratio at a stationary position as illustrated in fig 17 once a bubble swarm passes i e the local void fraction increases the drag reduction effect continues for a duration 1 f opt 1 f λ before the next passage of the bubble swarms at f f opt the successive bubble swarm arrive at the expiration of the drag reduction induced by the passage of the former bubble swarm fig 17 a at f f opt however the next swarm passes after the expiration of the drag reduction yielding a period in which there is no drag reduction fig 17 b this clearly decreases the time averaged drag reduction ratio relative to the case of f f opt in the case that f f opt the frequent passage of bubble swarms entirely alternates the flow fig 17 c and the flow does not recover to the single phase turbulent state anywhere in the channel the wall shear stress loses the expected transient response to the local void fraction see fig 1 b resulting in a drag reduction analogous to that of the cbi this leads to a higher time averaged drag reduction ratio at f f opt compared with f f opt for the same α because the level of turbulence suppression during passage of a bubble swarm depends on f the exact recovery distance may vary with f simultaneously drag reduction by the swarm of bubbles elongates the recovery distance thus finding the theoretical optimal frequency is a matter of two way interaction to be further investigated 5 conclusions we investigated the drag reduction due to rbi in high speed horizontal turbulent channel flows with water velocity of 5 7 m s corresponding to re m 1 1 105 1 7 105 the size of bubbles was approximately 1 0 mm the bubbles were injected into the channel flow with periodically fluctuating gas flow rates in the rbi the bubble distribution in the channel was visualized using a line scanning camera the periodicity in the temporal variation of the projection void fraction calculated from the sequential images was confirmed to coincide with the repetition frequency of the bubble injection the wall shear stress acting on the top wall of the channel was directly measured using a shear stress sensor the rbi induced the periodic fluctuation of the wall shear stress at a frequency identical to the repetition frequency the time averaged drag reduction ratio was increased by applying the rbi compared with the conventional cbi at the same estimated bulk void fraction in the channel flow we found that the rbi at a repetition frequency of 2 0 hz tended to promote the drag reduction most effectively and at most doubled the drag reduction ratio relative to the cbi in terms of the promotion of drag reduction the friction coefficient was lower than that of the cbi indicating the stronger depression of turbulence owing to the decrease in the wall friction coefficient the efficiency of the drag reduction per unit gas volume improved especially at re m 1 4 105 the high efficiency of drag reduction due to rbi was demonstrated in the high speed turbulent flows we introduced several factors determining the optimal frequency of rbi the frequency based on the recovery length of turbulent channel flows was judged the most attributable to the experimental results of the optimal frequency i e 2 0 hz the

engineering of sft hasn t been carried out on account of safety and stability concerns induced by all kinds of environmental loading excitations it is reported that 85 of the total amount of earthquakes on earth happen in the sea duan and wang yyue 2010 the three areas that are potential to build sft in china are the bohai strait the qiongzhou strait and the taiwan strait which are all in the circumpacific seismic belt therefore the study for the seismic behavior of sft becomes one of the hottest topics in academia and industry it is noted that the sft that placed in earthquake prone areas may be simultaneously subjected to not only earthquake action but also wave current action what s more the effect of seaquake is much more complex which can induce hydrodynamic pressures acting on the offshore structure and complicated coupling interaction between earthquake and wave current chen et al 2012 lee et al 2016 wu and mei 2017 therefore to guarantee the safety and stability of sft during its whole lifetime it is urgent need to study and understand the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current so far some researches on sft subjected to independent earthquake action or subjected to independent wave current action has been conducted in the respect of independent wave current action chen et al 2018 proposed a theoretical approach to make coupled vibration analysis of sft tube cable system subjected to combined parametric excitation and wave current action wu and mei 2017 studied the dynamic response of cable of submerged floating tunnel subjected to random wave force through the pseudo excitation method chen et al 2021 studied the nonlinear interaction between the moored sft and surface wave action through a presented numerical model jin et al 2020 established a full time domain two dimensional numerical model for the coupled dynamic analysis for wave action on a tension leg type sft in time domain li et al 2018 experimentally studied the pressure characteristic of sft subjected to wave force excitation with various section forms yang et al 2020 studied the 2d motion characteristics of sft in wave loads in an experimental way deng et al 2020 experimentally studied the vortex induced vibration of a twin tube submerged floating tunnel segment model in steady current action in the respect of independent earthquake action martinelli et al 2011 investigated the multi support seismic response for sft anchored by cables through a proposed innovative numerical model chen et al 2012 experimentally and numerically investigated seismic response of sft with underwater shaking table test and finite element model su and sun 2013 proposed a mathematical equation for vibration of sft tether subjected to the effects of earthquake and parametric excitation dong and li 2016 utilized the theory of elastic foundation beam to establish the dynamic equations of sft tube subjected to earthquake action lee et al 2016 studied the dynamic behavior of a sft with a rectangular cross section subjected to earthquake action in a relative accurate numerical way in the respect of combined earthquake and wave current actions due to the great difficulty to simulate the combined action for earthquake and wave current in experiment and numerical calculation only a few studies have been reported wu and mei 2017 utilized modified morison s equation to formulate the hydrodynamic force induced by earthquake excitation and investigated the vibration response of sft cable subjected to simultaneous hydrodynamic force and earthquake excitations luo et al 2021 utilized the stokes wave theory and trigonometric series method to calculate the wave load and earthquake and adopted the d alembert principle to establish the tube tether model of sft subjected to the wave earthquake action to investigate the dynamic response of sft subject to the coupled action of earthquakes and waves xie and chen 2021 presented a new mathematical model for analyzing the dynamic response of sft canyon water system subjected to earthquakes and potential current actions while considered the transmission effect of canyon water to the original horizontal seismic wave input overall the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave current action was rarely studied the existed researches were focused on theoretical and numerical studies in these studies to solve the complicated interaction between water and sft subjected to combined actions of earthquake and wave current many assumptions were introduced which neglected the accuracy of numerical calculation and validity of their calculations still need to be verified by shaking table test up to now no experimental researches which thoroughly investigate the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current have been reported the underwater shaking table test is widely recognized as the most effective method to investigate the dynamic behavior of underwater structures subjected to earthquake which can reproduce earthquake excitations to achieve the earthquake actions as to simulate practical situation and provide experimental verification for theoretical and numerical studies the experimental investigation for the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave current action is conducted in this study in this study the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake wave and current is experimentally investigated based on the wave current flume and a specially designed underwater shaking device a physical scaled model experiment of sft for studying the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current is presented three important judge rules are introduced to verify the reliability of the earthquake wave output from the underwater shaking device a comparison between numerical simulations and experimental results is then presented to assess the validity of the proposed test model the influence of key load parameters such as the peak ground acceleration pga and type of single earthquake the wave height current velocity etc and the combination of earthquake wave and current on the dynamic behavior of sft are deeply and thoroughly explored this experiment research has theoretical and engineering importance for the prevention and control hazard of design for the sft located at complicated ocean environment 2 experimental model design 2 1 experimental model set up the experiment is carried out in the wave current flume with its size length width height 30 m 1 5 m 1 5 m a push board wave maker is used to generate the desired incident waves at the one end of the flume a tilt type wave absorber is installed at the other end of the flume to prevent the wave reflection affecting test results the uniform and steady current can be generated and ensured by a large pump a specially designed circulating loop and a porous guide plate set up at the inlet and outlet of the flume in this test before the formal use for the flume through numerous qualitative calibration tests and experimental observations the accuracy of wave generation current generation and wave current interaction of the wave flume can satisfy design requirements and specification standards for hydrodynamic test in the present study the main concern for the test is the influence of combined action of earthquake wave and current on the dynamic behavior of sft the elasticity and gravity similarity laws should be fulfilled in the model design thus the cauchy and froude similarity should be fulfilled concurrently to implement the inertial gravitational and restoring forces simulation in the experiment which is expressed as liu et al 2017 ding et al 2018 1 s e s g s ρ s l in which s e is the elastic modulus scale factor s g is the gravitational acceleration scale factor s ρ is the density scale factor and s l is the geometric scale factor following the existed studies the gravitational acceleration of prototype and model are regarded as equal the eq 1 can be simplified as 2 s e s ρ s l in this experiment a scheme of a sft for crossing funk bay is taken as the prototype based on the dimensions of the wave current flume the scaled segment model of the sft is designed and the scales reaction for various physical quantities are summarized in table 1 detailed sketch of experimental model set up is shown in fig 1 seen in fig 1 a the experimental model consists of wave current flume scaled model tube anchoring cables boundary restrain device underwater shaking device and data acquisition devices the numbers of the cables are named c1 c6 and c1 c3 and c4 c6 are respectively arranged at the upstream and downstream sides of the flume the major parameters of the prototype and physical model of sft are summarized in table 2 it is noted that if the cable interval is strictly consistent for the scale ratio it is hard to install anchorage device thus in the test about 2 cm are reserved for each end of the tube to install anchorage device in the test the pretension of the cable is considered and adjusted accurately for the cable by varying the elongation of turnbuckle to satisfy the requirement for the stability of the original balance of sft and the test objective and based on previous studies jin et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the typical pretension of the each cable of sft is set as 24n in the test 2 2 data acquisition devices and installation as shown in fig 1 b the data acquisition devices used in this test including ⅰ waterproof tensile force gage 6 waterproof tensile force gages are respectively installed at the bottom end of each cable to measure the tension of cables ⅱ waterproof accelerometer 3 waterproof accelerometers are respectively installed at the shaking table the midpoint of upper surface of the tube and the underwater anchor board to measure the acceleration of the structures and are respectively named a1 a3 ⅲ imu inertial measurement unit imu is installed at the barycenter of the tube to measure its rotations roll yaw and pitch ⅳ dic 3d digital image correlation three dimensions dic measurement system is used to measure the displacement of the tube the dic 3d is placed at the exact front of the sft model at the outside of the flume in dic 3d measurement system the ray racing method is applied to obtain the target position from the binocular vision measurements which is a non contacting technique with high precision trajectory measurement for the moving object four circinate trackers are set on the surface of the tube bottom the moving trackers motion characteristics of tube are captured by two cameras the major measuring devices and their parameters are listed in table 3 2 3 underwater shaking device most of the traditional wave current flume can t simulate underwater earthquake let alone to simulate the combined action of earthquake wave and current some of large scale underwater shaking tables that can simulate earthquake wave and current action separately or simultaneously in the same flume has been reported in existed studies chen et al 2012 liu et al 2017 ding et al 2018 however they are very expensive and have lengthy construction cycle that limit their applications in actual test in this study a specially designed underwater shaking device is presented to stimulate the combined action of wave earthquake and wave as shown in fig 1 a and c the underwater shaking device includes three main components ⅰ shaking table on land the shaking table is installed above the flume through a load bearing bracket to generate various earthquake waves by control computer ⅱ rigid brace the rigid brace is used to connect the shaking table and sliding false board to transfer the earthquake excitation from shaking table to underwater sliding false board ⅲ sliding false board the sliding false board is installed in the bottom of the flume and is mainly composed of slide ways sliding blokes and anchored board to simulate underwater earthquake excitation it is worth pointing out that the acceleration consistency between shaking table and sliding false board is the most important control indicator for the underwater shaking device to satisfy this requirement the structural form and stiffness characteristics for the rigid brace are specially designed and the unidirectional slide way is induced to guarantee the false board can only move horizontally while its movements of other degrees of freedom directions are strictly limited to prevent the coupling of multi direction movement of the board 2 4 details of the boundary restraint device the span of a sft is usually up to dozens or even hundreds of kilometers long due to the limitation of dimension of the test flumes and experimentation cost experimental investigations about the dynamic behavior of sft are mainly conducted on segmental model test previous experimental studies seo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 have neglected the restraint condition of both ends of sft and almost set them free in engineering practice the sft tube is fixed to the ground and as xiao and huang 2010 shows boundary conditions have obvious effect on the seismic behavior of sft hence stimulating the boundary conditions for the tube is necessary and important to effectively simulate the boundary condition for the segmental model based on the previous studies deng et al 2020 lin 2016 a numerical tool to link the results between the entire length numerical model and the segment physical model is adopted the boundary constraints simulation of the segment model is described by the following three steps 1 entire length numerical model in abaqus is established based on a scheme of sft as shown in fig 2 the basic parameters for the numerical model are listed in table 2 the tube and cables are respectively modeled with 3d beam element b31 and truss element t3d2 lin et al 2018 xiang et al 2018 the both ends of the tube are simply supported to the ground and the cables are pined to the seabed 2 a boundary constraint simulation method based on spring damper model is proposed to consider the boundary constraint effect for the segment model and its schematic sketch is shown in fig 3 a the horizontal and vertical springs and dampers are used to simulate the translational motion constraint and the relative eccentric installation of the sets of spring damping system can be used to provide restoring moments to simulate the rotation constraint segment numerical model with the present designed boundary constraint is used to veritably reconstitute its motion and stressing state during entire length numerical model the equivalent stiffness and damping fittings are made by the adjustment of stiffness and damping for the springs and dampers and the eccentric distance between the spring damping modules and middle axis of the cross section of the tube 3 the constraint parameters values of stiffness damping and eccentric distance can be obtained by fitting results of step 2 and is implemented in the end of the physical segment model as shown in fig 3 b the boundary constraint device is consisted of four spring damping modules each module is mainly composed of a spring and a damper one end of the module is connected to the tube by the spring and the other end is fixed to one side of frame by the damper through the above three steps the boundary constraint of the physical segment model is simulated in this test combination with theoretical analysis and numerical simulation the typical stiffness of the horizontal and vertical spring is adopted as 30 6 n m 21 6 n m respectively and typical damping of the damper is adopted as 0 045 2 5 test case design to ensure the effectiveness of the test results the input earthquake wave should consider the loading properties and the actual geological conditions of the model in this study an artificial el centro wave an artificial wave generated by utilizing seismic design spectrum mot of china 2008 and sine wave are chosen as typical wave types for further analysis it is noted that if the time scale is abided strictly the time duration of el centro wave is decreased as about 5 s it is difficult to preserve the spectral characteristics for the earthquake wave and the dynamic response for the physical scale model cannot be guaranteed thus the artificial el wave artificial wave and sine wave are artificially lengthened to 300 s in the prototype and decreased to about 26 s in actual test satisfied the similarity requirement figs 4 5 show the acceleration time history curves and corresponding spectrum characteristics of artificial el wave and artificial wave as for fair comparison the concept of equivalent energy density and energy flux xu et al 2014 is introduced to relate the parameters between sine and stochastic wave types in the test the effects of earthquakes waves and current are only considered in the transverse direction of the sft and waves travel with the current in this study the main test conditions are designed i independent earthquake test ⅱ independent wave or current test ⅲ combined earthquake wave and current test the detailed test case descriptions are shown in table 4 3 validity assessment for the present experimental model 3 1 reliability verification for earthquake output of the underwater shaking device to ensure the reliability of the earthquake wave output from the underwater shaking device three important judge rules are introduced to assess the reliability of the earthquake wave output which can be detailed as 1 the consistency of acceleration at each point of the underwater sliding false board it requires that each point on the underwater sliding false board has the same accelerations 2 the consistency of earthquake input and output from underwater shaking device it requires that the input acceleration from the control computer and the output acceleration from the underwater false board should be identical 3 the repeatability of earthquake output from the underwater shaking device it requires that no matter how many times the same acceleration is input the same earthquake acceleration will be output in this study following the above mentioned 3 judge rules the artificial el centro wave and artificial wave are selected the input acceleration from the control computer is compared with that recorded at points 1 2 on the underwater false board and three times records from point 1 to make reliability verification for the underwater shaking device and the results can be seen in figs 6 7 in fig 6 a both the input acceleration from the control computer and the output acceleration from the underwater false board at points 1 2 all increase rapidly at the first 3 s and keep drastically oscillation during 3 20 s then decrease to zero rapidly they have the same curve tendencies and the similar spectrum characteristics the results from fig 6 a indicate that the rules 1 2 are well satisfied fig 6 b shows the output acceleration comparison between three times records from point 1 similarly the amplitude range curve characteristics frequency characteristics from these three accelerations show good consistency with a relative error below 5 the results from fig 6 b indicate that the rule 3 are well satisfied the same verification result of artificial wave also can be obtained from fig 7 a b overall based on the above comparisons it is concluded that the three judge rules that assessed the reliability of the earthquake wave output can be satisfied well thus it is deemed that the earthquake acceleration outputs from the underwater shaking device are valid and reliable 3 2 comparison between numerical and experimental results in order to verify reliability of experimental results the segment numerical model subjected to the same earthquake wave is established by using abaqus program and the comparisons between the numerical results and experimental results are made as shown in figs 8 9 it is noted that the segment numerical model is only 180 m length and has 3 pairs of anchor cables and its two ends are constrained by the present boundary constraints simulation method with springs and damper detailed description can be seen in fig 3 also the relative error results of the free vibration frequency of sft between the results from test model and numerical model is less than 8 besides the dynamic amplification factor daf is introduced to evaluate the influence effect from earthquake excitation which is expressed as xiang et al 2018 3 daf β α α where α is the cable tension in the initial state before the earthquake excitation action and β is the maximum dynamic cable tension when the sft is subjected to earthquake excitation fig 9 a shows the comparison of the time history curves of the tube subjected to artificial el centro wave between the numerical and experimental results fig 9 b c respectively show the comparison of the maximum horizontal acceleration for the tube and parameter daf for cable tension between the numerical and experimental results subjected to different pgas of artificial el centro wave it is obvious that both the trends and the amplitudes of all curves and graphs from numerical and experimental results show a good consistency i e the maximum horizontal acceleration of tube and the daf for cable tension from the two methods are both increased with the increase of the pga of the el centro wave with a relative error within 10 only some small differences are observed from the results of the two methods that is some fluctuations occur in the curves of numerical results after about 20 s and some little gaps occur between the two methods in the graphs comparison these differences may be caused by many factors e g the tube water coupling can t be fully considered in numerical model installation error of physical model and accuracy of sensors overall based on the comparisons the present test model is capable to provide a sufficiently accurate analysis for the dynamic behaviors of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 independent earthquake tests in fig 10 the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube increases with the increase of earthquake pga and the trends of the tube horizontal acceleration time histories are basically identical when subjected to the same kind of earthquake excitation the experimental results are consistent with the study from lee et al 2016 it is indicated that the trend of tube acceleration under the earthquake is mainly affected by the type of earthquake wave and the magnitude of the earthquake increases with the increasement of earthquake pga the amplification ratio of the maximum tube horizontal acceleration to maximum input acceleration subjected to all the three earthquakes varies from 0 05 to 0 15 the result is consistent with previous study chen et al 2012 according to study liu et al 2017 about cable stayed bridge tower subjected to earthquake its acceleration amplification ratio is usually larger than 1 which is almost ten times larger than that with sft with flexible cable support from the results it can be found that earthquake has less effect on the horizontal acceleration of sft tube that with flexible cable support than on the cable stayed bridge tower with pier rigid support and it implies the excellent suppression ability for the sft to earthquake vibration while compared with traditional bridges and tunnel with rigid support in fig 11 it shows the comparison of parameter daf and maximum roll of tube subjected to different earthquake waves with different pgas it can be easily seen that daf and maximum roll of tube distinctly increase with the increase of pga with their ranges varying from 0 025 to 0 25 and 1 8 respectively the parameter daf and maximum roll of tube subjected to sine wave are always larger than those subjected to artificial el centro wave and artificial wave and the gap rapidly increases with the increase of pga daf subjected to the artificial wave is smallest when subjected to low intensity wave while is moderate subjected to comparatively large intensity wave the dynamic variation of sft induced by different earthquakes wave mainly depends on the energy density and spectrum characteristic of the earthquake types fig 12 shows the trends of the cable tension time histories are identical when subjected to the same kind of earthquake excitation and the cable tension increases with the increase of pga different from previous studies on flexible marine structure subjected to earthquake in this test the cable tension time history curves from different pgas all have the similar shape and tendency with the input earthquake wave it implies that in practical engineering the dynamic behavior and the cable tension level of sft subjected to earthquake excitation are mainly related to pga of earthquake the axial stiffness pretension of the cable and the connective stiffness between the cable with tube and the foundation 4 2 independent wave tests in fig 13 the effect of the wave period on the cable tension of c2 cable subjected to independent wave load are studied it can be clearly observed that the cable tension from all the wave periods changes regularly and periodically with the change of time as the increase of the wave period approximately the cable tension firstly increases and then attenuates and two peak values can be observed at the wave periods of 0 9 s and 1 5 s and the maximum cable tension occur at wave period of 1 5 s besides tiny phase differences of the curves with different wave period can be observed in fig 14 a the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube fluctuates irregularly with the increase of wave period and reaches its maximum value 0 085 m s2 and minimum value 0 041 m s2 at the periods of 1 3 s and 0 7 s respectively fig 14 b shows that the maximum roll of the tube tends to decrease firstly and then increase generally with the increase of wave period and reaches its maximum value 3 2 and minimum value 0 41 at the periods of 1 5 s and 0 9 s respectively the results may due to that system resonance could occur in the condition that the wave period approach or are the multiple of the natural period of sft which results in the distinct amplification of the total response as revealed by luo et al 2021 in fig 15 it can be clearly observed that the cable tension from all the wave height increases with the increase of wave height similarly in fig 16 a b in the range of wave height 0 14 m 0 24 m the maximum horizontal acceleration and roll of the tube increase with the increase of the wave height it is noted that the maximum horizontal acceleration and roll of the tube increase comparatively slowly at the wave height ranges from 0 14 m to 0 18 m but increase abruptly when the wave height is larger than 0 18 m in practical engineering the critical value of wave height corresponding to the turning point for the curve should be given more attentions 4 3 independent current tests it can be clearly observed in fig 17 a that the cable tension of c2 cable approximately increases quadratically with the increase of current velocity which is consistent with classical linear wave and hydrodynamic theories in fig 17 b as the current velocity increases the maximum roll of the tube increases and its increasing speed slows down with the increase of the current velocity in fig 17 c the maximum roll of the tube shows an approximately linear growth trend while the current velocity increases from 0 14 m s to 0 22 m s 4 4 combined earthquake and wave tests fig 18 a b show the comparisons of time history curves of cable tension for c2 cable and roll of sft subjected to independent wave action and combined earthquake and wave action in the tests the earthquake excitation is acted on the time domain of about 20 s 50 s the trends of the time histories of cable tension and roll subjected to independent wave action and combined earthquake and wave action are similar but not exactly consistent in the time domain of earthquake action only some tiny changes can be observed in the curves for comparison i e some high frequency and multi frequency fluctuations can be seen in the curves while considering the combined earthquake and wave action and after the earthquake action the amplitude of the cable tension and roll subjected to combined earthquake and wave action becomes slightly smaller than that from independent wave action it means earthquake energy is absorbed by hydrodynamic damping and the coupling effect between wave radiation and diffraction in the discussion case in fig 18 c the horizontal acceleration of the tube subjected to the combined earthquake and wave action is much larger than that subjected to independent wave it has distinct high frequency and multi frequency characteristics and has similar shape and tendency with the input earthquake wave after the decay stage of earthquake action i e after about 20 s due to the effect of wave action the horizontal acceleration of the tube shows distinct beat frequency characteristic while dominated by wave frequency while the horizontal acceleration of the tube subjected to independent wave action has relatively small amplitude low frequency characteristic and regular shape and tendency the experimental results are consistent with the study from luo et al 2021 it is indicated that the earthquake action has larger effect on the horizontal acceleration of the tube compared to the wave action the results imply that the sft with flexible anchor cables has better performance of seismic resistance compared with traditional bridges and tunnel with rigid support and the earthquake action mainly affects the horizontal acceleration of the tube which is not conducive for human body comfort besides the high frequency and multi frequency fluctuations of anchor cables caused by earthquake excitation may lead to the impact load alternate slack taut phenomena and fatigue failure for the cable which increased the possibility of cable breakage and is harmful to the safety of the sft in order to have a more comprehensive understanding about the characteristics in frequency domain of the horizontal acceleration for tube subjected to independent wave action and combined earthquake and wave action the fourier transform of horizontal acceleration of the tube is conducted and the comparison of fourier spectrums is shown in fig 19 in fig 19 subjected to independent wave action the acceleration spectra of the tube shows more distinct low frequency contents i e at the range of about 0 rad s to 3 rad s three peaks value are observed with the maximum value of 0 027 m s2 at the frequency of about 1 0 rad s while subjected to combined earthquake and wave action the acceleration spectra of the tube has wider frequency brand and lower amplitude and shows more stochastic characteristic its energy concentration region is focused on the range of frequency of about 26 rad s to 52 rad s and the maximum value is 0 014 m s2 at the frequency of about 40 rad s in engineering practice the natural vibration frequency of sft should be designed to keep away from the dominant frequency range of the excitation loadings which includes not only the dominant frequency induced by independent wave action but also the widened dominant frequency brand caused by the combined action of earthquake and wave in fig 20 a subjected to the independent earthquake action the sway of tube shows distinct perturbation and amplification at the time domain of earthquake action and then tends to be stable after the earthquake action it is worth noting that the sway of tube is much smaller than that subjected to independent wave action and the combined action of earthquake and wave in fig 20 b subjected to the independent wave action the sway of tube shows a periodical tendency and its maximum value reaches to 2 9 cm while considering the combined action of wave and earthquake the sway of the tube remains unchanged and only shows tiny phase and amplitude difference in the curve the results in fig 20 implies that due to the flexible support the displacement of the sft are basically unaffected by earthquakes from fig 21 a for the three earthquake waves all the maximum cable tension basically increases with the increase of wave height and the combined effect induced by combined action of earthquake and wave is increased with the wave height it implies the wave play a dominated role than earthquake while combination with earthquake excitation the wave height can strengthen or weaken the seismic response for the tube and can induce resonance effect in certain conditions jiang et al 2019 luo et al 2021 thus some distinct peak points e g at the wave height of 0 18 m and 0 2 m are observed in the three curves of maximum cable tensions it s worth pointing out the maximum cable tension subjected to the combined action of artificial wave and wave is always larger than that subjected to the other two earthquakes at the wave height of 0 14 m 0 2 m but becomes smaller than the other two earthquakes at the wave height of 0 22 m 0 24 m it means that in relatively small wave height wave play a dominated role than earthquake the coupling effect due to combination of high energy density earthquake and wave mainly strengthen the superposition effect for the cable tension fig 21 b shows that the maximum roll of the tube from the three earthquakes all roughly increases with the increase of wave height due to weak synchronization of transmission of flexible cable and irregular perturbation field induced by coupling effect of earthquake and wave the roll curves of tube show an obvious feature with large fluctuation and randomness of these the maximum roll of the tube subjected to the combined action of artificial el centro wave and wave shows a relative distinct tendency to increase with the increase of wave height and reaches its peak value at the wave height of 0 20 m and then decreases with the increase of wave height in fig 21 c except for some special points e g wave height of 0 18 m 0 22 m respectively at the curve of artificial el centro wave and sine wave for the three earthquake waves the maximum horizontal acceleration approximately shows a tendency to decrease with the increase of wave height from previous studies wu et al 2021 jiang et al 2019 wave can weaken the influence of earthquake wave on the horizontal acceleration of the tube and stronger the wave are more powerful ability for strengthening the hydrodynamic damping for the tube which supports our results for different earthquake waves the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube subjected to the action of artificial el centro wave is always larger than that subjected to the other two earthquake waves except at the wave height of 0 18 m the results are mainly related to the difference of the spectrum characteristic between different earthquake waves it can be drawn from the fig 22 a for the three earthquake waves with the increasing of the wave period all the curves for the maximum cable tension of the c2 cable exhibits a distinct peak at wave periods of 0 9 s moreover the curves for maximum tension variation subjected to artificial el centro wave and artificial wave coincide generally and shows the tendency to periodically fall and rise with the increase of wave period generally the maximum tension subjected to sine wave shows the tendency of increasing with the increase of wave period except for the wave period of 1 1 s the maximum cable tension for c2 cable subjected to the artificial wave is generally smaller than that subjected to the other two earthquakes especially for wave period of larger than 0 7 s in fig 22 b for all the three earthquakes the maximum roll of the tube approximately increases with the increase of wave period of these the curves for the sine wave and artificial el centro wave show quadratic increasing tendency and the curve for the artificial wave shows distinct fluctuation at the wave period of 0 5 s 0 9 s fig 22 c shows that for all the three earthquakes the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube basically increases quadratically with the increase of wave period and an obvious turning point at the wave period of 0 9 s for all the curves can be observed especially for the curve subjected to the artificial el centro wave in summary the wave parameters have distinct effect on the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake and wave e g the wave height basically can increase the cable tension and roll of sft but can decrease the horizontal acceleration for the sft and the wave period can increase the horizontal acceleration and roll of the tube while varies the maximum cable tension with the tendency of first increase and then decease bedsides due to complicated interaction between earthquake and wave action generally the curves for the sft show an obvious feature with large fluctuation and randomness 4 5 combined earthquake and wave current tests shown in fig 23 a subjected to the combined action of earthquake and current the maximum cable tension for c2 cable shows the tendency of increasing linearly with the increase of current velocity while subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current the maximum cable tension of c2 cable tension is firstly increased which reaches a maximum valve at the current velocity of 0 2 m s after that value decreases the results may due to current has promoting effect to the wave and different current velocity can change the phase difference between the peak of wave force and earthquake acceleration at the current velocity of 0 2 m s the superimposed effect induced by combination of earthquake wave and current is maximum in fig 23 b the maximum roll of the tube subjected to the two combined actions of earthquake wave and current both increase with the increase of current velocity the difference is that with the increase of current velocity the increase rate for the curve subjected to combined actions of earthquake and current slows down while speeds up for the curve subjected to combined actions of earthquake current and wave as earthquake energy is absorbed by hydrodynamic damping and the coupling effect between wave radiation and diffraction in most of the range of current velocity the maximum roll subjected to the combined action of earthquake and current is always larger than that subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current current can change the phase difference between the peak of wave force and earthquake acceleration with the increase of current velocity for the roll of the tube the superposition effect of earthquakes and waves is more obvious and for the maximum tension of cable the cancellation effect of earthquakes and waves is more obvious the difference mainly due to the asynchronism of loading transmitting between the cable and tube thus contrary to the results in fig 23 a the maximum roll subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current increases sharply at the current velocity of 0 22 m s which lead to it becomes larger than that subjected to the combined action of earthquake and current in fig 23 c generally the maximum horizontal acceleration subjected to these two combined actions of earthquake wave and current show a tendency to increase with the increase of current velocity except for some special points e g current velocity of 0 20 m s and 0 22 m s it is noted that the maximum horizontal acceleration of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current is obviously larger than that subjected to the combined the action of earthquake and wave it is also obviously larger than that subjected to the independent earthquake wave current action which respectively shown in figs 10 a 17 b and 18 c and is lager than their superposition as well the results show the dynamic response of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake wave and current is not the simple superposition of that subjected to the independent earthquake wave and current the results may due to the impact effect of current to the tube and the earthquake and wave can strengthen this effect as pointed out by jiang et al 2019 besides the two curves shown in fig 23 c show large fluctuation and randomness this results may be attributed to the complicated interaction between earthquake wave and current and more attentions should be paid for the sft in design construction and operation stages the present methods and model can be used to predict subsequent hydrodynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave current actions of more precisely and maturely for field applications 5 conclusions in this research the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current are experimentally investigated the following conclusions and suggestions can be drawn 1 based on wave current flume and a specially designed underwater shaking device a physical scaled model experiment of sft is presented to understand the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current the present underwater shaking device can be used to experimentally investigate the dynamic behavior of marine structure subjected to the combination of earthquake and wave current excitations and has economical simple and reliable advantages 2 with three important judge rules the earthquake wave outputs from the underwater shaking device are verified to be reliable the relative error results of the free vibration frequency of sft between the results from test model and numerical model is less than 8 the experimental results are observed to conform the numerical results well validating the test with a relative error below 10 the present methods and model can be used to predict subsequent hydrodynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave action of more precisely and maturely for field applications 3 from the results it can be found that earthquake has less effect on the dynamic response of sft that with flexible cable support which implies the excellent suppression ability for the sft to earthquake vibration sft has different seismic failure mechanism while compared with traditional bridges and tunnel with rigid support the high frequency and multi frequency fluctuations of anchor cables caused by earthquake excitation which may lead to the impact load alternate slack taut phenomena and fatigue failure for the cable increasing the possibility of cable breakage in the actual project the aseismic design of sft should pay much attentions to prevent the failure of anchorage foundation anti cable breakage and reasonable design for mooring system 4 based on varying effect factors e g type and pga of earthquake wave height and current velocity the dynamic response of sft subjected to independent and combined action of earthquake wave and current are analyzed systematically and studied comparatively the maximum tension amplification of the cable under independent earthquake can reach to 25 and the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube increases to 0 45 m s2 wave can respectively weaken the tension amplification of earthquake to 10 and increase the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube by 40 the dynamic response of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake wave and current is not the simple superposition of that subjected to the independent earthquake wave and current besides the dynamic responses of sft show large randomness and fluctuation this may be attributed to the complicated interaction between earthquake wave and current 5 the underwater shaking table test is widely recognized as the most effective method to investigate the dynamic behavior of underwater structures under combination of earthquake wave current as the complicated mechanical mechanism of combined action of earthquake and wave there are no existed theoretical supports which can systematically explain the present experimental results at present only a few theoretical researches about the sft under the combined action of earthquake wave and current have been done but some assumptions were introduced in these researches neglecting the accuracy and validity of their calculations however qualitatively the total regularity and tendency of the present test results can be supported by existed theoretical researches in depth and

research has theoretical and engineering importance for the prevention and control hazard of design for the sft keywords submerged floating tunnel dynamic behavior underwater shaking device experimental investigation combined action of earthquake wave and current 1 introduction submerged floating tunnel sft also known as archimedes bridge is an innovative traffic structure across long and deep water areas it is mainly made of tunnel tube suspended at a certain depth underwater by buoyancy mooring system restricting the motion for the tunnel deep water foundation and the revetment section connecting both sides sft has its unique characteristics and charm lin et al 2018 xiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 such as will not be affected by extreme weather conditions lower construction cost negligible effects on the normal navigation and other water production activities etc thus sft is attracting more and more attentions in academia and industry the sft is generally located in the ocean during the whole lifetime and subjected to complicated marine environmental loadings although a long time has passed since the conception for sft was presented the actual engineering of sft hasn t been carried out on account of safety and stability concerns induced by all kinds of environmental loading excitations it is reported that 85 of the total amount of earthquakes on earth happen in the sea duan and wang yyue 2010 the three areas that are potential to build sft in china are the bohai strait the qiongzhou strait and the taiwan strait which are all in the circumpacific seismic belt therefore the study for the seismic behavior of sft becomes one of the hottest topics in academia and industry it is noted that the sft that placed in earthquake prone areas may be simultaneously subjected to not only earthquake action but also wave current action what s more the effect of seaquake is much more complex which can induce hydrodynamic pressures acting on the offshore structure and complicated coupling interaction between earthquake and wave current chen et al 2012 lee et al 2016 wu and mei 2017 therefore to guarantee the safety and stability of sft during its whole lifetime it is urgent need to study and understand the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current so far some researches on sft subjected to independent earthquake action or subjected to independent wave current action has been conducted in the respect of independent wave current action chen et al 2018 proposed a theoretical approach to make coupled vibration analysis of sft tube cable system subjected to combined parametric excitation and wave current action wu and mei 2017 studied the dynamic response of cable of submerged floating tunnel subjected to random wave force through the pseudo excitation method chen et al 2021 studied the nonlinear interaction between the moored sft and surface wave action through a presented numerical model jin et al 2020 established a full time domain two dimensional numerical model for the coupled dynamic analysis for wave action on a tension leg type sft in time domain li et al 2018 experimentally studied the pressure characteristic of sft subjected to wave force excitation with various section forms yang et al 2020 studied the 2d motion characteristics of sft in wave loads in an experimental way deng et al 2020 experimentally studied the vortex induced vibration of a twin tube submerged floating tunnel segment model in steady current action in the respect of independent earthquake action martinelli et al 2011 investigated the multi support seismic response for sft anchored by cables through a proposed innovative numerical model chen et al 2012 experimentally and numerically investigated seismic response of sft with underwater shaking table test and finite element model su and sun 2013 proposed a mathematical equation for vibration of sft tether subjected to the effects of earthquake and parametric excitation dong and li 2016 utilized the theory of elastic foundation beam to establish the dynamic equations of sft tube subjected to earthquake action lee et al 2016 studied the dynamic behavior of a sft with a rectangular cross section subjected to earthquake action in a relative accurate numerical way in the respect of combined earthquake and wave current actions due to the great difficulty to simulate the combined action for earthquake and wave current in experiment and numerical calculation only a few studies have been reported wu and mei 2017 utilized modified morison s equation to formulate the hydrodynamic force induced by earthquake excitation and investigated the vibration response of sft cable subjected to simultaneous hydrodynamic force and earthquake excitations luo et al 2021 utilized the stokes wave theory and trigonometric series method to calculate the wave load and earthquake and adopted the d alembert principle to establish the tube tether model of sft subjected to the wave earthquake action to investigate the dynamic response of sft subject to the coupled action of earthquakes and waves xie and chen 2021 presented a new mathematical model for analyzing the dynamic response of sft canyon water system subjected to earthquakes and potential current actions while considered the transmission effect of canyon water to the original horizontal seismic wave input overall the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave current action was rarely studied the existed researches were focused on theoretical and numerical studies in these studies to solve the complicated interaction between water and sft subjected to combined actions of earthquake and wave current many assumptions were introduced which neglected the accuracy of numerical calculation and validity of their calculations still need to be verified by shaking table test up to now no experimental researches which thoroughly investigate the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current have been reported the underwater shaking table test is widely recognized as the most effective method to investigate the dynamic behavior of underwater structures subjected to earthquake which can reproduce earthquake excitations to achieve the earthquake actions as to simulate practical situation and provide experimental verification for theoretical and numerical studies the experimental investigation for the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave current action is conducted in this study in this study the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake wave and current is experimentally investigated based on the wave current flume and a specially designed underwater shaking device a physical scaled model experiment of sft for studying the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current is presented three important judge rules are introduced to verify the reliability of the earthquake wave output from the underwater shaking device a comparison between numerical simulations and experimental results is then presented to assess the validity of the proposed test model the influence of key load parameters such as the peak ground acceleration pga and type of single earthquake the wave height current velocity etc and the combination of earthquake wave and current on the dynamic behavior of sft are deeply and thoroughly explored this experiment research has theoretical and engineering importance for the prevention and control hazard of design for the sft located at complicated ocean environment 2 experimental model design 2 1 experimental model set up the experiment is carried out in the wave current flume with its size length width height 30 m 1 5 m 1 5 m a push board wave maker is used to generate the desired incident waves at the one end of the flume a tilt type wave absorber is installed at the other end of the flume to prevent the wave reflection affecting test results the uniform and steady current can be generated and ensured by a large pump a specially designed circulating loop and a porous guide plate set up at the inlet and outlet of the flume in this test before the formal use for the flume through numerous qualitative calibration tests and experimental observations the accuracy of wave generation current generation and wave current interaction of the wave flume can satisfy design requirements and specification standards for hydrodynamic test in the present study the main concern for the test is the influence of combined action of earthquake wave and current on the dynamic behavior of sft the elasticity and gravity similarity laws should be fulfilled in the model design thus the cauchy and froude similarity should be fulfilled concurrently to implement the inertial gravitational and restoring forces simulation in the experiment which is expressed as liu et al 2017 ding et al 2018 1 s e s g s ρ s l in which s e is the elastic modulus scale factor s g is the gravitational acceleration scale factor s ρ is the density scale factor and s l is the geometric scale factor following the existed studies the gravitational acceleration of prototype and model are regarded as equal the eq 1 can be simplified as 2 s e s ρ s l in this experiment a scheme of a sft for crossing funk bay is taken as the prototype based on the dimensions of the wave current flume the scaled segment model of the sft is designed and the scales reaction for various physical quantities are summarized in table 1 detailed sketch of experimental model set up is shown in fig 1 seen in fig 1 a the experimental model consists of wave current flume scaled model tube anchoring cables boundary restrain device underwater shaking device and data acquisition devices the numbers of the cables are named c1 c6 and c1 c3 and c4 c6 are respectively arranged at the upstream and downstream sides of the flume the major parameters of the prototype and physical model of sft are summarized in table 2 it is noted that if the cable interval is strictly consistent for the scale ratio it is hard to install anchorage device thus in the test about 2 cm are reserved for each end of the tube to install anchorage device in the test the pretension of the cable is considered and adjusted accurately for the cable by varying the elongation of turnbuckle to satisfy the requirement for the stability of the original balance of sft and the test objective and based on previous studies jin et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the typical pretension of the each cable of sft is set as 24n in the test 2 2 data acquisition devices and installation as shown in fig 1 b the data acquisition devices used in this test including ⅰ waterproof tensile force gage 6 waterproof tensile force gages are respectively installed at the bottom end of each cable to measure the tension of cables ⅱ waterproof accelerometer 3 waterproof accelerometers are respectively installed at the shaking table the midpoint of upper surface of the tube and the underwater anchor board to measure the acceleration of the structures and are respectively named a1 a3 ⅲ imu inertial measurement unit imu is installed at the barycenter of the tube to measure its rotations roll yaw and pitch ⅳ dic 3d digital image correlation three dimensions dic measurement system is used to measure the displacement of the tube the dic 3d is placed at the exact front of the sft model at the outside of the flume in dic 3d measurement system the ray racing method is applied to obtain the target position from the binocular vision measurements which is a non contacting technique with high precision trajectory measurement for the moving object four circinate trackers are set on the surface of the tube bottom the moving trackers motion characteristics of tube are captured by two cameras the major measuring devices and their parameters are listed in table 3 2 3 underwater shaking device most of the traditional wave current flume can t simulate underwater earthquake let alone to simulate the combined action of earthquake wave and current some of large scale underwater shaking tables that can simulate earthquake wave and current action separately or simultaneously in the same flume has been reported in existed studies chen et al 2012 liu et al 2017 ding et al 2018 however they are very expensive and have lengthy construction cycle that limit their applications in actual test in this study a specially designed underwater shaking device is presented to stimulate the combined action of wave earthquake and wave as shown in fig 1 a and c the underwater shaking device includes three main components ⅰ shaking table on land the shaking table is installed above the flume through a load bearing bracket to generate various earthquake waves by control computer ⅱ rigid brace the rigid brace is used to connect the shaking table and sliding false board to transfer the earthquake excitation from shaking table to underwater sliding false board ⅲ sliding false board the sliding false board is installed in the bottom of the flume and is mainly composed of slide ways sliding blokes and anchored board to simulate underwater earthquake excitation it is worth pointing out that the acceleration consistency between shaking table and sliding false board is the most important control indicator for the underwater shaking device to satisfy this requirement the structural form and stiffness characteristics for the rigid brace are specially designed and the unidirectional slide way is induced to guarantee the false board can only move horizontally while its movements of other degrees of freedom directions are strictly limited to prevent the coupling of multi direction movement of the board 2 4 details of the boundary restraint device the span of a sft is usually up to dozens or even hundreds of kilometers long due to the limitation of dimension of the test flumes and experimentation cost experimental investigations about the dynamic behavior of sft are mainly conducted on segmental model test previous experimental studies seo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 have neglected the restraint condition of both ends of sft and almost set them free in engineering practice the sft tube is fixed to the ground and as xiao and huang 2010 shows boundary conditions have obvious effect on the seismic behavior of sft hence stimulating the boundary conditions for the tube is necessary and important to effectively simulate the boundary condition for the segmental model based on the previous studies deng et al 2020 lin 2016 a numerical tool to link the results between the entire length numerical model and the segment physical model is adopted the boundary constraints simulation of the segment model is described by the following three steps 1 entire length numerical model in abaqus is established based on a scheme of sft as shown in fig 2 the basic parameters for the numerical model are listed in table 2 the tube and cables are respectively modeled with 3d beam element b31 and truss element t3d2 lin et al 2018 xiang et al 2018 the both ends of the tube are simply supported to the ground and the cables are pined to the seabed 2 a boundary constraint simulation method based on spring damper model is proposed to consider the boundary constraint effect for the segment model and its schematic sketch is shown in fig 3 a the horizontal and vertical springs and dampers are used to simulate the translational motion constraint and the relative eccentric installation of the sets of spring damping system can be used to provide restoring moments to simulate the rotation constraint segment numerical model with the present designed boundary constraint is used to veritably reconstitute its motion and stressing state during entire length numerical model the equivalent stiffness and damping fittings are made by the adjustment of stiffness and damping for the springs and dampers and the eccentric distance between the spring damping modules and middle axis of the cross section of the tube 3 the constraint parameters values of stiffness damping and eccentric distance can be obtained by fitting results of step 2 and is implemented in the end of the physical segment model as shown in fig 3 b the boundary constraint device is consisted of four spring damping modules each module is mainly composed of a spring and a damper one end of the module is connected to the tube by the spring and the other end is fixed to one side of frame by the damper through the above three steps the boundary constraint of the physical segment model is simulated in this test combination with theoretical analysis and numerical simulation the typical stiffness of the horizontal and vertical spring is adopted as 30 6 n m 21 6 n m respectively and typical damping of the damper is adopted as 0 045 2 5 test case design to ensure the effectiveness of the test results the input earthquake wave should consider the loading properties and the actual geological conditions of the model in this study an artificial el centro wave an artificial wave generated by utilizing seismic design spectrum mot of china 2008 and sine wave are chosen as typical wave types for further analysis it is noted that if the time scale is abided strictly the time duration of el centro wave is decreased as about 5 s it is difficult to preserve the spectral characteristics for the earthquake wave and the dynamic response for the physical scale model cannot be guaranteed thus the artificial el wave artificial wave and sine wave are artificially lengthened to 300 s in the prototype and decreased to about 26 s in actual test satisfied the similarity requirement figs 4 5 show the acceleration time history curves and corresponding spectrum characteristics of artificial el wave and artificial wave as for fair comparison the concept of equivalent energy density and energy flux xu et al 2014 is introduced to relate the parameters between sine and stochastic wave types in the test the effects of earthquakes waves and current are only considered in the transverse direction of the sft and waves travel with the current in this study the main test conditions are designed i independent earthquake test ⅱ independent wave or current test ⅲ combined earthquake wave and current test the detailed test case descriptions are shown in table 4 3 validity assessment for the present experimental model 3 1 reliability verification for earthquake output of the underwater shaking device to ensure the reliability of the earthquake wave output from the underwater shaking device three important judge rules are introduced to assess the reliability of the earthquake wave output which can be detailed as 1 the consistency of acceleration at each point of the underwater sliding false board it requires that each point on the underwater sliding false board has the same accelerations 2 the consistency of earthquake input and output from underwater shaking device it requires that the input acceleration from the control computer and the output acceleration from the underwater false board should be identical 3 the repeatability of earthquake output from the underwater shaking device it requires that no matter how many times the same acceleration is input the same earthquake acceleration will be output in this study following the above mentioned 3 judge rules the artificial el centro wave and artificial wave are selected the input acceleration from the control computer is compared with that recorded at points 1 2 on the underwater false board and three times records from point 1 to make reliability verification for the underwater shaking device and the results can be seen in figs 6 7 in fig 6 a both the input acceleration from the control computer and the output acceleration from the underwater false board at points 1 2 all increase rapidly at the first 3 s and keep drastically oscillation during 3 20 s then decrease to zero rapidly they have the same curve tendencies and the similar spectrum characteristics the results from fig 6 a indicate that the rules 1 2 are well satisfied fig 6 b shows the output acceleration comparison between three times records from point 1 similarly the amplitude range curve characteristics frequency characteristics from these three accelerations show good consistency with a relative error below 5 the results from fig 6 b indicate that the rule 3 are well satisfied the same verification result of artificial wave also can be obtained from fig 7 a b overall based on the above comparisons it is concluded that the three judge rules that assessed the reliability of the earthquake wave output can be satisfied well thus it is deemed that the earthquake acceleration outputs from the underwater shaking device are valid and reliable 3 2 comparison between numerical and experimental results in order to verify reliability of experimental results the segment numerical model subjected to the same earthquake wave is established by using abaqus program and the comparisons between the numerical results and experimental results are made as shown in figs 8 9 it is noted that the segment numerical model is only 180 m length and has 3 pairs of anchor cables and its two ends are constrained by the present boundary constraints simulation method with springs and damper detailed description can be seen in fig 3 also the relative error results of the free vibration frequency of sft between the results from test model and numerical model is less than 8 besides the dynamic amplification factor daf is introduced to evaluate the influence effect from earthquake excitation which is expressed as xiang et al 2018 3 daf β α α where α is the cable tension in the initial state before the earthquake excitation action and β is the maximum dynamic cable tension when the sft is subjected to earthquake excitation fig 9 a shows the comparison of the time history curves of the tube subjected to artificial el centro wave between the numerical and experimental results fig 9 b c respectively show the comparison of the maximum horizontal acceleration for the tube and parameter daf for cable tension between the numerical and experimental results subjected to different pgas of artificial el centro wave it is obvious that both the trends and the amplitudes of all curves and graphs from numerical and experimental results show a good consistency i e the maximum horizontal acceleration of tube and the daf for cable tension from the two methods are both increased with the increase of the pga of the el centro wave with a relative error within 10 only some small differences are observed from the results of the two methods that is some fluctuations occur in the curves of numerical results after about 20 s and some little gaps occur between the two methods in the graphs comparison these differences may be caused by many factors e g the tube water coupling can t be fully considered in numerical model installation error of physical model and accuracy of sensors overall based on the comparisons the present test model is capable to provide a sufficiently accurate analysis for the dynamic behaviors of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 independent earthquake tests in fig 10 the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube increases with the increase of earthquake pga and the trends of the tube horizontal acceleration time histories are basically identical when subjected to the same kind of earthquake excitation the experimental results are consistent with the study from lee et al 2016 it is indicated that the trend of tube acceleration under the earthquake is mainly affected by the type of earthquake wave and the magnitude of the earthquake increases with the increasement of earthquake pga the amplification ratio of the maximum tube horizontal acceleration to maximum input acceleration subjected to all the three earthquakes varies from 0 05 to 0 15 the result is consistent with previous study chen et al 2012 according to study liu et al 2017 about cable stayed bridge tower subjected to earthquake its acceleration amplification ratio is usually larger than 1 which is almost ten times larger than that with sft with flexible cable support from the results it can be found that earthquake has less effect on the horizontal acceleration of sft tube that with flexible cable support than on the cable stayed bridge tower with pier rigid support and it implies the excellent suppression ability for the sft to earthquake vibration while compared with traditional bridges and tunnel with rigid support in fig 11 it shows the comparison of parameter daf and maximum roll of tube subjected to different earthquake waves with different pgas it can be easily seen that daf and maximum roll of tube distinctly increase with the increase of pga with their ranges varying from 0 025 to 0 25 and 1 8 respectively the parameter daf and maximum roll of tube subjected to sine wave are always larger than those subjected to artificial el centro wave and artificial wave and the gap rapidly increases with the increase of pga daf subjected to the artificial wave is smallest when subjected to low intensity wave while is moderate subjected to comparatively large intensity wave the dynamic variation of sft induced by different earthquakes wave mainly depends on the energy density and spectrum characteristic of the earthquake types fig 12 shows the trends of the cable tension time histories are identical when subjected to the same kind of earthquake excitation and the cable tension increases with the increase of pga different from previous studies on flexible marine structure subjected to earthquake in this test the cable tension time history curves from different pgas all have the similar shape and tendency with the input earthquake wave it implies that in practical engineering the dynamic behavior and the cable tension level of sft subjected to earthquake excitation are mainly related to pga of earthquake the axial stiffness pretension of the cable and the connective stiffness between the cable with tube and the foundation 4 2 independent wave tests in fig 13 the effect of the wave period on the cable tension of c2 cable subjected to independent wave load are studied it can be clearly observed that the cable tension from all the wave periods changes regularly and periodically with the change of time as the increase of the wave period approximately the cable tension firstly increases and then attenuates and two peak values can be observed at the wave periods of 0 9 s and 1 5 s and the maximum cable tension occur at wave period of 1 5 s besides tiny phase differences of the curves with different wave period can be observed in fig 14 a the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube fluctuates irregularly with the increase of wave period and reaches its maximum value 0 085 m s2 and minimum value 0 041 m s2 at the periods of 1 3 s and 0 7 s respectively fig 14 b shows that the maximum roll of the tube tends to decrease firstly and then increase generally with the increase of wave period and reaches its maximum value 3 2 and minimum value 0 41 at the periods of 1 5 s and 0 9 s respectively the results may due to that system resonance could occur in the condition that the wave period approach or are the multiple of the natural period of sft which results in the distinct amplification of the total response as revealed by luo et al 2021 in fig 15 it can be clearly observed that the cable tension from all the wave height increases with the increase of wave height similarly in fig 16 a b in the range of wave height 0 14 m 0 24 m the maximum horizontal acceleration and roll of the tube increase with the increase of the wave height it is noted that the maximum horizontal acceleration and roll of the tube increase comparatively slowly at the wave height ranges from 0 14 m to 0 18 m but increase abruptly when the wave height is larger than 0 18 m in practical engineering the critical value of wave height corresponding to the turning point for the curve should be given more attentions 4 3 independent current tests it can be clearly observed in fig 17 a that the cable tension of c2 cable approximately increases quadratically with the increase of current velocity which is consistent with classical linear wave and hydrodynamic theories in fig 17 b as the current velocity increases the maximum roll of the tube increases and its increasing speed slows down with the increase of the current velocity in fig 17 c the maximum roll of the tube shows an approximately linear growth trend while the current velocity increases from 0 14 m s to 0 22 m s 4 4 combined earthquake and wave tests fig 18 a b show the comparisons of time history curves of cable tension for c2 cable and roll of sft subjected to independent wave action and combined earthquake and wave action in the tests the earthquake excitation is acted on the time domain of about 20 s 50 s the trends of the time histories of cable tension and roll subjected to independent wave action and combined earthquake and wave action are similar but not exactly consistent in the time domain of earthquake action only some tiny changes can be observed in the curves for comparison i e some high frequency and multi frequency fluctuations can be seen in the curves while considering the combined earthquake and wave action and after the earthquake action the amplitude of the cable tension and roll subjected to combined earthquake and wave action becomes slightly smaller than that from independent wave action it means earthquake energy is absorbed by hydrodynamic damping and the coupling effect between wave radiation and diffraction in the discussion case in fig 18 c the horizontal acceleration of the tube subjected to the combined earthquake and wave action is much larger than that subjected to independent wave it has distinct high frequency and multi frequency characteristics and has similar shape and tendency with the input earthquake wave after the decay stage of earthquake action i e after about 20 s due to the effect of wave action the horizontal acceleration of the tube shows distinct beat frequency characteristic while dominated by wave frequency while the horizontal acceleration of the tube subjected to independent wave action has relatively small amplitude low frequency characteristic and regular shape and tendency the experimental results are consistent with the study from luo et al 2021 it is indicated that the earthquake action has larger effect on the horizontal acceleration of the tube compared to the wave action the results imply that the sft with flexible anchor cables has better performance of seismic resistance compared with traditional bridges and tunnel with rigid support and the earthquake action mainly affects the horizontal acceleration of the tube which is not conducive for human body comfort besides the high frequency and multi frequency fluctuations of anchor cables caused by earthquake excitation may lead to the impact load alternate slack taut phenomena and fatigue failure for the cable which increased the possibility of cable breakage and is harmful to the safety of the sft in order to have a more comprehensive understanding about the characteristics in frequency domain of the horizontal acceleration for tube subjected to independent wave action and combined earthquake and wave action the fourier transform of horizontal acceleration of the tube is conducted and the comparison of fourier spectrums is shown in fig 19 in fig 19 subjected to independent wave action the acceleration spectra of the tube shows more distinct low frequency contents i e at the range of about 0 rad s to 3 rad s three peaks value are observed with the maximum value of 0 027 m s2 at the frequency of about 1 0 rad s while subjected to combined earthquake and wave action the acceleration spectra of the tube has wider frequency brand and lower amplitude and shows more stochastic characteristic its energy concentration region is focused on the range of frequency of about 26 rad s to 52 rad s and the maximum value is 0 014 m s2 at the frequency of about 40 rad s in engineering practice the natural vibration frequency of sft should be designed to keep away from the dominant frequency range of the excitation loadings which includes not only the dominant frequency induced by independent wave action but also the widened dominant frequency brand caused by the combined action of earthquake and wave in fig 20 a subjected to the independent earthquake action the sway of tube shows distinct perturbation and amplification at the time domain of earthquake action and then tends to be stable after the earthquake action it is worth noting that the sway of tube is much smaller than that subjected to independent wave action and the combined action of earthquake and wave in fig 20 b subjected to the independent wave action the sway of tube shows a periodical tendency and its maximum value reaches to 2 9 cm while considering the combined action of wave and earthquake the sway of the tube remains unchanged and only shows tiny phase and amplitude difference in the curve the results in fig 20 implies that due to the flexible support the displacement of the sft are basically unaffected by earthquakes from fig 21 a for the three earthquake waves all the maximum cable tension basically increases with the increase of wave height and the combined effect induced by combined action of earthquake and wave is increased with the wave height it implies the wave play a dominated role than earthquake while combination with earthquake excitation the wave height can strengthen or weaken the seismic response for the tube and can induce resonance effect in certain conditions jiang et al 2019 luo et al 2021 thus some distinct peak points e g at the wave height of 0 18 m and 0 2 m are observed in the three curves of maximum cable tensions it s worth pointing out the maximum cable tension subjected to the combined action of artificial wave and wave is always larger than that subjected to the other two earthquakes at the wave height of 0 14 m 0 2 m but becomes smaller than the other two earthquakes at the wave height of 0 22 m 0 24 m it means that in relatively small wave height wave play a dominated role than earthquake the coupling effect due to combination of high energy density earthquake and wave mainly strengthen the superposition effect for the cable tension fig 21 b shows that the maximum roll of the tube from the three earthquakes all roughly increases with the increase of wave height due to weak synchronization of transmission of flexible cable and irregular perturbation field induced by coupling effect of earthquake and wave the roll curves of tube show an obvious feature with large fluctuation and randomness of these the maximum roll of the tube subjected to the combined action of artificial el centro wave and wave shows a relative distinct tendency to increase with the increase of wave height and reaches its peak value at the wave height of 0 20 m and then decreases with the increase of wave height in fig 21 c except for some special points e g wave height of 0 18 m 0 22 m respectively at the curve of artificial el centro wave and sine wave for the three earthquake waves the maximum horizontal acceleration approximately shows a tendency to decrease with the increase of wave height from previous studies wu et al 2021 jiang et al 2019 wave can weaken the influence of earthquake wave on the horizontal acceleration of the tube and stronger the wave are more powerful ability for strengthening the hydrodynamic damping for the tube which supports our results for different earthquake waves the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube subjected to the action of artificial el centro wave is always larger than that subjected to the other two earthquake waves except at the wave height of 0 18 m the results are mainly related to the difference of the spectrum characteristic between different earthquake waves it can be drawn from the fig 22 a for the three earthquake waves with the increasing of the wave period all the curves for the maximum cable tension of the c2 cable exhibits a distinct peak at wave periods of 0 9 s moreover the curves for maximum tension variation subjected to artificial el centro wave and artificial wave coincide generally and shows the tendency to periodically fall and rise with the increase of wave period generally the maximum tension subjected to sine wave shows the tendency of increasing with the increase of wave period except for the wave period of 1 1 s the maximum cable tension for c2 cable subjected to the artificial wave is generally smaller than that subjected to the other two earthquakes especially for wave period of larger than 0 7 s in fig 22 b for all the three earthquakes the maximum roll of the tube approximately increases with the increase of wave period of these the curves for the sine wave and artificial el centro wave show quadratic increasing tendency and the curve for the artificial wave shows distinct fluctuation at the wave period of 0 5 s 0 9 s fig 22 c shows that for all the three earthquakes the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube basically increases quadratically with the increase of wave period and an obvious turning point at the wave period of 0 9 s for all the curves can be observed especially for the curve subjected to the artificial el centro wave in summary the wave parameters have distinct effect on the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake and wave e g the wave height basically can increase the cable tension and roll of sft but can decrease the horizontal acceleration for the sft and the wave period can increase the horizontal acceleration and roll of the tube while varies the maximum cable tension with the tendency of first increase and then decease bedsides due to complicated interaction between earthquake and wave action generally the curves for the sft show an obvious feature with large fluctuation and randomness 4 5 combined earthquake and wave current tests shown in fig 23 a subjected to the combined action of earthquake and current the maximum cable tension for c2 cable shows the tendency of increasing linearly with the increase of current velocity while subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current the maximum cable tension of c2 cable tension is firstly increased which reaches a maximum valve at the current velocity of 0 2 m s after that value decreases the results may due to current has promoting effect to the wave and different current velocity can change the phase difference between the peak of wave force and earthquake acceleration at the current velocity of 0 2 m s the superimposed effect induced by combination of earthquake wave and current is maximum in fig 23 b the maximum roll of the tube subjected to the two combined actions of earthquake wave and current both increase with the increase of current velocity the difference is that with the increase of current velocity the increase rate for the curve subjected to combined actions of earthquake and current slows down while speeds up for the curve subjected to combined actions of earthquake current and wave as earthquake energy is absorbed by hydrodynamic damping and the coupling effect between wave radiation and diffraction in most of the range of current velocity the maximum roll subjected to the combined action of earthquake and current is always larger than that subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current current can change the phase difference between the peak of wave force and earthquake acceleration with the increase of current velocity for the roll of the tube the superposition effect of earthquakes and waves is more obvious and for the maximum tension of cable the cancellation effect of earthquakes and waves is more obvious the difference mainly due to the asynchronism of loading transmitting between the cable and tube thus contrary to the results in fig 23 a the maximum roll subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current increases sharply at the current velocity of 0 22 m s which lead to it becomes larger than that subjected to the combined action of earthquake and current in fig 23 c generally the maximum horizontal acceleration subjected to these two combined actions of earthquake wave and current show a tendency to increase with the increase of current velocity except for some special points e g current velocity of 0 20 m s and 0 22 m s it is noted that the maximum horizontal acceleration of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current is obviously larger than that subjected to the combined the action of earthquake and wave it is also obviously larger than that subjected to the independent earthquake wave current action which respectively shown in figs 10 a 17 b and 18 c and is lager than their superposition as well the results show the dynamic response of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake wave and current is not the simple superposition of that subjected to the independent earthquake wave and current the results may due to the impact effect of current to the tube and the earthquake and wave can strengthen this effect as pointed out by jiang et al 2019 besides the two curves shown in fig 23 c show large fluctuation and randomness this results may be attributed to the complicated interaction between earthquake wave and current and more attentions should be paid for the sft in design construction and operation stages the present methods and model can be used to predict subsequent hydrodynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave current actions of more precisely and maturely for field applications 5 conclusions in this research the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current are experimentally investigated the following conclusions and suggestions can be drawn 1 based on wave current flume and a specially designed underwater shaking device a physical scaled model experiment of sft is presented to understand the dynamic behavior of sft subjected to the combined action of earthquake wave and current the present underwater shaking device can be used to experimentally investigate the dynamic behavior of marine structure subjected to the combination of earthquake and wave current excitations and has economical simple and reliable advantages 2 with three important judge rules the earthquake wave outputs from the underwater shaking device are verified to be reliable the relative error results of the free vibration frequency of sft between the results from test model and numerical model is less than 8 the experimental results are observed to conform the numerical results well validating the test with a relative error below 10 the present methods and model can be used to predict subsequent hydrodynamic behavior of sft subjected to combined earthquake and wave action of more precisely and maturely for field applications 3 from the results it can be found that earthquake has less effect on the dynamic response of sft that with flexible cable support which implies the excellent suppression ability for the sft to earthquake vibration sft has different seismic failure mechanism while compared with traditional bridges and tunnel with rigid support the high frequency and multi frequency fluctuations of anchor cables caused by earthquake excitation which may lead to the impact load alternate slack taut phenomena and fatigue failure for the cable increasing the possibility of cable breakage in the actual project the aseismic design of sft should pay much attentions to prevent the failure of anchorage foundation anti cable breakage and reasonable design for mooring system 4 based on varying effect factors e g type and pga of earthquake wave height and current velocity the dynamic response of sft subjected to independent and combined action of earthquake wave and current are analyzed systematically and studied comparatively the maximum tension amplification of the cable under independent earthquake can reach to 25 and the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube increases to 0 45 m s2 wave can respectively weaken the tension amplification of earthquake to 10 and increase the maximum horizontal acceleration of the tube by 40 the dynamic response of sft subjected to combined action of earthquake wave and current is not the simple superposition of that subjected to the independent earthquake wave and current besides the dynamic responses of sft show large randomness and fluctuation this may be attributed to the complicated interaction between earthquake wave and current 5 the underwater shaking table test is widely recognized as the most effective method to investigate the dynamic behavior of underwater structures under combination of earthquake wave current as the complicated mechanical mechanism of combined action of earthquake and wave there are no existed theoretical supports which can systematically explain the present experimental results at present only a few theoretical researches about the sft under the combined action of earthquake wave and current have been done but some assumptions were introduced in these researches neglecting the accuracy and validity of their calculations however qualitatively the total regularity and tendency of the present test results can be supported by existed theoretical researches in depth and sufficient theoretical supports for this study are still needed to develop in the future credit authorship contribution statement zhiwen wu conceptualization resources project administration writing

to the collision the results show that the model is effective and feasible for accurately extracting ship navigation safety information keywords ship encounter space spatial logical analysis optimal neighbor triangulation network collision risk 1 introduction at present maritime transportation is developing rapidly the united nations conference on trade and development unctad recently published a series of reports titled review of maritime transport 2020 showing that there are around 98 000 merchant ships with gross tonnage of 100 or greater globally yielding a total of 2 06 billion tons additionally according to unctad statistics the global seaborne trade reached 11 9 billion tons in 2019 accounting for approximately 80 90 of the world s total merchandise trade furthermore the seaborne trade is expected to reach an average annual growth of 3 4 from 2020 to 2024 however the rapid growth of the scale and the number of ships is also expected to increase the possibility of maritime traffic incidents the 1912 titanic disaster which killed more than 1 500 people was a landmark event that promoted the adoption of international marine traffic safety conventions however there have been dozens of serious marine traffic accidents around the world since the 1970s these include the running aground and sinking of the cruise ship costa concordia the sinking of the ferry sewol and the explosion and sinking of the tanker sanchi these incidents caused enormous casualties and property losses and had serious social effects the european maritime safety agency 2019 released an annual overview of maritime casualty statistics in 2019 showing that 23 073 offshore traffic incidents occurred over nearly a decade of these 54 4 were navigation errors with collisions and touching and grounding incidents accounting for 48 2 and 28 1 respectively general cargo ship incidents accounted for 43 8 for of the incidents the safety and shipping assessment report of allianz insurance company states that a total of 2 815 shipping accidents occurred throughout 2019 a year on year increase of 5 the data of global integrated shipping information system gisis of the international maritime organization imo are public we used the casualty and incident module in gisis to obtain ship incident information among these 1433 records were severe incidents 804 were serious and 276 were unimportant fig 1 shows the spatial information distribution of the severity of global maritime traffic incidents based on gis this figure shows that the coast of china singapore and malacca straits the east coast of malaysia the waters around the united kingdom the northern mediterranean and the western coast of europe are current hot spots for maritime accidents fig 2 shows the maritime incident type information in detail among these incidents the proportion of maritime incidents caused by ship collisions is up to 51 therefore the study of ship navigation hazard analysis and perception technology is related to human safety environmental protection and economic development and has thus always been a key subject that has gained the interest of countries around the world therefore this article focuses on a new method based on the spatial information platform for dividing the encounter space of ships and the analytical model of the spatial relationship the proposed method can accurately calculate the navigational spatial feature information of the target and provide spatial analysis results with spatial relationships and temporal and spatial attributes for ship navigation moreover it improves the assessment ability of ship encounter safety and can significantly improve the space perception and analysis ability of future ships intelligent navigation the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 provides an in depth analysis of the current development status advantages and disadvantages of navigation risk analysis methods section 3 introduces the ship encounter space algorithm and logical spatial relationship analytical model to verify the model s feasibility sections 4 and 5 introduce the data source information of the m t sanchi collision accident case and investigate a case study and demonstrate the analysis result of the proposed method respectively section 6 discusses the main research results advantages and relevance of the proposed method finally section 7 provides a summary and outlines further study 2 literature review recently imo has continuously developed and improved a series of international conventions to enhance marine traffic safety these international conventions can be used to guide a ship s evasive actions most countries have adopted imo issued formal safety assessments imo 2002 2003 to judge maritime navigation safety and accelerate the research and development of other navigation risk analysis methods to solve the problems of safe ship navigation scholars have conducted extensive research and produced notable results first relevant research on ship navigation risk identification can be roughly divided into developments based on the safe encounter distance and encounter time as well as the ship domain and arena in the early days the most considered factors in ship encountering risk assessment methods were the distance of the closest point of approaching dcpa and times to the closest point of approaching tcpa kearon 1977 these two factors are considered to be an essential indicator of the spatial and temporal aspects determining collision risk in the automatic radar plotting aid arpa based on dcpa and tcpa dalian maritime university researchers constructed a model for calculating spatiotemporal collision risk wu and zheng 2001 zheng and wu 2002 liu et al 2020 built a spatial analysis model suitable for the collision risk analysis of multiship encounter situations based on dcpa using a gis platform however the traditional definition of the same safe encounter distance based on dcpa and tcpa does not cover all factors e g motion parameters and encounter relationships that affect collision risk for considering the incomplete hazard identification owing to dcpa and tcpa issues a field of theories based on ship domain has been proposed since the 1970s fuji and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 the ship domain is a safe encounter distance model that considers ship dimensions motion parameters and encounter situations to solve incomplete consideration defects of traditional methods based on cpa and tcpa in recent years ship domain theory has continued to be the focus of attention in the maritime safety field and many achievements have been published for example ship domain models based on automatic identification system ais data hansen et al 2013 gao and shi 2020 chen et al 2018 ship domain models based on expert knowledge and artificial intelligence pietrzykowski et al 2009 2012 chen et al 2019 and ship domain models based on analytical expression wang and chin 2016 dinh and im 2016 among others hazard identification algorithms continue to improve with increasing research the marine algorithm is the most widely used among many algorithms szlapczynski 2006 investigated a domain model ellipse and proposed the degree of domain violation and time to domain violation concepts with solutions szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 these concepts and methods have been successfully applied to the avoidance decision of stand on vessel and give way vessel szlapczynski et al 2018 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 realized a visual model of collision hazard improvements associated with research on ship collision risk identification and intelligent collision avoidance algorithms have achieved overall good results scholars optimize and upgrade navigation risk assessment methods however in a real navigational geographic environment ship safety information usually presents challenges such as a large amount of data difficulty in data fusion redundancy and conflicts among information additionally a ship has interlaced and complex spatial relationships which can result in ambiguity complexity and navigation information inaccuracies meaning that navigational spatial relationship information cannot be accurately extracted gis has a strong ability to solve problems in spatial relationship reasoning and spatial distribution law analysis navigation risk analysis in a spatial information platform can improve the use of navigation safety data and gis provides powerful libraries for spatial analysis and graphics which will help simplify the data analysis process and visually represent ship encounters more intuitively general spatial relations can be divided into distance orientation topological and logical relations haowen and ren zhong 2003 these are also spatial relationships that must be considered in maritime safety scholars have studied spatial distribution patterns chaode et al 2008 the spatial proximity relationship between points lines and surfaces brennan and martin 2012 and the nearest distance analysis jingwei s et al 2017 of spatial elements using the theory of spatial relationship at present gis spatial analysis is seldom used in marine navigation safety analyses or ship collision risk calculation however in the navigation safety field there is an urgent need for relevant research methods that can be used to analyze navigation space characteristics to provide accurate spatial characteristics and attribute information for navigation objectives and improve ship encounter safety assessment capabilities therefore this paper proposes a new method for dividing the ship encounter space and spatial logical relationship analysis based on the spatial information platform the model analyzes the logical relationship between the spatial division of the ship s navigation data and the ship encounter space based on the spatial distribution spatial structure and encounter characteristics of the ship navigation data hence the logical characteristics and dangerous trend information of the ship encounter space in different navigation spaces are extracted and the purpose of solving the problem of ship navigation risk analysis is completed fig 3 illustrates the detailed research framework of the ship encounter space division and spatial logic relationship analysis model fig 4 shows the overall flow of calculation and analysis of the proposed method 3 materials and methods 3 1 method ideas and symbol description the analytical model of ship encounter space logic proposed in this paper it is divided into four calculation and analysis steps fig 5 shows specific analysis and implementation process of the proposed method simultaneously we have summarized the meaning of formulas and symbols involved in the method as shown in table 1 it shows symbol description in the text and formulas of method 3 2 ship encounter space situation classification ships coming from different directions converge to form various ship encounter spaces wang et al 2017 the three types of ship encounter situations in the international regulations for preventing collision at sea guidelines are head on crossing and overtaking to establish an analytical model of ship encounter logical relationships and simplify the steps of hazard calculation the encounter situation is classified based on the target ship location and encounter situation types zheng 2000 fig 6 shows the results of ship encounter situation classification when the target ship located in region f the relative bearing is 355 r b 360 or 0 r b 5 and the course difference between the two ships is 175 δ c 185 the specific responsibility for avoidance in that case is that both ships alter course to starboard and pass port to port regions a and b indicate starboard crossing situations including small angle vertical and large angle crossings 5 r b 112 5 180 δ c 360 in this case the ship shall stay out of the way of the target ship similarly a ship shall stay out of the way when overtaking a target ship from more than 22 5 abaft her beam r b and δ c are the relative bearing of the incoming vessels and the course difference between the two ships respectively 3 3 ship encounter space division method this research uses the spatial structure analysis method to divide the navigation space in an orderly manner and calculate the logical spatial relationship between ships this is one of the key issues in safe ship navigation based on descartes idea of dividing the space using the convex domain tokita et al 2004 combined with the voronoi diagram and delaunay triangulation theory delaunay et al 1934 this study proposes an algorithm for calculating and solving the geometric relationships of the ship encounter space fig 7 depicts a schematic of the effect of dividing the encounter space of numerous ships in a specific range the voronoi polygon and delaunay triangulation network are a type of spatial structure analysis method that can accurately express and address the distribution state and characteristics spatial patterns spatial neighborhood characteristics and the spatial influence range of spatial entities when ships navigate in complex and dense waters there are many ships or obstacles around them numerous ships exhibit interlaced and complex spatial relationships coexisting with dynamic and static states and discretely distributed spatial relationships the establishment of the neighboring triangulation networks can simplify the spatial organizational structure and enhance the computing efficiency therefore there is an urgent need for ship navigation safety analysis that can be used to analyze spatial navigation features to provide accurate information on the trend of encountering danger from the ship navigation perception the voronoi diagram and delaunay triangulation network is a geometric structure with broad applications they are powerful algorithms for performing spatial geometric measurements and analyses niu et al 2018 luque et al 2011 ledoux and gold 2008 the proposed ship encounter space division algorithm is based on the excellent features of the voronoi diagram and delaunay triangulation network such as the sphere of influence and nearest neighbor characteristics the optimal neighboring triangulation network refers to a spatial geometric structure suitable for navigational hazard analysis where a specific sea area is considered as a space a ship is considered as a point and encounter and spatial proximity features are considered as the criteria the divided ship encounter space is a geometric structure formed after duality based on the optimal neighboring triangulation it is a convex polygon where each ship is the central point the divided ship encounter space realizes the spatial perspective and reflects the spatial influence range between ships the optimal neighboring triangulation network and divided ship encounter space provide the necessary structural information of the geometric elements in the early stage for the feature analysis of the encounter space fig 8 depicts the detailed segmentation principle of the ship encounter space in this figure the initial ship position v v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 v 6 v 7 v 8 v 9 v 10 v 11 v 12 is considered as the point elements of the ship encounter space division a principal step of the ship encounter space division is establishing several two dimensional coordinates with each ship as the origin a uniform coordinate axis with v 8 as the origin is established and a 360 rotation is performed based on the ship encounter features and adjacent values to obtain v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 v 6 v 7 the first group of the triangulation t v 8 v 1 v 2 v 8 v 2 v 3 v 8 v 3 v 4 v 8 v 4 v 5 v 8 v 5 v 6 v 8 v 6 v 7 with v 8 as the center point is constructed by obtaining an object point similarly the unified coordinate axis of the origin is established to form the initial triangulation network then the dual graph of triangulation is the range of the convex polygon corresponding to each ship in fig 8 step 4 refers to the dual graph extraction process the dual graph is associated with a plane graph and both can be transformed the establishment of the dual graph is based on the characteristics of the ship encounters such as the relative distance course speed and relative bearing during sailing at sea the outer circles are extracted using the triangulation network formed by combining the adjacent relationships between ships and then the centers of all outer circles are connected to obtain the dual graph which is the new result of the ship encounter space each edge of the convex polygon in fig 8 has two points and each point has three edges based on the eider s relation r r v r e 2 the constructed optimal neighboring triangulation network shows the following mathematical relation 1 r e 3 r 6 r v 2 r 5 where r r e and r v are the growing points edges and join points in a convex polygon diagram respectively eq 1 establishes that the spatial organization of the segmentation results shows a linear structure any point and the discrete ship in the convex polygon formed in the encounter space of the ship exhibit the characteristics of the optimal proximity and each convex polygon can reflect the spatial influence range of the discrete point to a certain extent ships sailing at sea are like multiple points that are discretely distributed in space and because of the speed and course of the ship there will always be certain encounters between ships the ship encounter space division algorithm proposed in this paper can segment and analyze ship navigation data such as the spatial position and topological relationship between ships the proposed algorithm takes the marine radar detection area as a certain range space and uses each ship as a growth element based on the euclidean relationship and encounter characteristics it grows to form the convex polygonal range of the space corresponding to each ship fig 9 shows the convex polygon that results after the encounter spaces of multiple ships within a certain range are divided based on the space division results of the ship encounter in fig 9 the encounter space is divided into six convex polygons then the basic vector elements i e points lines and polygons are used to describe the basic spatial relationships in the encounter space in fig 9 table 2 shows the detailed information of the relationship between the convex polygonal space elements and the structure after dividing the ship encounter space in fig 9 furthermore assume that the set of ship targets is 2 w w 1 x 1 y 1 w 2 x 2 y 2 w n x n y n r 2 n 6 where w represents the set of all ships w 1 x 1 y 1 represents the coordinate information of the first ship in the encounter space w n x n y n represents the coordinate information of the n th ship target in the ship set w and n 6 implies that there are six ship targets in the current hypothetical encounter space for w x y r 2 w i x i y i and w j x j y j exist then eq 3 expresses the encounter space division area of ship i 3 d i v s i w i w w j w i j i j n where d i v s i represents the result of the encounter space after the division w i represents the location information of ship i and w j represents the location information of ship j in the equation w i w x i x 2 y i y 2 then eq 4 is used to express the encounter space division results of ship set w 4 w d i v d i v s 1 d i v s 2 d i v s n n 6 where w d i v indicates that the divided ships meet the space assembly d i v s 1 is the result of the encounter space after the division of the first ship and d i v s n is the result of the encounter space after the division of the n th ship 3 4 analytical model of logical relations in the ship encounter space 3 4 1 spatial neighbor relation analysis in the ship encounter space in ship navigation many ships present a spatial relationship that is staggered complex both dynamic and static and discretely distributed in this spatial relationship the spatial distribution law between ships and the geometric features implicit in the spatial organization s form zhang et al 2016 are part of the spatial topological relationship and spatial logical relationship these spatial relationships play an important role in spatial modeling and spatial analysis wang and zhang 2019 yu et al 2016 in this paper the convex polygons dividing the ship encounter space combined with the optimal neighbor triangulation network achieve the calculation and analysis of the proximity relationships of the ship encounter space this is a key step for mining spatial geometric laws and analyzing neighboring relations which is beneficial improving the accuracy of the spatial analysis of the hazard degree of ships in the later period to determine the neighbor relationship of the ship s encounter space the optimal neighboring triangulation in the encounter space is constructed based on the results of the division of the ship encounter space combined with the ship s euclidean distance euclidean direction position encounter parameters and other information next the method defines the k th order neighbor relationship between control point first assume that there is a control point set target on a finite convex domain in a two dimensional cartesian space 5 o o 1 o 2 o n 3 n o i o j o i j 1 2 n where o represents the set of control points in the convex domain and 3 n implies that this point set is not less than three points o i and o j represent the two point features in the convex domain then the k th order neighbor relationship of any point in the convex polygon can be defined as n k o i o j x d x o j d x n k 1 o i k 0 i f k 2 o j n k 2 o i 6 n 0 o i o i where x is any point on the plane n k o i is a set of points with k order neighbor to point o i and d x o j represents the euclidean distance between points x and o j thus eq 6 can be used to define the k th order neighborhood relationship of the space target after the division of the ship encounter space the space after o i and o j is divided into o i v and o j v assuming that o i v o j v exists when the minimum number of connections between o i and o j is k and v o r o i v o r o j then k is called the v o r o n o i distance between o i and o j which is also called the k th order neighborhood relationship between o i and o j expressed as 7 o i k a d j o j d v o i v o j v k here o i v and o j v represent the space divided by o i and o j respectively k a d j implies that o i and o j exhibit a k th order neighborhood relationship and d v o i v o j v represents the neighborhood relationship after segmentation when d v o i o j 1 it is called geometrically directly adjacent and the two convex polygons have a common boundary expressed by g e o im m a d j when the spatial topological relationship is separated it is referred to as being geometrically separated adjacent expressed by g e o s e p a d j eqs 8 and 9 express two different spatial neighbor relations 8 o i g e o im m a d j o j d v o i v o j v 1 9 o i g e o s e p a d j o j d v o i v o j v 1 furthermore to accurately describe the spatial relationship between ships we regard the spatial entity as a set of points güting 1988 this article introduces a 3 3 matrix chen et al 2001 long and li 2013 that describes the spatial neighbor relationship and uses a 9 intersection model to judge the neighbor relation of the ship encounter space refer to eq 10 for details 10 r i j a b a b a b a b v a b a b a b v a b a b d v a b here r i j a b describes the spatial relationship result between encounter spaces a and b a and b are the encounter space boundaries of a and b respectively a and b are the internal areas of the encounter spaces a and b respectively a and b are the complement of the encounter spaces a and b respectively when a and b are directly adjacent in space the matrix can be expressed as 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 when a and b belong to the k order neighborhood relationship the matrix can be expressed as 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 k the use of the 9 intersection model can not only describe the k th order neighborhood relationship of the ship s encounter space in detail it can also describe other spatial relationships such as the adjacency connectivity closure inclusion and consistency of the ship s encounter space it is one of the more successful formal gis models of spatial relations in china 3 4 2 analytical method of approximation relations of ship encounter space approximation space theory first established by professor v a efremovi in 1952 from the perspective of space topology is relatively mature in the application of spatial relationship analysis vakarelov et al 2001 third et al 2007 an analysis model of the approximation relation of a ship encounter space is established using approximation space theory and is used for reasoning and calculation of the space approximation relations of convex polygons in a ship s encounter space the model can express the approximation relationship of the ship encounter space in detail based on the spatial information platform this paper takes the main ship as the point layer and the convex polygon formed by segmentation in the free space as the approximation object to be analyzed the paper then uses the approximation relation analysis model to calculate the approximation relation to the main ship in an encounter space consisting of different target ships fig 10 shows the calculation and analysis vector diagram of the ship encounter space s approximation relationship g p g p 1 g p 1 g p 2 and q p q p 1 q p 1 q p 2 are the encounter spaceset after the main ships g and q are divided respectively according to the assumption in fig 10 q p and g p include the two dimensional point set p p 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 p n these n points constitute the vertices of the convex polygon in the encounter space when the interior angle formed by the line segments p i 1 p i and p i p i 1 i e the angle formed in the bounded area enclosed by the polygon is not greater than π p i is defined as a convex point if n vertices are all convex points the polygon is called convex brandon and ivo 2007 all the structures constructed in the encounter space of the ship in fig 10 are convex polygons to calculate the spatial approximation relationship between the main ship and the convex hull set in fig 10 first the calculation method of the nearest neighbor point between the convex polygon and the main ship is defined 11 n n g p q g p i g p i arg min gp d q g p g p g p here n n g p q represents the subset of the nearest neighbors point of the convex hull set of main ship q and g p d q g p i is the euclidean distance of the convex hull set of the main ship q and g p g p i is the element in the convex hull set of g p to calculate the shortest distance from a point to a convex polygon it is assumed that the edges of the convex polygon set g p contain p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j n p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j fig 10 each side exhibits a normal vector n i pointing to the inside of the polygon then the set of visible edges must be solved first therefore we use eqs 12 and 13 to calculate the visible edges of the ship encounter space set convex polygon g p 12 w g p x u u n x p 1 p 2 n x p 2 p 3 n x p i p j 13 w g p y s s n y p 1 p 2 n y p 2 p 3 n y p i p j where w g p x and w g p y are the direction relationship between the point elements x and y and the normal vector of each side of the convex polygon set g p we can determine the visible edge based on whether n x p i p j is greater than zero n i is the normal vector of each side of the convex polygon u is the normal vector calculation result set of point element x and the convex shape and s is the normal vector calculation result set of point element y and the convex shape 14 m p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j i j r 15 m p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j i j r if w g p x n p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j is the visible side relative to point x m is the set of visible edges in the encounter space when w g p y n the edge of p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j is not visible relative to point y m implies that g p meets the set of invisible edges of the convex polygon after obtaining the visible edges of the convex shape the specific space approximation size can be calculated according to fig 10 the ship encounter space polygons q p and g p eqs 16 and 17 are used to express the calculation method of the space approximation distance and the space approximation degree of the space polygon where the target point meets the ship 16 s g p x m i n d x g p 1 d x g p 2 d x g p i 17 q b s x t 2 s x t 1 t here s g p x is the minimum distance between the target point x and the visible edge set m i e the spatial approximation distance q b is the spatial approximation degree of the convex polygon g p s x t 1 is the convex polygon at the first moment polygon g p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 in fig 10 s x t 2 is the convex polygon at the second moment polygon g p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 in fig 10 and t represents a time period if the q b value is large the encounter space is considered more dangerous with respect to point x 3 4 3 quantitative analysis of navigation risk following the laws of spatial geography spatial relationships are a key factor for mutual influence between targets lee and bednarz 2009 therefore the calculation and depth analysis of the ship s spatial neighbor relation and spatial approximation relation are realized through the spatial logical relationship of the ship encounter space and a convex polygon with geometric direct proximity and approximation is obtained for a ship target in an unsafe convex polygon the risk of ship collision can be further quantitatively analyzed by dcpa tcpa or the ship domain method however relying solely on dcpa and tcpa for collision avoidance decision making at sea no longer meets the accuracy requirements of ship automatic avoidance decision making therefore this paper refers to the ship domain model of coldwell 1983 and a ship domain model with offset values proposed by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 to quantitatively analyze ship collision risks the model considered the heading speed and size of the target ship meanwhile the scale factor introduced by szlapczynski 2016 can improve the ability to recognize the danger posed by targets with similar motion parameters and is more vigilant to ships on the front right meaning it complies with colregs requirements fig 11 shows a diagram for calculating collision risk based on the ship domain fig 11 a is a diagram of scaling factor calculation 18 c r a 1 f 2 min a 2 t min t s 2 a 3 f 2 t 1 2 here f t is the scope of the ship when it is zoomed in and out when the target ship is at the boundary of the domain f min is a circular domain of a quotient of a predicted dcpa and the radius of the smallest acceptable distance between the ship and the target object and c r is the ship s collision risk t min is the arrival time at the nearest meeting point and t s is the time required to avoid a collision a 1 a 2 and a 3 represent the influential coefficients of different ships in terms of main dimensions ship types and sailing waters respectively a greater c r value signifies a higher probability of collision and greater time urgency 4 application of the methodology case study 4 1 background introduction of application examples and data preprocessing this section uses data provided by china s ministry of transport as the basis for conducting simulation application research on the model s validity according to an investigation of the chinese maritime department at 20 00 cst utc 08 on january 6 2018 the panamanian flagged tanker sanchi and the bulk carrier cf crystal out of hong kong collided approximately 160 nautical miles east of the yangtze river estuary the collision caused the sanchi to catch fire at the time of the accident it was cloudy with good visibility northerly winds of magnitude 4 to 5 and light waves the geographic coordinates of the collision are 30 50 00 north latitude and 124 56 00 longitude the waters of the incident were open and not near any shipwrecks reefs or other obstructions and the water depth of the chart was approximately 55 m at the time of the incident the cr crystal was loaded with approximately 640 000 tons of grain and had 14 m of draught and a speed of 13 2 knots the two ships sailed in opposite directions and surrounding vessels at that time included ccl ningbo maersk shams trf mongstad mantucket zhejiang daiyu 03187 zhejiang daiyu 01272 zhejiang daiyu 01215 and zhejiang daiyu 02151 marine traffic data provide basic technical parameters of the sanchi as shown in table 3 table 4 introduces the detailed information source of ship related data first we use the arcgis platform to perform spatial preprocessing such as spatial registration and the geometric correction of accident and navigation data to determine the spatial position information of the ship fig 12 a and b show the surrounding sea area and navigation information of the surrounding ships at the time of the incident the red dots in fig 12 a indicate the collision 30 50 00 n 124 56 00 e and sinking 28 22 00 n 125 55 00 e positions fig 12 c shows the trajectory of the two ships before the collision twenty minutes before the collision the sanchi and the cf crystal had already formed a cross encounter state according to article 15 of colreg the sanchi should have paid close attention to the navigation on the starboard side to avoid colliding while crossing however the incident was caused by the failure of the officer of the watch to give way which resulted in serious consequences this article takes the sanchi incident as a model research case and uses radar imagery from before the collision as the database the accuracy of the model is then verified by analyzing the dangerous situation of the ships in different time periods this analysis provides navigation aids for ship safety early warnings and pilot navigation decision making 5 results 5 1 ship encounter space division in this research the c programming language and gis components are used to develop the ship encounter space division algorithm module table 5 describes the software and hardware configuration information of the algorithm design presentation and execution in detail first the target ship is set as the growth element in the spatial information platform and actual spatial position information is input the division model then analyzes the encounter space based on an analytical geometric method using the convex domain division space and the optimal triangle at the same time each ship is divided into separate growth elements based on their euclidean distance euclidean direction proximity relationship and encounter characteristics lastly the encounter space of each ship is divided this paper selects navigation information from before the collision between the sanchi and cf crystal as the data source and divides the ship encounter space by analyzing the sanchi s encounter scene and track information the collision can be divided into four stages in the model research at 19 31 the distance between the two vessels is more than six nautical miles which is the free movement stage two vessels in a crossing situation in this case the sanchi and cf crystal belong to the early action stage at six nautical miles rule 8 of the colregs states any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the rule of this part and if the circumstances of the case admit be positive made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship in these circumstances collision avoidance measures such as stop reverse and turn right can be taken the best measure to avoid collisions at such a time is to turn to the right and carefully check the effectiveness of anti collision actions at 19 42 the distance between the sanchi and cf crystal was only about three nautical miles which places the ships in the action stage at 19 46 the vessels are 1 6 nautical miles apart collision avoidance is most helpful in this stage as the collision will be inevitable otherwise fig 13 shows the results of the space division of ship encounters in four periods in detail based on the space division results shown in fig 13 the encounter space of the target ship within the radar display range of the sanchi is constantly changing and the sanchi s encounter situation continues to be in the encounter space of ship c in addition this study analyzes the euclidean distance and euclidean direction in the space of the divided ship encounter the euclidean analysis took 15 as the space interval which was divided in 24 directions after which the ship objects in each direction were analyzed the analysis results show that each convex polygon contains only one ship object and the distance between any point in 24 directions and the ship point in each divided encounter space is less than the distance to the ship point of other polygons fig 14 specifically shows the results of euclidean analysis based on the 15 24 ship encounter space the next section describes the establishment of the optimal neighbor triangulation network based on the divided ship encounter space in detail 5 2 construction of optimal neighbor triangulation network in the encounter space of ships the element information and attribute information of the ship encounter space are segmented using the ship encounter space division algorithm proposed in the previous chapter thereby establishing convex polygons that correspond to different ships next the model further calculates and generates the optimal neighboring triangulation network based on the spatial geometric characteristics of the convex polygons after which it analyzes spatial logic information and spatial association between ships based on that triangulation network the optimal neighbor triangulation network of the ship encounter space the model constructs usually has the characteristics of empty circle nearest neighbor regional optimality and so on which can reflect the geometric logical relationship neighbor relationship and approximation relationship of the ship encounter space in detail the results of different triangulations represent the encounter status of different ships which helps improve the accuracy of the spatial analysis of the encounter hazard based on the results of the ship encounter space division in the four time periods before the collision of sanchi and cf crystal the model uses the spatial position and topological relationships between ships and the characteristics of spatial elements and attributes in the encounter space to conduct spatial associations such as layered superposition and intersection to construct optimal neighboring triangulation network of ships fig 15 shows the optimal neighbor triangulation network results for the four periods the next section analyzes and calculates the logical relationships of the ship encounter space 5 3 analysis of the logical analysis results of ship encounter space the spatial logical relationship analytical model described in section 3 calculates the spatial logical relationships i e neighboring relationship and approximation relationship in the ship encounter space of the ship at four time periods based on the established optimal neighbor triangulation network after which we extract the navigation safety information and potential spatial structure relationship between the ships we conducted dynamic analysis of the optimal neighboring triangulation network of the ship encounter space at the four intervals and obtained results corresponding to the spatial logical relationships in those four time periods fig 16 shows the calculation results fig 16 a shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 31 during this period the sanchi s radar detected nine ship targets ships b c h j and a all belong to the geometric direct adjacency relationship 56 of the ships belong to the second order adjacency relationship and ship a belongs to the third order adjacency relationship in addition ship c is near the peak position of the curve indicating a high spatial association between ships c and a and a greater probability of encountering ships fig 16 b shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 35 at this moment the radar aboard the m t sanchi detected 10 ship targets approximately 55 6 of the ships have a greater degree of spatial proximity to ship a among these ships c d and e are all near the wave crest indicating that the spatial neighbor and spatial approximation values of these three ships and ship a are relatively large therefore the probability of encountering ships is also high so it is necessary to always be vigilant about the state of navigation the spatial logical relationships of the other ships are relatively discrete and near the average value so the degree of spatial correlation is low and there is no obvious risk of collision fig 16 c shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 42 here five ships c h e d and j and ship a are adjacent to each other ships e and c continue to be at the crest of the wave and their spatial approximation relationship is also significantly higher than that of other ships this indicates that ships e and c pose the greatest danger to ship a meaning that collision avoidance measures should be taken in time in accordance with regulations the encounter space of the other ships has a high degree of dispersion and insignificant spatial neighbor relationships and there is no spatial approximation relationship with ship a this indicates that the navigational interference between the other ships is low and there is no danger of collision fig 16 d shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 46 the results show that most ships still maintain a high spatial neighbor relationship with ship a among these ships e and ship a are first order adjacent relations and there is a continuous and strong spatial approximation relationship with a euclidean distance is only 1 6 nautical miles ship e ship has the most restrictive degree and highest spatial correlation to ship a s navigation space meaning it is very prone to collision and has always been a collision threat to ship a at this time ships c and a are still in the first order adjacent state but the spatial approximation relationship has disappeared and the spatial logical relationship has also been at the average level furthermore based on the analytical results of the logical relationship of the encounter space the model calculates and obtains the specific spatial approximation value of the ship encounter space for targets that are directly adjacent as well as spatial approximation fig 17 shows the calculation results of the spatial approximation relationship between ships c d and e and the sanchi at four periods at the same time combined with the ship domain method the model further calculates the ship s collision risk results fig 18 shows the calculation results of the danger parameters of ships c d and e and the sanchi at four period fig 17 a shows the changing trend of the space approximation distances of ships c d and e and the sanchi at four periods the three target ships and the sanchi showed a continuous approaching spatial situation the change trends of ships c and d are relatively gentle but the approaching situation of ship e ship is more and the approximation distance gradually converges to 0 showing that ship e has the greatest degree of approach to the sanchi and is very prone to collision fig 17 b shows the approximate size of the encounter space in three periods here the approximation degree of ship e is getting larger and the approximation degree of ships c and d to the sanchi is slowly decreasing this shows that the probability of an encounter between ships c and d against the sanchi is declining fig 17 c and d are the spline fitting results of the spatial approximation values to more intuitively obtain the spatial approximation trend of ships c e and d and the sanchi 5 4 verification of model accuracy and reliability in this research we propose a new method for the division of ship encounter space and logical relationship analysis it can calculate and analyze the spatial distribution and spatial structure and encounter characteristics between ships to identify dangerous situations of the ships to verify the model s accuracy and reliability we use the analytical results of the spatial logic relationship the topological analysis value and the results of the scaling factor to perform error calculations this paper uses the correlation method to calculate consistency with other models and selects the correlation coefficient to measure the closeness of the linear relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable we use the classic pearson correlation coefficient cosine similarity and spearman correlation coefficient to measure the closeness of the relationship between variables we then compare the model results in this paper with the overall accuracy of previous calculation methods for ship collision risk table 6 shows the result of correlation coefficient of spatial logic analysis results the spatial logical relationship has a strong correlation with the topological analysis value and scaling factor both of which are above 90 additionally fig 19 compares average results of the absolute values of correlations 6 discussion this research is based on ship encounter space division and spatial logic analysis to conduct spatial analysis of navigation safety between ships at present many scholars have also proposed methods for calculating ship collision risk first in ship domain methods scholars use the approximate ellipse domain method to express the safety distance and conduct collision avoidance research szlapczynski et al 2018 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 studied ship domains in open water which have asymmetric and irregular shapes and found that the ship domain shape changes dynamically depending on the situation that study can be considered an expansion of davis s dynamic world davis et al 1980 in the study of ship safety navigation and navigation systems goerlandt et al 2015 analyzed a ship collision risk warning system that which considers parameters such as dcpa tcpa bow cross range bow cross time relative position range time and visibility to achieve a risk level analysis of ship collision pietrzykowski et al 2009 introduced artificial intelligence methods integrating ais enc arpa gnss and other multi source navigation information pietrzykowski et al 2012 to achieve intelligently learning navigation knowledge and develop a navigation decision support system these algorithms have generally achieved good results in calculating ship navigation risk however if they are to be further promoted and applied to actual ship navigation and more in depth research on the analysis and mining of navigation risk information should be conducted if the spatial information platform can support the model the real electronic navigation chart is used as the bottom layer and other navigation data information with accurate spatial characteristics is superimposed for risk analysis which will simplify the analysis process richer and more accurate navigation risk information and other potential spatial relationship characteristics can be extracted liu et al 2020 used a topological analysis model based on gis spatial analysis methods and cpa to obtain a ship s spatial topological relationship and navigational space safety our proposed model is comparable with other collision risk algorithms while a ship is sailing the speed course distance and bearing of the surrounding ships are factors that influence the safe navigation of the main ship in solving the problem of ship collision risk warning the ship domain model szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 is the latest solution superior to dcpa and tcpa this research considers ship collision risk as the idea of the model positioning and proposes a new analytical model for segmenting and extracting spatial relationships of the ship encounter space in a spatial information platform combined with the ship domain method and is used for ship navigation risk analysis this method can improve the utilization of navigational safety data and exhibits a powerful gis ability to explore the spatial relationships and analyze problems related to spatial distribution laws it uses geographic information data comprising spatial location distribution shape distance proximity bearing and topological relationships to achieve a qualitative or quantitative analysis of the spatial relationship between ships using geometric analyses mathematical modeling geographic calculations and other methods the spatial information platform also provides a powerful spatial analysis model library and a visualization graphics library rendering the navigational information into a dedicated navigation map we simplify the data analysis process to analyze the navigation data in a more realistic geographical environment moreover we adopt various visualization methods to more intuitively detect the ship encounter space hazard information so that the navigator can quickly understand the current navigation safety situation the proposed model can combine and analyze the spatial relationships and attribute information of ship navigation data and obtain the spatial characteristics between ships more effectively and intuitively thus improving space assessment and encounter safety additionally the proposed model can further extract potential spatial features such as the spatial neighborhood relation and approximation relation of ships during navigation and measure the logical spatial relationships between ships more accurately intuitively and in detail thus it provides spatial analysis results with spatial relationships and temporal and spatial attributes for the intelligent obstacle avoidance of ships in different sailing waters and reduces the complexity and uncertainty of the navigation process after calculating the accuracy rate the overall correlation result was 94 08 the average error was approximately 5 92 and the overall error was between 7 8 and 0 37 furthermore according to the computer environment configuration in table 5 this research calculates the time running efficiency of the proposed method and performs a comparative analysis with some existing models the comparative analysis results are shown in fig 20 the results prove that the proposed model can accurately extract the hazard information and navigational spatial relationship between ships and the time operation efficiency has improved this model has been successfully implemented in a navigation hazard analysis of the collision between the m t sanchi and m v cf crystal based on the analysis results of the logical relationship of the ship encounter space m v cf crystal and m t sanchi always have a logical spatial relationship directly adjacent and approximate to each other and m v cf crystal continues to be at the peak position of the result value of the logical spatial relationship thus m v cf crystal shows the characteristics of the most restrictive degree and highest spatial relevance with respect to the m t sanchi s navigation space forming a very dangerous spatial situation which is also consistent with the actual situation therefore the proposed method can meet ship navigation safety assessment needs 7 conclusion and future work because ships have interlaced and complex spatial relationships in the navigation space encounter information is often vague and complicated to improve the ability to analyze the spatial relationships of target ships and extract information about navigational hazard trends this article proposes an analytical model of the spatial division and spatial logic relationship of ships in the encounter space based on gis technology the proposed model uses constructed convex polygons of the ships and the optimal neighboring triangulation network which can not only be used to analyze the logical relationship of the encounter space but also further extract the potential navigational spatial relationship features such as spatial proximity and spatial approximation value lastly the model obtains information on the hazard trends of ships in different sailing states and reduces ambiguity in navigation therefore the proposed model can provide ship pilots with accurate and rich navigation spatial feature analysis results and collision hazard information under different navigation situations in this article a simulated application of the model is conducted with data from the collision incident between the m t sanchi and m v cf crystal the results show that the model can effectively analyze and extract spatial relationships between the ship s navigation and the dangerous situation thereby improving the ability to evaluate navigation space safety in the future we will further apply the gis spatial analysis algorithm to navigation safety research for extracting richer potential safety features of the navigation space this study is a preliminary attempt and deficiencies and limitations in many aspects must be addressed to further improve the optimization and perfect the model we will further combine the advantages of spatial structure analysis methods voronoi polygons delaunay triangulation network etc when establishing the encounter space geometric network more navigation characteristics will be considered to assist the ship s safe navigation in waters with complex spatial relationships such as straight sections turning sections and multiple obstacles to improve the spatial perception and analysis capabilities of future smart ships in dangerous navigation areas fig 21 is a future

20187,to improve the ability to analyze the spatial relationship between target ships this study proposes a method for dividing the ship encounter space and analyzing spatial logical relationships

characteristics of ships in this model it is necessary to divide ship encounter spaces to form a new spatial data model the model then analyzes the spatial logical relationship between the optimal neighboring triangulation network and convex polygons in the ship encounter space and lastly obtains the trend information of the encounter danger and features of the encounter in the ship s navigation this study conducted a model simulation using data of the m t sanchi and m v cf crystal collision on january 6 2018 and analyzed the collision risk characteristics during four periods prior to the collision the results show that the model is effective and feasible for accurately extracting ship navigation safety information keywords ship encounter space spatial logical analysis optimal neighbor triangulation network collision risk 1 introduction at present maritime transportation is developing rapidly the united nations conference on trade and development unctad recently published a series of reports titled review of maritime transport 2020 showing that there are around 98 000 merchant ships with gross tonnage of 100 or greater globally yielding a total of 2 06 billion tons additionally according to unctad statistics the global seaborne trade reached 11 9 billion tons in 2019 accounting for approximately 80 90 of the world s total merchandise trade furthermore the seaborne trade is expected to reach an average annual growth of 3 4 from 2020 to 2024 however the rapid growth of the scale and the number of ships is also expected to increase the possibility of maritime traffic incidents the 1912 titanic disaster which killed more than 1 500 people was a landmark event that promoted the adoption of international marine traffic safety conventions however there have been dozens of serious marine traffic accidents around the world since the 1970s these include the running aground and sinking of the cruise ship costa concordia the sinking of the ferry sewol and the explosion and sinking of the tanker sanchi these incidents caused enormous casualties and property losses and had serious social effects the european maritime safety agency 2019 released an annual overview of maritime casualty statistics in 2019 showing that 23 073 offshore traffic incidents occurred over nearly a decade of these 54 4 were navigation errors with collisions and touching and grounding incidents accounting for 48 2 and 28 1 respectively general cargo ship incidents accounted for 43 8 for of the incidents the safety and shipping assessment report of allianz insurance company states that a total of 2 815 shipping accidents occurred throughout 2019 a year on year increase of 5 the data of global integrated shipping information system gisis of the international maritime organization imo are public we used the casualty and incident module in gisis to obtain ship incident information among these 1433 records were severe incidents 804 were serious and 276 were unimportant fig 1 shows the spatial information distribution of the severity of global maritime traffic incidents based on gis this figure shows that the coast of china singapore and malacca straits the east coast of malaysia the waters around the united kingdom the northern mediterranean and the western coast of europe are current hot spots for maritime accidents fig 2 shows the maritime incident type information in detail among these incidents the proportion of maritime incidents caused by ship collisions is up to 51 therefore the study of ship navigation hazard analysis and perception technology is related to human safety environmental protection and economic development and has thus always been a key subject that has gained the interest of countries around the world therefore this article focuses on a new method based on the spatial information platform for dividing the encounter space of ships and the analytical model of the spatial relationship the proposed method can accurately calculate the navigational spatial feature information of the target and provide spatial analysis results with spatial relationships and temporal and spatial attributes for ship navigation moreover it improves the assessment ability of ship encounter safety and can significantly improve the space perception and analysis ability of future ships intelligent navigation the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 provides an in depth analysis of the current development status advantages and disadvantages of navigation risk analysis methods section 3 introduces the ship encounter space algorithm and logical spatial relationship analytical model to verify the model s feasibility sections 4 and 5 introduce the data source information of the m t sanchi collision accident case and investigate a case study and demonstrate the analysis result of the proposed method respectively section 6 discusses the main research results advantages and relevance of the proposed method finally section 7 provides a summary and outlines further study 2 literature review recently imo has continuously developed and improved a series of international conventions to enhance marine traffic safety these international conventions can be used to guide a ship s evasive actions most countries have adopted imo issued formal safety assessments imo 2002 2003 to judge maritime navigation safety and accelerate the research and development of other navigation risk analysis methods to solve the problems of safe ship navigation scholars have conducted extensive research and produced notable results first relevant research on ship navigation risk identification can be roughly divided into developments based on the safe encounter distance and encounter time as well as the ship domain and arena in the early days the most considered factors in ship encountering risk assessment methods were the distance of the closest point of approaching dcpa and times to the closest point of approaching tcpa kearon 1977 these two factors are considered to be an essential indicator of the spatial and temporal aspects determining collision risk in the automatic radar plotting aid arpa based on dcpa and tcpa dalian maritime university researchers constructed a model for calculating spatiotemporal collision risk wu and zheng 2001 zheng and wu 2002 liu et al 2020 built a spatial analysis model suitable for the collision risk analysis of multiship encounter situations based on dcpa using a gis platform however the traditional definition of the same safe encounter distance based on dcpa and tcpa does not cover all factors e g motion parameters and encounter relationships that affect collision risk for considering the incomplete hazard identification owing to dcpa and tcpa issues a field of theories based on ship domain has been proposed since the 1970s fuji and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 the ship domain is a safe encounter distance model that considers ship dimensions motion parameters and encounter situations to solve incomplete consideration defects of traditional methods based on cpa and tcpa in recent years ship domain theory has continued to be the focus of attention in the maritime safety field and many achievements have been published for example ship domain models based on automatic identification system ais data hansen et al 2013 gao and shi 2020 chen et al 2018 ship domain models based on expert knowledge and artificial intelligence pietrzykowski et al 2009 2012 chen et al 2019 and ship domain models based on analytical expression wang and chin 2016 dinh and im 2016 among others hazard identification algorithms continue to improve with increasing research the marine algorithm is the most widely used among many algorithms szlapczynski 2006 investigated a domain model ellipse and proposed the degree of domain violation and time to domain violation concepts with solutions szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 these concepts and methods have been successfully applied to the avoidance decision of stand on vessel and give way vessel szlapczynski et al 2018 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 realized a visual model of collision hazard improvements associated with research on ship collision risk identification and intelligent collision avoidance algorithms have achieved overall good results scholars optimize and upgrade navigation risk assessment methods however in a real navigational geographic environment ship safety information usually presents challenges such as a large amount of data difficulty in data fusion redundancy and conflicts among information additionally a ship has interlaced and complex spatial relationships which can result in ambiguity complexity and navigation information inaccuracies meaning that navigational spatial relationship information cannot be accurately extracted gis has a strong ability to solve problems in spatial relationship reasoning and spatial distribution law analysis navigation risk analysis in a spatial information platform can improve the use of navigation safety data and gis provides powerful libraries for spatial analysis and graphics which will help simplify the data analysis process and visually represent ship encounters more intuitively general spatial relations can be divided into distance orientation topological and logical relations haowen and ren zhong 2003 these are also spatial relationships that must be considered in maritime safety scholars have studied spatial distribution patterns chaode et al 2008 the spatial proximity relationship between points lines and surfaces brennan and martin 2012 and the nearest distance analysis jingwei s et al 2017 of spatial elements using the theory of spatial relationship at present gis spatial analysis is seldom used in marine navigation safety analyses or ship collision risk calculation however in the navigation safety field there is an urgent need for relevant research methods that can be used to analyze navigation space characteristics to provide accurate spatial characteristics and attribute information for navigation objectives and improve ship encounter safety assessment capabilities therefore this paper proposes a new method for dividing the ship encounter space and spatial logical relationship analysis based on the spatial information platform the model analyzes the logical relationship between the spatial division of the ship s navigation data and the ship encounter space based on the spatial distribution spatial structure and encounter characteristics of the ship navigation data hence the logical characteristics and dangerous trend information of the ship encounter space in different navigation spaces are extracted and the purpose of solving the problem of ship navigation risk analysis is completed fig 3 illustrates the detailed research framework of the ship encounter space division and spatial logic relationship analysis model fig 4 shows the overall flow of calculation and analysis of the proposed method 3 materials and methods 3 1 method ideas and symbol description the analytical model of ship encounter space logic proposed in this paper it is divided into four calculation and analysis steps fig 5 shows specific analysis and implementation process of the proposed method simultaneously we have summarized the meaning of formulas and symbols involved in the method as shown in table 1 it shows symbol description in the text and formulas of method 3 2 ship encounter space situation classification ships coming from different directions converge to form various ship encounter spaces wang et al 2017 the three types of ship encounter situations in the international regulations for preventing collision at sea guidelines are head on crossing and overtaking to establish an analytical model of ship encounter logical relationships and simplify the steps of hazard calculation the encounter situation is classified based on the target ship location and encounter situation types zheng 2000 fig 6 shows the results of ship encounter situation classification when the target ship located in region f the relative bearing is 355 r b 360 or 0 r b 5 and the course difference between the two ships is 175 δ c 185 the specific responsibility for avoidance in that case is that both ships alter course to starboard and pass port to port regions a and b indicate starboard crossing situations including small angle vertical and large angle crossings 5 r b 112 5 180 δ c 360 in this case the ship shall stay out of the way of the target ship similarly a ship shall stay out of the way when overtaking a target ship from more than 22 5 abaft her beam r b and δ c are the relative bearing of the incoming vessels and the course difference between the two ships respectively 3 3 ship encounter space division method this research uses the spatial structure analysis method to divide the navigation space in an orderly manner and calculate the logical spatial relationship between ships this is one of the key issues in safe ship navigation based on descartes idea of dividing the space using the convex domain tokita et al 2004 combined with the voronoi diagram and delaunay triangulation theory delaunay et al 1934 this study proposes an algorithm for calculating and solving the geometric relationships of the ship encounter space fig 7 depicts a schematic of the effect of dividing the encounter space of numerous ships in a specific range the voronoi polygon and delaunay triangulation network are a type of spatial structure analysis method that can accurately express and address the distribution state and characteristics spatial patterns spatial neighborhood characteristics and the spatial influence range of spatial entities when ships navigate in complex and dense waters there are many ships or obstacles around them numerous ships exhibit interlaced and complex spatial relationships coexisting with dynamic and static states and discretely distributed spatial relationships the establishment of the neighboring triangulation networks can simplify the spatial organizational structure and enhance the computing efficiency therefore there is an urgent need for ship navigation safety analysis that can be used to analyze spatial navigation features to provide accurate information on the trend of encountering danger from the ship navigation perception the voronoi diagram and delaunay triangulation network is a geometric structure with broad applications they are powerful algorithms for performing spatial geometric measurements and analyses niu et al 2018 luque et al 2011 ledoux and gold 2008 the proposed ship encounter space division algorithm is based on the excellent features of the voronoi diagram and delaunay triangulation network such as the sphere of influence and nearest neighbor characteristics the optimal neighboring triangulation network refers to a spatial geometric structure suitable for navigational hazard analysis where a specific sea area is considered as a space a ship is considered as a point and encounter and spatial proximity features are considered as the criteria the divided ship encounter space is a geometric structure formed after duality based on the optimal neighboring triangulation it is a convex polygon where each ship is the central point the divided ship encounter space realizes the spatial perspective and reflects the spatial influence range between ships the optimal neighboring triangulation network and divided ship encounter space provide the necessary structural information of the geometric elements in the early stage for the feature analysis of the encounter space fig 8 depicts the detailed segmentation principle of the ship encounter space in this figure the initial ship position v v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 v 6 v 7 v 8 v 9 v 10 v 11 v 12 is considered as the point elements of the ship encounter space division a principal step of the ship encounter space division is establishing several two dimensional coordinates with each ship as the origin a uniform coordinate axis with v 8 as the origin is established and a 360 rotation is performed based on the ship encounter features and adjacent values to obtain v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 v 6 v 7 the first group of

axis of the origin is established to form the initial triangulation network then the dual graph of triangulation is the range of the convex polygon corresponding to each ship in fig 8 step 4 refers to the dual graph extraction process the dual graph is associated with a plane graph and both can be transformed the establishment of the dual graph is based on the characteristics of the ship encounters such as the relative distance course speed and relative bearing during sailing at sea the outer circles are extracted using the triangulation network formed by combining the adjacent relationships between ships and then the centers of all outer circles are connected to obtain the dual graph which is the new result of the ship encounter space each edge of the convex polygon in fig 8 has two points and each point has three edges based on the eider s relation r r v r e 2 the constructed optimal neighboring triangulation network shows the following mathematical relation 1 r e 3 r 6 r v 2 r 5 where r r e and r v are the growing points edges and join points in a convex polygon diagram respectively eq 1 establishes that the spatial organization of the segmentation results shows a linear structure any point and the discrete ship in the convex polygon formed in the encounter space of the ship exhibit the characteristics of the optimal proximity and each convex polygon can reflect the spatial influence range of the discrete point to a certain extent ships sailing at sea are like multiple points that are discretely distributed in space and because of the speed and course of the ship there will always be certain encounters between ships the ship encounter space division algorithm proposed in this paper can segment and analyze ship navigation data such as the spatial position and topological relationship between ships the proposed algorithm takes the marine radar detection area as a certain range space and uses each ship as a growth element based on the euclidean relationship and encounter characteristics it grows to form the convex polygonal range of the space corresponding to each ship fig 9 shows the convex polygon that results after the encounter spaces of multiple ships within a certain range are divided based on the space division results of the ship encounter in fig 9 the encounter space is divided into six convex polygons then the basic vector elements i e points lines and polygons are used to describe the basic spatial relationships in the encounter space in fig 9 table 2 shows the detailed information of the relationship between the convex polygonal space elements and the structure after dividing the ship encounter space in fig 9 furthermore assume that the set of ship targets is 2 w w 1 x 1 y 1 w 2 x 2 y 2 w n x n y n r 2 n 6 where w represents the set of all ships w 1 x 1 y 1 represents the coordinate information of the first ship in the encounter space w n x n y n represents the coordinate information of the n th ship target in the ship set w and n 6 implies that there are six ship targets in the current hypothetical encounter space for w x y r 2 w i x i y i and w j x j y j exist then eq 3 expresses the encounter space division area of ship i 3 d i v s i w i w w j w i j i j n where d i v s i represents the result of the encounter space after the division w i represents the location information of ship i and w j represents the location information of ship j in the equation w i w x i x 2 y i y 2 then eq 4 is used to express the encounter space division results of ship set w 4 w d i v d i v s 1 d i v s 2 d i v s n n 6 where w d i v indicates that the divided ships meet the space assembly d i v s 1 is the result of the encounter space after the division of the first ship and d i v s n is the result of the encounter space after the division of the n th ship 3 4 analytical model of logical relations in the ship encounter space 3 4 1 spatial neighbor relation analysis in the ship encounter space in ship navigation many ships present a spatial relationship that is staggered complex both dynamic and static and discretely distributed in this spatial relationship the spatial distribution law between ships and the geometric features implicit in the spatial organization s form zhang et al 2016 are part of the spatial topological relationship and spatial logical relationship these spatial relationships play an important role in spatial modeling and spatial analysis wang and zhang 2019 yu et al 2016 in this paper the convex polygons dividing the ship encounter space combined with the optimal neighbor triangulation network achieve the calculation and analysis of the proximity relationships of the ship encounter space this is a key step for mining spatial geometric laws and analyzing neighboring relations which is beneficial improving the accuracy of the spatial analysis of the hazard degree of ships in the later period to determine the neighbor relationship of the ship s encounter space the optimal neighboring triangulation in the encounter space is constructed based on the results of the division of the ship encounter space combined with the ship s euclidean distance euclidean direction position encounter parameters and other information next the method defines the k th order neighbor relationship between control point first assume that there is a control point set target on a finite convex domain in a two dimensional cartesian space 5 o o 1 o 2 o n 3 n o i o j o i j 1 2 n where o represents the set of control points in the convex domain and 3 n implies that this point set is not less than three points o i and o j represent the two point features in the convex domain then the k th order neighbor relationship of any point in the convex polygon can be defined as n k o i o j x d x o j d x n k 1 o i k 0 i f k 2 o j n k 2 o i 6 n 0 o i o i where x is any point on the plane n k o i is a set of points with k order neighbor to point o i and d x o j represents the euclidean distance between points x and o j thus eq 6 can be used to define the k th order neighborhood relationship of the space target after the division of the ship encounter space the space after o i and o j is divided into o i v and o j v assuming that o i v o j v exists when the minimum number of connections between o i and o j is k and v o r o i v o r o j then k is called the v o r o n o i distance between o i and o j which is also called the k th order neighborhood relationship between o i and o j expressed as 7 o i k a d j o j d v o i v o j v k here o i v and o j v represent the space divided by o i and o j respectively k a d j implies that o i and o j exhibit a k th order neighborhood relationship and d v o i v o j v represents the neighborhood relationship after segmentation when d v o i o j 1 it is called geometrically directly adjacent and the two convex polygons have a common boundary expressed by g e o im m a d j when the spatial topological relationship is separated it is referred to as being geometrically separated adjacent expressed by g e o s e p a d j eqs 8 and 9 express two different spatial neighbor relations 8 o i g e o im m a d j o j d v o i v o j v 1 9 o i g e o s e p a d j o j d v o i v o j v 1 furthermore to accurately describe the spatial relationship between ships we regard the spatial entity as a set of points güting 1988 this article introduces a 3 3 matrix chen et al 2001 long and li 2013 that describes the spatial neighbor relationship and uses a 9 intersection model to judge the neighbor relation of the ship encounter space refer to eq 10 for details 10 r i j a b a b a b a b v a b a b a b v a b a b d v a b here r i j a b describes the spatial relationship result between encounter spaces a and b a and b are the encounter space boundaries of a and b respectively a and b are the internal areas of the encounter spaces a and b respectively a and b are the complement of the encounter spaces a and b respectively when a and b are directly adjacent in space the matrix can be expressed as 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 when a and b belong to the k order neighborhood relationship the matrix can be expressed as 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 k the use of the 9 intersection model can not only describe the k th order neighborhood relationship of the ship s encounter space in detail it can also describe other spatial relationships such as the adjacency connectivity closure inclusion and consistency of the ship s encounter space it is one of the more successful formal gis models of spatial relations in china 3 4 2 analytical method of approximation relations of ship encounter space approximation space theory first established by professor v a efremovi in 1952 from the perspective of space topology is relatively mature in the application of spatial relationship analysis vakarelov et al 2001 third et al 2007 an analysis model of the approximation relation of a ship encounter space is established using approximation space theory and is used for reasoning and calculation of the space approximation relations of convex polygons in a ship s encounter space the model can express the approximation relationship of the ship encounter space in detail based on the spatial information platform this paper takes the main ship as the point layer and the convex polygon formed by segmentation in the free space as the approximation object to be analyzed the paper then uses the approximation relation analysis model to calculate the approximation relation to the main ship in an encounter space consisting of different target ships fig 10 shows the calculation and analysis vector diagram of the ship encounter space s approximation relationship g p g p 1 g p 1 g p 2 and q p q p 1 q p 1 q p 2 are the encounter spaceset after the main ships g and q are divided respectively according to the assumption in fig 10 q p and g p include the two dimensional point set p p 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 p n these n points constitute the vertices of the convex polygon in the encounter space when the interior angle formed by the line segments p i 1 p i and p i p i 1 i e the angle formed in the bounded area enclosed by the polygon is not greater than π p i is defined as a convex point if n vertices are all convex points the polygon is called convex brandon and ivo 2007 all the structures constructed in the encounter space of the ship in fig 10 are convex polygons to calculate the spatial approximation relationship between the main ship and the convex hull set in fig 10 first the calculation method of the nearest neighbor point between the convex polygon and the main ship is defined 11 n n g p q g p i g p i arg min gp d q g p g p g p here n n g p q represents the subset of the nearest neighbors point of the convex hull set of main ship q and g p d q g p i is the euclidean distance of the convex hull set of the main ship q and g p g p i is the element in the convex hull set of g p to calculate the shortest distance from a point to a convex polygon it is assumed that the edges of the convex polygon set g p contain p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j n p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j fig 10 each side exhibits a normal vector n i pointing to the inside of the polygon then the set of visible edges must be solved first therefore we use eqs 12 and 13 to calculate the visible edges of the ship encounter space set convex polygon g p 12 w g p x u u n x p 1 p 2 n x p 2 p 3 n x p i p j 13 w g p y s s n y p 1 p 2 n y p 2 p 3 n y p i p j where w g p x and w g p y are the direction relationship between the point elements x and y and the normal vector of each side of the convex polygon set g p we can determine the visible edge based on whether n x p i p j is greater than zero n i is the normal vector of each side of the convex polygon u is the normal vector calculation result set of point element x and the convex shape and s is the normal vector calculation result set of point element y and the convex shape 14 m p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j i j r 15 m p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j i j r if w g p x n p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j is the visible side relative to point x m is the set of visible edges in the encounter space when w g p y n the edge of p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 p i p j is not visible relative to point y m implies that g p meets the set of invisible edges of the convex polygon after obtaining the visible edges of the convex shape the specific space approximation size can be calculated according to fig 10 the ship encounter space polygons q p and g p eqs 16 and 17 are used to express the calculation method of the space approximation distance and the space approximation degree of the space polygon where the target point meets the ship 16 s g p x m i n d x g p 1 d x g p 2 d x g p i 17 q b s x t 2 s x t 1 t here s g p x is the minimum distance between the target point x and the visible edge set m i e the spatial approximation distance q b is the spatial approximation degree of the convex polygon g p s x t 1 is the convex polygon at the first moment polygon g p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 in fig 10 s x t 2 is the convex polygon at the second moment polygon g p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 in fig 10 and t represents a time period if the q b value is large the encounter space is considered more dangerous with respect to point x 3 4 3 quantitative analysis of navigation risk following the laws of spatial geography spatial relationships are a key factor for mutual influence between targets lee and bednarz 2009 therefore the calculation and depth analysis of the ship s spatial neighbor relation and spatial approximation relation are realized through the spatial logical relationship of the ship encounter space and a convex polygon with geometric direct proximity and approximation is obtained for a ship target in an unsafe convex polygon the risk of ship collision can be further quantitatively analyzed by dcpa tcpa or the ship domain method however relying solely on dcpa and tcpa for collision avoidance decision making at sea no longer meets the accuracy requirements of ship automatic avoidance decision making therefore this paper refers to the ship domain model of coldwell 1983 and a ship domain model with offset values proposed by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 to quantitatively analyze ship collision risks the model considered the heading speed and size of the target ship meanwhile the scale factor introduced by szlapczynski 2016 can improve the ability to recognize the danger posed by targets with similar motion parameters and is more vigilant to ships on the front right meaning it complies with colregs requirements fig 11 shows a diagram for calculating collision risk based on the ship domain fig 11 a is a diagram of scaling factor calculation 18 c r a 1 f 2 min a 2 t min t s 2 a 3 f 2 t 1 2 here f t is the scope of the ship when it is zoomed in and out when the target ship is at the boundary of the domain f min is a circular domain of a quotient of a predicted dcpa and the radius of the smallest acceptable distance between the ship and the target object and c r is the ship s collision risk t min is the arrival time at the nearest meeting point and t s is the time required to avoid a collision a 1 a 2 and a 3 represent the influential coefficients of different ships in terms of main dimensions ship types and sailing waters respectively a greater c r value signifies a higher probability of collision and greater time urgency 4 application of the methodology case study 4 1 background introduction of application examples and data preprocessing this section uses data provided by china s ministry of transport as the basis for conducting simulation application research on the model s validity according to an investigation of the chinese maritime department at 20 00 cst utc 08 on january 6 2018 the panamanian flagged tanker sanchi and the bulk carrier cf crystal out of hong kong collided approximately 160 nautical miles east of the yangtze river estuary the collision caused the sanchi to catch fire at the time of the accident it was cloudy with good visibility northerly winds of magnitude 4 to 5 and light waves the geographic coordinates of the collision are 30 50 00 north latitude and 124 56 00 longitude the waters of the incident were open and not near any shipwrecks reefs or other obstructions and the water depth of the chart was approximately 55 m at the time of the incident the cr crystal was loaded with approximately 640 000 tons of grain and had 14 m of draught and a speed of 13 2 knots the two ships sailed in opposite directions and surrounding vessels at that time included ccl ningbo maersk shams trf mongstad mantucket zhejiang daiyu 03187 zhejiang daiyu 01272 zhejiang daiyu 01215 and zhejiang daiyu 02151 marine traffic data provide basic technical parameters of the sanchi as shown in table 3 table 4 introduces the detailed information source of ship related data first we use the arcgis platform to perform spatial preprocessing such as spatial registration and the geometric correction of accident and navigation data to determine the spatial position information of the ship fig 12 a and b show the surrounding sea area and navigation information of the surrounding ships at the time of the incident the red dots in fig 12 a indicate the collision 30 50 00 n 124 56 00 e and sinking 28 22 00 n 125 55 00 e positions fig 12 c shows the trajectory of the two ships before the collision twenty minutes before the collision the sanchi and the cf crystal had already formed a cross encounter state according to article 15 of colreg the sanchi should have paid close attention to the navigation on the starboard side to avoid colliding while crossing however the incident was caused by the failure of the officer of the watch to give way which resulted in serious consequences this article takes the sanchi incident as a model research case and uses radar imagery from before the collision as the database the accuracy of the model is then verified by analyzing the dangerous situation of the ships in different time periods this analysis provides navigation aids for ship safety early warnings and pilot navigation decision making 5 results 5 1 ship encounter space division in this research the c programming language and gis components are used to develop the ship encounter space division algorithm module table 5 describes the software and hardware configuration information of the algorithm design presentation and execution in detail first the target ship is set as the growth element in the spatial information platform and actual spatial position information is input the division model then analyzes the encounter space based on an analytical geometric method using the convex domain division space and the optimal triangle at the same time each ship is divided into separate growth elements based on their euclidean distance euclidean direction proximity relationship and encounter characteristics lastly the encounter space of each ship is divided this paper selects navigation information from before the collision between the sanchi and cf crystal as the data source and divides the ship encounter space by analyzing the sanchi s encounter scene and track information the collision can be divided into four stages in the model research at 19 31 the distance between the two vessels is more than six nautical miles which is the free movement stage two vessels in a crossing situation in this case the sanchi and cf crystal belong to the early action stage at six nautical miles rule 8 of the colregs states any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the rule of this part and if the circumstances of the case admit be positive made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship in these circumstances collision avoidance measures such as stop reverse and turn right can be taken the best measure to avoid collisions at such a time is to turn to the right and carefully check the effectiveness of anti collision actions at 19 42 the distance between the sanchi and cf crystal was only about three nautical miles which places the ships in the action stage at 19 46 the vessels are 1 6 nautical miles apart collision avoidance is most helpful in this stage as the collision will be inevitable otherwise fig 13 shows the results of the space division of ship encounters in four periods in detail based on the space division results shown in fig 13 the encounter space of the target ship within the radar display range of the sanchi is constantly changing and the sanchi s encounter situation continues to be in the encounter space of ship c in addition this study analyzes the euclidean distance and euclidean direction in the space of the divided ship encounter the euclidean analysis took 15 as the space interval which was divided in 24 directions after which the ship objects in each direction were analyzed the analysis results show that each convex polygon contains only one ship object and the distance between any point in 24 directions and the ship point in each divided encounter space is less than the distance to the ship point of other polygons fig 14 specifically shows the results of euclidean analysis based on the 15 24 ship encounter space the next section describes the establishment of the optimal neighbor triangulation network based on the divided ship encounter space in detail 5 2 construction of optimal neighbor triangulation network in the encounter space of ships the element information and attribute information of the ship encounter space are segmented using the ship encounter space division algorithm proposed in the previous chapter thereby establishing convex polygons that correspond to different ships next the model further calculates and generates the optimal neighboring triangulation network based on the spatial geometric characteristics of the convex polygons after which it analyzes spatial logic information and spatial association between ships based on that triangulation network the optimal neighbor triangulation network of the ship encounter space the model constructs usually has the characteristics of empty circle nearest neighbor regional optimality and so on which can reflect the geometric logical relationship neighbor relationship and approximation relationship of the ship encounter space in detail the results of different triangulations represent the encounter status of different ships which helps improve the accuracy of the spatial analysis of the encounter hazard based on the results of the ship encounter space division in the four time periods before the collision of sanchi and cf crystal the model uses the spatial position and topological relationships between ships and the characteristics of spatial elements and attributes in the encounter space to conduct spatial associations such as layered superposition and intersection to construct optimal neighboring triangulation network of ships fig 15 shows the optimal neighbor triangulation network results for the four periods the next section analyzes and calculates the logical relationships of the ship encounter space 5 3 analysis of the logical analysis results of ship encounter space the spatial logical relationship analytical model described in section 3 calculates the spatial logical relationships i e neighboring relationship and approximation relationship in the ship encounter space of the ship at four time periods based on the established optimal neighbor triangulation network after which we extract the navigation safety information and potential spatial structure relationship between the ships we conducted dynamic analysis of the optimal neighboring triangulation network of the ship encounter space at the four intervals and obtained results corresponding to the spatial logical relationships in those four time periods fig 16 shows the calculation results fig 16 a shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 31 during this period the sanchi s radar detected nine ship targets ships b c h j and a all belong to the geometric direct adjacency relationship 56 of the ships belong to the second order adjacency relationship and ship a belongs to the third order adjacency relationship in addition ship c is near the peak position of the curve indicating a high spatial association between ships c and a and a greater probability of encountering ships fig 16 b shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 35 at this moment the radar aboard the m t sanchi detected 10 ship targets approximately 55 6 of the ships have a greater degree of spatial proximity to ship a among these ships c d and e are all near the wave crest indicating that the spatial neighbor and spatial approximation values of these three ships and ship a are relatively large therefore the probability of encountering ships is also high so it is necessary to always be vigilant about the state of navigation the spatial logical relationships of the other ships are relatively discrete and near the average value so the degree of spatial correlation is low and there is no obvious risk of collision fig 16 c shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 42 here five ships c h e d and j and ship a are adjacent to each other ships e and c continue to be at the crest of the wave and their spatial approximation relationship is also significantly higher than that of other ships this indicates that ships e and c pose the greatest danger to ship a meaning that collision avoidance measures should be taken in time in accordance with regulations the encounter space of the other ships has a high degree of dispersion and insignificant spatial neighbor relationships and there is no spatial approximation relationship with ship a this indicates that the navigational interference between the other ships is low and there is no danger of collision fig 16 d shows the geometric logical relationship of the ship encounter space at 19 46 the results show that most ships still maintain a high spatial neighbor relationship with ship a among these ships e and ship a are first order adjacent relations and there is a continuous and strong spatial approximation relationship with a euclidean distance is only 1 6 nautical miles ship e ship has the most restrictive degree and highest spatial correlation to ship a s navigation space meaning it is very prone to collision and has always been a collision threat to ship a at this time ships c and a are still in the first order adjacent state but the spatial approximation relationship has disappeared and the spatial logical relationship has also been at the average level furthermore based on the analytical results of the logical relationship of the encounter space the model calculates and obtains the specific spatial approximation value of the ship encounter space for targets that are directly adjacent as well as spatial approximation fig 17 shows the calculation results of the spatial approximation relationship between ships c d and e and the sanchi at four periods at the same time combined with the ship domain method the model further calculates the ship s collision risk results fig 18 shows the calculation results of the danger parameters of ships c d and e and the sanchi at four period fig 17 a shows the changing trend of the space approximation distances of ships c d and e and the sanchi at four periods the three target ships and the sanchi showed a continuous approaching spatial situation the change trends of ships c and d are relatively gentle but the approaching situation of ship e ship is more and the approximation distance gradually converges to 0 showing that ship e has the greatest degree of approach to the sanchi and is very prone to collision fig 17 b shows the approximate size of the encounter space in three periods here the approximation degree of ship e is getting larger and the approximation degree of ships c and d to the sanchi is slowly decreasing this shows that the probability of an encounter between ships c and d against the sanchi is declining fig 17 c and d are the spline fitting results of the spatial approximation values to more intuitively obtain the spatial approximation trend of ships c e and d and the sanchi 5 4 verification of model accuracy and reliability in this research we propose a new method for the division of ship encounter space and logical relationship analysis it can calculate and analyze the spatial distribution and spatial structure and encounter characteristics between ships to identify dangerous situations of the ships to verify the model s accuracy and reliability we use the analytical results of the spatial logic relationship the topological analysis value and the results of the scaling factor to perform error calculations this paper uses the correlation method to calculate consistency with other models and selects the correlation coefficient to measure the closeness of the linear relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable we use the classic pearson correlation coefficient cosine similarity and spearman correlation coefficient to measure the closeness of the relationship between variables we then compare the model results in this paper with the overall accuracy of previous calculation methods for ship collision risk table 6 shows the result of correlation coefficient of spatial logic analysis results the spatial logical relationship has a strong correlation with the topological analysis value and scaling factor both of which are above 90 additionally fig 19 compares average results of the absolute values of correlations 6 discussion this research is based on ship encounter space division and spatial logic analysis to conduct spatial analysis of navigation safety between ships at present many scholars have also proposed methods for calculating ship collision risk first in ship domain methods scholars use the approximate ellipse domain method to express the safety distance and conduct collision avoidance research szlapczynski et al 2018 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 studied ship domains in open water which have asymmetric and irregular shapes and found that the ship domain shape changes dynamically depending on the situation that study can be considered an expansion of davis s dynamic world davis et al 1980 in the study of ship safety navigation and navigation systems goerlandt et al 2015 analyzed a ship collision risk warning system that which considers parameters such as dcpa tcpa bow cross range bow cross time relative position range time and visibility to achieve a risk level analysis of ship collision pietrzykowski et al 2009 introduced artificial intelligence methods integrating ais enc arpa gnss and other multi source navigation information pietrzykowski et al 2012 to achieve intelligently learning navigation knowledge and develop a navigation decision support system these algorithms have generally achieved good results in calculating ship navigation risk however if they are to be further promoted and applied to actual ship navigation and more in depth research on the analysis and mining of navigation risk information should be conducted if the spatial information platform can support the model the real electronic navigation chart is used as the bottom layer and other navigation data information with accurate spatial characteristics is superimposed for risk analysis which will simplify the analysis process richer and more accurate navigation risk information and other potential spatial relationship characteristics can be extracted liu et al 2020 used a topological analysis model based on gis spatial analysis methods and cpa to obtain a ship s spatial topological relationship and navigational space safety our proposed model is comparable with other collision risk algorithms while a ship is sailing the speed course distance and bearing of the surrounding ships are factors that influence the safe navigation of the main ship in solving the problem of ship collision risk warning the ship domain model szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 is the latest solution superior to dcpa and tcpa this research considers ship collision risk as the idea of the model positioning and proposes a new analytical model for segmenting and extracting spatial relationships of the ship encounter space in a spatial information platform combined with the ship domain method and is used for ship navigation risk analysis this method can improve the utilization of navigational safety data and exhibits a powerful gis ability to explore the spatial relationships and analyze problems related to spatial distribution laws it uses geographic information data comprising spatial location distribution shape distance proximity bearing and topological relationships to achieve a qualitative or quantitative analysis of the spatial relationship between ships using geometric analyses mathematical modeling geographic calculations and other methods the spatial information platform also provides a powerful spatial analysis model library and a visualization graphics library rendering the navigational information into a dedicated navigation map we simplify the data analysis process to analyze the navigation data in a more realistic geographical environment moreover we adopt various visualization methods to more intuitively detect the ship encounter space hazard information so that the navigator can quickly understand the current navigation safety situation the proposed model can combine and analyze the spatial relationships and attribute information of ship navigation data and obtain the spatial characteristics between ships more effectively and intuitively thus improving space assessment and encounter safety additionally the proposed model can further extract potential spatial features such as the spatial neighborhood relation and approximation relation of ships during navigation and measure the logical spatial relationships between ships more accurately intuitively and in detail thus it provides spatial analysis results with spatial relationships and temporal and spatial attributes for the intelligent obstacle avoidance of ships in different sailing waters and reduces the complexity and uncertainty of the navigation process after calculating the accuracy rate the overall correlation result was 94 08 the average error was approximately 5 92 and the overall error was between 7 8 and 0 37 furthermore according to the computer environment configuration in table 5 this research calculates the time running efficiency of the proposed method and performs a comparative analysis with some existing models the comparative analysis results are shown in fig 20 the results prove that the proposed model can accurately extract the hazard information and navigational spatial relationship between ships and the time operation efficiency has improved this model has been successfully implemented in a navigation hazard analysis of the collision between the m t sanchi and m v cf crystal based on the analysis results of the logical relationship of the ship encounter space m v cf crystal and m t sanchi always have a logical spatial relationship directly adjacent and approximate to each other and m v cf crystal continues to be at the peak position of the result value of the logical spatial relationship thus m v cf crystal shows the characteristics of the most restrictive degree and highest spatial relevance with respect to the m t sanchi s navigation space forming a very dangerous spatial situation which is also consistent with the actual situation therefore the proposed method can meet ship navigation safety assessment needs 7 conclusion and future work because ships have interlaced and complex spatial relationships in the navigation space encounter information is often vague and complicated to improve the ability to analyze the spatial relationships of target ships and extract information about navigational hazard trends this article proposes an analytical model of the spatial division and spatial logic relationship of ships in the encounter space based on gis technology the proposed model uses constructed convex polygons of the ships and the optimal neighboring triangulation network which can not only be used to analyze the logical relationship of the encounter space but also further extract the potential navigational spatial relationship features such as spatial proximity and spatial approximation value lastly the model obtains information on the hazard trends of ships in different sailing states and reduces ambiguity in navigation therefore the proposed model can provide ship pilots with accurate and rich navigation spatial feature analysis results and collision hazard information under different navigation situations in this article a simulated application of the model is conducted with data from the collision incident between the m t sanchi and m v cf crystal the results show that the model can effectively analyze and extract spatial relationships between the ship s navigation and the dangerous situation thereby improving the ability to evaluate navigation space safety in the future we will further apply the gis spatial analysis algorithm to navigation safety research for extracting richer potential safety features of the navigation space this study is a preliminary attempt and deficiencies and limitations in many aspects must be addressed to further improve the optimization and perfect the model we will further combine the advantages of spatial structure analysis methods voronoi polygons delaunay triangulation network etc when establishing the encounter space geometric network more navigation characteristics will be considered to assist the ship s safe navigation in waters with complex spatial relationships such as straight sections turning sections and multiple obstacles to improve the spatial perception and analysis capabilities of future smart ships in dangerous navigation areas fig 21 is a future research prospect of the in depth integration of the ship navigation characteristics and spatial relationship analysis continued development of the study results can significantly improve the ability of navigation perception and the analysis of ships as well as provide model support for the future development of intelligent ship navigation hazard intelligent sensing technologies credit authorship

20188,this study examined the buckling behaviours of six segmented toroids and a continuous toroid subjected to external pressure all the toroids had the same wall thickness net volume and structural mass the finite element method was employed to explore the linear buckling nonlinear buckling and imperfection sensitivity of the toroids on the basis of the finite element modelling results two identical segmented toroids and two identical continuous toroids were designed fabricated and tested to validate the numerical estimations the results indicated a good agreement between the numerical estimations and experimental observations segmented toroids can have nearly the same buckling capacity and imperfection sensitivity as equivalent continuous toroids jordan s formula can be extended to estimate the buckling capacity of multisegmented toroids keywords segmented toroid continuous toroid buckling capacity external pressure 1 introduction toroidal shells are widely applied in the nuclear ocean aerospace and civil industries such toroids can be used as liquid tanks as well as internal and external pressure vessels lubis and su udi 2017 zhan and redekop 2008 singh and prasad 2017 in particular as displayed in fig 1 toroids are the most promising pressure hulls for deep sea space stations and underwater missile launchers ross 2005 2006 2006 du et al 2015 according to ross 2006 compared with cylinders toroids provide higher storage volume enable superior manoeuvrability and allow deep sea space stations to have superior three dimensional 3d steering performance however buckling is the most common failure mode of toroids under external pressure and this is a canonical problem that must be evaluated in the design stage lee et al 2016 błachut 2014 the buckling behaviours of externally pressurised toroids have been widely studied using analytical numerical and experimental approaches jordan 1965a 1965b and jordan and shelley 1966 have proposed an analytical equation for the buckling pressure of toroids on the basis of asymptotic analyses galletly and błachut 1995 used this equation as a benchmark for assessing their experimental and numerical results subsequently błachut and jaiswal 2000 conducted a detailed numerical study on the effects of boundary geometry material and imperfection on the buckling of steel toroids moreover błachut 2003 performed external hydrostatic tests on three steel toroids to validate numerical modelling błachut 2004 also proposed a composite toroid with variable cross section thickness which can bear higher pressure compared with a toroid with constant thickness in addition zingoni et al 2015 2020 examined toroids with atypical cross sections zhang et al 2020a conducted a comparison between an equivalent toroid and cylinder they found that compared with a cylinder a toroid has a considerably higher buckling capacity and considerably lower imperfection sensitivity moreover they explored the effect of rotation angles on the buckling of toroidal shell segments and their results indicated the effectiveness of rib stiffened toroids zhang et al 2020b most previous studies on toroids have focused on continuous toroids fig 1 a such continuous geometries had a positive meridional radius on the intrados and a negative meridional radius on the extrados zhang et al 2020a consequently fabricating accurate continuous toroids with existing pressing or spinning techniques is highly difficult because of the mature manufacturing process of the cylindrical shell it is more convenient to manufacture the segmented toroids composed of the cylindrical shell which overcomes the disadvantage of the difficult manufacturing of the large toroids shell as displayed in fig 2 a wang 2005 studied the buckling of segmented tubes under external pressure and found that multisegmented tubes can possess nearly the same buckling pressure as continuous tubes on the basis of the aforementioned discussion we believe that segmented toroids can replace continuous toroids in many engineering applications the segmented toroids were successively connected by cylindrical shells with the number of segment n as shown in fig 2 b each cylindrical shell had the same and symmetrical chamfer angle of β 90 180 n as shown in fig 3 therefore the present study investigated the buckling of segmented and continuous toroids under external pressure section 2 presents the geometric and physical properties of six segmented toroids and one continuous toroid section 3 presents the numerical analysis of the buckling and postbuckling behaviours of the aforementioned toroids section 4 describes the design fabrication and testing of two identical segmented toroids n 8 and two identical continuous toroids n for validating the numerical estimations finally section 5 presents the main conclusions of this study and recommendations for future research we found that multisegmented toroids exhibit nearly the same

segment has a uniform wall thickness of t an external section radius of r and an axis length of l the number of segment n was set as 6 8 10 12 14 or 16 in this study to perform a like for like comparison all the segmented toroids were assumed to have the same wall thickness net volume and structural mass as the equivalent continuous toroid depicted in fig 1 a the continuous toroid has a section radius r of 70 5 mm a rotation radius r of 131 mm and a uniform thickness t of 1 346 mm the continuous toroid can be considered as a special case of a segmented toroid where n all the toroids

of deep submersibles or deep sea space stations their buoyancy factor is a critical design constraint the buoyancy factor is mathematically expressed as the ratio of the shell mass to its drainage mass also named displacement in ocean community buoyancy factor is an important index to evaluate the buoyancy reserve of shell small buoyancy factor indicates the shell can carried more crew or equipment by combining eqs 1 and 3 or eqs 4 and 6 the ratios of segmented and continuous toroids can be expressed as follows 7 δ ρ t 2 r t r 2 ρ w where ρ w is the water density 1020 kg m 3 the buoyancy factors of the segmented toroids were the same as that of the equivalent continuous toroid 3 numerical analysis in this study eigen value analysis were performed for perfect geometries of equivalent toroids subsequently geometrically and materially nonlinear buckling analysis were performed for imperfect geometries of equivalent toroids including linear buckling mode imperfections 3 1 finite element modelling all the linear and nonlinear numerical models used in this study were created using the computer aided engineering package abaqus in line with current european regulations schalen 2004 and chinese rules china classification society ccs 2018 the detailed methodologies of model creation were described by zhang et al 2020a to examine the imperfection sensitivity of toroids the eigenmode imperfections obtained from eigenvalue analysis were introduced on the perfect geometry the imperfection size δ was set as 0 05 t 0 1 t 0 2 t 0 4 t 0 8 t 1 2 t and 1 6 t in this study the finite element models of a representative segmented toroid and the equivalent continuous toroid are illustrated in fig 4 the target of riks analysis was to determine the critical buckling load post buckling mode and equilibrium paths of post buckling of toroids the fully integrated quadrilateral shell element which is designated as s4 in the numerical package was adopted in the finite element mesh moreover full scale modelling was performed to evaluate the potential asymmetric buckling or postbuckling modes in the mesh convergence examination in the linear elastic buckling analyses a sufficiently fine mesh comprising approximately 15000 elements was obtained for each model detailed element numbers are presented in the final column of table 1 during the analyses the simpson integration rule was implemented for five section points along the shell thickness the representative examples of convergence study of segmented toroid n 8 and equivalent continuous toroid n are displayed in fig 5 wherein the red star point represents the determined element quantity intending for the numerical analysis three nodes of each finite element model were carefully constrained to avoid rigid body motion and additional reaction force this boundary condition is recommended by the ccs 2018 for numerically evaluating the ultimate strength of cylindrical and spherical pressure hulls of deep submersibles moreover the aforementioned boundary condition has been successfully used to evaluate the ultimate strength of egg shaped zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019b longan shaped zhang et al 2018a 2018b 2018b and corrugated zhang et al 2019c shells of revolution under external pressure in the numerical modelling the reference load that is external pressure was 1 mpa for examining cases of linear elastic buckling linear elastic and isotropic material modelling was conducted and the subspace approach was used as these interfaces where two segments were joined were subjected to plasticity during pressurizing tripathi et al 2020 the nonlinear buckling analysis of segmented toroids were carried out using an elastic perfectly plastic material model and the modified riks algorithm moreover for examining the cases of nonlinear buckling elastic perfectly plastic material modelling was conducted and the modified riks algorithm was used the modified riks algorithm has been extensively used to evaluate the unstable nonlinear collapse of shells of revolution riks 1979 crisfield 1981 ramm 1981 the parameters of the riks algorithm were as follows initial increment in arc length along the static equilibrium path was δ l i n 0 1 total arc length scale factor associated with the step was l p e r i o d 1 minimum arc length increment was δ l min 10 50 maximum arc length increment was δ l m a x 0 1 notably the welding effects including residual stresses material hardening and imperfections were not taken into account in section 3 1 because the geometrically and physically perfect models were assumed in the analysis 3 2 numerical results and discussion the linear buckling modes of the segmented and continuous toroids were similar and had the form of one half wave on the intrados as displayed in fig 4 b these linear buckling modes are typical of toroidal shells under external pressure błachut and jaiswal 2000 błachut 2003 2004 the aforementioned observations are attributed to the fact that each toroid intrados was subjected to relatively high stress fig 8 the results indicate that the intrados is the weak zone of segmented toroids the linear buckling loads of the segmented and continuous toroids are presented in the second column of table 2 and plotted in fig 6 as presented in table 2 and fig 6 the linear buckling load p l i n increased with an increase in the segment number n for n 8 the segmented toroids had up to 91 7 of the buckling capacity of the equivalent continuous toroid furthermore for n 16 the segmented toroids had up to 98 1 of the buckling capacity of the equivalent continuous toroid results similar to the aforementioned ones were obtained for the nonlinear buckling loads of toroids at each size fig 6 and table 2 the aforementioned observations are in agreement with previous observations of segmented tubes under external pressure zhang et al 2020b thus the segmenting method can be extended to other types of continuous shells as displayed in fig 6 the buckling load decreased with an increase in the imperfection size which indicated that the segmented toroids are imperfection sensitive structures the horizontal dotted line in fig 6 represents the semianalytical prediction results which were obtained using the conventional jordan s formula jordan 1973 for a continuous toroid under external pressure as follows 8 p j o r d a n 0 1738 e t r 7 r r 2 1 μ 2 2 1 3 as displayed in fig 6 the semianalytical prediction results were lower than the linear buckling loads of perfect toroids with perfect geometries and the nonlinear buckling loads of imperfect toroids with small imperfection sizes δ 0 05 t in the case of large imperfection sizes the semianalytical prediction results were only lower than the nonlinear buckling loads of imperfect toroids with high segment numbers jordan s formula can be extended to estimate the buckling capacity of multisegmented toroids the imperfection sensitivity is plotted in the form of a graph of the knockdown factor versus the imperfection size fig 7 the knockdown factor is defined as the ratio of the nonlinear buckling load for an imperfect geometry to the linear buckling load for a perfect geometry wagner et al 2020 2018 national aeronautics and space administration nasa 1968 the smaller the knockdown factor the higher is the imperfection sensitivity as displayed in fig 7 the imperfection sensitivity decreased with an increase in the segment number when the segment number was 16 the segmented toroids had nearly the same imperfection sensitivity as the equivalent continuous toroid the equilibrium paths of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited a metastable character under small imperfections as displayed in fig 8 under small imperfections the applied load tended to change marginally with an increase in deflection in the postbuckling stage moreover under small imperfections the postbuckling modes were similar to the linear buckling modes the equilibrium paths of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited an unstable character under large imperfections under large imperfections the applied loads tended to decrease considerably with an increase in deflection in the postbuckling stage moreover under large imperfections the postbuckling modes exhibited the form of local collapse similar postbuckling phenomena were observed in previous studies during the nonlinear collapse of resin toroids under external pressure zhang et al 2020a the von mises stress contours at the buckling points of the equilibrium paths are plotted in fig 8 first yield load p y are also shown in fig 8 indicating the elastic plastic buckling regime as depicted in fig 8 relatively high stresses were distributed on the intrados surface this result corresponds to the postbuckling zones the maximum stress in each case was higher than the yield strength which indicated that the toroids underwent elastic plastic buckling the high stresses at the integration points of the shell elements were equal to the yield strength because elastic perfectly plastic material modelling was performed the difference between the contour plot stress and the integration point value is attributed to the fact that the stress contours were plotted in the form of the average element output at nodes abaqus 6 12 1 4 experimental analysis to validate the aforementioned numerical estimations two identical segmented toroids n 8 and two identical continuous toroids n were designed fabricated and tested these toroids had the same wall thickness net volume and structural mass so that a like for like comparison could be conducted 4 1 materials and methods the segmented toroids were fabricated from eight identical cylindrical segments through manual tungsten inert gas tig welding the cylindrical segments were cut from a cylindrical shell which was cold pressed from a rectangular steel sheet the detailed fabrication process for the segmented toroids is illustrated in fig 9 a similarly the continuous toroids were fabricated from four identical toroidal segments the toroidal segments were cold pressed from a customised steel sheet and tig welded at the joint the detailed fabrication process for the continuous toroids is shown in fig 9 b additional details on this process are provided by zhang et al 2020b the fabricated toroids are depicted in fig 10 a after the toroids were fabricated the wall thickness was geometrically measured and the external surface was examined to determine the fabrication quality and obtain data for the subsequent numerical analysis the measurement scene is depicted in fig 11 a and b the wall thickness was measured using an ultrasonic device dakota px 7 america the wall thickness data are presented in the first five columns of table 3 the wall thickness was measured at 18 equally distributed points around 24 and 28 cross sections of the segmented and continuous toroids respectively the external surface was examined using an optical scanner model cronos 3d italy the geometric deviations of the fabricated toroids from the perfect toroids are presented in fig 12 following the user manual of this scanner a contrast aid film was sprayed on the surface of the toroids and many marking circles were randomly created on the sprayed surface before scanning the scanning measurement time for each toroid was approximately 2 5 h after the scanning the marking circles were removed and the contrast aid film on the toroid was cleaned in addition the structural mass of each toroid was determined using an electronic scale the mass data are presented in the penultimate column of table 3 the four fabricated toroids were individually buckled in a cylindrical pressure tank as displayed in fig 11 c the tank cavity has a radius of 250 mm and a height of 500 mm the tank thickness is 30 mm which enables a maximum working pressure of 8 mpa to be achieved a digital pressure sensor installed in the tank cover is used to record the applied pressure the recording device is a dynamic data acquisition system dh5902n china with a recording frequency of 50 hz the pressure histories recorded in this study are illustrated in fig 13 pressure was slowly applied using a manual pressure pump to achieve quasi static loading the pressure medium was tap water and the buckling of each toroid was accompanied by an audible noise and a sharp drop in pressure after buckling each toroid was removed from the pressure tank the buckled segmented and continuous toroids are displayed in fig 10 b 4 2 results and discussion 4 2 1 experimental analysis of the segmented and continuous toroids the geometrically measured data of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited good repeatability and indicated a relatively high fabrication accuracy as presented in table 3 the standard deviations of the thicknesses of st 1 and st 2 were 0 016 and 0 022 mm respectively which were considerably lower than those of ct 1 and ct 2 0 044 and 0 050 mm respectively moreover the differences between the minimum and maximum thicknesses of st 1 and st 2 were 0 066 and 0 172 mm respectively which were considerably lower than those of ct 1 and ct 2 0 252 and 0 342 mm respectively the aforementioned findings indicate that controlling the thickness variations of continuous toroids is very difficult because of their complex geometry with negative and positive gaussian curvatures nevertheless the segmented and continuous toroids had average wall thicknesses in the small range of 1 325 1 367 mm as displayed in fig 12 the geometric deviation of the segmented toroids from perfect toroids were mainly due to manual welding deformation the st 2 segmented toroid exhibited a low geometric deviation thus segmented toroids can be accurately fabricated using a professional welding technique the geometric deviations of the two continuous toroids were identical because only four circular seams had to be welded to fabricate them compared with the st 2 segmented toroid the continuous toroids had lower geometric accuracy because of the high difficulty in fabricating continuous toroidal shells the closed capacities surface areas and structural masses of the fabricated toroids were identical to the corresponding data the closed capacities and surface areas of the two segmented toroids and two continuous toroids were determined from the measured geometries table 3 the ratio of the geometric data to the measured geometric data varied from 0 999 to 1 011 for the segmented toroids and from 0 994 to 0 999 for the continuous toroids tables 1 and 3 similarly the ratio of the mass to the measured mass varied from 0 991 to 0 995 for the segmented toroids and from 0 973 to 0 965 for the continuous toroids the experimental buckling pressures and postbuckling modes of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited good repeatability as displayed in fig 10 b the postbuckling modes of all the tested toroids had the form of local collapse because of the substantial fabricated imperfections such collapse modes are also found in the numerical observations displayed in fig 8 the obtained stepwise curves are attributed to the manual operation of the water pump each step in these curves corresponds to a small loading increment the long loading time of each curve indicates a quasi static loading case the maximum recorded pressure in each curve corresponds to the buckling pressure which is presented in the last column of table 3 the buckling pressure varied from 2 030 to 2 110 mpa for the segmented toroids and from 2 459 to 2 261 mpa for the continuous toroids the average load carrying capacity of the segmented toroids was as high as 88 of that of the continuous toroids which is identical to the corresponding numerical evaluation result table 2 the performance ratio was used to evaluate the segmented and continuous toroidal geometries this ratio has been used to evaluate egg shaped longan shaped and spherical shells under external pressure zhang et al 2020a the performance ratio is defined according to the buckling pressure p net volume v and structural mass m as follows 9 η p v m by substituting the experimental values from table 3 into eq 9 performance ratios of 6 64 6 92 and 7 37 7 94 mpa dm3 kg were obtained for the segmented and continuous toroids respectively the average performance ratio of the segmented toroids was as high as 89 of that of the continuous toroids which confirmed the effectiveness of the segmented toroids 4 2 2 numerical evaluation of the fabricated toroids for further examining the buckling of the tested toroids the finite element method fem was implemented using abaqus finite elements were generated on the optically measured geometries due to irregularities of the measured geometries in addition to the main element type s4 some triangular elements s3 were meshed detailed element information is presented in the first three columns of table 4 the average wall thickness values are presented in the fourth column of table 3 the pressure loading boundary constraints material modelling process and model solving process in the simulations were the same as those described in section 3 1 both linear and nonlinear analyses were performed for the fabricated segmented and continuous toroids with real geometric imperfections such a numerical modelling approach is in line with nasa s current research direction hilburger et al 2006 hilburger 2012 which is related to the development of a new evaluation flowchart comprising three steps measuring the real shell geometry predicting the buckling loads according to the measured geometry and determining the corresponding knock factor the obtained numerical data are presented in table 4 and fig 14 as presented in table 4 the experimental linear buckling loads of the segmented toroids were 2 471 and 2 476 mpa which are close to the linear buckling load of the equivalent perfect toroid 2 339 mpa table 2 the linear buckling loads of the tested continuous toroids were 2 640 and 2 650 mpa which are close to the linear buckling load of the equivalent perfect toroid 2 552 mpa table 2 the average linear buckling capacity of the segmented toroids was 93 5 of that of the continuous toroids the nonlinear buckling loads of the toroids were 7 12 lower than their linear buckling loads this decrease can be attributed to the geometric and material nonlinearities when both linear and nonlinear analyses involve the same geometrical imperfections therefore the nonlinear numerical evaluations were closer to the experimental results than the linear numerical evaluations were the ratios of nonlinear buckling load to experimental buckling load ranged from 1 000 to 1 119 which confirmed the accuracy of the fem the postbuckling paths of the tested toroids corresponded to an unstable or a metastable character due to the geometric imperfections of the toroids fig 10 the numerical equilibrium paths of the tested toroids are shown in fig 14 these paths are similar to those of perfect toroids with linear buckling mode imperfections fig 8 the postbuckling modes of all the tested toroids had the form of local collapse the collapse locations and forms were consistent with the experimental observations presented in fig 10 b the von mises stress contours at the buckling points of the equilibrium paths are also plotted in fig 14 as displayed in fig 14 the maximum stress of the tested toroids was higher than the yield strength this result indicates that the tested toroids underwent elastic plastic buckling the stress results for the tested toroids were similar to those for perfect toroids with linear buckling mode imperfections fig 8 however in contrast to the regular stress distribution depicted in fig 8 all the tested toroids exhibited an irregular and random stress distribution pattern because of their irregular and random imperfections notably this study only focused on segmented toroids with a circular section according to previous studies on continuous toroids with atypical sections an elliptical section can bear a higher pressure than can a circular section błachut and jaiswal 2000 therefore segmented toroids with atypical sections should be explored in future studies 5 conclusions this study performed a numerical and experimental investigation on the buckling behaviours of pressurised segmented toroids and an equivalent continuous toroid the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the linear buckling modes of perfect toroids were similar and had the form of one half wave on the intrados the postbuckling modes of imperfect toroids were similar to the linear buckling modes under small geometric imperfections however these postbuckling modes had the form of typical local collapse under large geometric imperfections 2 both linear and nonlinear buckling loads increased with an increase in the segment number when the segment number n was 16 the buckling capacity of the segmented toroids reached to 98 1 of the equivalent continuous toroids even if the segment number was reduced to 8 the buckling load of the segmented toroids can be 91 7 of the equivalent continuous toroid in the hydrostatic test the value was 88 which is similar to the result of numerical analysis 3 the buckling load decreased with an increase in the imperfection size which indicates that segmented toroids are imperfection sensitive structures the imperfection sensitivity decreased with an increase in the segment number when the segment number was 16 the segmented toroids had nearly the same imperfection sensitivity as the equivalent continuous toroid 4 all the toroids buckled in an elastic plastic manner the equilibrium paths of segmented and continuous toroids exhibited a metastable character under small geometric imperfections but an unstable character under large geometric imperfections jordan s formula can be extended to estimate the buckling capacity of multisegmented toroids 5 the ratio of the average measured geometric and physical properties of segmented toroids to those of continuous toroids varied in the range of 0 975 0 994 indicating that the model had high manufacturing accuracy and good repeatability the physical properties involved in wall thickness structural mass net volume and external surface area the tested buckling pressures and postbuckling modes of the segmented and continuous toroids also exhibited good repeatability which was in line with the numerical observations credit authorship contribution statement jian zhang supervision project administration writing chenyang di data curation modelling

the eigenmode imperfections obtained from eigenvalue analysis were introduced on the perfect geometry the imperfection size δ was set as 0 05 t 0 1 t 0 2 t 0 4 t 0 8 t 1 2 t and 1 6 t in this study the finite element models of a representative segmented toroid and the equivalent continuous toroid are illustrated in fig 4 the target of riks analysis was to determine the critical buckling load post buckling mode and equilibrium paths of post buckling of toroids the fully integrated quadrilateral shell element which is designated as s4 in the numerical package was adopted in the finite element mesh moreover full scale modelling was performed to evaluate the potential asymmetric buckling or postbuckling modes in the mesh convergence examination in the linear elastic buckling analyses a sufficiently fine mesh comprising approximately 15000 elements was obtained for each model detailed element numbers are presented in the final column of table 1 during the analyses the simpson integration rule was implemented for five section points along the shell thickness the representative examples of convergence study of segmented toroid n 8 and equivalent continuous toroid n are displayed in fig 5 wherein the red star point represents the determined element quantity intending for the numerical analysis three nodes of each finite element model were carefully constrained to avoid rigid body motion and additional reaction force this boundary condition is recommended by the ccs 2018 for numerically evaluating the ultimate strength of cylindrical and spherical pressure hulls of deep submersibles moreover the aforementioned boundary condition has been successfully used to evaluate the ultimate strength of egg shaped zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019b longan shaped zhang et al 2018a 2018b 2018b and corrugated zhang et al 2019c shells of revolution under external pressure in the numerical modelling the reference load that is external pressure was 1 mpa for examining cases of linear elastic buckling linear elastic and isotropic material modelling was conducted and the subspace approach was used as these interfaces where two segments were joined were subjected to plasticity during pressurizing tripathi et al 2020 the nonlinear buckling analysis of segmented toroids were carried out using an elastic perfectly plastic material model and the modified riks algorithm moreover for examining the cases of nonlinear buckling elastic perfectly plastic material modelling was conducted and the modified riks algorithm was used the modified riks algorithm has been extensively used to evaluate the unstable nonlinear collapse of shells of revolution riks 1979 crisfield 1981 ramm 1981 the parameters of the riks algorithm were as follows initial increment in arc length along the static equilibrium path was δ l i n 0 1 total arc length scale factor associated with the step was l p e r i o d 1 minimum arc length increment was δ l min 10 50 maximum arc length increment was δ l m a x 0 1 notably the welding effects including residual stresses material hardening and imperfections were not taken into account in section 3 1 because the geometrically and physically perfect models were assumed in the analysis 3 2 numerical results and discussion the linear buckling modes of the segmented and continuous toroids were similar and had the form of one half wave on the intrados as displayed in fig 4 b these linear buckling modes are typical of toroidal shells under external pressure błachut and jaiswal 2000 błachut 2003 2004 the aforementioned observations are attributed to the fact that each toroid intrados was subjected to relatively high stress fig 8 the results indicate that the intrados is the weak zone of segmented toroids the linear buckling loads of the segmented and continuous toroids are presented in the second column of table 2 and plotted in fig 6 as presented in table 2 and fig 6 the linear buckling load p l i n increased with an increase in the segment number n for n 8 the segmented toroids had up to 91 7 of the buckling capacity of the equivalent continuous toroid furthermore for n 16 the segmented toroids had up to 98 1 of the buckling capacity of the equivalent continuous toroid results similar to the aforementioned ones were obtained for the nonlinear buckling loads of toroids at each size fig 6 and table 2 the aforementioned observations are in agreement with previous observations of segmented tubes under external pressure zhang et al 2020b thus the segmenting method can be extended to other types of continuous shells as displayed in fig 6 the buckling load decreased with an increase in the imperfection size which indicated that the segmented toroids are imperfection sensitive structures the horizontal dotted line in fig 6 represents the semianalytical prediction results which were obtained using the conventional jordan s formula jordan 1973 for a continuous toroid under external pressure as follows 8 p j o r d a n 0 1738 e t r 7 r r 2 1 μ 2 2 1 3 as displayed in fig 6 the semianalytical prediction results were lower than the linear buckling loads of perfect toroids with perfect geometries and the nonlinear buckling loads of imperfect toroids with small imperfection sizes δ 0 05 t in the case of large imperfection sizes the semianalytical prediction results were only lower than the nonlinear buckling loads of imperfect toroids with high segment numbers jordan s formula can be extended to estimate the buckling capacity of multisegmented toroids the imperfection sensitivity is plotted in the form of a graph of the knockdown factor versus the imperfection size fig 7 the knockdown factor is defined as the ratio of the nonlinear buckling load for an imperfect geometry to the linear buckling load for a perfect geometry wagner et al 2020 2018 national aeronautics and space administration nasa 1968 the smaller the knockdown factor the higher is the imperfection sensitivity as displayed in fig 7 the imperfection sensitivity decreased with an increase in the segment number when the segment number was 16 the segmented toroids had nearly the same imperfection sensitivity as the equivalent continuous toroid the equilibrium paths of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited a metastable character under small imperfections as displayed in fig 8 under small imperfections the applied load tended to change marginally with an increase in deflection in the postbuckling stage moreover under small imperfections the postbuckling modes were similar to the linear buckling modes the equilibrium paths of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited an unstable character under large imperfections under large imperfections the applied loads tended to decrease considerably with an increase in deflection in the postbuckling stage moreover under large imperfections the postbuckling modes exhibited the form of local collapse similar postbuckling phenomena were observed in previous studies during the nonlinear collapse of resin toroids under external pressure zhang et al 2020a the von mises stress contours at the buckling points of the equilibrium paths are plotted in fig 8 first yield load p y are also shown in fig 8 indicating the elastic plastic buckling regime as depicted in fig 8 relatively high stresses were distributed on the intrados surface this result corresponds to the postbuckling zones the maximum stress in each case was higher than the yield strength which indicated that the toroids underwent elastic plastic buckling the high stresses at the integration points of the shell elements were equal to the yield strength because elastic perfectly plastic material modelling was performed the difference between the contour plot stress and the integration point value is attributed to the fact that the stress contours were plotted in the form of the average element output at nodes abaqus 6 12 1 4 experimental analysis to validate the aforementioned numerical estimations two identical segmented toroids n 8 and two identical continuous toroids n were designed fabricated and tested these toroids had the same wall thickness net volume and structural mass so that a like for like comparison could be conducted 4 1 materials and methods the segmented toroids were fabricated from eight identical cylindrical segments through manual tungsten inert gas tig welding the cylindrical segments were cut from a cylindrical shell which was cold pressed from a rectangular steel sheet the detailed fabrication process for the segmented toroids is illustrated in fig 9 a similarly the continuous toroids were fabricated from four identical toroidal segments the toroidal segments were cold pressed from a customised steel sheet and tig welded at the joint the detailed fabrication process for the continuous toroids is shown in fig 9 b additional details on this process are provided by zhang et al 2020b the fabricated toroids are depicted in fig 10 a after the toroids were fabricated the wall thickness was geometrically measured and the external surface was examined to determine the fabrication quality and obtain data for the subsequent numerical analysis the measurement scene is depicted in fig 11 a and b the wall thickness was measured using an ultrasonic device dakota px 7 america the wall thickness data are presented in the first five columns of table 3 the wall thickness was measured at 18 equally distributed points around 24 and 28 cross sections of the segmented and continuous toroids respectively the external surface was examined using an optical scanner model cronos 3d italy the geometric deviations of the fabricated toroids from the perfect toroids are presented in fig 12 following the user manual of this scanner a contrast aid film was sprayed on the surface of the toroids and many marking circles were randomly created on the sprayed surface before scanning the scanning measurement time for each toroid was approximately 2 5 h after the scanning the marking circles were removed and the contrast aid film on the toroid was cleaned in addition the structural mass of each toroid was determined using an electronic scale the mass data are presented in the penultimate column of table 3 the four fabricated toroids were individually buckled in a cylindrical pressure tank as displayed in fig 11 c the tank cavity has a radius of 250 mm and a height of 500 mm the tank thickness is 30 mm which enables a maximum working pressure of 8 mpa to be achieved a digital pressure sensor installed in the tank cover is used to record the applied pressure the recording device is a dynamic data acquisition system dh5902n china with a recording frequency of 50 hz the pressure histories recorded in this study are illustrated in fig 13 pressure was slowly applied using a manual pressure pump to achieve quasi static loading the pressure medium was tap water and the buckling of each toroid was accompanied by an audible noise and a sharp drop in pressure after buckling each toroid was removed from the pressure tank the buckled segmented and continuous toroids are displayed in fig 10 b 4 2 results and discussion 4 2 1 experimental analysis of the segmented and continuous toroids the geometrically measured data of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited good repeatability and indicated a relatively high fabrication accuracy as presented in table 3 the standard deviations of the thicknesses of st 1 and st 2 were 0 016 and 0 022 mm respectively which were considerably lower than those of ct 1 and ct 2 0 044 and 0 050 mm respectively moreover the differences between the minimum and maximum thicknesses of st 1 and st 2 were 0 066 and 0 172 mm respectively which were considerably lower than those of ct 1 and ct 2 0 252 and 0 342 mm respectively the aforementioned findings indicate that controlling the thickness variations of continuous toroids is very difficult because of their complex geometry with negative and positive gaussian curvatures nevertheless the segmented and continuous toroids had average wall thicknesses in the small range of 1 325 1 367 mm as displayed in fig 12 the geometric deviation of the segmented toroids from perfect toroids were mainly due to manual welding deformation the st 2 segmented toroid exhibited a low geometric deviation thus segmented toroids can be accurately fabricated using a professional welding technique the geometric deviations of the two continuous toroids were identical because only four circular seams had to be welded to fabricate them compared with the st 2 segmented toroid the continuous toroids had lower geometric accuracy because of the high difficulty in fabricating continuous toroidal shells the closed capacities surface areas and structural masses of the fabricated toroids were identical to the corresponding data the closed capacities and surface areas of the two segmented toroids and two continuous toroids were determined from the measured geometries table 3 the ratio of the geometric data to the measured geometric data varied from 0 999 to 1 011 for the segmented toroids and from 0 994 to 0 999 for the continuous toroids tables 1 and 3 similarly the ratio of the mass to the measured mass varied from 0 991 to 0 995 for the segmented toroids and from 0 973 to 0 965 for the continuous toroids the experimental buckling pressures and postbuckling modes of the segmented and continuous toroids exhibited good repeatability as displayed in fig 10 b the postbuckling modes of all the tested toroids had the form of local collapse because of the substantial fabricated imperfections such collapse modes are also found in the numerical observations displayed in fig 8 the obtained stepwise curves are attributed to the manual operation of the water pump each step in these curves corresponds to a small loading increment the long loading time of each curve indicates a quasi static loading case the maximum recorded pressure in each curve corresponds to the buckling pressure which is presented in the last column of table 3 the buckling pressure varied from 2 030 to 2 110 mpa for the segmented toroids and from 2 459 to 2 261 mpa for the continuous toroids the average load carrying capacity of the segmented toroids was as high as 88 of that of the continuous toroids which is identical to the corresponding numerical evaluation result table 2 the performance ratio was used to evaluate the segmented and continuous toroidal geometries this ratio has been used to evaluate egg shaped longan shaped and spherical shells under external pressure zhang et al 2020a the performance ratio is defined according to the buckling pressure p net volume v and structural mass m as follows 9 η p v m by substituting the experimental values from table 3 into eq 9 performance ratios of 6 64 6 92 and 7 37 7 94 mpa dm3 kg were obtained for the segmented and continuous toroids respectively the average performance ratio of the segmented toroids was as high as 89 of that of the continuous toroids which confirmed the effectiveness of the segmented toroids 4 2 2 numerical evaluation of the fabricated toroids for further examining the buckling of the tested toroids the finite element method fem was implemented using abaqus finite elements were generated on the optically measured geometries due to irregularities of the measured geometries in addition to the main element type s4 some triangular elements s3 were meshed detailed element information is presented in the first three columns of table 4 the average wall thickness values are presented in the fourth column of table 3 the pressure loading boundary constraints material modelling process and model solving process in the simulations were the same as those described in section 3 1 both linear and nonlinear analyses were performed for the fabricated segmented and continuous toroids with real geometric imperfections such a numerical modelling approach is in line with nasa s current research direction hilburger et al 2006 hilburger 2012 which is related to the development of a new evaluation flowchart comprising three steps measuring the real shell geometry predicting the buckling loads according to the measured geometry and determining the corresponding knock factor the obtained numerical data are presented in table 4 and fig 14 as presented in table 4 the experimental linear buckling loads of the segmented toroids were 2 471 and 2 476 mpa which are close to the linear buckling load of the equivalent perfect toroid 2 339 mpa table 2 the linear buckling loads of the tested continuous toroids were 2 640 and 2 650 mpa which are close to the linear buckling load of the equivalent perfect toroid 2 552 mpa table 2 the average linear buckling capacity of the segmented toroids was 93 5 of that of the continuous toroids the nonlinear buckling loads of the toroids were 7 12 lower than their linear buckling loads this decrease can be attributed to the geometric and material nonlinearities when both linear and nonlinear analyses involve the same geometrical imperfections therefore the nonlinear numerical evaluations were closer to the experimental results than the linear numerical evaluations were the ratios of nonlinear buckling load to experimental buckling load ranged from 1 000 to 1 119 which confirmed the accuracy of the fem the postbuckling paths of the tested toroids corresponded to an unstable or a metastable character due to the geometric imperfections of the toroids fig 10 the numerical equilibrium paths of the tested toroids are shown in fig 14 these paths are similar to those of perfect toroids with linear buckling mode imperfections fig 8 the postbuckling modes of all the tested toroids had the form of local collapse the collapse locations and forms were consistent with the experimental observations presented in fig 10 b the von mises stress contours at the buckling points of the equilibrium paths are also plotted in fig 14 as displayed in fig 14 the maximum stress of the tested toroids was higher than the yield strength this result indicates that the tested toroids underwent elastic plastic buckling the stress results for the tested toroids were similar to those for perfect toroids with linear buckling mode imperfections fig 8 however in contrast to the regular stress distribution depicted in fig 8 all the tested toroids exhibited an irregular and random stress distribution pattern because of their irregular and random imperfections notably this study only focused on segmented toroids with a circular section according to previous studies on continuous toroids with atypical sections an elliptical section can bear a higher pressure than can a circular section błachut and jaiswal 2000 therefore segmented toroids with atypical sections should be explored in future studies 5 conclusions this study performed a numerical and experimental investigation on the buckling behaviours of pressurised segmented toroids and an equivalent continuous toroid the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the linear buckling modes of perfect toroids were similar and had the form of one half wave on the intrados the postbuckling modes of imperfect toroids were similar to the linear buckling modes under small geometric imperfections however these postbuckling modes had the form of typical local collapse under large geometric imperfections 2 both linear and nonlinear buckling loads increased with an increase in the segment number when the segment number n was 16 the buckling capacity of the segmented toroids reached to 98 1 of the equivalent continuous toroids even if the segment number was reduced to 8 the buckling load of the segmented toroids can be 91 7 of the equivalent continuous toroid in the hydrostatic test the value was 88 which is similar to the result of numerical analysis 3 the buckling load decreased with an increase in the imperfection size which indicates that segmented toroids are imperfection sensitive structures the imperfection sensitivity decreased with an increase in the segment number when the segment number was 16 the segmented toroids had nearly the same imperfection sensitivity as the equivalent continuous toroid 4 all the toroids buckled in an elastic plastic manner the equilibrium paths of segmented and continuous toroids exhibited a metastable character under small geometric imperfections but an unstable character under large geometric imperfections jordan s formula can be extended to estimate the buckling capacity of multisegmented toroids 5 the ratio of the average measured geometric and physical properties of segmented toroids to those of continuous toroids varied in the range of 0 975 0 994 indicating that the model had high manufacturing accuracy and good repeatability the physical properties involved in wall thickness structural mass net volume and external surface area the tested buckling pressures and postbuckling modes of the segmented and continuous toroids also exhibited good repeatability which was in line with the numerical observations credit authorship contribution statement jian zhang supervision project administration writing chenyang di data curation modelling

20189,range is an important indicator for measuring the performance of supercavitating vehicles scavs which is closely related to the hydrodynamic layout of vehicles the motion state cavitating flow and control surfaces of a vehicle which are key factors that affect the hydrodynamic distribution have an important impact on the range a range optimization model is established for a scav on a straight and level trajectory wherein the optimal variables include the cavitator number speed of motion diameter and deflection angle of the cavitator pitch angle and fin deflection angle the global search performance of the adaptive genetic algorithm is improved by segmenting the main optimization variables and performing multiple optimizations in each segment thereby resulting in the development of a program called the genetic zouliu code ge zl code based on the optimization model some geometric characteristic and motion parameters of natural and ventilated scavs are optimized to the maximum ranges using the ge zl code analyses are performed to determine the influences of the navigation depth and slenderness ratio of the vehicle on the optimization results i e the change trends of the optimization variables and the maximum range with the change in the navigation depth and slenderness ratio additionally the optimization results of the two vehicles are compared and analyzed furthermore based on the optimization results the relationships among the cavitator diameters column body diameters and full lengths of the vehicles are formulated using the nonlinear least square method based on the analyses of the afterbody force characteristics the study also shows that the scav can rely on only the deflections of the cavitator and fin to achieve good horizontal straight navigation without other wetted afterbodies by optimizing geometric characteristic and motion parameters keywords supercavity supercavitating vehicle optimization model genetic algorithm range 1 introduction a supercavitating vehicle scav is a new type of high speed underwater vehicle developed based on the principle and technology of supercavitation logvinovich 1969 the vehicle with the exception of its head and tail is covered by a large bubble i e supercavity to greatly reduce the navigation resistance kuklinski et al 2001 according to different generation methods supercavities can be divided into natural and ventilated supercavities natural supercavities are usually generated by increasing the speed of motion or reducing the ambient pressure hrubes 2001 saranjam 2013 a supercavity can also be formed by ventilating noncondensable gas into the flow separation area of the head of the vehicle kawakami and arndt 2011 lee et al 2019 which is called a ventilated supercavity and its size is maintained or controlled by adjusting the ventilation to change the pressure inside the supercavity zou and liu 2015 however the two types of supercavitating flows usually have similar hydrodynamic and drag reduction characteristics in the same cavitation state the second type of supercavitating flow expands the development and application of supercavitation drag reduction because there is no requirement for the flow velocity and ambient pressure and this type of supercavitating flow also provides a theoretical basis for the study of supercavitation in water tunnel experiments natural supercavitating flow is a two phase flow produced by vapor water phase changes and there are mass and momentum transports between the water and vapor on a supercavity wall the compressibility of water is very significant in very high speed flows hrubes 2001 the process of ventilated supercavitating flow is relatively complicated the flow involves not only momentum transport between gas and water zou et al 2018 but also mass transport between water and vapor i e natural cavitation which can occur on the front wall of the supercavity and vapor interacts with water and gas in terms of momentum when the inflow velocity is sufficiently high zou et al 2020 the degree of natural cavitation influences the trends describing ventilation controlling supercavitation vlasenko 2003 i e the relationship between the ventilation coefficient and ventilation cavitation number the greater the natural cavitation number is the greater the effect of ventilation control on the supercavitating flow the gas injected into the supercavity flows into the wake from a shear layer on the supercavity wall zou and zhang 2021 under fixed incoming flows and ventilation conditions the shear layer characteristic scale i e shear layer thickness increases with increasing reynolds numbers in addition the froude number which characterizes the influence of gravity has an important effect on the flow this effect is mainly reflected in two aspects supercavity deformation and tail closure kawakami and arndt 2011 the greater the influence of gravity is the more obvious the pressure difference between the supercavity upper and lower surfaces on the one hand the pressure difference causes the supercavity to float upwards along its longitudinal axis and on the other hand the pressure difference interacts with the adverse pressure gradient at the supercavity tail to produce velocity circulation on the longitudinal closed curve around the supercavity wall the gas in the shear layer exits from the vortex tubes on both sides of the tail to maintain the mass conservation of the gas inside the supercavity which is called vortex tube tail closure when the gravity effect is negligible the supercavity presents an axisymmetric shape under the combined action of an adverse pressure gradient and shear forces on the supercavity wall the tail is closed in the form of an unsteady re entrant jet with gas leakage governed by toroidal vortex shedding wang et al 2015 in experimental studies new tail closure phenomena are observed in the transition process of two classical types of closures karn et al 2016 in addition to the flow mechanisms the hydrodynamic characteristics and motion stability of scavs are also important issues in the field of supercavitation research the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vehicle are analyzed in terms of the angle of attack aoa yuan et al 2012 control surfaces i e cavitator and fin mokhtarzadeh et al 2012 sanabria et al 2015 and afterbody paryshev 2003 ncnitt et al 2006 lee et al 2008 in water tunnel experiments numerical simulations of the multiphase flow model based on computational fluid dynamics cfd also show that a vehicle without motion control can rely on the wet hydrodynamic force of the afterbody to maintain stable straight motion lindau et al 2003 and a good pitching motion attitude yu et al 2012 in the longitudinal plane in addition the semiempirical and theoretical supercavity models are usually applied to establish the dynamic model of the vehicle to analyze motion characteristics and stability kulkarni and pratap 2010 nguyen and balachandran 2011 kim and kim 2015 savchenko et al 2019 based on rigid body dynamic theory to accurately calculate the unsteady state of the supercavity supercavity dynamic models kirschner and arzoumanian 2008 serebryakov 2009 zou et al 2016 are applied in a scav dynamic model for complicated motion simulations and analyses and then the dynamic model is coupled with a control law to realize the simulations of climbing diving and acceleration motions of a scav in the longitudinal plane zou and wang 2020 zou et al 2021 the range like maneuverability is also worthy of attention mirzaei and taghvaei 2019 under certain propulsion performance conditions the motion performance is closely related to the cavitating flow pattern and the vehicle s hydrodynamic distribution motion parameters and control surfaces model experiments and cfd based numerical simulations are both commonly used methods for hydrodynamic analysis and vehicle design however the time and economic costs of these two methods are relatively large with the rapid development of optimization theory intelligent algorithms aim to overcome the constraints of continuous differentiability of the objective function and constraint conditions in traditional optimization algorithms thereby realizing the transformation from direction oriented to problem oriented problems additionally these algorithms have relatively high computational accuracy and efficiency in solving complicated problems and their results are less dependent on the selection of initial points than the results of previous algorithms the more popular intelligent algorithms in the field of optimization design mainly include genetic algorithms simulated annealing algorithms particle swarm algorithms and ant colony algorithms since the overall search strategy and optimized search method of a genetic algorithm which do not rely on gradient information or other auxiliary knowledge during calculation only need the objective function influencing the search direction and the corresponding fitness function this type of algorithm provides a general framework for solving complicated problems and has strong robustness toward different types of problems genetic algorithms have been developed and applied in the fields of trajectory optimization and aerodynamic optimization for aircraft through improvement or combination with other algorithms hybrid genetic algorithms are developed to optimize planetary exploration trajectories crain et al 2000 wuerl et al 2003 a method is proposed to optimize flight trajectories in the cruise phase using a genetic algorithm patron and botez 2015 wherein lateral and vertical flight profiles are optimized simultaneously based on the algorithm the optimal trajectory generator developed can avoid collisions and safely attain the targets for space robots seddaoui and saaj 2021 in addition considering factors such as the engine aerodynamics and control a multiobjective optimization of a missile with a solid rocket motor is carried out using the pareto genetic algorithm anderson et al 2001 bayley et al 2008 a multiobjective genetic algorithm is developed for the integrated design optimization of aerodynamic shapes and propulsion systems in supersonic aircraft design rallabhandi and mavris 2008 and applied to a novel optimization method for the design of aircraft mission success spaces gao et al 2020 in the process of aerodynamic optimization an adaptive parameter method can also be used to improve the search efficiency and global optimization ability of a genetic algorithm ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 overall the genetic algorithm is the most widely used and successful intelligent algorithm therefore this study intends to establish a range optimization model for a scav in horizontal and straight flight and the genetic algorithm is improved to achieve a better global search performance to develop a program called ge zl code by segmenting the main optimization variable and performing several cycles of optimization in each segment based on the optimization model the cavitation number speed of motion diameter and deflection angle of the cavitator pitch angle and fin deflection angle are optimized to achieve the maximum straight navigation range for a scav using the self developed ge zl code 2 range optimization model in addition to the propulsion performance navigation resistance is one of the most important factors affecting the range of a scav since the vehicle is almost surrounded by a supercavity only its head and tail are in contact with water as shown in fig 1 the resistance is mainly produced by the head i e cavitator of the vehicle and is approximately proportional to the square of the speed of motion and the front flow area of the cavitator as well as closely related to the supercavitating flow state in addition to hydrodynamic forces on the cavitator and fin i e f c and f f the vehicle s afterbody can contact the supercavity wall thereby generating sufficient planing force i e f p to maintain the balance of the force and torque in fact the cavitation degree and the relative position between the supercavity and vehicle determine the force characteristics of the vehicle the supercavity trajectory is determined by the cavitator motion thus body coordinate system b of the scav is established at the cavitator which is beneficial for dynamic modeling and analysis the plane x b z b coincides with the longitudinal plane of the vehicle in the coordinate system and axis x b is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and points in the direction of motion the cavitator is the only component in fig 2 that always remains wet the resultant force is perpendicular to the cavitator s upstream surface and decomposed into drag and lift in coordinate system b in eqs 2 and 3 zou and wang 2020 which have been validated by experiments

g m b g x g cos θ to provide a restoring moment the vehicle s afterbody usually comes into contact with the supercavity wall to generate a planing force f p and its moment m p the force is usually perpendicular to the longitudinal axis in fig 1 which causes the vehicle s dynamic system to be highly nonlinear but it also plays a vital role in maintaining the vehicle s stable motion the force is

hydrodynamic forces depend on the wetted area of the vehicle the wetted area is obtained by calculating the supercavity shape to determine the relative position between the vehicle and the supercavity for a scav under a cruise state its motion state and supercavitating flow pattern are approximately unchanged therefore for the large scav in this study whose motion speed is lower than the underwater sound speed a steady supercavity model is obtained for the supercavity shape by solving the unsteady supercavity cross section equation validated by experiments serebryakov 2015 and numerical

area it is necessary to further constrain the supercavity dimension and the relative position of the supercavity and vehicle no areas except for the head and tail of the vehicle should be able to get wet the supercavity radius is relatively small at the junction between the cone section and the column section of the vehicle which is usually located in the front of the supercavity if the supercavity is not large enough the vehicle is likely to experience moisture at the joint to avoid this scenario the constraint in eq 24 is established to ensure that the supercavity radius at the junction is greater than the radius of the column section in the same way the constraint in eq 25 ensures that the supercavity can envelope the vehicle furthermore the constraint in eq 26 is added to prevent the wetted area of the vehicle s afterbody from being too large and affecting the calculation accuracy of the planing force model in eq 14 24 r b r n 2 r n 2 c d k σ c k μ α l l b σ c 2 μ α l

simulates the genetic and evolutionary processes of organisms in a natural environment the algorithm compares each solution of the optimization problem to a single individual and these individuals constitute a population by simulating operations such as selection crossover and mutation in a natural biological world individuals continue to evolve and finally an optimal solution is obtained the calculation process of the algorithm is shown in fig 4 first the code length l of the variables is set based on the initial parameters and their precision the binary coding method is used for optimization variables due to its simple coding and decoding operations and easy implementation of the crossover and mutate operations for n d in the interval m n the binary form is obtained by first calculating n b using formula 27 and then converting n b into a binary number while the decoding process involves first converting a binary number into a decimal value and then calculating the corresponding decimal number using formula 27 27 n b n d m 2 l 1 n m after the variables are encoded into binary forms they are spliced to obtain a chromosome with a length of 16 the chromosome represents the genetic information of an individual and its changes are the essence of evolution considering the diversity of the population and avoiding a local optimum a completely random method is used to initialize the population composed of many individuals the population size is the number of individuals due to the different complexities of the problems the population numbers are 1000 and 2000 respectively in the optimization processes of the natural and ventilated scavs herein the genetic algorithm sets up a fitness function to evaluate the pros and cons of individuals the larger the value of the fitness function is the better the individual the fitness function is usually set according to the objective function importantly for the constrained optimization problems in this manuscript the constraint conditions are added as penalty functions to the objective function i e the range optimization model to achieve unconstrained optimizations for the maximum optimization problem similar to the research the objective function is set as the fitness function the fitness of each individual in the population is calculated and then the individuals are sorted from small to large according to their fitness while keeping the best individual in the next generation using an elite retention strategy to ensure that the fitness is positive a power function of f x i i 1 3 is used to reassign each individual where f x i is the fitness of the i th individual the roulette algorithm causes the fitness of an individual to be positively correlated with the selection probability as the most classic selection algorithm such that the individuals with higher fitness have a higher probability of being retained in the next generation to ensure that the population evolves in the direction of optimization therefore the probability of each individual being selected is calculated using the roulette algorithm the specific process assumes that there are a total of n individuals in the population and the probability of selection of the i th individual is p s x i f x i j 1 n f x j by generating random numbers between 0 and 1 the roulette algorithm is again applied to select individuals needing genetic operations to generate a new generation of parents for the crossover and mutation operations the adaptive probability algorithm is used to calculate different crossover and mutation probabilities for individuals with different fitness levels in eqs 28 and 29 this makes individuals with poor fitness levels change more easily thereby ensuring the diversity of the population for individuals with better fitness the probabilities of crossover and mutation are reduced to avoid the convergence difficulty in the later stage of the algorithm single point crossover and single point mutation methods are used to perform crossover and mutation operations on individuals for individuals with odd numbers in the population in turn a random number is generated between 0 and 1 and compared with the crossover probability of the individual to determine whether the individual needs to crossover if the former is smaller than the latter the individual and its following individual are cross operated i e the two are divided at a randomly selected position and the parts on the right are exchanged after a round of crossover operations for each individual in the population a random number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared with the mutation probability of the individual the same method applied for the crossover operation is used to determine whether the individual is mutated the specific operation of mutation involves reversing the original genic value at a randomly selected position when the genetic operations of each generation are completed the optimization process is continued or terminated based on whether a termination condition is satisfied the maximum number of iterations is set to 1600 as the termination condition herein 28 p 1 p c

of individuals are set as p c 2 0 5 p c 1 0 9 respectively and the upper and lower limits of the mutation probability p 2 of individuals are set as p m 2 0 2 and p m 1 0 9 respectively for complicated problems with multiple optimization variables a method to improve the global search performance of the algorithm is proposed herein i e the main optimization variable is segmented the problem is optimized multiple times in each segment and the best solution is taken as the final optimization result the cavitator diameter is selected as the main optimization variable in this study next the schaffer function is solved to examine the global search performance and computational stability of the self developed ge zl code because it has a strong oscillating behavior which makes it difficult to find its maximum value as shown in fig 5 additionally to better demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm the obtained solution is compared with the results obtained from classic algorithms in table 1 where ge sa sqp and ds represent the genetic algorithm the simulated annealing algorithm the sequential quadratic programming algorithm and the nelder mead direct search in the matlab toolbox respectively it can be seen from the table that the solution obtained by the ge zl code can accurately predict the exact solution 30 f 0 5 sin 2 x 2 y 2 0 5 1 0 001 x 2 y 2 2 4 optimization of the natural scav natural supercavitation is mainly produced by increasing the motion velocity to change the body surface pressure and its cavitation degree which is characterized by the natural cavitation number is determined by the motion velocity and ambient pressure the independent optimization variables in the optimization include the natural cavitation number the diameter and deflection angle of the cavitator the deflection angle of the fin and the pitch angle the motion velocity is calculated according to the natural cavitation number and ambient pressure taking into account the actual motion of the vehicle it is necessary to further constrain the ranges of the changes in the pitch angle and control surfaces to ensure a reasonable motion attitude and avoid the saturation of control surfaces see table 2 these constraints also ensure the accuracy of the hydrodynamic calculation of the control surfaces in addition the range of cavitation number is limited to ensure the production of supercavitation and the variation of the cavitator diameter should meet the basic requirement for drag reduction based on the range optimization model the natural scav is optimized using the ge zl algorithm and the basic model parameters in table 3 the optimization variables and range tend to be stable after 1600 iterations as shown in fig 6 it is worth mentioning that since the selection crossover and mutation in the algorithm are all random operations rather than deterministic rules the algorithm has a certain degree of randomness therefore the relatively strong oscillations that occur in the initial stage in the figure are understandable the vehicle obtains the maximum range l r 2638 15 m when the optimization variables are σ v 0 0474 v 157 3067 m s d n 0 0774 m θ 0 0010 rad δ c 0 0153 r a d and δ f 0 0016 r a d under these conditions of the cavitation degree and the vehicle s characteristic geometry and motion attitude the vehicle has a good performance in reducing drag the pitch angle is a very small negative value i e θ 0 0 57 3 0 which means that the vehicle maintains a good horizontal movement attitude the cavitator is deflected downward by 0 8 766 0 around its transverse axis to supplement the lift the horizontal fins deflect upward and the aoa of the fin is positive to provide the lift with α f arctan w f u f arctan u s δ f w c δ f u c δ f w s δ f 0 0917 0 fig 7 a shows that compared with the longitudinal force f x c the lateral force f z c is a very small for the cavitator therefore it is believed that the resultant force acting on the cavitator is perpendicular to the upstream surface of the cavitator which coincides with the theoretical analysis logvinovich 1969 although the lift force l f is much greater than the drag d f in the velocity coordinate system of the fin the fin drag f x f in the body coordinate system of the vehicle is much smaller than the lateral force f z f that produces a large pitching moment m y f as shown in fig 7 b for the scav the fin is mainly used as a control surface to provide the lift in such a small pitch attitude the deflections of the control surfaces of the vehicle can prevent the afterbody from wetting that is the planing force f z p is zero as shown in fig 7 c since the cavitation degree depends on the ambient pressure and the covered body length the navigation depth and slenderness ratio both have an effect on the motion state and performance of the natural scav therefore by optimizing the vehicles with different navigation depths and slenderness ratios analyses are performed on the influences of the navigation depth and slenderness ratio on the optimization results 4 1 optimizations of the natural scavs with different navigation depths the greater the navigation depth is the greater the ambient pressure is and the more difficult it is for natural cavitation to occur under the same vehicle model parameters the optimization results vary with different navigation depths based on the range optimization model the vehicle is optimized at different water depths using the basic model parameters in table 3 fig 8 a shows the influence of the navigation depth on the optimization variables of the vehicle where h is the dimensionless navigation depth with h h h 0 and h 0 5 m σ v v d θ δ c and δ f are the dimensionless optimization variables and σ v σ v σ v 0 v v v 0 d d n d n 0 θ θ θ 0 δ c δ c δ c 0 and δ f δ f δ f 0 where σ v 0 v 0 d n 0 θ 0 δ c 0 and δ f 0 are the optimization variables at the water depth h 0 a properly sized supercavity shape is formed to achieve good drag reduction performance by jointly adjusting the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter because the change trends of the supercavity size with changing cavitation number and changing cavitator diameter are opposite that is the supercavity size decreases with the increase in the former and increases with the increase in the latter the change trends of the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter with increasing navigation depth are similar as the ambient pressure increases with increasing water depth the speed of motion of the vehicle increases to maintain supercavitating flows state overall the deflection angle of the cavitator generally decreases as the water depth increases except at a water depth of 125 m where the larger pitch angle of the vehicle results in the generation of a planing force and the cavitator deflects to further supplement the lift it should be emphasized that the larger the pitch angle of the vehicle is the smaller the lateral force caused by gravity and the smaller the lift required for the fin to decrease the lift the deflection of the fin increases to reduce the fin s aoa and vice versa therefore the pitch angle and fin deflection angle show very similar changes in numerical value with increasing navigation depth the deflection directions of the two are opposite except at a mutational water depth of 125 m in addition when the navigation depth gradually increases the increased speed of motion greatly increases the resistance thereby increasing the propellant mass combustion rate of the vehicle and shortening the navigation time for the same vehicle the maximum range decreases with increasing navigation depth and this change gradually shows signs of becoming level as shown in fig 8 b where l r 0 is the range at h 0 4 2 optimizations of the natural scavs with different slenderness ratios the vehicle s slenderness ratio i e the ratio of the vehicle length to the body diameter λ l b d b not only determines the propellant fuel mass to a certain extent but also influences the drag reduction performance of supercavitating flows covering the body surface different slenderness ratios are obtained by fixing the body diameter and changing the vehicle length the vehicles with different slenderness ratios are optimized using the model parameters in table 3 as shown in fig 9 where λ is the dimensionless slenderness ratio λ λ λ 0 λ 0 5 and the optimization variable values of the vehicle at λ 0 are taken as the characteristic values for the nondimensionalization of the optimization variables it is interesting that the planing force does not occur in all optimized states fig 9 a shows that the vehicle needs to move faster to attain a larger supercavity enveloping the vehicle as the slenderness ratio increases the speed of motion increases with increasing slenderness ratio and the natural cavitation number decreases accordingly overall the cavitator diameter shows a decreasing trend thereby ensuring the optimal supercavitation shape and drag reduction performance however the cavitator diameter increases to make the supercavity cover the vehicle after the turning point of λ 18 the pitch angle and fin deflection angle rotate to maintain the balance of lateral forces on the vehicle and show very similar trends in numerical value as the slenderness ratio varies for the same reason presented in section 4 1 it is worth noting that when λ is in the range of 18 20 the pitch angles are close to zero at θ 0 0011 0 this means that the vehicles with these slenderness ratio can have very good horizontal motion attitudes the increase in the slenderness ratio increases the gravity on the vehicle when the slenderness ratio increases to a certain degree the cavitator is required to deflect downward to provide part of the lift to maintain the force balance thus the downward deflection angle of the cavitator increases as the slenderness ratio increases until λ is larger than 18 where the pitch angles are very small additionally the optimization range increases as the slenderness ratio increases in fig 9 b where l r 0 is the range at λ 0 when λ increases to 18 the change in range slows there are two main reasons for the effect on the one hand when the propulsion fuel mass ratio is constant the fuel mass is positively correlated with the slenderness ratio similar to the correlation with the vehicle mass the greater the slenderness ratio is the greater the fuel mass and the greater the assurance of long distance navigation on the other hand the speed of motion generally increases as the slenderness ratio increases considering that the cavitator diameter influences the generation and size of the supercavity and that the length and body diameter of the vehicle influence the development process of supercavitation it is important to reveal the inherent relationship between the characteristic geometric parameters of the vehicle when the maximum range is obtained the relationship between the cavitator diameter and the slenderness ratio is shown in fig 9 c where d n is the dimensionless cavitator diameter and d n d n d b the cavitator diameter decreases with increasing slenderness ratio until the slenderness ratio is close to 18 and then shows a tendency to gradually increase the functional relationship between the two is obtained using the nonlinear least square method where d n a λ 2 b λ c a 0 001008 b 0 03703 and c 0 4661 the fitting formula provides a theoretical reference for the design research of supercavitating vehicles to a certain extent 5 optimization of the ventilated scav ventilated supercavitation is fundamentally different from natural supercavitation in terms of generation the ventilation cavitation number which characterizes the degree of cavitation mainly depends on the pressure of the noncondensable gas injected into a supercavity unlike the case of natural supercavitation the ventilation cavitation number and the speed of motion are two independent optimization variables and the ambient pressure has a limited influence on the navigation performance of the vehicle under ventilated supercavitation therefore the ranges of the ventilated scavs with different slenderness ratios are optimized here the basic model parameters of the vehicle are consistent with those of the natural scav see table 3 during the optimization process in addition to constraining the optimization variables in table 2 the speed of motion must be constrained to ensure that the vehicle has a higher speed than conventional underwater vehicles the constraint range of the speed is v 50 150 m s fig 10 shows the iterative process of vehicle optimization when the slenderness ratio is 6 6667 compared with the natural scav the ventilated scav has a smaller optimal speed of motion but obtains a smaller ventilation cavitation number for a specific reasonable supercavity shape a small cavitation number means that a large cavitator diameter is not needed to achieve the best cruise performance the ventilated scav maintains a small negative pitch angle and its control surfaces deflect to provide the lift the attitude characteristics and their principles are similar to those of the natural scav the optimized ventilated scav is subject to less navigation resistance than the optimized natural scav thus the range of the former is greatly improved under the same propeller performance apart from the magnitude difference in the drag the hydrodynamic characteristics in fig 11 are also similar for the two types of the vehicles overall both can simply use the deflections of the cavitator and fin to maintain the balance of the lateral force and the horizontal straight motion 5 1 optimizations of the ventilated scavs with different slenderness ratios overall the optimal ventilated cavitation number decreases to generate a larger supercavity covering the vehicle with the increase in the slenderness ratio λ of the scav and the speed of motion shows an increasing change rule at a fixed navigation depth as shown in fig 12 a although the slenderness ratio of the supercavity is essentially related to only the cavitation number zou et al 2016 the cavitator diameter can appropriately decrease to avoid excessive supercavitation influencing the drag reduction effect when λ is not large i e λ 15 for the cases in which λ is greater than approximately 15 the cavitator diameter and cavitation number synergistically change to increase the size of the supercavity as λ increases the pitch angle and fin deflection angle are in opposite directions with similar change trends to satisfy the balance of the lift and pitch moment in the slenderness ratio range of 13 20 the larger the slenderness ratio is the better the vehicle can maintain the horizontal motion attitude the cavitator deflects to supplement the lift for the same reason the range of the ventilated scav increases as the slenderness ratio increases similar to the natural scav in fig 12 b where l r 0 is the range at λ 0 additionally the dimensionless cavitator diameter first decreases and then increases as the slenderness ratio increases as shown in fig 12 c the turning point of the change occurs in the slenderness ratio range of 18 20 the fitting formula is d n a λ 2 b λ c where a 0 001123 b 0 03786 and c 0 4569 5 2 comparison and analysis of the optimizations of natural and ventilated scavs due to the differences in their supercavitation generation mechanisms the natural and ventilated scavs have different parameter characteristics after optimization as shown in fig 13 a where σ generally refers to the cavitation number including natural and ventilated situations i e σ v and σ c and the blue solid line and black dotted line represent the results of the former and the latter respectively when the slenderness ratio is very small the natural cavitation number is significantly larger than the ventilation cavitation number because the natural cavitation number and speed of motion are not independent variables for the natural scav the optimal cavitation number mainly satisfies the supercaviation condition enveloping the vehicle as much as possible in the case of a small slenderness ratio the natural cavitation number is certainly large however the cavitation number is not completely determined by the speed of motion and ambient pressure for a ventilated scav it needs to be optimized with the speed of motion to reduce the vehicle s resistance as much as possible and its value cannot be large the degree of ventilated cavitation is higher than that of natural cavitation thus the ventilated scav needs a large pitch angle and large deflection angles of control surfaces i e cavitator and fin to provide a restoring force overall for a vehicle with a medium or large slenderness ratio the changes of the optimization variables with changing slenderness ratio tend to slow overall in the natural and ventilated supercavitation states the natural cavitation number gradually decreases and the ventilation cavitation number tends to stabilize the speeds of motion increase with increasing slenderness ratio and the speed of the natural scav which is fully responsible for the generation of supercavitation at a fixed navigation depth is larger than that of the ventilated scav the ventilated scav achieves a better drag reduction performance by simultaneously optimizing the cavitation number and speed of motion the cavitator diameters show a similar change trend to that of the slenderness ratio for natural and ventilated scavs however the slenderness ratio at which the cavitator diameter of a ventilated scav undergoes a transitional change is smaller than that of a natural scav compared with the deflection angle of the cavitator of the natural scav which increases first and then decreases as the slenderness ratio increases the deflection angle of the cavitator of the ventilated scav is larger and oscillates slightly around the equilibrium point the larger the slenderness ratio is the smaller the pitch angles i e the better the horizontal motion attitude of the two types of vehicles moreover the natural scav has a better motion attitude than the ventilated scav under the same slenderness ratio and therefore the former only needs a smaller fin deflection angle to balance the lateral force however as shown in fig 13 b the latter s range is greater than that of the former and the gap between the two increases as the slenderness ratio increases furthermore to analyze the influence of the slenderness ratio fig 14 a compares the change trends of the scavs optimization results for various slender ratios where σ generally refers to the dimensionless cavitation number including natural and ventilated situations with σ v and σ c the speed of motion significantly increases to reduce the cavitation number and produce a larger supercavity for the natural scav for the ventilated scav the cavitation number can be changed by regulating the ventilation rate therefore its motion speed shows little change compared with that of the natural scav during the optimization processes the cavitator diameter plays a role in neutralizing the size of the supercavity the cavitator diameter changes the supercavity size to avoid the wetted area of the vehicle s afterbody region being too small to maintain the force balance additionally the change in the cavitator diameter reduces the resistance on the cavitator to obtain a good navigation performance the cavitator diameters follow the same changing law with the slenderness ratio for the two types of the vehicles before the turning changes occur when the slenderness ratio is small the pitch angle and fin deflection angle of the natural scav change with larger fluctuations than those of the ventilated scav because the sharp decrease in the cavitation number leads to a significant increase in the supercavitation size in addition the deflection of the cavitator changes more obviously to supplement the lift for the natural scav this demonstrates that the motion attitude is easily affected by the small slenderness ratio for the natural scav which changes the lateral component of gravity in the longitudinal plane to balance gravity the fin also produces a corresponding deflection the natural scav s cavitator plays a prominent role in providing the lift as shown in fig 14 b in terms of the optimization range the growth rate of a ventilated scav s range with the slenderness ratio is gradually decreasing overall while that of the natural vehicle first increases and then tends to level off when the slenderness ratio is larger than approximately 18 6 conclusions by analyzing the force and balance conditions a range optimization model is established for the scavs during straight navigation wherein the constraint conditions include the force balance control surface constraints and the reasonable motion attitude and supercavity shape of the vehicle an adaptive genetic algorithm is improved to develop an optimization program i e ge zl code by segmenting the main optimization variable and performing multiple optimizations in each segment based on the range optimization model natural and ventilated scavs with the same propellant mass ratio are optimized to achieve the maximum ranges using the ge zl code for the natural scav analyses are performed on the influences of the navigation depth and slenderness ratio on the optimization variables and range a reasonable supercavity shape is obtained mainly by optimizing the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter to achieve a good drag reduction performance the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter have similar change trends with varying navigation depth to maintain supercavitating flows the speed of motion increases with increasing navigation depth an increasing speed of motion causes a sharp increase in the navigation drag thus the range decreases as the navigation depth increases but the magnitude of the decrease constantly decreases the deflection angle of the cavitator decreases as the navigation depth increases under the condition of no wetted afterbody the pitch angle s change rule with the navigation depth is similar to that of the fin deflection angle which is primarily responsible for the balance of lateral force regarding the influence of the slenderness ratio as the slenderness ratio increases the required natural cavitation number continues to decrease such that the speed of motion continues to increase to produce a sufficiently large supercavity when the slenderness ratio is not large the cavitator diameter decreases as the slenderness ratio increases the diameter increases again to ensure that the supercavity envelops the vehicle after the turning point of λ 18 similar to the effect of the navigation depth the pitch angle and fin deflection angle present similar change rules the vehicle exhibits a good horizontal motion attitude in the slenderness ratio range of 18 20 since the slenderness ratio causes changes in gravity the deflection angle of the cavitator becomes larger as the slenderness ratio increases until λ is larger than 18 at which point the pitch angles are very small an increase in the slenderness ratio causes an increase in the speed of motion and fuel mass thus the range increases as the ratio increases furthermore the relationship among the cavitator diameter body diameter and full length of the vehicle is formulated by the nonlinear least square method based on the optimization results for the ventilated scav a larger slenderness ratio also results in a smaller ventilation cavitation number to produce a larger supercavity overall although the ventilation cavitation number is not solely determined by the speed of motion the speed is an important factor that affects the value of the cavitation number therefore as the slenderness ratio increases the speed of motion continues to increase when the slenderness ratio does not exceed 15 the cavitator diameter decreases accordingly to obtain a reasonable supercavity macroscopic scale and improve the drag reduction effect otherwise the cavitator diameter increases to achieve a larger supercavity as the slenderness ratio increases the pitch angle and fin deflection angle exhibit similar change trends to satisfy the balance of the vehicle s lift and moment in opposite directions the vehicle has a relatively small pitch angle in the slenderness ratio ranges of 13 20 and the larger the slenderness ratio is the better the motion attitude as a supplement to lift the cavitator deflects to regulate the vehicle s lateral force similar to the case of the natural scav the ventilated scav s range also increases with the increase in the slenderness ratio the relationship between the dimensionless cavitator diameter and slenderness ratio is also modeled using the fitting method in addition by comparing the optimization results of the natural scav this study indicates that the degree of ventilation cavitation is higher than that of natural cavitation with the same slenderness ratio when the slenderness ratio is not very large therefore the pitch angle and the deflection angles of control surfaces are both sufficiently large to provide a restoring force for the ventilated scav in general both vehicles can simply rely on the deflections of the cavitator and fin to achieve horizontal and straight navigation the natural scav has a better horizontal motion attitude under the same slenderness ratio while through the coordinated optimization of the cavitation number and speed of motion the ventilated scav achieves a better drag reduction performance for the maximum range this study provides a research method for the optimization design of scavs to obtain a maximum horizontal straight range it is beneficial for designing the overall shape and hydrodynamic layout of natural and ventilated scavs and is also expected to promote the application of intelligent optimization algorithms in the scav research however for an actual ventilated scav ventilation is a critical parameter that is regulated for the supercavity shape in our following work ventilation will be included in the optimization by constructing a universal functional relationship between ventilation and the cavitation number credit authorship contribution statement wang zou

straight and level trajectory wherein the optimal variables include the cavitator number speed of motion diameter and deflection angle of the cavitator pitch angle and fin deflection angle the global search performance of the adaptive genetic algorithm is improved by segmenting the main optimization variables and performing multiple optimizations in each segment thereby resulting in the development of a program called the genetic zouliu code ge zl code based on the optimization model some geometric characteristic and motion parameters of natural and ventilated scavs are optimized to the maximum ranges using the ge zl code analyses are performed to determine the influences of the navigation depth and slenderness ratio of the vehicle on the optimization results i e the change trends of the optimization variables and the maximum range with the change in the navigation depth and slenderness ratio additionally the optimization results of the two vehicles are compared and analyzed furthermore based on the optimization results the relationships among the cavitator diameters column body diameters and full lengths of the vehicles are formulated using the nonlinear least square method based on the analyses of the afterbody force characteristics the study also shows that the scav can rely on only the deflections of the cavitator and fin to achieve good horizontal straight navigation without other wetted afterbodies by optimizing geometric characteristic and motion parameters keywords supercavity supercavitating vehicle optimization model genetic algorithm range 1 introduction a supercavitating vehicle scav is a new type of high speed underwater vehicle developed based on the principle and technology of supercavitation logvinovich 1969 the vehicle with the exception of its head and tail is covered by a large bubble i e supercavity to greatly reduce the navigation resistance kuklinski et al 2001 according to different generation methods supercavities can be divided into natural and ventilated supercavities natural supercavities are usually generated by increasing the speed of motion or reducing the ambient pressure hrubes 2001 saranjam 2013 a supercavity can also be formed by ventilating noncondensable gas into the flow separation area of the head of the vehicle kawakami and arndt 2011 lee et al 2019 which is called a ventilated supercavity and its size is maintained or controlled by adjusting the ventilation to change the pressure inside the supercavity zou and liu 2015 however the two types of supercavitating flows usually have similar hydrodynamic and drag reduction characteristics in the same cavitation state the second type of supercavitating flow expands the development and application of supercavitation drag reduction because there is no requirement for the flow velocity and ambient pressure and this type of supercavitating flow also provides a theoretical basis for the study of supercavitation in water tunnel experiments natural supercavitating flow is a two phase flow produced by vapor water phase changes and there are mass and momentum transports between the water and vapor on a supercavity wall the compressibility of water is very significant in very high speed flows hrubes 2001 the process of ventilated supercavitating flow is relatively complicated the flow involves not only momentum transport between gas and water zou et al 2018 but also mass transport between water and vapor i e natural cavitation which can occur on the front wall of the supercavity and vapor interacts with water and gas in terms of momentum when the inflow velocity is sufficiently high zou et al 2020 the degree of natural cavitation influences the trends describing ventilation controlling supercavitation vlasenko 2003 i e the relationship between the ventilation coefficient and ventilation cavitation number the greater the natural cavitation number is the greater the effect of ventilation control on the supercavitating flow the gas injected into the supercavity flows into the wake from a shear layer on the supercavity wall zou and zhang 2021 under fixed incoming flows and ventilation conditions the shear layer characteristic scale i e shear layer thickness increases with increasing reynolds numbers in addition the froude number which characterizes the influence of gravity has an important effect on the flow this effect is mainly reflected in two aspects supercavity deformation and tail closure kawakami and arndt 2011 the greater the influence of gravity is the more obvious the pressure difference between the supercavity upper and lower surfaces on the one hand the pressure difference causes the supercavity to float upwards along its longitudinal axis and on the other hand the pressure difference interacts with the adverse pressure gradient at the supercavity tail to produce velocity circulation on the longitudinal closed curve around the supercavity wall the gas in the shear layer exits from the vortex tubes on both sides of the tail to maintain the mass conservation of the gas inside the supercavity which is called vortex tube tail closure when the gravity effect is negligible the supercavity presents an axisymmetric shape under the combined action of an adverse pressure gradient and shear forces on the supercavity wall the tail is closed in the form of an unsteady re entrant jet with gas leakage governed by toroidal vortex shedding wang et al 2015 in experimental studies new tail closure phenomena are observed in the transition process of two classical types of closures karn et al 2016 in addition to the flow mechanisms the hydrodynamic characteristics and motion stability of scavs are also important issues in the field of supercavitation research the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vehicle are analyzed in terms of the angle of attack aoa yuan et al 2012 control surfaces i e cavitator and fin mokhtarzadeh et al 2012 sanabria et al 2015 and afterbody paryshev 2003 ncnitt et al 2006 lee et al 2008 in water tunnel experiments numerical simulations of the multiphase flow model based on computational fluid dynamics cfd also show that a vehicle without motion control can rely on the wet hydrodynamic force of the afterbody to maintain stable straight motion lindau et al 2003 and a good pitching motion attitude yu et al 2012 in the longitudinal plane in addition the semiempirical and theoretical supercavity models are usually applied to establish the dynamic model of the vehicle to analyze motion characteristics and stability kulkarni and pratap 2010 nguyen and balachandran 2011 kim and kim 2015 savchenko et al 2019 based on rigid body dynamic theory to accurately calculate the unsteady state of the supercavity supercavity dynamic models kirschner and arzoumanian 2008 serebryakov 2009 zou et al 2016 are applied in a scav dynamic model for complicated motion simulations and analyses and then the dynamic model is coupled with a control law to realize the simulations of climbing diving and acceleration motions of a scav in the longitudinal plane zou and wang 2020 zou et al 2021 the range like maneuverability is also worthy of attention mirzaei and taghvaei 2019 under certain propulsion performance conditions the motion performance is closely related to the cavitating flow pattern and the vehicle s hydrodynamic distribution motion parameters and control surfaces model experiments and cfd based numerical simulations are both commonly used methods for hydrodynamic analysis and vehicle design however the time and economic costs of these two methods are relatively large with the rapid development of optimization theory intelligent algorithms aim to overcome the constraints of continuous differentiability of the objective function and constraint conditions in traditional optimization algorithms thereby realizing the transformation from direction oriented to problem oriented problems additionally these algorithms have relatively high computational accuracy and efficiency in solving complicated problems and their results are less dependent on the selection of initial points than the results of previous algorithms the more popular intelligent algorithms in the field of optimization design mainly include genetic algorithms simulated annealing algorithms particle swarm algorithms and ant colony algorithms since the overall search strategy and optimized search method of a genetic algorithm which do not rely on gradient information or other auxiliary knowledge during calculation only need the objective function influencing the search direction and the corresponding fitness function this type of algorithm provides a general framework for solving complicated problems and has strong robustness toward different types of problems genetic algorithms have been developed and applied in the fields of trajectory optimization and aerodynamic optimization for aircraft through improvement or combination with other algorithms hybrid genetic algorithms are developed to optimize planetary exploration trajectories crain et al 2000 wuerl et al 2003 a method is proposed to optimize flight trajectories in the cruise phase using a genetic algorithm patron and botez 2015 wherein lateral and vertical flight profiles are optimized simultaneously based on the algorithm the optimal trajectory generator developed can avoid collisions and safely attain the targets for space robots seddaoui and saaj 2021 in addition considering factors such as the engine aerodynamics and control a multiobjective optimization of a missile with a solid rocket motor is carried out using the pareto genetic algorithm anderson et al 2001 bayley et al 2008 a multiobjective genetic algorithm is developed for the integrated design optimization of aerodynamic shapes and propulsion systems in supersonic aircraft design rallabhandi and mavris 2008 and applied to a novel optimization method for the design of aircraft mission success spaces gao et al 2020 in the process of aerodynamic optimization an adaptive parameter method can also be used to improve the search efficiency and global optimization ability of a genetic algorithm ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 overall the genetic algorithm is the most widely used and successful intelligent algorithm therefore this study intends to establish a range optimization model for a scav in horizontal and straight flight and the genetic algorithm is improved to achieve a better global search performance to develop a program called ge zl code by segmenting the main optimization variable and performing several cycles of optimization in each segment based on the optimization model the cavitation number speed of motion diameter and deflection angle of the cavitator pitch angle and fin deflection angle are optimized to achieve the maximum straight navigation range for a scav using the self developed ge zl code 2 range optimization model in addition to the propulsion performance navigation resistance is one of the most important factors affecting the range of a scav since the vehicle is almost surrounded by a supercavity only its head and tail are in contact with water as shown in fig 1 the resistance is mainly produced by the head i e cavitator of the vehicle and is approximately proportional to the square of the speed of motion and the front flow area of the cavitator as well as closely related to the supercavitating flow state in addition to hydrodynamic forces on the cavitator and fin i e f c and f f the vehicle s afterbody can contact the supercavity wall thereby generating sufficient planing force i e f p to maintain the balance of the force and torque in fact the cavitation degree and the relative position between the supercavity and vehicle determine the force characteristics of the vehicle the supercavity trajectory is determined by the cavitator motion thus body coordinate system b of the scav is established at the cavitator which is beneficial for dynamic modeling and analysis the plane x b z b coincides with the longitudinal plane of the vehicle in the coordinate system and axis x b is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and points in the direction of motion the cavitator is the only component in fig 2 that always remains wet the resultant force is perpendicular to the cavitator s upstream surface and decomposed into drag and lift in coordinate system b in eqs 2 and 3 zou and wang 2020 which have been validated by experiments

g m b g x g cos θ to provide a restoring moment the vehicle s afterbody usually comes into contact with the supercavity wall to generate a planing force f p and its moment m p the force is usually perpendicular to the longitudinal axis in fig 1 which causes the vehicle s dynamic system to be highly nonlinear but it also plays a vital role in maintaining the vehicle s stable motion the force is

hydrodynamic forces depend on the wetted area of the vehicle the wetted area is obtained by calculating the supercavity shape to determine the relative position between the vehicle and the supercavity for a scav under a cruise state its motion state and supercavitating flow pattern are approximately unchanged therefore for the large scav in this study whose motion speed is lower than the underwater sound speed a steady supercavity model is obtained for the supercavity shape by solving the unsteady supercavity cross section equation validated by experiments serebryakov 2015 and numerical simulations zou et al 2016 2018 16 r c 2 r n 2 r n 2 c d k σ k μ x σ 2 μ x 2 17 k 1 2 l n 2 e l n 4 1 m a 2 σ μ l n λ c e the supercavity deforms under the actions of gravity and the lateral force on

in the cruising state the speed and fuel combustion rate of the vehicle remain almost constant thus the propellant mass satisfies the formula m f m f t and the range l r of the vehicle i e the

area it is necessary to further constrain the supercavity dimension and the relative position of the supercavity and vehicle no areas except for the head and tail of the vehicle should be able to get wet the supercavity radius is relatively small at the junction between the cone section and the column section of the vehicle which is usually located in the front of the supercavity if the supercavity is not large enough the vehicle is likely to experience moisture at the joint to avoid this scenario the constraint in eq 24 is established to ensure that the supercavity radius at the junction is greater than the radius of the column section in the same way the constraint in eq 25 ensures that the supercavity can envelope the vehicle furthermore the constraint in eq 26 is added to prevent the wetted area of the vehicle s afterbody from being too large and affecting the calculation accuracy of the planing force model in eq 14 24 r b r n 2 r n 2 c d k σ c k μ α l l b σ c 2 μ α l

simulates the genetic and evolutionary processes of organisms in a natural environment the algorithm compares each solution of the optimization problem to a single individual and these individuals constitute a population by simulating operations such as selection crossover and mutation in a natural biological world individuals continue to evolve and finally an optimal solution is obtained the calculation process of the algorithm is shown in fig 4 first the code length l of the variables is set based on the initial parameters and their precision the binary coding method is used for optimization variables due to its simple coding and decoding operations and easy implementation of the crossover and mutate operations for n d in the interval m n the binary form is obtained by first calculating n b using formula 27 and then converting n b into a binary number while the decoding process involves first converting a binary number into a decimal value and then calculating the corresponding decimal number using formula 27 27 n b n d m 2 l 1 n m after the variables are encoded into binary forms they are spliced to obtain a chromosome with a length of 16 the chromosome represents the genetic information of an individual and its changes are the essence of evolution considering the diversity of the population and avoiding a local optimum a completely random method is used to initialize the population composed of many individuals the population size is the number of individuals due to the different complexities of the problems the population numbers are 1000 and 2000 respectively in the optimization processes of the natural and ventilated scavs herein the genetic algorithm sets up a fitness function to evaluate the pros and cons of individuals the larger the value of the fitness function is the better the individual the fitness function is usually set according to the objective function importantly for the constrained optimization problems in this manuscript the constraint conditions are added as penalty functions to the objective function i e the range optimization model to achieve unconstrained optimizations for the maximum optimization problem similar to the research the objective function is set as the fitness function the fitness of each individual in the population is calculated and then the individuals are sorted from small to large according to their fitness while keeping the best individual in the next generation using an elite retention strategy to ensure that the fitness is positive a power function of f x i i 1 3 is used to reassign each individual where f x i is the fitness of the i th individual the roulette algorithm causes the fitness of an individual to be positively correlated with the selection probability as the most classic selection algorithm such that the individuals with higher fitness have a higher probability of being retained in the next generation to ensure that the population evolves in the direction of optimization therefore the probability of each individual being selected is calculated using the roulette algorithm the specific process assumes that there are a total of n individuals in the population and the probability of selection of the i th individual is p s x i f x i j 1 n f x j by generating random numbers between 0 and 1 the roulette algorithm is again applied to select individuals needing genetic operations to generate a new generation of parents for the crossover and mutation operations the adaptive probability algorithm is used to calculate different crossover and mutation probabilities for individuals with different fitness levels in eqs 28 and 29 this makes individuals with poor fitness levels change more easily thereby ensuring the diversity of the population for individuals with better fitness the probabilities of crossover and mutation are reduced to avoid the convergence difficulty in the later stage of the algorithm single point crossover and single point mutation methods are used to perform crossover and mutation operations on individuals for individuals with odd numbers in the population in turn a random number is generated between 0 and 1 and compared with the crossover probability of the individual to determine whether the individual needs to crossover if the former is smaller than the latter the individual and its following individual are cross operated i e the two are divided at a randomly selected position and the parts on the right are exchanged after a round of crossover operations for each individual in the population a random number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared with the mutation probability of the individual the same method applied for the crossover operation is used to determine whether the individual is mutated the specific operation of mutation involves reversing the original genic value at a randomly selected position when the genetic operations of each generation are completed the optimization process is continued or terminated based on whether a termination condition is satisfied the maximum number of iterations is set to 1600 as the termination condition herein 28 p 1 p c 1 p c 1 p c 2 f 1 f avg f max f avg f 1 f avg p c 1 f 1 f avg 29 p 2 p m 1 p m 1 p m 2 f max f 2 f max f avg f 2 f avg p m 1 f 2 f avg here the upper and lower limits of the crossover probability p 1 of individuals are set as p c 2 0 5 p c 1 0 9 respectively and the upper and lower limits of the mutation probability p 2 of individuals are set as p m 2 0 2 and p m 1 0 9 respectively for complicated problems with multiple optimization variables a method to improve the global search performance of the algorithm is proposed herein i e the main optimization variable is segmented the problem is optimized multiple times in each segment and the best solution is taken as the final optimization result the cavitator diameter is selected as the main optimization variable in this study next the schaffer function is solved to examine the global search performance and computational stability of the self developed ge zl code because it has a strong oscillating behavior which makes it difficult to find its maximum value as shown in fig 5 additionally to better demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm the obtained solution is compared with the results obtained from classic algorithms in table 1 where ge sa sqp and ds represent the genetic algorithm the simulated annealing algorithm the sequential quadratic programming algorithm and the nelder mead direct search in the matlab toolbox respectively it can be seen from the table that the solution obtained by the ge zl code can accurately predict the exact solution 30 f 0 5 sin 2 x 2 y 2 0 5 1 0 001 x 2 y 2 2 4 optimization of the natural scav natural supercavitation is mainly produced by increasing the motion velocity to change the body surface pressure and its cavitation degree which is characterized by the natural cavitation number is determined by the motion velocity and ambient pressure the independent optimization variables in the optimization include the natural cavitation number the diameter and deflection angle of the cavitator the deflection angle of the fin and the pitch angle the motion velocity is calculated according to the natural cavitation number and ambient pressure taking into account the actual motion of the vehicle it is necessary to further constrain the ranges of the changes in the pitch angle and control surfaces to ensure a reasonable motion attitude and avoid the saturation of control surfaces see table 2 these constraints also ensure the accuracy of the hydrodynamic calculation of the control surfaces in addition the range of cavitation number is limited to ensure the production of supercavitation and the variation of the cavitator diameter should meet the basic requirement for drag reduction based on the range optimization model the natural scav is optimized using the ge zl algorithm and the basic model parameters in table 3 the optimization variables and range tend to be stable after 1600 iterations as shown in fig 6 it is worth mentioning that since the selection crossover and mutation in the algorithm are all random operations rather than deterministic rules the algorithm has a certain degree of randomness therefore the relatively strong oscillations that occur in the initial stage in the figure are understandable the vehicle obtains the maximum range l r 2638 15 m when the optimization variables are σ v 0 0474 v 157 3067 m s d n 0 0774 m θ 0 0010 rad δ c 0 0153 r a d and δ f 0 0016 r a d under these conditions of the cavitation degree and the vehicle s characteristic geometry and motion attitude the vehicle has a good performance in reducing drag the pitch angle is a very small negative value i e θ 0 0 57 3 0 which means that the vehicle maintains a good horizontal movement attitude the cavitator is deflected downward by 0 8 766 0 around its transverse axis to supplement the lift the horizontal fins deflect upward and the aoa of the fin is positive to provide the lift with α f arctan w f u f arctan u s δ f w c δ f u c δ f w s δ f 0 0917 0 fig 7 a shows that compared with the longitudinal force f x c the lateral force f z c is a very small for the cavitator therefore it is believed that the resultant force acting on the cavitator is perpendicular to the upstream surface of the cavitator which coincides with the theoretical analysis logvinovich 1969 although the lift force l f is much greater than the drag d f in the velocity coordinate system of the fin the fin drag f x f in the body coordinate system of the vehicle is much smaller than the lateral force f z f that produces a large pitching moment m y f as shown in fig 7 b for the scav the fin is mainly used as a control surface to provide the lift in such a small pitch attitude the deflections of the control surfaces of the vehicle can prevent the afterbody from wetting that is the planing force f z p is zero as shown in fig 7 c since the cavitation degree depends on the ambient pressure and the covered body length the navigation depth and slenderness ratio both have an effect on the motion state and performance of the natural scav therefore by optimizing the vehicles with different navigation depths and slenderness ratios analyses are performed on the influences of the navigation depth and slenderness ratio on the optimization results 4 1 optimizations of the natural scavs with different navigation depths the greater the navigation depth is the greater the ambient pressure is and the more difficult it is for natural cavitation to occur under the same vehicle model parameters the optimization results vary with different navigation depths based on the range optimization model the vehicle is optimized at different water depths using the basic model parameters in table 3 fig 8 a shows the influence of the navigation depth on the optimization variables of the vehicle where h is the dimensionless navigation depth with h h h 0 and h 0 5 m σ v v d θ δ c and δ f are the dimensionless optimization variables and σ v σ v σ v 0 v v v 0 d d n d n 0 θ θ θ 0 δ c δ c δ c 0 and δ f δ f δ f 0 where σ v 0 v 0 d n 0 θ 0 δ c 0 and δ f 0 are the optimization variables at the water depth h 0 a properly sized supercavity shape is formed to achieve good drag reduction performance by jointly adjusting the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter because the change trends of the supercavity size with changing cavitation number and changing cavitator diameter are opposite that is the supercavity size decreases with the increase in the former and increases with the increase in the latter the change trends of the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter with increasing navigation depth are similar as the ambient pressure increases with increasing water depth the speed of motion of the vehicle increases to maintain supercavitating flows state overall the deflection angle of the cavitator generally decreases as the water depth increases except at a water depth of 125 m where the larger pitch angle of the vehicle results in the generation of a planing force and the cavitator deflects to further supplement the lift it should be emphasized that the larger the pitch angle of the vehicle is the smaller the lateral force caused by gravity and the smaller the lift required for the fin to decrease the lift the deflection of the fin increases to reduce the fin s aoa and vice versa therefore the pitch angle and fin deflection angle show very similar changes in numerical value with increasing navigation depth the deflection directions of the two are opposite except at a mutational water depth of 125 m in addition when the navigation depth gradually increases the increased speed of motion greatly increases the resistance thereby increasing the propellant mass combustion rate of the vehicle and shortening the navigation time for the same vehicle the maximum range decreases with increasing navigation depth and this change gradually shows signs of becoming level as shown in fig 8 b where l r 0 is the range at h 0 4 2 optimizations of the natural scavs with different slenderness ratios the vehicle s slenderness ratio i e the ratio of the vehicle length to the body diameter λ l b d b not only determines the propellant fuel mass to a certain extent but also influences the drag reduction performance of supercavitating flows covering the body surface different slenderness ratios are obtained by fixing the body diameter and changing the vehicle length the vehicles with different slenderness ratios are optimized using the model parameters in table 3 as shown in fig 9 where λ is the dimensionless slenderness ratio λ λ λ 0 λ 0 5 and the optimization variable values of the vehicle at λ 0 are taken as the characteristic values for the nondimensionalization of the optimization variables it is interesting that the planing force does not occur in all optimized states fig 9 a shows that the vehicle needs to move faster to attain a larger supercavity enveloping the vehicle as the slenderness ratio increases the speed of motion increases with increasing slenderness ratio and the natural cavitation number decreases accordingly overall the cavitator diameter shows a decreasing trend thereby ensuring the optimal supercavitation shape and drag reduction performance however the cavitator diameter increases to make the supercavity cover the vehicle after the turning point of λ 18 the pitch angle and fin deflection angle rotate to maintain the balance of lateral forces on the vehicle and show very similar trends in numerical value as the slenderness ratio varies for the same reason presented in section 4 1 it is worth noting that when λ is in the range of 18 20 the pitch angles are close to zero at θ 0 0011 0 this means that the vehicles with these slenderness ratio can have very good horizontal motion attitudes the increase in the slenderness ratio increases the gravity on the vehicle when the slenderness ratio increases to a certain degree the cavitator is required to deflect downward to provide part of the lift to maintain the force balance thus the downward deflection angle of the cavitator increases as the slenderness ratio increases until λ is larger than 18 where the pitch angles are very small additionally the optimization range increases as the slenderness ratio increases in fig 9 b where l r 0 is the range at λ 0 when λ increases to 18 the change in range slows there are two main reasons for the effect on the one hand when the propulsion fuel mass ratio is constant the fuel mass is positively correlated with the slenderness ratio similar to the correlation with the vehicle mass the greater the slenderness ratio is the greater the fuel mass and the greater the assurance of long distance navigation on the other hand the speed of motion generally increases as the slenderness ratio increases considering that the cavitator diameter influences the generation and size of the supercavity and that the length and body diameter of the vehicle influence the development process of supercavitation it is important to reveal the inherent relationship between the characteristic geometric parameters of the vehicle when the maximum range is obtained the relationship between the cavitator diameter and the slenderness ratio is shown in fig 9 c where d n is the dimensionless cavitator diameter and d n d n d b the cavitator diameter decreases with increasing slenderness ratio until the slenderness ratio is close to 18 and then shows a tendency to gradually increase the functional relationship between the two is obtained using the nonlinear least square method where d n a λ 2 b λ c a 0 001008 b 0 03703 and c 0 4661 the fitting formula provides a theoretical reference for the design research of supercavitating vehicles to a certain extent 5 optimization of the ventilated scav ventilated supercavitation is fundamentally different from natural supercavitation in terms of generation the ventilation cavitation number which characterizes the degree of cavitation mainly depends on the pressure of the noncondensable gas injected into a supercavity unlike the case of natural supercavitation the ventilation cavitation number and the speed of motion are two independent optimization variables and the ambient pressure has a limited influence on the navigation performance of the vehicle under ventilated supercavitation therefore the ranges of the ventilated scavs with different slenderness ratios are optimized here the basic model parameters of the vehicle are consistent with those of the natural scav see table 3 during the optimization process in addition to constraining the optimization variables in table 2 the speed of motion must be constrained to ensure that the vehicle has a higher speed than conventional underwater vehicles the constraint range of the speed is v 50 150 m s fig 10 shows the iterative process of vehicle optimization when the slenderness ratio is 6 6667 compared with the natural scav the ventilated scav has a smaller optimal speed of motion but obtains a smaller ventilation cavitation number for a specific reasonable supercavity shape a small cavitation number means that a large cavitator diameter is not needed to achieve the best cruise performance the ventilated scav maintains a small negative pitch angle and its control surfaces deflect to provide the lift the attitude characteristics and their principles are similar to those of the natural scav the optimized ventilated scav is subject to less navigation resistance than the optimized natural scav thus the range of the former is greatly improved under the same propeller performance apart from the magnitude difference in the drag the hydrodynamic characteristics in fig 11 are also similar for the two types of the vehicles overall both can simply use the deflections of the cavitator and fin to maintain the balance of the lateral force and the horizontal straight motion 5 1 optimizations of the ventilated scavs with different slenderness ratios overall the optimal ventilated cavitation number decreases to generate a larger supercavity covering the vehicle with the increase in the slenderness ratio λ of the scav and the speed of motion shows an increasing change rule at a fixed navigation depth as shown in fig 12 a although the slenderness ratio of the supercavity is essentially related to only the cavitation number zou et al 2016 the cavitator diameter can appropriately decrease to avoid excessive supercavitation influencing the drag reduction effect when λ is not large i e λ 15 for the cases in which λ is greater than approximately 15 the cavitator diameter and cavitation number synergistically change to increase the size of the supercavity as λ increases the pitch angle and fin deflection angle are in opposite directions with similar change trends to satisfy the balance of the lift and pitch moment in the slenderness ratio range of 13 20 the larger the slenderness ratio is the better the vehicle can maintain the horizontal motion attitude the cavitator deflects to supplement the lift for the same reason the range of the ventilated scav increases as the slenderness ratio increases similar to the natural scav in fig 12 b where l r 0 is the range at λ 0 additionally the dimensionless cavitator diameter first decreases and then increases as the slenderness ratio increases as shown in fig 12 c the turning point of the change occurs in the slenderness ratio range of 18 20 the fitting formula is d n a λ 2 b λ c where a 0 001123 b 0 03786 and c 0 4569 5 2 comparison and analysis of the optimizations of natural and ventilated scavs due to the differences in their supercavitation generation mechanisms the natural and ventilated scavs have different parameter characteristics after optimization as shown in fig 13 a where σ generally refers to the cavitation number including natural and ventilated situations i e σ v and σ c and the blue solid line and black dotted line represent the results of the former and the latter respectively when the slenderness ratio is very small the natural cavitation number is significantly larger than the ventilation cavitation number because the natural cavitation number and speed of motion are not independent variables for the natural scav the optimal cavitation number mainly satisfies the supercaviation condition enveloping the vehicle as much as possible in the case of a small slenderness ratio the natural cavitation number is certainly large however the cavitation number is not completely determined by the speed of motion and ambient pressure for a ventilated scav it needs to be optimized with the speed of motion to reduce the vehicle s resistance as much as possible and its value cannot be large the degree of ventilated cavitation is higher than that of natural cavitation thus the ventilated scav needs a large pitch angle and large deflection angles of control surfaces i e cavitator and fin to provide a restoring force overall for a vehicle with a medium or large slenderness ratio the changes of the optimization variables with changing slenderness ratio tend to slow overall in the natural and ventilated supercavitation states the natural cavitation number gradually decreases and the ventilation cavitation number tends to stabilize the speeds of motion increase with increasing slenderness ratio and the speed of the natural scav which is fully responsible for the generation of supercavitation at a fixed navigation depth is larger than that of the ventilated scav the ventilated scav achieves a better drag reduction performance by simultaneously optimizing the cavitation number and speed of motion the cavitator diameters show a similar change trend to that of the slenderness ratio for natural and ventilated scavs however the slenderness ratio at which the cavitator diameter of a ventilated scav undergoes a transitional change is smaller than that of a natural scav compared with the deflection angle of the cavitator of the natural scav which increases first and then decreases as the slenderness ratio increases the deflection angle of the cavitator of the ventilated scav is larger and oscillates slightly around the equilibrium point the larger the slenderness ratio is the smaller the pitch angles i e the better the horizontal motion attitude of the two types of vehicles moreover the natural scav has a better motion attitude than the ventilated scav under the same slenderness ratio and therefore the former only needs a smaller fin deflection angle to balance the lateral force however as shown in fig 13 b the latter s range is greater than that of the former and the gap between the two increases as the slenderness ratio increases furthermore to analyze the influence of the slenderness ratio fig 14 a compares the change trends of the scavs optimization results for various slender ratios where σ generally refers to the dimensionless cavitation number including natural and ventilated situations with σ v and σ c the speed of motion significantly increases to reduce the cavitation number and produce a larger supercavity for the natural scav for the ventilated scav the cavitation number can be changed by regulating the ventilation rate therefore its motion speed shows little change compared with that of the natural scav during the optimization processes the cavitator diameter plays a role in neutralizing the size of the supercavity the cavitator diameter changes the supercavity size to avoid the wetted area of the vehicle s afterbody region being too small to maintain the force balance additionally the change in the cavitator diameter reduces the resistance on the cavitator to obtain a good navigation performance the cavitator diameters follow the same changing law with the slenderness ratio for the two types of the vehicles before the turning changes occur when the slenderness ratio is small the pitch angle and fin deflection angle of the natural scav change with larger fluctuations than those of the ventilated scav because the sharp decrease in the cavitation number leads to a significant increase in the supercavitation size in addition the deflection of the cavitator changes more obviously to supplement the lift for the natural scav this demonstrates that the motion attitude is easily affected by the small slenderness ratio for the natural scav which changes the lateral component of gravity in the longitudinal plane to balance gravity the fin also produces a corresponding deflection the natural scav s cavitator plays a prominent role in providing the lift as shown in fig 14 b in terms of the optimization range the growth rate of a ventilated scav s range with the slenderness ratio is gradually decreasing overall while that of the natural vehicle first increases and then tends to level off when the slenderness ratio is larger than approximately 18 6 conclusions by analyzing the force and balance conditions a range optimization model is established for the scavs during straight navigation wherein the constraint conditions include the force balance control surface constraints and the reasonable motion attitude and supercavity shape of the vehicle an adaptive genetic algorithm is improved to develop an optimization program i e ge zl code by segmenting the main optimization variable and performing multiple optimizations in each segment based on the range optimization model natural and ventilated scavs with the same propellant mass ratio are optimized to achieve the maximum ranges using the ge zl code for the natural scav analyses are performed on the influences of the navigation depth and slenderness ratio on the optimization variables and range a reasonable supercavity shape is obtained mainly by optimizing the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter to achieve a good drag reduction performance the natural cavitation number and cavitator diameter have similar change trends with varying navigation depth to maintain supercavitating flows the speed of motion increases with increasing navigation depth an increasing speed of motion causes a sharp increase in the navigation drag thus the range decreases as the navigation depth increases but the magnitude of the decrease constantly decreases the deflection angle of the cavitator decreases as the navigation depth increases under the condition of no wetted afterbody the pitch angle s change rule with the navigation depth is similar to that of the fin deflection angle which is primarily responsible for the balance of lateral force regarding the influence of the slenderness ratio as the slenderness ratio increases the required natural cavitation number continues to decrease such that the speed of motion continues to increase to produce a sufficiently large supercavity when the slenderness ratio is not large the cavitator diameter decreases as the slenderness ratio increases the diameter increases again to ensure that the supercavity envelops the vehicle after the turning point of λ 18 similar to the effect of the navigation depth the pitch angle and fin deflection angle present similar change rules the vehicle exhibits a good horizontal motion attitude in the slenderness ratio range of 18 20 since the slenderness ratio causes changes in gravity the deflection angle of the cavitator becomes larger as the slenderness ratio increases until λ is larger than 18 at which point the pitch angles are very small an increase in the slenderness ratio causes an increase in the speed of motion and fuel mass thus the range increases as the ratio increases furthermore the relationship among the cavitator diameter body diameter and full length of the vehicle is formulated by the nonlinear least square method based on the optimization results for the ventilated scav a larger slenderness ratio also results in a smaller ventilation cavitation number to produce a larger supercavity overall although the ventilation cavitation number is not solely determined by the speed of motion the speed is an important factor that affects the value of the cavitation number therefore as the slenderness ratio increases the speed of motion continues to increase when the slenderness ratio does not exceed 15 the cavitator diameter decreases accordingly to obtain a reasonable supercavity macroscopic scale and improve the drag reduction effect otherwise the cavitator diameter increases to achieve a larger supercavity as the slenderness ratio increases the pitch angle and fin deflection angle exhibit similar change trends to satisfy the balance of the vehicle s lift and moment in opposite directions the vehicle has a relatively small pitch angle in the slenderness ratio ranges of 13 20 and the larger the slenderness ratio is the better the motion attitude as a supplement to lift the cavitator deflects to regulate the vehicle s lateral force similar to the case of the natural scav the ventilated scav s range also increases with the increase in the slenderness ratio the relationship between the dimensionless cavitator diameter and slenderness ratio is also modeled using the fitting method in addition by comparing the optimization results of the natural scav this study indicates that the degree of ventilation cavitation is higher than that of natural cavitation with the same slenderness ratio when the slenderness ratio is not very large therefore the pitch angle and the deflection angles of control surfaces are both sufficiently large to provide a restoring force for the ventilated scav in general both vehicles can simply rely on the deflections of the cavitator and fin to achieve horizontal and straight navigation the natural scav has a better horizontal motion attitude under the same slenderness ratio while through the coordinated optimization of the cavitation number and speed of motion the ventilated scav achieves a better drag reduction performance for the maximum range this study provides a research method for the optimization design of scavs to obtain a maximum horizontal straight range it is beneficial for designing the overall shape and hydrodynamic layout of natural and ventilated scavs and is also expected to promote the application of intelligent optimization algorithms in the scav research however for an actual ventilated scav ventilation is a critical parameter that is regulated for the supercavity shape in our following work ventilation will be included in the optimization by constructing a universal functional relationship between ventilation and the cavitation number credit authorship contribution statement wang zou
