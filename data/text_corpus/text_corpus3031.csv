15155,the removal of organic micropollutants in municipal wastewater treatment is an extensively studied field of research but the underlying enzymatic processes have only been elucidated to a small extent so far in order to shed more light on the enzymatic degradation of the artificial sweetener acesulfame ace in this context we enriched two bacterial taxa which were not yet described to be involved in the degradation of ace an unknown chelatococcus species and ensifer adhaerens by incubating activated sludge in chemically defined media containing ace as sole carbon source cell free lysates were extracted spiked with ace and analyzed via target lc ms ms demonstrating for the first time enzymatically catalyzed ace degradation outside of living cells fractionation of the lysate via two dimensional fast protein liquid chromatography fplc succeeded in a partial separation of the enzymes catalyzing the initial transformation reaction of ace from those catalyzing the further transformation pathway thereby an accumulation of the intermediate transformation product acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid ansa in the ace degrading fractions was achieved providing first quantitative evidence that the cleavage of the sulfuric ester moiety of ace is the initial transformation step the metaproteome of the enrichments was analyzed in the fplc fractions and in the unfractionated lysate using shotgun proteomics via uhplc hrms ms and label free quantification the comparison of protein abundances in the fplc fractions to the corresponding ace degradation rates revealed a metallo β lactamase fold metallo hydrolase as most probable candidate for the enzyme catalyzing the initial transformation from ace to ansa this enzyme was by far the most abundant of all detected proteins and amounted to a relative protein abundance of 91 in the most active fraction after the second fractionation step moreover the analysis of the unfractionated lysate resulted in a list of further proteins possibly involved in the transformation of ace most striking a highly abundant amidase likely catalyzing the further transformation of ansa and an abc transporter substrate binding protein that may be involved in the uptake of ace into the cell graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acesulfame enzymatic degradation transformation pathway protein fractionation shotgun proteomics label free quantification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction acesulfame ace is a non caloric artificial sweetener approved in more than 100 countries for usage in beverages food personal care products and pharmaceutical preparations nearly a thousand metric tons were used in the united states alone in 2019 belton et al 2020 after ingestion and absorption ace is excreted without being metabolized thus entering the water cycle unchanged via domestic wastewater renwick 1986 von rymon lipinski and hanger 2001 while ace was predominantly reported persistent towards biodegradation for years buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2010 lange et al 2012 spoelstra et al 2013 harwood 2014 it had already been shown that ace can be degraded by technical processes like ozonation scheurer et al 2010 or photolysis by uv light gan et al 2014 sang et al 2014 scheurer et al 2014 however an increasing number of studies indicated that also biologically mediated degradation is possible ace removal has been reported in soil incubation experiments buerge et al 2011 bank filtration sites storck et al 2015 in a lab scale fixed bed reactor storck et al 2016 as well as in bench scale activated sludge sequencing batch reactors sbr falås et al 2016 and in wwtps cardenas et al 2016 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 using literature data and analysis of time dependent evolvements of mass loads of ace in german rivers it was concluded that the capability of biological degradation of ace in wwtps has evolved in different regions of the world during the last decade kahl et al 2018 de lorenzo 2022 this was a striking result as the evolution of the capability for the degradation of a specific micropollutant in wwtps has not been observed so far raising questions about the complete transformation pathway as well as the microbes and enzymes involved in the degradation of ace in a previous study we identified sulfamic acid sa as quantitatively formed sole stable transformation product tp castronovo et al 2017 it was furthermore shown that the formation of acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid ansa occurred via cleavage of the ace sulfuric ester while we assessed the substance as an intermediate of a sidechain reaction and favored an assumed degradation pathway via cleavage of the ace amide bond kahl et al 2018 demonstrated for the first time that bacteria can grow on ace as sole carbon source in enrichment cultures and observed an increased abundance of several families of proteobacteria predominantly of phyllobacteriaceae nitrobacteraceae methylophilaceae and pseudomonaceae while also detecting the quantitative formation of sa kleinsteuber et al 2019 also observed the mineralization to sa and detected ansa formation but could not quantify the substance also leaving the option that it is merely a product of a sidechain reaction they succeeded in isolating several strains of the genera bosea and chelatococcus as first proven ace degrading bacteria while huang et al 2021 and huang et al 2022 isolated two more strains of chelatococcus and three bacterial strains of the genus shinella with that capability as the approval as a food additive already indicates the estimated risk of ace for human health and the environment has been predominantly classified as low so far although it was reported that phototoxicity of its photodegradation products may affect aquatic ecosystems naik et al 2021 moreover recent studies from yu et al 2021 and yu et al 2022 and li et al 2022 indicated that ace and other artificial sweeteners might play a non neglectable role in the dissemination of antibiotics resistances which gives greatly increased urgency to the studies of its degradation and the involved organisms genes and proteins studies analyzing the genomes of isolated bacterial strains and metagenomes of consortia degrading ace huang et al 2021 and huang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 have been conducted recently but despite the extensive research already done and knowledge gained on this topic the crucial genes and enzymes involved in ace degradation are still not unambiguously identified which would be a prerequisite to be able to trace the evolution and spread of this ability to the best of our knowledge there is no available literature to date analyzing the actual protein expression of ace degrading organisms in order to search for the responsible enzymes and neither have enzyme assays been applied for this purpose so far in the present study we therefore expanded the range of analytical methods used to investigate ace degradation until now by combining bottom up shotgun proteomics which is the proteomics approach most commonly used for enzyme discovery sturmberger et al 2016 with protein fractionation and enzyme activity assays the objectives of this study were to identify unknown ace degrading bacteria via enrichment from activated sludge to evaluate if enzymatically catalyzed ace degradation can be achieved outside of living cells in order to facilitate a more targeted search for enzymes involved in degradation through lysate fractionation accompanied by enzyme assays to separate the individual reaction steps of ace degradation by separating the responsible enzymes in order to unequivocally identify the metabolic pathway route and the underlying enzymatic functions to identify proteins involved in the degradation of ace 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental workflow an overview of the applied experimental workflow is shown in fig 1 an activated sludge inoculum was incubated in two slightly different chemically defined media one containing nh4 the other no3 as nitrogen source and both containing ace as sole carbon source for details see chapter 2 3 the taxonomic composition of both enriched cultures was analyzed via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to identify the taxa responsible for ace degradation see chapters 2 5 and 2 6 culture 1 was used for further experiments and measurements aiming on enzyme activity assays and metaproteome analysis a first experimental approach to identify the enzyme catalyzing the degradation of ace was to split culture 1 into parallel batches and search for overexpressed proteins in a target batch fed with ace in comparison to parallel control batches fed with alternative carbon sources however this setup led to considerable taxonomic variations between the different treatments and inconclusive metaproteomics results data not shown activity based protein profiling another common method and one of the most direct ways for enzyme discovery sturmberger et al 2016 was no available option due to the lack of an appropriate chemical probe therefore we instead expanded an approach published by krah et al 2016 who analyzed the degradation of micropollutants in lysates extracted from activated sludge from a wwtp in order to considerably reduce sample complexity and facilitate the search for the enzyme s catalyzing the initial ace transformation we subjected the cell free basic lysate after extraction see chapter 2 7 to a two dimensional fractionation via fast protein liquid chromatography fplc see chapter 2 8 the resulting fractions were analyzed via enzyme activity assays see chapter 2 9 and shotgun proteomics see chapters 2 11 and 2 12 proteins of interest were identified via comparison of protein abundances with corresponding ace degradation rates in the respective fractions 2 2 chemicals ace potassium 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich schnelldorf germany acetoacetamide n sulfonate ansa was kindly provided by celanese frankfurt am main germany as triethylammonium salt 2 3 cultivation the inoculum was taken from the biological treatment step of the municipal wastewater treatment plant in koblenz germany this wwtp is operated as a conventional activated sludge process with nitrification and denitrification treating 61 000 m3 d with a load of

castronovo et al 2017 the activated sludge sample was incubated in 250 ml amber glass bottles which were continuously aerated and mixed with a magnetic stirrer two different enrichment cultures were incubated in parallel solely differing in the nitrogen sources added to the minimal media which was 200 mg l nh4cl in culture 1 and 300 mg l nano3 in culture 2 the composition of the minimal media is described in detail in the si table s1 these cultures were fed with ace as sole carbon source spiking a weekly dosage of 150 mg l carbon in form of ace for 2 years aliquots were transferred to new

description of lc ms settings can be found in the supporting information see table s2 and table s3 enzyme assays in fractionated and unfractionated cell free lysates were conducted within the autosampler for real time measurement of ace and ansa the autosampler temperature was set to 30 c to facilitate enzymatic catalysis lysates were transferred to 0 3 ml polypropylene ms vials neolab migge gmbh heidelberg germany and spiked with 100 µg l ace subsequently the vials were capped briefly mixed on a vortex mixer put into the autosampler and injected into the lc ms within less than one

20 precursors chosen for fragmentation an agc target of 1e5 and a maximum injection time of 65 ms more details concerning the lc ms ms settings are provided in the si see table s4 and table s5 2 12 data processing of shotgun proteomics measurements the proteome discoverer 2 5 0 400 software from thermo fisher scientific was used to process the ms data collected data from all measurements all samples measured in triplicate were processed in a single run the workflow settings were closely resembling the settings used by melo et al 2021 and osório et al 2021 in the processing step sequest ht

for precursor ions quantification with precursor abundance based on intensity and summed abundances of all connected peptide groups used for protein quantification since absolute protein abundances had to be compared between different fractions of a single cell lysate no normalization was applied more details are provided in the si see table s6 although the taxonomic composition of the cultures had been analyzed the two most abundant taxa of culture 1 could not be determined down to the species level thus no exact selection of corresponding publicly available proteomes as database for the shotgun proteomics analysis was possible therefore the following protein databases were used all downloaded on the 12th of april 2022 all entries for the genus chelatococcus from ncbi protein database 82 521 entries all entries for the genus chelatococcus from uniprot knowledgebase 28 961 entries the reference proteome for the genus pseudomonas from uniprot knowledgebase 299 780 entries the list of common repository of adventitious proteins crap 116 entries the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes blastkoala annotation tool was used to retrieve kegg orthology identifiers k numbers as functional orthologs for the identified proteins kanehisa et al 2016 selected proteins of interest were further analyzed using the blastp 2 13 0 tool altschul et al 1997 and 2005 against the non redundant protein sequences nr database on the ncbi webpage 3 results and discussion 3 1 taxonomic composition of enriched cultures to elucidate the enzymatically catalyzed degradation of ace in wastewater treatment plants activated sludge samples from the biological treatment step of a wwtp were used to enrich ace degrading bacteria in artificial media with ace as sole carbon source parallel incubation of two cultures with different nitrogen sources successfully resulted in two enriched bacterial communities the taxonomic analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that in enrichment culture 1 an unknown species of the genus chelatococcus was the main contributor to ace degradation with a relative abundance of 84 3 an unspecified representative of the genus pseudomonas showed the second highest relative abundance in this enriched culture with 14 5 while all other identified otus combined made up the remaining 1 2 in enrichment culture 2 the bacterial species ensifer adhaerens was identified as the most abundant ace degrader 76 1 followed by the same unknown chelatococcus species as in culture 1 10 6 while no other otu accounted for more than 2 of the total abundance see fig 2 and table s7 degradation of ace has not been described so far in published literature for a species of the genus ensifer until now nine ace degrading strains have been isolated including four specimen of the genus chelatococcus three of the genus shinella and two bosea spp kleinsteuber et al 2019 huang et al 2021 and huang et al 2022 furthermore also the pseudomonas specimen in both cultures of the present study might be a newly discovered taxon of ace degraders which would differ even at the class level from the species that have been isolated so far however it cannot be ruled out that pseudomonas was merely an opportunistic organism feeding on exudates of the much more abundant chelatococcus sp which might also apply to the remaining much less abundant taxa like all ace degrading genera chelatococcus bosea and shinella unequivocally identified in literature so far also the two most abundant specimens of the current study belong to the order hyphomicrobiales class alphaproteobacteria which is a striking accumulation considering that the identified taxa were enriched in independent cultures over a time period of several years from different research teams and isolated from cultures collected in different locations in germany and hong kong moreover in a study of kahl et al 2018 an increase of the families phyllobacteriaceae and nitrobacteraceae described as bradyrhizobiaceae was observed in aerobic enriched cultures fed with ace these families also belong to hyphomicrobiales further supporting the assumption that the ability to degrade ace might be widely spread within this order the enrichment of the taxa chelatococcus sp family chelatococcaceae and ensifer adhaerens family rhizobiaceae in the current study are in line with the findings of huang et al 2022 who observed a diversity of ace degrading bacteria at the family level and a conservation at the order level although not all representatives of the chelatococcus genus are able to degrade ace as was shown for chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 huang et al 2021 remarkably now the fifth strain of this genus has been found with this capability 3 2 ace degradation and ansa formation in enzyme assays aiming at investigating the ace transforming enzymes cells from culture 1 od600 0 36 poc 64 mg l were washed and concentrated by a factor of 12 5 via centrifugation and resuspension after which proteins were extracted by lysis centrifugation and filtration to obtain the so called basic lysate bl protein concentration 230 mg l in this unfractionated basic lysate ace was degraded completely within a few minutes even at an elevated spike concentration of 100 µg l neither ace nor ansa the only intermediate tp identified so far could be detected at the second sampling time after approx 16 5 min fig 3 this bl was subsequently fractionated via two dimensional fplc to reduce sample complexity as described in chapter 2 8 although protein concentrations were below the bca test limit of quantitation 20 mg l in all produced fplc fractions ace removal was still observed in some of the fractions after the first fractionation via sec 16 fractions ace degradation was mainly restricted to fraction sec 7 where the degradation curve could be well described r2 1 000 by first order reaction kinetics c t c 0 e kt with a rate constant k of 2 71 per hour likewise the highest ansa concentrations were detected in this fraction a lower ansa formation was observed in sec 8 where also ace degradation proceeded much slower k 0 064 h r2 0 665 than in sec 7 fig 3 these results suggested that the enzyme responsible for the initial ace cleavage was mainly collected in fraction sec 7 which was therefore further separated using aex chromatography after this second fractionation step 9 fractions ace degradation activity could still be recovered fig 4 and was highest in fraction aex 6 k 0 263 h r2 0 988 followed by aex 5 k 0 107 h r2 0 965 the good fit of ace degradation in sec 7 aex 5 and aex 6 to first order reaction kinetics indicates that substrate saturation of the responsible enzyme played a minor role at most the observed ace degrading activity in fractionated lysates let us further assume that co substrates are probably not needed since those would have to elute in the same fractions as the target enzyme at least for small molecules this seems unlikely during size fractionation therefore the differences regarding the ace degradation rate between the various fractions should directly reflect the quantitative differences of the target enzyme abundance between the respective fractions this is an important finding considering our approach of comparing protein abundances with ace degradation rates in all fractions to search for the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace transformation see chapter 3 3 3 while in fraction sec 7 considerable concentrations of ansa of up to 27 of the initial molar concentration of ace were detected a formation of this tp was barely visible in the bl 2 of the initial ace spike hence sec succeeded in separating the enzyme catalyzing the reaction from ace to ansa from the enzyme catalyzing the further transformation of ansa to a certain degree the low concentrations of ansa in the unfractionated bl suggest that the detection or quantification of this tp in degradation experiments using living cell cultures is presumably even more difficult since in those approaches ansa would have to find its way out of the cells into the culture medium first to be detectable via ms this might explain the fact that although the formation of ansa was also found in some previous ace degradation studies with living cell cultures until now it has not been quantified kleinsteuber et al 2019 or detected in relevant concentrations castronovo et al 2017 or has not been detected at all huang et al 2021 having left open the possibility that the substance was merely a product of a sidechain reaction the relatively high proportion of ansa in sec 7 was the first quantitative confirmation of ansa being the main intermediate in the transformation pathway of ace it can be concluded that the initial ace degradation reaction was not the hydrolytic ring cleavage of the amide bond but a hydrolysis of the sulfamate ester by nucleophilic attack of either the sulfamate sulfur or the cc double bond fig 5 therefore the responsible catalyzing enzymes were assumed to be sulfuric ester hydrolases ec 3 1 6 also known as sulfohydrolases or sulfatases or hydro lyases ec 4 2 1 also known as hydratases more generally these results demonstrate that the use of enzyme activity assays in fractionated cell free lysates can be a valuable tool to elucidate micropollutant transformation pathways which could not be clarified by degradation experiments with living cultures alone 3 3 metaproteomics results 3 3 1 number of protein identifications all samples from the basic lysate the 16 sec fractions and 9 aex fractions of culture 1 were analyzed using shotgun proteomics in total 3892 bacterial protein groups were identified the master proteins of all groups are listed in table s8 of the 3078 proteins detected in the bl approximately 83 were affiliated with the genus chelatococcus and 17 with the genus pseudomonas which is in very good agreement with the results from the taxonomic analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing chelatococcus 84 3 pseudomonas 14 5 within the chelatococcus genus most hits were attributed to the known ace degraders chelatococcus sp hy11 40 and chelatococcus sp yt9 32 identified by huang et al 2021 suggesting a close genetic relationship of those strains to the chelatococcus specimen grown in the enriched cultures of the present study it was estimated that 50 of the proteome of the chelatococcus specimen in culture 1 was detected based on the proteomes for the assumingly closely related taxa chelatococcus sp hy11 and chelatococcus sp yt9 which contain 6123 and 5985 protein entries respectively see ncbi database 3 3 2 protein abundances in the basic lysate bl for label free quantification protein abundances of the three fold injections of each sample were grouped within the proteome discoverer workflow the median intensity of all chelatococcus proteins in the bl amounted to 4 68 106 while the median intensity of all pseudomonas proteins amounted to 7 16 105 see fig s1 so 6 5 times lower this again is in good accordance to the 5 8 times lower taxonomic abundance count and the 5 0 times lower number of identified proteins of pseudomonas the 25 most abundant proteins in the bl were all chelatococcus proteins and accounted for approx 44 of the summed abundance of all 3078 master proteins in the bl table 1 the three most abundant proteins which in sum accounted for remarkable 25 of the total protein abundance in the bl were an metallo β lactamase mbl fold metallo hydrolase wp 213320982 1 chelatococcus sp yt9 11 5 of total protein abundance in bl followed by an abc transporter substrate binding protein wp 213320983 1 chelatococcus sp yt9 9 9 and a multispecies amidase wp 213327473 1 identical protein in chelatococcus sp yt9 sp hy11 and an unclassified chelatococcus species 3 4 those proteins will subsequently be referred to as 1 metallo hydrolase 2 abc transporter and 3 amidase respectively only then proteins follow that are usually detected in very high abundances in bacteria like chaperones chaperonins or elongation factors considering that cleavage of the amide bond of ansa is described in literature castronovo et al 2017 kleinsteuber et al 2019 in particular the highly abundant 3 amidase catches the eye at first sight the enzyme commission number ec 3 5 1 4 assigned to this enzyme via keggs blastkoala tool describes a hydrolytic activity acting on carbon nitrogen bonds in linear amides which fits very well to the proposed cleavage of ansa to form sa and acetoacetate fig 5 strikingly the gene encoding this enzyme was included in a set of 812 genes identified by huang et al 2021 which were shared by two ace degrading chelatococcus strains but were not part of the genomes of two further chelatococcus strains unable to degrade ace and which they therefore regarded as genes potentially involved in the degradation pathway of ace besides this result the metabolic pathway map of functional orthologs k numbers assigned to all identified chelatococcus proteins including proteins only identified in fplc fractions showed a complete representation of the pathway modules carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism lipid metabolism nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism see fig s2 green lines assigned functions for the 25 most abundant proteins see table 1 and red lines in fig s2 particularly clearly depict the way of acetoacetyl coa via acetyl coa into the completely represented glyoxylate cycle the glyoxylate cycle is a bypass of the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and has a central role for bacterial growth on carbon sources like acetate since the two carbons in acetate entering the complete tca cycle would be lost as co2 during the two oxidative decarboxylation reaction steps by circumventing these steps the glyoxylate cycle enables the net conversion of acetyl coa to metabolic intermediates cronan and laporte 2005 these results are consistent with the assumption of kleinsteuber et al 2019 that acetoacetyl coa is formed in the ace degradation pathway and suggest that this intermediate is used as c source for metabolic processes sulfatase or hydratase activities which are expected to be needed for the initial ring cleavage of ace to ansa see chapter 3 2 were not represented by the functional annotation of the 25 most abundant proteins via blastkoala neither were enzymes for the catalysis from acetoacetate to acetoacetyl coa however for three of the 25 most abundant proteins no functional orthologs could be assigned those were the top two 1 metallo hydrolase and 2 abc transporter and a tripartite tricarboxylate transporter substrate binding protein since high expression of unnecessary proteins would have an adverse effect on bacterial growth and therefore be a competitive disadvantage scott et al 2010 kalisky et al 2007 it can be assumed that also the two most abundant proteins 1 metallo hydrolase and 2 abc transporter have indispensable roles for the cells to thrive and thus might be involved in ace degradation based on the same consideration it is reasonable to assume that the proteins responsible for the uptake of ace into the cell as well as the enzymes catalyzing the initial ring cleavage of ace should also likely be among the most abundant proteins since those functions are the prerequisite for all following anabolic and catabolic processes in the culture these assumptions are strengthened by the fact that 3 amidase as presumed catalyst of the ansa degradation and the enzymes responsible for the further carbon metabolism via glyoxylate cycle were all detected among the 25 most abundant proteins therefore the 1 metallo hydrolase is regarded as possible candidate for the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace transformation to ansa while the 2 abc transporter might be involved in the uptake of ace into the cell 3 3 3 proteomics results from fast protein liquid chromatography fplc fractionations to facilitate a more targeted search for the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace degradation reaction the complexity of the basic lysate was reduced via two dimensional fast protein liquid chromatography fplc as described in chapter 2 8 protein abundances were analyzed via a label free quantification workflow and compared to the corresponding observed ace degradation rates in all fractions in order to assess whether the calculated protein abundances were comparable between different fractions the abundance of the protein trypsin which was used for protein digestion in all fractions at the same amount was also analyzed as a kind of reference in fact the differences in trypsin abundance amounted to a factor of 1 45 or less among the different sec fractions and to a factor of 1 41 or less among the different aex fractions supporting a rather good reliability of comparing differences in protein abundances between the different fractions see fig s3 and blue spots in fig 6 upper half the following three selection criteria were applied stepwise as filters to narrow down the list of candidates for proteins catalyzing the initial ace degradation step 1 as a first filter only proteins were selected from which at least three peptides or at least two unique peptides were identified to reduce the probability of false positive identifications 2 as a second filter proteins had to be at least twice as abundant in the most active size exclusion fraction sec 7 compared to the much less active fraction sec 8 and at least five times more abundant in sec 7 than in all other sec fractions looking at the corresponding observed ace degradation rates this is presumably a rather conservative criterion considering that the calculated degradation rate constant in sec 7 was higher by a factor of 40 even in comparison to the second most active fraction sec 8 but since r2 of the fitted curve for sec 8 was rather low 0 665 this rate constant value was not considered very reliable 3 as a third filter criterion proteins had to be more abundant in the most active anion exchange fraction aex 6 than in the second most active fraction aex 5 and in aex 5 more abundant than in all remaining aex fractions since the shotgun proteomics uhplc ms ms measurements were run in three different batches separate runs for bl sec and aex over a time course of three months protein abundances were only compared within the samples of each individual lc ms batch to prevent impairment due to a possibly varying sensitivity of the mass spectrometer after applying the filter criteria described above only 20 master proteins were left as potential candidates for catalyzing the initial ace ring cleavage see table 2 and fig s4 which were subsequently checked for plausible functions via blastkoala annotation interpro searches and uniparc entries see table s9 kleinsteuber et al 2019 discussed amidohydrolases sulfohydrolases or hydratases as potential enzymes for the initial ace transformation step while they favored the degradation pathway via the hydrolysis of the so bond catalyzed by a sulfohydrolase or a michael addition of water to the cc system catalyzed by a hydratase via ansa this assessment has been confirmed in the present study by the observed ansa formation of up to 27 of the initial ace spike as described in chapter 3 2 although in the current study nine identified master proteins contained the string sulfatase and none containing the strings sulfohydrolase or sulphohydrolase in the protein description results the calculated protein abundances of each of them were at least seven times higher in one or more inactive sec fractions than in the most active fraction sec 7 therefore they were unlikely the enzymes catalyzing the initial ace transformation reaction in the overall view of both the shotgun proteomics analysis of the enzyme fractions as well as of the bl see chapter 3 3 2 the enzyme 1 metallo hydrolase was the most outstanding candidate for being the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace ring cleavage by far the protein did not only comply to all filter criteria but was also the protein with the highest calculated abundance of all identified proteins in the unfractionated lysate see table 1 and in the three most active fractions fig 6 lower half it accounted for 11 of the total protein abundance in the bl 44 in sec 7 and 33 in aex 5 in aex 6 ultimately this enzyme accounted for 91 of the total protein abundance being more than 1500fold more abundant than the second most abundant of the detected proteins complying to all filter criteria selt selw selh family protein the 1 metallo hydrolase was furthermore more than 60fold higher abundant in the bl than all other 14 identified mbl fold metallo hydrolases combined from the 283 amino acids in the 1 metallo hydrolase 236 were actually detected in the present study a protein blast blastp of the detected amino acids against the ncbi non redundant protein sequences nr showed an identity of 83 for wp 213320982 1 which was the most significant similarity of all proteins in the database with an e value of 1e 152 the second best match having an e value of 1e 11 with 24 identity the fact that 1 metallo hydrolase in culture 1 showed this high sequence identity with an enzyme of another ace degrading bacterium chelatococcus sp yt9 identified half across the globe while having no nearly as strong sequence similarity to any other protein of any other organism bacteria archaea or eukaryotes stored in the ncbi database suggests that this enzyme is highly specialized and indeed involved in the catalysis of the initial ace transformation reaction the metallo hydrolase like mbl fold superfamily contains a conserved αββα fold domain with a histidine rich motif at the interface of the β β sandwich as active site and consists mainly of hydrolytic enzymes au et al 2021 gonzález 2021 the eponymous β lactamases are amidases catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of the lactam ring of a wide range of β lactam antibiotics and are responsible for a large proportion of bacterial antibiotic resistances however this superfamily also includes enzymes with the functional annotation of sulfuric ester hydrolases daiyasu et al 2001 baier and tokuriki 2014 barbeyron et al 2016 bebrone 2013 a catalytic activity matching the transformation from ace to ansa these so called type iii sulfatases bind two zn2 ions as cofactors hagelueken et al 2006 beatty et al 2013 which could conceivably promote a hydrolytic cleavage of ace via a nucleophilic attack it is known that zinc ions in complexes within enzymes can reduce the pk a of coordinated water molecules by acting as lewis acid leading to a highly increased formation of hydroxide ions oh which are strong nucleophiles bebrone 2007 and 2013 berg et al 2007 at the same time the second enzyme bound zinc cation could activate ace by reducing its electron density for example via protonation of the amide nitrogen enabling a nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide at either the carbon double bond or the sulfamate group while the 1 metallo hydrolase was not listed in the set of 812 genes identified by huang et al 2021 which were shared exclusively by ace degrading chelatococcus strains see chapter 3 3 2 another mbl fold metallo hydrolase included in that list was not detected in the present study which might be an indicator that also other mbl fold metallo hydrolases could catalyze the initial degradation step of ace 3 3 4 further implications of proteomics results from basic lysate and fractions while the experimental approach of the current study focused on enzyme identification it should be considered that the enzymes catalyzing the individual ace degradation steps are not necessarily the decisive factors if an organism is able to degrade ace or even grow on it as substrate it is also conceivable that the limiting factor is the ability to transport ace into the cell this consideration is supported by previous studies where it was observed that ace and other artificial sweeteners could enhance cell membrane and envelope permeability yu et al 2021 yu et al 2022 li et al 2022 with the 2 abc transporter substrate binding protein an abc transporter protein was identified as the second most abundant of all detected proteins which might play a role in ace uptake in this context it is very remarkable that the genes for the two most abundant proteins 1 metallo hydrolase and 2 abc transporter substrate binding protein are located on a small 13 942 base pairs long plasmid of chelatococcus sp yt9 which codes for only eleven proteins five of those protein coding genes have functions related to gene transfer and integration three genes code for domains of an abc transporter which might be responsible for ace uptake into the cell one gene codes for the 1 metallo hydrolase which is our most probable candidate for the enzyme catalyzing the ace ring cleavage another gene codes for an amidase family protein which has 39 sequence identity and according to alphafold calculations a very similar tertiary structure as the 3 amidase identified in enrichment culture 1 fig s5 which was the third most abundant protein in our study and a plausible candidate for ansa degradation according to an analysis of the plasmid using the web service tool operon mapper taboada et al 2018 the genes coding for the amidase metallo hydrolase and the three abc transporter proteins are all part of the same operon so transcription is initiated by a single promoter the last remaining gene on this plasmid finally codes for a sulfite exporter taue safe family protein which is a protein family involved in the transport of anions across the cytoplasmic membrane this is a function which might fit to the export of the stable ace degradation product sa so at least at a first glance this plasmid could be a small specialized unit containing the most relevant functions to process ace and its transformation products which might have facilitated the global spread of the ability to degrade ace via horizontal gene transfer these observations fit well to results recently published by huang et al 2022 who also suspected biodegradation of ace to be a plasmid mediated process based on comparative genomic analysis in their study they highlighted a plasmid shared by three of their identified ace degrading shinella spp coding for 42 proteins likewise including among others an amidase with high amino acid similarity among five ace degraders three domains of an abc transporter and a sulfite exporter taue safe family protein since further recent studies have reported that ace among other artificial sweeteners can enhance antibiotic resistance dissemination by promoting plasmid mediated conjugative transfer and induce an increase in plasmid persistence yu et al 2021 yu et al 2022 li et al 2022 further analysis of the catalytic profile of the 1 metallo hydrolase seems highly recommendable to determine if this enzyme actually is able to catalyze not only the degradation of ace but also of β lactam antibiotics 4 conclusions and outlook using ace as sole carbon source two bacterial taxa were highly enriched in two different cultures strongly suggesting their ability to grow on ace ensifer adhaerens which would be the first time ace degradation was observed for this species and genus and a further specimen of the genus chelatococcus like all isolated ace degrading taxa described in literature so far these bacteria belong to the order hyphomicrobiales indicating that this ability is a relatively widespread within this order and or b is largely limited to this order this was the first time the enzymatically catalyzed degradation of ace was observed outside of living bacteria in cell free lysates lysate complexity could be reduced via two dimensional fplc while preserving the activity of the target enzyme for ring cleavage of ace protein fractionation additionally succeeded in sufficiently separating the enzymes catalyzing the first two steps in ace catabolism as a result ansa could be quantified for the first time in relevant concentrations as primary tp proving a ring cleavage of ace at the sulfuric ester moiety as initial degradation reaction and pointing at enzymes with sulfatase or hydratase activity shotgun proteomics of the fractionated and unfractionated lysates and comparison of protein abundances with ace degradation rates in the respective fractions led to the identification of an mbl fold metallo hydrolase as a strong contender for the enzyme catalyzing the reaction from ace to ansa furthermore a highly abundant amidase was identified as possible catalyst for the further degradation of ansa and an abc transporter substrate binding protein was observed potentially involved in the uptake of ace into the bacterial cell in total an estimated 50 of the proteome of the present chelatococcus specimen were detected and quantified enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were strongly represented particularly those involved in the glyoxylate cycle

15155,the removal of organic micropollutants in municipal wastewater treatment is an extensively studied field of research but the underlying enzymatic processes have only been elucidated to a small extent so far in order to shed more light on the enzymatic degradation of the artificial sweetener acesulfame ace in this context we enriched two bacterial taxa which were not yet described to be involved in the degradation of ace an unknown chelatococcus species and ensifer adhaerens by incubating activated sludge in chemically defined media containing ace as sole carbon source cell free lysates were extracted spiked with ace and analyzed via target lc ms ms demonstrating for the first time enzymatically catalyzed ace degradation outside of living cells fractionation of the lysate via two dimensional fast protein liquid chromatography fplc succeeded in a partial separation of the enzymes catalyzing the initial transformation reaction of ace from those catalyzing the further transformation pathway thereby an accumulation of the intermediate transformation product acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid ansa in the ace degrading fractions was achieved providing first quantitative evidence that the cleavage of the sulfuric ester moiety of ace is the initial transformation step the metaproteome of the enrichments was analyzed in the fplc fractions and in the unfractionated lysate using shotgun proteomics via uhplc hrms ms and label free quantification the comparison of protein abundances in the fplc fractions to the corresponding ace degradation rates revealed a metallo β lactamase fold metallo hydrolase as most probable candidate for the enzyme catalyzing the initial transformation from ace to ansa this enzyme was by far the most abundant of all detected proteins and amounted to a relative protein abundance of 91 in the most active fraction after the second fractionation step moreover the analysis of the unfractionated lysate resulted in a list of further proteins possibly involved in the transformation of ace most striking a highly abundant amidase likely catalyzing the further transformation of ansa and an abc transporter substrate binding protein that may be involved in the uptake of ace into the cell graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acesulfame enzymatic degradation transformation pathway protein fractionation shotgun proteomics label free quantification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction acesulfame ace is a non caloric artificial sweetener approved in more than 100 countries for usage in beverages food personal care products and pharmaceutical preparations nearly a thousand metric tons were used in the united states alone in 2019 belton et al 2020 after ingestion and absorption ace is excreted without being metabolized thus entering the water cycle unchanged via domestic wastewater renwick 1986 von rymon lipinski and hanger 2001 while ace was predominantly reported persistent towards biodegradation for years buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2010 lange et al 2012 spoelstra et al 2013 harwood 2014 it had already been shown that ace can be degraded by technical processes like ozonation scheurer et al 2010 or photolysis by uv light gan et al 2014 sang et al 2014 scheurer et al 2014 however an increasing number of studies indicated that also biologically mediated degradation is possible ace removal has been reported in soil incubation experiments buerge et al 2011 bank filtration sites storck et al 2015 in a lab scale fixed bed reactor storck et al 2016 as well as in bench scale activated sludge sequencing batch reactors sbr falås et al 2016 and in wwtps cardenas et al 2016 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 using literature data and analysis of time dependent evolvements of mass loads of ace in german rivers it was concluded that the capability of biological degradation of ace in wwtps has evolved in different regions of the world during the last decade kahl et al 2018 de lorenzo 2022 this was a striking result as the evolution of the capability for the degradation of a specific micropollutant in wwtps has not been observed so far raising questions about the complete transformation pathway as well as the microbes and enzymes involved in the degradation of ace in a previous study we identified sulfamic acid sa as quantitatively formed sole stable transformation product tp castronovo et al 2017 it was furthermore shown that the formation of acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid ansa occurred via cleavage of the ace sulfuric ester while we assessed the substance as an intermediate of a sidechain reaction and favored an assumed degradation pathway via cleavage of the ace amide bond kahl et al 2018 demonstrated for the first time that bacteria can grow on ace as sole carbon source in enrichment cultures and observed an increased abundance of several families of proteobacteria predominantly of phyllobacteriaceae nitrobacteraceae methylophilaceae and pseudomonaceae while also detecting the quantitative formation of sa kleinsteuber et al 2019 also observed the mineralization to sa and detected ansa formation but could not quantify the substance also leaving the option that it is merely a product of a sidechain reaction they succeeded in isolating several strains of the genera bosea and chelatococcus as first proven ace degrading bacteria while huang et al 2021 and huang et al 2022 isolated two more strains of chelatococcus and three bacterial strains of the genus shinella with that capability as the approval as a food additive already indicates the estimated risk of ace for human health and the environment has been predominantly classified as low so far although it was reported that phototoxicity of its photodegradation products may affect aquatic ecosystems naik et al 2021 moreover recent studies from yu et al 2021 and yu et al 2022 and li et al 2022 indicated that ace and other artificial sweeteners might play a non neglectable role in the dissemination of antibiotics resistances which gives greatly increased urgency to the studies of its degradation and the involved organisms genes and proteins studies analyzing the genomes of isolated bacterial strains and metagenomes of consortia degrading ace huang et al 2021 and huang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 have been conducted recently but despite the extensive research already done and knowledge gained on this topic the crucial genes and enzymes involved in ace degradation are still not unambiguously identified which would be a prerequisite to be able to trace the evolution and spread of this ability to the best of our knowledge there is no available literature to date analyzing the actual protein expression of ace degrading organisms in order to search for the responsible enzymes and neither have enzyme assays been applied for this purpose so far in the present study we therefore expanded the range of analytical methods used to investigate ace degradation until now by combining bottom up shotgun proteomics which is the proteomics approach most commonly used for enzyme discovery sturmberger et al 2016 with protein fractionation and enzyme activity assays the objectives of this study were to identify unknown ace degrading bacteria via enrichment from activated sludge to evaluate if enzymatically catalyzed ace degradation can be achieved outside of living cells in order to facilitate a more targeted search for enzymes involved in degradation through lysate fractionation accompanied by enzyme assays to separate the individual reaction steps of ace degradation by separating the responsible enzymes in order to unequivocally identify the metabolic pathway route and the underlying enzymatic functions to identify proteins involved in the degradation of ace 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental workflow an overview of the applied experimental workflow is shown in fig 1 an activated sludge inoculum was incubated in two slightly different chemically defined media one containing nh4 the other no3 as nitrogen source and both containing ace as sole carbon source for details see chapter 2 3 the taxonomic composition of both enriched cultures was analyzed via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to identify the taxa responsible for ace degradation see chapters 2 5 and 2 6 culture 1 was used for further experiments and measurements aiming on enzyme activity assays and metaproteome analysis a first experimental approach to identify the enzyme catalyzing the degradation of ace was to split culture 1 into parallel batches and search for overexpressed proteins in a target batch fed with ace in comparison to parallel control batches fed with alternative carbon sources however this setup led to considerable taxonomic variations between the different treatments and inconclusive metaproteomics results data not shown activity based protein profiling another common method and one of the most direct ways for enzyme discovery sturmberger et al 2016 was no available option due to the lack of an appropriate chemical probe therefore we instead expanded an approach published by krah et al 2016 who analyzed the degradation of micropollutants in lysates extracted from activated sludge from a wwtp in order to considerably reduce sample complexity and facilitate the search for the enzyme s catalyzing the initial ace transformation we subjected the cell free basic lysate after extraction see chapter 2 7 to a two dimensional fractionation via fast protein liquid chromatography fplc see chapter 2 8 the resulting fractions were analyzed via enzyme activity assays see chapter 2 9 and shotgun proteomics see chapters 2 11 and 2 12 proteins of interest were identified via comparison of protein abundances with corresponding ace degradation rates in the respective fractions 2 2 chemicals ace potassium 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich schnelldorf germany acetoacetamide n sulfonate ansa was kindly provided by celanese frankfurt am main germany as triethylammonium salt 2 3 cultivation the inoculum was taken from the biological treatment step of the municipal wastewater treatment plant in koblenz germany this wwtp is operated as a conventional activated sludge process with nitrification and denitrification treating 61 000 m3 d with a load of 220 000 population equivalents in a previous study an ace removal of roughly 70 was observed in this plant with influent concentrations ranging from approx 10 to 65 µg l and an average of 40 µg l castronovo et al 2017 the activated sludge sample was incubated in 250 ml amber glass bottles which were continuously aerated and mixed with a magnetic stirrer two different enrichment cultures were incubated in parallel solely differing in the nitrogen sources added to the minimal media which was 200 mg l nh4cl in culture 1 and 300 mg l nano3 in culture 2 the composition of the minimal media is described in detail in the si table s1 these cultures were fed with ace as sole carbon source spiking a weekly dosage of 150 mg l carbon in form of ace for 2 years aliquots were transferred to new

description of lc ms settings can be found in the supporting information see table s2 and table s3 enzyme assays in fractionated and unfractionated cell free lysates were conducted within the autosampler for real time measurement of ace and ansa the autosampler temperature was set to 30 c to facilitate enzymatic catalysis lysates were transferred to 0 3 ml polypropylene ms vials neolab migge gmbh heidelberg germany and spiked with 100 µg l ace subsequently the vials were capped briefly mixed on a vortex mixer put into the autosampler and injected into the lc ms within less than one minute after spiking 2 10 measurement of protein concentrations and in solution digestion of proteins protein concentrations of lysates were measured via bicinchoninic acid bca method using the pierce

data processing of shotgun proteomics measurements the proteome discoverer 2 5 0 400 software from thermo fisher scientific was used to process the ms data collected data from all measurements all samples measured in triplicate were processed in a single run the workflow settings were closely resembling the settings used by melo et al 2021 and osório et al 2021 in the processing step sequest ht

for precursor ions quantification with precursor abundance based on intensity and summed abundances of all connected peptide groups used for protein quantification since absolute protein abundances had to be compared between different fractions of a single cell lysate no normalization was applied more details are provided in the si see table s6 although the taxonomic composition of the cultures had been analyzed the two most abundant taxa of culture 1 could not be determined down to the species level thus no exact selection of corresponding publicly available proteomes as database for the shotgun proteomics analysis was possible therefore the following protein databases were used all downloaded on the 12th of april 2022 all entries for the genus chelatococcus from ncbi protein database 82 521 entries all entries for the genus chelatococcus from uniprot knowledgebase 28 961 entries the reference proteome for the genus pseudomonas from uniprot knowledgebase 299 780 entries the list of common repository of adventitious proteins crap 116 entries the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes blastkoala annotation tool was used to retrieve kegg orthology identifiers k numbers as functional orthologs for the identified proteins kanehisa et al 2016 selected proteins of interest were further analyzed using the blastp 2 13 0 tool altschul et al 1997 and 2005 against the non redundant protein sequences nr database on the ncbi webpage 3 results and discussion 3 1 taxonomic composition of enriched cultures to elucidate the enzymatically catalyzed degradation of ace in wastewater treatment plants activated sludge samples from the biological treatment step of a wwtp were used to enrich ace degrading bacteria in artificial media with ace as sole carbon source parallel incubation of two cultures with different nitrogen sources successfully resulted in two enriched bacterial communities the taxonomic analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that in enrichment culture 1 an unknown species of the genus chelatococcus was the main contributor to ace degradation with a relative abundance of 84 3 an unspecified representative of the genus pseudomonas showed the second highest relative abundance in this enriched culture with 14 5 while all other identified otus combined made up the remaining 1 2 in enrichment culture 2 the bacterial species ensifer adhaerens was identified as the most abundant ace degrader 76 1 followed by the same unknown chelatococcus species as in culture 1 10 6 while no other otu accounted for more than 2 of the total abundance see fig 2 and table s7 degradation of ace has not been described so far in published literature for a species of the genus ensifer until now nine ace degrading strains have been isolated including four specimen of the genus chelatococcus three of the genus shinella and two bosea spp kleinsteuber et al 2019 huang et al 2021 and huang et al 2022 furthermore also the pseudomonas specimen in both cultures of the present study might be a newly discovered taxon of ace degraders which would differ even at the class level from the species that have been isolated so far however it cannot be ruled out that pseudomonas was merely an opportunistic organism feeding on exudates of the much more abundant chelatococcus sp which might also apply to the remaining much less abundant taxa like all ace degrading genera chelatococcus bosea and shinella unequivocally identified in literature so far also the two most abundant specimens of the current study belong to the order hyphomicrobiales class alphaproteobacteria which is a striking accumulation considering that the identified taxa were enriched in independent cultures over a time period of several years from different research teams and isolated from cultures collected in different locations in germany and hong kong moreover in a study of kahl et al 2018 an increase of the families phyllobacteriaceae and nitrobacteraceae described as bradyrhizobiaceae was observed in aerobic enriched cultures fed with ace these families also belong to hyphomicrobiales further supporting the assumption that the ability to degrade ace might be widely spread within this order the enrichment of the taxa chelatococcus sp family chelatococcaceae and ensifer adhaerens family rhizobiaceae in the current study are in line with the findings of huang et al 2022 who observed a diversity of ace degrading bacteria at the family level and a conservation at the order level although not all representatives of the chelatococcus genus are able to degrade ace as was shown for chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 huang et al 2021 remarkably now the fifth strain of this genus has been found with this capability 3 2 ace degradation and ansa formation in enzyme assays aiming at investigating the ace transforming enzymes cells from culture 1 od600 0 36 poc 64 mg l were washed and concentrated by a factor of 12 5 via centrifugation and resuspension after which proteins were extracted by lysis centrifugation and filtration to obtain the so called basic lysate bl protein concentration 230 mg l in this unfractionated basic lysate ace was degraded completely within a few minutes even at an elevated spike concentration of 100 µg l neither ace nor ansa the only intermediate tp identified so far could be detected at the second sampling time after approx 16 5 min fig 3 this bl was subsequently fractionated via two dimensional fplc to reduce sample complexity as described in chapter 2 8 although protein concentrations were below the bca test limit of quantitation 20 mg l in all produced fplc fractions ace removal was still observed in some of the fractions after the first fractionation via sec 16 fractions ace degradation was mainly restricted to fraction sec 7 where the degradation curve could be well described r2 1 000 by first order reaction kinetics c t c 0 e kt with a rate constant k of 2 71 per hour likewise the highest ansa concentrations were detected in this fraction a lower ansa formation was observed in sec 8 where also ace degradation proceeded much slower k 0 064 h r2 0 665 than in sec 7 fig 3 these results suggested that the enzyme responsible for the initial ace cleavage was mainly collected in fraction sec 7 which was therefore further separated using aex chromatography after this second fractionation step 9 fractions ace degradation activity could still be recovered fig 4 and was highest in fraction aex 6 k 0 263 h r2 0 988 followed by aex 5 k 0 107 h r2 0 965 the good fit of ace degradation in sec 7 aex 5 and aex 6 to first order reaction kinetics indicates that substrate saturation of the responsible enzyme played a minor role at most the observed ace degrading activity in fractionated lysates let us further assume that co substrates are probably not needed since those would have to elute in the same fractions as the target enzyme at least for small molecules this seems unlikely during size fractionation therefore the differences regarding the ace degradation rate between the various fractions should directly reflect the quantitative differences of the target enzyme abundance between the respective fractions this is an important finding considering our approach of comparing protein abundances with ace degradation rates in all fractions to search for the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace transformation see chapter 3 3 3 while in fraction sec 7 considerable concentrations of ansa of up to 27 of the initial molar concentration of ace were detected a formation of this tp was barely visible in the bl 2 of the initial ace spike hence sec succeeded in separating the enzyme catalyzing the reaction from ace to ansa from the enzyme catalyzing the further transformation of ansa to a certain degree the low concentrations of ansa in the unfractionated bl suggest that the detection or quantification of this tp in degradation experiments using living cell cultures is presumably even more difficult since in those approaches ansa would have to find its way out of the cells into the culture medium first to be detectable via ms this might explain the fact that although the formation of ansa was also found in some previous ace degradation studies with living cell cultures until now it has not been quantified kleinsteuber et al 2019 or detected in relevant concentrations castronovo et al 2017 or has not been detected at all huang et al 2021 having left open the possibility that the substance was merely a product of a sidechain reaction the relatively high proportion of ansa in sec 7 was the first quantitative confirmation of ansa being the main intermediate in the transformation pathway of ace it can be concluded that the initial ace degradation reaction was not the hydrolytic ring cleavage of the amide bond but a hydrolysis of the sulfamate ester by nucleophilic attack of either the sulfamate sulfur or the cc double bond fig 5 therefore the responsible catalyzing enzymes were assumed to be sulfuric ester hydrolases ec 3 1 6 also known as sulfohydrolases or sulfatases or hydro lyases ec 4 2 1 also known as hydratases more generally these results demonstrate that the use of enzyme activity assays in fractionated cell free lysates can be a valuable tool to elucidate micropollutant transformation pathways which could not be clarified by degradation experiments with living cultures alone 3 3 metaproteomics results 3 3 1 number of protein identifications all samples from the basic lysate the 16 sec fractions and 9 aex fractions of culture 1 were analyzed using shotgun proteomics in total 3892 bacterial protein groups were identified the master proteins of all groups are listed in table s8 of the 3078 proteins detected in the bl approximately 83 were affiliated with the genus chelatococcus and 17 with the genus pseudomonas which is in very good agreement with the results from the taxonomic analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing chelatococcus 84 3 pseudomonas 14 5 within the chelatococcus genus most hits were attributed to the known ace degraders chelatococcus sp hy11 40 and chelatococcus sp yt9 32 identified by huang et al 2021 suggesting a close genetic relationship of those strains to the chelatococcus specimen grown in the enriched cultures of the present study it was estimated that 50 of the proteome of the chelatococcus specimen in culture 1 was detected based on the proteomes for the assumingly closely related taxa chelatococcus sp hy11 and chelatococcus sp yt9 which contain 6123 and 5985 protein entries respectively see ncbi database 3 3 2 protein abundances in the basic lysate bl for label free quantification protein abundances of the three fold injections of each sample were grouped within the proteome discoverer workflow the median intensity of all chelatococcus proteins in the bl amounted to 4 68 106 while the median intensity of all pseudomonas proteins amounted to 7 16 105 see fig s1 so 6 5 times lower this again is in good accordance to the 5 8 times lower taxonomic abundance count and the 5 0 times lower number of identified proteins of pseudomonas the 25 most abundant proteins in the bl were all chelatococcus proteins and accounted for approx 44 of the summed abundance of all 3078 master proteins in the bl table 1 the three most abundant proteins which in sum accounted for remarkable 25 of the total protein abundance in the bl were an metallo β lactamase mbl fold metallo hydrolase wp 213320982 1 chelatococcus sp yt9 11 5 of total protein abundance in bl followed by an abc transporter substrate binding protein wp 213320983 1 chelatococcus sp yt9 9 9 and a multispecies amidase wp 213327473 1 identical protein in chelatococcus sp yt9 sp hy11 and an unclassified chelatococcus species 3 4 those proteins will subsequently be referred to as 1 metallo hydrolase 2 abc transporter and 3 amidase respectively only then proteins follow that are usually detected in very high abundances in bacteria like chaperones chaperonins or elongation factors considering that cleavage of the amide bond of ansa is described in literature castronovo et al 2017 kleinsteuber et al 2019 in particular the highly abundant 3 amidase catches the eye at first sight the enzyme commission number ec 3 5 1 4 assigned to this enzyme via keggs blastkoala tool describes a hydrolytic activity acting on carbon nitrogen bonds in linear amides which fits very well to the proposed cleavage of ansa to form sa and acetoacetate fig 5 strikingly the gene encoding this enzyme was included in a set of 812 genes identified by huang et al 2021 which were shared by two ace degrading chelatococcus strains but were not part of the genomes of two further chelatococcus strains unable to degrade ace and which they therefore regarded as genes potentially involved in the degradation pathway of ace besides this result the metabolic pathway map of functional orthologs k numbers assigned to all identified chelatococcus proteins including proteins only identified in fplc fractions showed a complete representation of the pathway modules carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism lipid metabolism nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism see fig s2 green lines assigned functions for the 25 most abundant proteins see table 1 and red lines in fig s2 particularly clearly depict the way of acetoacetyl coa via acetyl coa into the completely represented glyoxylate cycle the glyoxylate cycle is a bypass of the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and has a central role for bacterial growth on carbon sources like acetate since the two carbons in acetate entering the complete tca cycle would be lost as co2 during the two oxidative decarboxylation reaction steps by circumventing these steps the glyoxylate cycle enables the net conversion of acetyl coa to metabolic intermediates cronan and laporte 2005 these results are consistent with the assumption of kleinsteuber et al 2019 that acetoacetyl coa is formed in the ace degradation pathway and suggest that this intermediate is used as c source for metabolic processes sulfatase or hydratase activities which are expected to be needed for the initial ring cleavage of ace to ansa see chapter 3 2 were not represented by the functional annotation of the 25 most abundant proteins via blastkoala neither were enzymes for the catalysis from acetoacetate to acetoacetyl coa however for three of the 25 most abundant proteins no functional orthologs could be assigned those were the top two 1 metallo hydrolase and 2 abc transporter and a tripartite tricarboxylate transporter substrate binding protein since high expression of unnecessary proteins would have an adverse effect on bacterial growth and therefore be a competitive disadvantage scott et al 2010 kalisky et al 2007 it can be assumed that also the two most abundant proteins 1 metallo hydrolase and 2 abc transporter have indispensable roles for the cells to thrive and thus might be involved in ace degradation based on the same consideration it is reasonable to assume that the proteins responsible for the uptake of ace into the cell as well as the enzymes catalyzing the initial ring cleavage of ace should also likely be among the most abundant proteins since those functions are the prerequisite for all following anabolic and catabolic processes in the culture these assumptions are strengthened by the fact that 3 amidase as presumed catalyst of the ansa degradation and the enzymes responsible for the further carbon metabolism via glyoxylate cycle were all detected among the 25 most abundant proteins therefore the 1 metallo hydrolase is regarded as possible candidate for the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace transformation to ansa while the 2 abc transporter might be involved in the uptake of ace into the cell 3 3 3 proteomics results from fast protein liquid chromatography fplc fractionations to facilitate a more targeted search for the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace degradation reaction the complexity of the basic lysate was reduced via two dimensional fast protein liquid chromatography fplc as described in chapter 2 8 protein abundances were analyzed via a label free quantification workflow and compared to the corresponding observed ace degradation rates in all fractions in order to assess whether the calculated protein abundances were comparable between different fractions the abundance of the protein trypsin which was used for protein digestion in all fractions at the same amount was also analyzed as a kind of reference in fact the differences in trypsin abundance amounted to a factor of 1 45 or less among the different sec fractions and to a factor of 1 41 or less among the different aex fractions supporting a rather good reliability of comparing differences in protein abundances between the different fractions see fig s3 and blue spots in fig 6 upper half the following three selection criteria were applied stepwise as filters to narrow down the list of candidates for proteins catalyzing the initial ace degradation step 1 as a first filter only proteins were selected from which at least three peptides or at least two unique peptides were identified to reduce the probability of false positive identifications 2 as a second filter proteins had to be at least twice as abundant in the most active size exclusion fraction sec 7 compared to the much less active fraction sec 8 and at least five times more abundant in sec 7 than in all other sec fractions looking at the corresponding observed ace degradation rates this is presumably a rather conservative criterion considering that the calculated degradation rate constant in sec 7 was higher by a factor of 40 even in comparison to the second most active fraction sec 8 but since r2 of the fitted curve for sec 8 was rather low 0 665 this rate constant value was not considered very reliable 3 as a third filter criterion proteins had to be more abundant in the most active anion exchange fraction aex 6 than in the second most active fraction aex 5 and in aex 5 more abundant than in all remaining aex fractions since the shotgun proteomics uhplc ms ms measurements were run in three different batches separate runs for bl sec and aex over a time course of three months protein abundances were only compared within the samples of each individual lc ms batch to prevent impairment due to a possibly varying sensitivity of the mass spectrometer after applying the filter criteria described above only 20 master proteins were left as potential candidates for catalyzing the initial ace ring cleavage see table 2 and fig s4 which were subsequently checked for plausible functions via blastkoala annotation interpro searches and uniparc entries see table s9 kleinsteuber et al 2019 discussed amidohydrolases sulfohydrolases or hydratases as potential enzymes for the initial ace transformation step while they favored the degradation pathway via the hydrolysis of the so bond catalyzed by a sulfohydrolase or a michael addition of water to the cc system catalyzed by a hydratase via ansa this assessment has been confirmed in the present study by the observed ansa formation of up to 27 of the initial ace spike as described in chapter 3 2 although in the current study nine identified master proteins contained the string sulfatase and none containing the strings sulfohydrolase or sulphohydrolase in the protein description results the calculated protein abundances of each of them were at least seven times higher in one or more inactive sec fractions than in the most active fraction sec 7 therefore they were unlikely the enzymes catalyzing the initial ace transformation reaction in the overall view of both the shotgun proteomics analysis of the enzyme fractions as well as of the bl see chapter 3 3 2 the enzyme 1 metallo hydrolase was the most outstanding candidate for being the enzyme catalyzing the initial ace ring cleavage by far the protein did not only comply to all filter criteria but was also the protein with the highest calculated abundance of all identified proteins in the unfractionated lysate see table 1 and in the three most active fractions fig 6 lower half it accounted for 11 of the total protein abundance in the bl 44 in sec 7 and 33 in aex 5 in aex 6 ultimately this enzyme accounted for 91 of the total protein abundance being more than 1500fold more abundant than the second most abundant of the detected proteins complying to all filter criteria selt selw selh family protein the 1 metallo hydrolase was furthermore more than 60fold higher abundant in the bl than all other 14 identified mbl fold metallo hydrolases combined from the 283 amino acids in the 1 metallo hydrolase 236 were actually detected in the present study a protein blast blastp of the detected amino acids against the ncbi non redundant protein sequences nr showed an identity of 83 for wp 213320982 1 which was the most significant similarity of all proteins in the database with an e value of 1e 152 the second best match having an e value of 1e 11 with 24 identity the fact that 1 metallo hydrolase in culture 1 showed this high sequence identity with an enzyme of another ace degrading bacterium chelatococcus sp yt9 identified half across the globe while having no nearly as strong sequence similarity to any other protein of any other organism bacteria archaea or eukaryotes stored in the ncbi database suggests that this enzyme is highly specialized and indeed involved in the catalysis of the initial ace transformation reaction the metallo hydrolase like mbl fold superfamily contains a conserved αββα fold domain with a histidine rich motif at the interface of the β β sandwich as active site and consists mainly of hydrolytic enzymes au et al 2021 gonzález 2021 the eponymous β lactamases are amidases catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of the lactam ring of a wide range of β lactam antibiotics and are responsible for a large proportion of bacterial antibiotic resistances however this superfamily also includes enzymes with the functional annotation of sulfuric ester hydrolases daiyasu et al 2001 baier and tokuriki 2014 barbeyron et al 2016 bebrone 2013 a catalytic activity matching the transformation from ace to ansa these so called type iii sulfatases bind two zn2 ions as cofactors hagelueken et al 2006 beatty et al 2013 which could conceivably promote a hydrolytic cleavage of ace via a nucleophilic attack it is known that zinc ions in complexes within enzymes can reduce the pk a of coordinated water molecules by acting as lewis acid leading to a highly increased formation of hydroxide ions oh which are strong nucleophiles bebrone 2007 and 2013 berg et al 2007 at the same time the second enzyme bound zinc cation could activate ace by reducing its electron density for example via protonation of the amide nitrogen enabling a nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide at either the carbon double bond or the sulfamate group while the 1 metallo hydrolase was not listed in the set of 812 genes identified by huang et al 2021 which were shared exclusively by ace degrading chelatococcus strains see chapter 3 3 2 another mbl fold metallo hydrolase included in that list was not detected in the present study which might be an indicator that also other mbl fold metallo hydrolases could catalyze the initial degradation step of ace 3 3 4 further implications of proteomics results from basic lysate and fractions while the experimental approach of the current study focused on enzyme identification it should be considered that the enzymes catalyzing the individual ace degradation steps are not necessarily the decisive factors if an organism is able to degrade ace or even grow on it as substrate it is also conceivable that the limiting factor is the ability to transport ace into the cell this consideration is supported by previous studies where it was observed that ace and other artificial sweeteners could enhance cell membrane and envelope permeability yu et al 2021 yu et al 2022 li et al 2022 with the 2 abc transporter substrate binding protein an abc transporter protein was identified as the second most abundant of all detected proteins which might play a role in ace uptake in this context it is very remarkable that the genes for the two most abundant proteins 1 metallo hydrolase and 2 abc transporter substrate binding protein are located on a small 13 942 base pairs long plasmid of chelatococcus sp yt9 which codes for only eleven proteins five of those protein coding genes have functions related to gene transfer and integration three genes code for domains of an abc transporter which might be responsible for ace uptake into the cell one gene codes for the 1 metallo hydrolase which is our most probable candidate for the enzyme catalyzing the ace ring cleavage another gene codes for an amidase family protein which has 39 sequence identity and according to alphafold calculations a very similar tertiary structure as the 3 amidase identified in enrichment culture 1 fig s5 which was the third most abundant protein in our study and a plausible candidate for ansa degradation according to an analysis of the plasmid using the web service tool operon mapper taboada et al 2018 the genes coding for the amidase metallo hydrolase and the three abc transporter proteins are all part of the same operon so transcription is initiated by a single promoter the last remaining gene on this plasmid finally codes for a sulfite exporter taue safe family protein which is a protein family involved in the transport of anions across the cytoplasmic membrane this is a function which might fit to the export of the stable ace degradation product sa so at least at a first glance this plasmid could be a small specialized unit containing the most relevant functions to process ace and its transformation products which might have facilitated the global spread of the ability to degrade ace via horizontal gene transfer these observations fit well to results recently published by huang et al 2022 who also suspected biodegradation of ace to be a plasmid mediated process based on comparative genomic analysis in their study they highlighted a plasmid shared by three of their identified ace degrading shinella spp coding for 42 proteins likewise including among others an amidase with high amino acid similarity among five ace degraders three domains of an abc transporter and a sulfite exporter taue safe family protein since further recent studies have reported that ace among other artificial sweeteners can enhance antibiotic resistance dissemination by promoting plasmid mediated conjugative transfer and induce an increase in plasmid persistence yu et al 2021 yu et al 2022 li et al 2022 further analysis of the catalytic profile of the 1 metallo hydrolase seems highly recommendable to determine if this enzyme actually is able to catalyze not only the degradation of ace but also of β lactam antibiotics 4 conclusions and outlook using ace as sole carbon source two bacterial taxa were highly enriched in two different cultures strongly suggesting their ability to grow on ace ensifer adhaerens which would be the first time ace degradation was observed for this species and genus and a further specimen of the genus chelatococcus like all isolated ace degrading taxa described in literature so far these bacteria belong to the order hyphomicrobiales indicating that this ability is a relatively widespread within this order and or b is largely limited to this order this was the first time the enzymatically catalyzed degradation of ace was observed outside of living bacteria in cell free lysates lysate complexity could be reduced via two dimensional fplc while preserving the activity of the target enzyme for ring cleavage of ace protein fractionation additionally succeeded in sufficiently separating the enzymes catalyzing the first two steps in ace catabolism as a result ansa could be quantified for the first time in relevant concentrations as primary tp proving a ring cleavage of ace at the sulfuric ester moiety as initial degradation reaction and pointing at enzymes with sulfatase or hydratase activity shotgun proteomics of the fractionated and unfractionated lysates and comparison of protein abundances with ace degradation rates in the respective fractions led to the identification of an mbl fold metallo hydrolase as a strong contender for the enzyme catalyzing the reaction from ace to ansa furthermore a highly abundant amidase was identified as possible catalyst for the further degradation of ansa and an abc transporter substrate binding protein was observed potentially involved in the uptake of ace into the bacterial cell in total an estimated 50 of the proteome of the present chelatococcus specimen were detected and quantified enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were strongly represented particularly those involved in the glyoxylate cycle

15156,hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is the most commonly used oxidant in advanced oxidation processes for emerging organic contaminant degradation however the activation of h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen

pollutants in the environment via activating oxidants to generate reactive oxygen species ros with high reactivity jin et al 2017 li et al 2020 ling et al 2022 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 2022 among the various oxidants hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is the most commonly used oxidant in aops currently h2o2 is mainly produced through the energy demanding and waste intensive anthraquinone process which is only feasible for large scale operations and production of commercially concentrated h2o2 30 70 wt xia et al 2020 in wastewater treatment applications developing small scale decentralized h2o2 generation systems is of increasing interest which avoids the needs of transportation storage separation purification and continual dosing of h2o2 wu and quan 2022 especially diluted h2o2 1 wt is commonly used to induce the generation of ros for wastewater treatment wu and quan 2022 however only a small fraction of h2o2 is converted into ros in most fenton or fenton like processes causing a large demand of h2o2 for optimum reaction performance zhang et al 2022 comprehensively techniques associated with the on site production of diluted h2o2 and improvement of h2o2 utilization efficiency are in need to reduce the invalid consumption of chemical energy so far many strategies have been reported to trigger o2 activation e g photocatalytic o2 activation and electrocatalytic o2 activation by inorganic organic semiconductors e g in2s3 in2o3 tio2 x and c3n4 to produce diluted h2o2 since oxygen is abundant and readily available on earth chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 kuttassery et al 2017 liu et al 2020 2021 pi et al 2020 wu and quan 2022 xia et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 unlike those energy demanding methods rationally regulating low valent metal sites and surface vacancies in catalysts to enhance o2 activation ability without energy input has attracted increasing interest for diluted h2o2 production for instance yang et al prepared zn0 cnts fe3o4 for o2 activation to in situ generate h2o2 and realized a removal of 99 4 chlorophenol yang et al 2018 however zn0 was consumed during the reaction which required further research to enhance the durability of catalysts gong et al 2018 recently wang and co workers reported an oxygen vacancy mediated cucofe tar ldh catalyst that directly activates o2 to produce h2o2 achieving efficient degradation of nitrobenzene s wang et al 2022a metal dopants such as ce zn cu and ni doped into catalytic materials modulate electronic structure and create oxygen vacancies by inducing charge redistribution lakshminarayanan et al 2011 sun et al 2019 the presence of oxygen vacancies ovs on the catalysts surface enhances the adsorption activation capability of o2 and accelerates the charge transfer in the catalytic system yang et al 2019a it is foreseeable that designing catalysts with abundant ovs and proper electronic structures has become an effective approach to energy efficient activation of o2 and on site generation of h2o2 most previous studies related to heterogeneous fenton or fenton like catalysis focused on improving the catalytic activity of the catalysts but ignored the burst consumption and low utilization efficiency of h2o2 which caused a waste of h2o2 on the one hand the main active species in traditional fenton process is hydroxyl radical oh generated via the haber weiss reaction koppenol 2001 but the utilization efficiency of h2o2 is very low due to the sluggish kinetics of fe ii generation zhang et al 2022 previous efforts have designed feocl fe iii ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid and carbon quantum dots mediated fe ii iii redox to improve the fe ii generation kinetics huang et al 2013 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 on the other hand the massive transform of superoxide o2 to o2 during the haber weiss cycle induced large consumption of h2o2 which is another primary cause of low h2o2 utilization efficiency in the fe based fenton like processes however few studies have paid attention to address this issue we hypothesize that if those locally generated o2 gas can be activated to generate h2o2 the h2o2 utilization efficiency could be greatly improved thus it is of scientific importance to elucidate the nature of o2 activation involved in enhancing h2o2 utilization efficiency in this work we synthesized a defective ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst for o2 activation and h2o2 catalysis by systematically comparing the electronic structure and catalytic behaviors of ternary binary and unary fe based catalysts we identified oxygen vacancies ovs with delocalized properties as the decisive factor for the catalytic superiority of ti doped fe mn spinel oxides in h2o2 utilization and singlet oxygen generation intriguingly ti mn3o4 fe3o4 acted as a shuttle that mediated the cycles among h2o2 superoxide o2 and singlet oxygen enabled unprecedent utilization of h2o2 through synergetic catalysis owning to ovs high valent active sites coupling moreover the stability and environmental robustness of the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalysts for decontamination were also investigated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials mn no3 2 feso4 ti so4

ultrapure water under light or dark then o2 or n2 gas with a flow rate of 100 ml min was bubbled into the above solution to drive the reaction the detection method of the as generated h2o2 was shown in text s1 the ion leaching was quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icap rq icpms all measurements were repeated in triplicate and reported as the average values 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure of fe based ternary catalysts doped with titanium as shown in sem images fig 1 a fe3o4 presented a structure of spherical shape with an average size about 50 100 nm after introducing mn or mn ti the binary and ternary catalysts were formed as homogeneous circular nanostructures with smaller average size under higher magnification via tem ti mn3o4 fe3o4 exhibited a diameter of 10 20 nm fig 1b elemental mappings of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 in fig 1c showed the distribution of fe mn and ti were not entirely uniform the mosaic of mn and ti observed in the selected region implied sufficient contact between mn and ti the mosaic of fe and mn stated fe and mn were not uniformly dispersed in the nanoparticle demonstrating the mutual invasion of fe3o4 and mn3o4 similarly ti was sparsely distributed in most regions near fe collectively the ternary structure mainly exposed a mutual loading between fe3o4 and mn3o4 with ti selectively doping in mn3o4 hr tem images fig 1d of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 showed the lattice distances at 0 29 0 25 and 0 48 nm were well indexed to the fe3o4 220 mn3o4 fe3o4 311 and mn3o4 fe3o4 111 planes boruah and das 2020 wan and wang 2017b respectively however no crystalline lattice was ascribed to tiox moreover the xrd diffractogram fig 1e showed ti mn3o4 fe3o4 well preserved the cubic spinel phases of fe3o4 pdf 65 3107 and mn3o4 pdf 13 0162 28 with no diffraction peaks indexed to titanium titanium monoxide or titanium dioxide the eds mapping together with hr tem images indicated that ti element was well doped in mn3o4 crystalline both fe3o4 and mn3o4 fe3o4 catalysts exhibited distinct peaks at 2θ 30 1 35 5 43 1 53 5 57 0 and 62 5 corresponding to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 plane of fe3o4 or and mn3o4 wan and wang 2017b 3 2 design considerations of rich structure vacancies creation of structure vacancies has been demonstrated to be a versatile and effective defect engineering strategy for regulating the electronic structure and activity of the surrounding active sites for target reactions song et al 2022 in this work o2 activation was triggered to improve the h2o2 generation and utilization efficiency through modulating defects abundance in fe based catalysts the properties of defect structures in the prepared fe based catalysts were examined by raman and o 1 s xps spectroscopy as shown in the raman spectra of synthesized catalysts fig 1f the peaks observed at 330 525 and 675 cm 1 corresponding to fe o bond of fe3o4 while 655 cm 1 can be ascribed to mn3o4 wan and wang 2017a the fe o bond of binary and ternary catalysts are not as strong as pure fe3o4 or even disappeared which may be due to the forming of a compound bond by mn o bond 655 cm 1 and fe o bond 675 cm 1 in general the band intensity in the peak of 151 cm 1 related to the relative content of ti o vacancies rempel et al 2020 obviously a strong peak at 151 cm 1 was observed in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 demonstrating that an abundant amount of ti o structure vacancies were formed due to the doping of ti fig 1g i show the o 1 s xps information of fe3o4 mn3o4 fe3o4 and ti mn3o4 fe3o4 respectively the o 1 s signal divided as two bands one sub band with higher binding energy peaks corresponded to surface adsorbed oxygen oii such as o or o2 2 and another sub band with lower binding energy peaks ascribed to lattice oxygen o2 oi du et al 2019 gao et al 2013 li et al 2019 zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 with the introduction of mn and then mn ti together the surface adsorbed oxygen shifted from 533 3 ev to 532 5 ev and then to 531 3 ev while the lattice oxygen shifted from 530 8 ev to 530 0 ev and then to 529 6 ev demonstrating the changing of local chemical environment of oxygen species generally a higher oii oi ratio signifies a higher ovs concentration jia et al 2016 zhan et al 2020 in addition ti doping induced an obvious difference in the relative peak intensities of oi and oii in catalysts from xps fitting analysis the oii oi values of fe3o4 mn3o4 fe3o4 and ti mn3o4 fe3o4 were 0 68 0 87 and 1 71 respectively and it could be found that the oii oi values increased as the ti doping content increased fig s1a c with the ti doping content increasing from 0 1 to 0 5 the cubic spinel phases of fe3o4 pdf 65 3107 and mn3o4 pdf 13 0162 became more obvious in the xrd spectrums fig s1d furthermore the fe 2p mn 2p and ti 2p xps profiles fig s2 collectively demonstrated abundant low valent ti mn and fe sites were contained in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalyst low valent metal sites lead to the jahn teller distortion and then promote the formation of oxygen vacancy to maintain charge balance he et al 2020 the fe o bond binding energy represented by fe 2p3 2 shifted from 711 8 ev to 711 1 ev and then to a lower binding energy of 710 6 ev over unitary binary and ternary catalysts fig s2a c indicating the fe o bond in the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 was weakened by the interaction among fe mn and ti xiong et al 2021 compared with mn3o4 fe3o4 the mn o bond binding energy ascribed to mn 2p3 2 shifted from 642 1 ev to a lower binding energy 641 6 ev fig s2d e demonstrating the mn o bond was weakened by the ti dopant in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 xiong et al 2021 consequently ti doping endowed ti mn3o4 fe3o4 with plentiful active sites weak fe o bond and mn o bond and abundant ovs 3 3 h2o2 generation via activation of o2 by ternary catalyst inspired by the previous studies that structure vacancies played key roles in activating o2 for h2o2 production chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 wu and quan 2022 we investigated the performance of ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst in activation of o2 for h2o2 generation as shown in fig 2 a the average concentration of h2o2 reached 16 2 μmol l in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o and enhanced to 35 5 μmol l with extra o2 pumping into ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o in addition when bubbling with n2 to remove the dissolved oxygen in the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o almost no h2o2 was generated as expected there was no h2o2 produced in mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o o2 or fe3o4 h2o o2 systems the results demonstrated that the dissolved oxygen in water could be activated by ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 to produce h2o2 and purging o2 into the activation system boosted the production of h2o2 the performance of ternary catalyst in h2o2 production varied with the ph of solutions with o2 purging in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o the average concentration of h2o2 was measured to be 0 9 μmol l 5 5 μmol l 13 6 μmol l 35 5 μmol l and 53 4 μmol l under ph 11 0 9 0 7 0 5 5 and 4 0 respectively fig 2b this suggested aerobic and acid environment favored the production of h2o2 since ti mn3o4 fe3o4 possessed abundant structure vacancies that has proven to be critical to the activation of o2 chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 wu and quan 2022 we proposed an oxygen vacancy dominated pathway for h2o2 production via ti mn3o4 fe3o4 as shown in eq 1 oxygen vacancies served as electron donors and initiated o2 activation to produce h2o2 it was worth noting that the generation of h2o2 was the same under light and dark fig s3 indicating the on site generation of h2o2 was not caused by the photo driven catalysis compared with photocatalytic and electrochemical activation of o2 for h2o2 production that grabbing electrons from electron hole pairs or electricity wu and quan 2022 xia et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 the ovs induced activation system with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 does not require external energy input 1 2ov e o2 2h h2o2 the h2o2 production increased with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 dosage and reached plateau when dosage was higher than 1 0 g l see fig 2c with the catalyst dosage of 1 0 g l h2o2 concentration reached a high value of 54 1 μmol l with reaction time of 30 min in addition the h2o2 production increased with the appropriate ti doping content x molar ratio of ti mn fe x 1 1 as shown in fig s4 with the increase of ti content from 0 1 to 0 5 the h2o2 concentration showed an increasing trend and ti mn3o4 fe3o4 x 0 5 exhibited the maximal h2o2 production activity the increased ti content in ternary catalyst induced the formation of more oxygen vacancies fig s1 thus improved the generation of h2o2 the produced h2o2 aqueous solution could be an environmental benign and efficient oxidant for elimination of refractory organic pollutants given the reported catalytic performance of mnox and feox catalysts hu et al 2011 jin et al 2017 wan and wang 2017b wang et al 2018 ti mn3o4 fe3o4 as expected catalyzed the as produced h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species see fig s5 the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 o2 system was further evaluated for degrading organic contaminants as presented in fig 2d 38 of tiamulin tia was removed within 120 min in the fenton like systems using ti mn3o4 fe3o4 while the tia removal increased to 80 when pure oxygen was pumped into the system in contrast the tia removal decreased to 19 when the system was purged with n2 which could be attributed to the sole adsorption effect by ternary catalysts the contributions from degradation in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 o2 were further analyzed via identifying the degradation intermediates by lc ms ms as illustrated in fig s6 four main products e g c8h18nso2 m z 192 10 in positive mode c20h33o2 m z 305 05 c28h48o5ns m z 510 25 and c26h46o8ns m z 532 25 were detected the corresponding structure formulas of these intermediates were listed in table s1 since no h2o2 was produced in the systems with mn3o4 fe3o4 or fe3o4 catalysts negligible degradation of tia in those two systems was not unexpected the results emphasized that the ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst possessed the synergistic ability of activating o2 to produce h2o2 meanwhile catalyzing h2o2 to degrade organic contaminants 3 4 catalytic performance of ternary catalyst for pollutant degradation with high utilization efficiency of h2o2 as aforementioned high demand of h2o2 was required for efficient degradation of organic contaminants in fenton and fenton like processes due to the low utilization of h2o2 in this section the catalytic performance of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 and the utilization efficiency of h2o2 were evaluated by carrying out the fenton like experiments as shown in fig 3 a the degradation of tia in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 suspension reached 100 in only 30 min while 20 of tia was removed when using other catalysts such as mn3o4 fe3o4 or fe3o4 intriguingly only 45 8 of h2o2 was consumed in the fenton like system with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 while those with mn3o4 fe3o4 and fe3o4 consumed 99 6 and 74 8 of h2o2 fig s7 respectively the h2o2 utilization efficiency η of unitary binary and ternary catalysts was calculated for comparison the η is defined as the ratio of stoichiometric h2o2 consumption δ h2o2 s for tia mineralization to actual h2o2 consumption δ h2o2 a text s1 table s2 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 as depicted in fig 3b ti mn3o4 fe3o4 had the highest η which was about 19 folds of mn3o4 fe3o4 and 24 folds of fe3o4 the η values of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 for bisphenol bpa and ofloxacin ofx degradation were also one order of magnitude larger than those of mn3o4 fe3o4 and fe3o4 given the observed performance of ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 in activating o2 to produce h2o2 it was speculated that the generated o2 in the fenton like system was activated to in situ generate h2o2 and replenished the consumed h2o2 consequently realizing a high utilization efficiency of h2o2 in order to verify this speculation n2 was continuously purged into the fenton like system to expel the generated o2 during the haber weiss reaction as shown in fig 3c with continuous purging of n2 in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 tia system h2o2 was cosumed with η h2o2 decreased by over 75 while the tia removal was diminished with the kinetics k pseudo first order rate constant decreased by 82 this result confirmed our hypothesis that o2 produced in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 tia could be utilized to on site generate h2o2 and reduce the h2o2 demands for pollutants degradation 3 5 mechanisms of in situ o2 activation and high h2o2 utilization epr spectroscopy is a sensitive method used to detect the generated species by using dmpo and temp as trapping agents as shown in fig 4 a quadruple peak signals assigned to spin adduct dmpo oh were observed in fe3o4 h2o2 this represented a oh dominated traditional fenton like system where the sluggish kinetics of fe ii generation caused low generation efficiency of hydroxyl radicals and poor performance in tia degradation meanwhile production of oxygen through haber weiss chain reactions and the oh self quenching reaction resulted in low h2o2 utilization efficiency in contrast epr signals of the spin adducts dmpoo2 and temp 1o2 were detected in mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 fig 4b implying that the loading of mn3o4 in binary catalysts induced a non radical pathway however a large number of bubbles were observed in the binary catalytic system with the dissolved oxygen do concentration in reaction solution reached up to 20 mg l fig 4d oxygen was intensively generated and escaped resulting in a waste of h2o2 and low utilization of h2o2 thus we studied the route of o2 generation in the binary catalytic system and found that the intermediate species o2 played a critical role specifically with the addition of p benzoquinone pbq a typical quencher of o2 into the binary catalytic system the do concentration in the mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 decreased from 20 mg l to 9 3 mg l fig 4d the oxygen bubbles were barely observed indicating the quenching of o2 hindered the generation of oxygen similar to mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 signals assigned to spin adducts dmpoo2 and temp 1o2 were observed in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 but much more obvious than those in the former system fig 4c intriguingly few oxygen bubbles were observed in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 and the do concentration in solutions during the experiment was only 10 7 mg l fig 4d besides adding ti mn3o4 fe3o4 into mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 could reduce the do concentration implying ti mn3o4 fe3o4 utilized the produced o2 during the haber weiss reactions in mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 the strong o2 activation ability of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst might have relationship to the electrical conductivity the electronic geometry of catalysts was then investigated by the solid epr spectroscopy see fig 4e it was observed that fe3o4 and mn3o4 fe3o4 exhibited relatively symmetric lorentz lines with g values of 2 3002 and 2 2734 respectively while ti mn3o4 fe3o4 displayed an asymmetrical dyson shape of the epr peak centered at g value 2 1515 and the asymmetry ratio a b of the low field and high field peak heights was 1 54 guy 1985 in general the epr peak asymmetry refers to the resonance absorption by mobile defects such as conduction delocalization electrons yaremchenko et al 2000 a larger asymmetry ratio means more electrons are delocalized in a bigger free motion space as shown in fig s8a with the ti content x molar ratio of ti mn fe x 1 1 increased from 0 1 0 3 to 0 5 the asymmetry ratio increased from 1 05 1 33 to 1 54 the epr results demonstrated that with the appropriate modification of ti the localized electrons resided in binary mn3o4 fe3o4 transformed into delocalized electron more importantly this unique electronic geometry could be optimized by adjusting the ti doping contents the electron delocalization enables ti mn3o4 fe3o4 to provide the high energy electrons enough for the activation of o2 by transferring them to the antibonding orbitals of o2 fang et al 2022 also evidenced by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis ti mn3o4 fe3o4 had the highest electronic conductivity than the other catalysts due to its smallest charge transfer resistance see fig 4f guo et al 2022 this might attribute to the abundant oxygen vacancies in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 with delocalized electrons the electron transferability was enhanced with the increasing ti contents from 0 1 to 0 5 fig s8b demonstrating the increased delocalized electrons in ternary catalysts boosted the electrical conductivity furthermore the o2 desorption peaks among the temperature range of 100 600 c in o2 tpd profiles see fig 4g showed that ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalyst possessed a strong adsorption affinity between the ovs and o2 song et al 2022 which benefited the utilization of locally generated o2 to produce h2o2 as aforementioned the abundant oxygen vacancies in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 yielded delocalization impacts on the chemical properties served as electron donors to boost the activation of o2 to generate o2 and further h2o2 that is the ovs mediated o2 o2 redox promote the o2 generation kinetics resulting in the efficient production of h2o2 and replenishment to the consumed h2o2 based on the abovementioned results the hypothesized catalytic routes for the in situ activation of o2 produced in fenton like process over ti mn3o4 fe3o4 are illustrated in fig 5 initially high valent active sites are reduced by h2o2 with o2 species produced eq 2 then o2 is catalyzed to be o2 and h eq 3 meanwhile o2 combines with each other to regenerate h2o2 and o2 eq 4 subsequently the as generated o2 grabs electrons from ovs in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 to regenerate o2 eq 5 in the meantime 1o2 is produced by the dismutation of o2 eq 6 li et al 2020 in this way the o2 o2 h2o2 redox cycles can be realized in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 fenton like catalysis via ovs high valent active sites coupling which greatly improve the regeneration of o2 and utilization efficiency of h2o2 in order to justify the soundness of the proposed cyclic routes the rate constants of those key reactions are discussed taken the widely studied fe element for example the rate constant k 1 for the reaction of catalyzing h2o2 to o2 by fe iii is 2 0 10 3 m 1 s 1 route 1 fig 5 hartmann et al 2010 munoz et al 2015 the rate constant k 2 for the step of catalyzing o2 to o2 by fe iii is 2 0 103 5 m 1 s 1 route 2 de laat and gallard 1999 the rate constant k 3 for the dismutation of o2 to generate h2o2 and o2 is 2 3 106 m 1 s 1 route 3 de laat and gallard 1999 munoz et al 2015 and the rate constant k 4 for the transformation of o2 to o2 is 2 0 1010 m 1 s 1 route 4 bielski et al 1985 obviously the kinetics of these four routes follow the order k 4 k 3 k 2 k 1 indicating the fastest route 4 triggers the chain reactions and the proposed cyclical routes are plausible as a result the ovs mediated o2 o2 h2o2 redox cycle enabled the production of active species for decontamination as well as the enhancement of h2o2 utilization efficiency 2 me n 1 h2o2 me n

transition metal element 3 6 stability and environment application with real water the catalytic stability of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 was evaluated with five cyclic experiments the used catalyst was collected by a magnet then washed and dried for the next cycle of catalysis without addition of fresh catalysts as shown in fig 6 a the tia removal reached 100 within 20 min after five cyclic experiments demonstrating the excellent reusability performance of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 moreover ti mn3o4 fe3o4 maintained excellent catalytic activities with 100 of tia removal in 20 min over a broad ph range from 4 0 to 11 0 fig 6b the results of ros quenching experiments fig s9a indicated singlet oxygen served as the decisive species for the tia degradation in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 besides 1o2 yield was quantitatively measured by the 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf conversion method liu et al 2022 the detailed quantitative detection of 1o2 was ascribed in text s5 as shown in fig s9b with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 dosage increased from 0 1 0 5 1 0 to 1 5 g l 818 2 1622 6 2270 3 and 2590 2 μmol g l of 1o2 was produced respectively furthermore a clo h2o2 system that generates sole 1o2 was used to study the degradation of tia maetzke and knak jensen 2006 as depicted in fig s9c d temp 1o2 signals gradually increased with the dosage of clo h2o2 increased from 1 mm to 50 mm leading to the tia removal rate increased from 12 3 to 54 4 these results indicated that 1o2 species was generated in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 and contributed to tia degradation in contrast the fe3o4 h2o2 system was dominated by hydroxyl radical and catalytic activities showed strong ph dependence fig s9d the results implied the non radical ternary system presented a much more improved suitability in a broad ph range than the oh radical dominated fenton like system wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019b given the excellent catalytic activity and stability of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 fenton like process it was further used in a practical application to treat real waters catalytic membrane filtration technology has been studied as a potential strategy for water decontamination due to its high efficiency and sustainability compared to the dispersed catalyst suspensions wang et al 2022b wu et al 2021 zou et al 2021 in this study a homemade filtration device was assembled for continuous catalytic filtration experiments see fig 6c the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 membranes with an effective area of 12 6 cm2 were fabricated by vacuum assisted filtering ti mn3o4 fe3o4 suspensions on polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe substrates namely ptfe tmf ultrapure water tap water and surface water collected from a local drinking water treatment plant shenzhen china spiked with 10 mg l tia were used for tests the detailed parameters e g ph codmn toc uv254 turbidity and do of real water samples were summarized in table s3 as shown in fig 6d the pristine ptfe membrane and ptfe tmf membrane contributed nearly 0 85 and 20 rejection of tia during the 12 h continuous run respectively with the addition of h2o2 averagely 95 1 89 4 and 83 9 of tia were removal from ultrapure water tap water and surface water respectively this suggested the high activity of ptfe tmf towards h2o2 activation another superiority of ptfe tmf reactor lied in its leaching resistance as shown in fig s10 the average concentrations of ti below the detection limit mn 27 0 μg l and fe 6 2 μg l in the effluents of ptfe tmf h2o2 system were much lower than the limits of world health organization standards 300 μg l for fe and 100 μg l for mn the excellent reactivity high adaptability to ph change and strong stability of the green ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalyst in degrading refractory organic pollutants demonstrated its enormous potential for practical application in water and wastewater decontamination 4 conclusions this study presents convincing pieces of evidence that ti mn3o4 fe3o4 can strength the o2 o2 h2o2 redox cycles via ovs high valent active sites coupling to trigger the activation of o2 promote the regeneration of o2 and enhance the utilization efficiency of h2o2 the superoxide ions and singlet oxygen are the predominant active species in ternary catalysis and their production efficiency as well as h2o2 utilization efficiency increase obviously in comparison with that of the oxygen vacancies poor binary catalysis in addition the activation of o2 to produce h2o2 does not require external energy input e g light electricity ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalysts with abundant ovs and delocalization electrons possess excellent catalytic activities toward both o2 activation and singlet oxygen dominated oxidation broadening the ph adaptability and enhancing the h2o2 utilization efficiency which shows great potential in water wastewater decontamination

15156,hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is the most commonly used oxidant in advanced oxidation processes for emerging organic contaminant degradation however the activation of h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species is always accompanied by o2 generation resulting in h2o2 waste here we prepare a ti doped mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst ti mn3o4 fe3o4 to create abundant oxygen vacancies ovs which yields electron delocalization impacts on enhancing the electrical conductivity accelerating the activation of o2 to produce h2o2 in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 system ovs mediated o2 o2 h2o2 redox cycles trigger the activation of locally generated o2 boost the regeneration of o2 and on site produce h2o2 for replenishment this leads to a 100 removal of tiamulin in 30 min at an unprecedented h2o2 utilization efficiency of 96 0 which is 24 folds higher than that with fe3o4 h2o2 importantly further integration of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalysts into membrane filtration achieved high rejections of tiamulin 83 9 from real surface water during a continuous 12 h operation demonstrating broad ph adaptability excellent catalytic stability and leaching resistance this work demonstrates a feasible strategy for developing ovs rich catalysts for improving h2o2 utilization efficiency via activation of locally generated oxygen during the haber weiss reaction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

potential risk to ecological environments and human health clyde et al 2021 yang et al 2012 yi et al 2017 advanced oxidation processes aops are widely applied to the treatment of emerging organic pollutants in the environment via activating oxidants to generate reactive oxygen species ros with high reactivity jin et al 2017 li et al 2020 ling et al 2022 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 2022 among the various oxidants hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is the most commonly used oxidant in aops currently h2o2 is mainly produced through the energy demanding and waste intensive anthraquinone process which is only feasible for large scale operations and production of commercially concentrated h2o2 30 70 wt xia et al 2020 in wastewater treatment applications developing small scale decentralized h2o2 generation systems is of increasing interest which avoids the needs of transportation storage separation purification and continual dosing of h2o2 wu and quan 2022 especially diluted h2o2 1 wt is commonly used to induce the generation of ros for wastewater treatment wu and quan 2022 however only a small fraction of h2o2 is converted into ros in most fenton or fenton like processes causing a large demand of h2o2 for optimum reaction performance zhang et al 2022 comprehensively techniques associated with the on site production of diluted h2o2 and improvement of h2o2 utilization efficiency are in need to reduce the invalid consumption of chemical energy so far many strategies have been reported to trigger o2 activation e g photocatalytic o2 activation and electrocatalytic o2 activation by inorganic organic semiconductors e g in2s3 in2o3 tio2 x and c3n4 to produce diluted h2o2 since oxygen is abundant and readily available on earth chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 kuttassery et al 2017 liu et al 2020 2021 pi et al 2020 wu and quan 2022 xia et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 unlike those energy demanding methods rationally regulating low valent metal sites and surface vacancies in catalysts to enhance o2 activation ability without energy input has attracted increasing interest for diluted h2o2 production for instance yang et al prepared zn0 cnts fe3o4 for o2 activation to in situ generate h2o2 and realized a removal of 99 4 chlorophenol yang et al 2018 however zn0 was consumed during the reaction which required further research to enhance the durability of catalysts gong et al 2018 recently wang and co workers reported an oxygen vacancy mediated cucofe tar ldh catalyst that directly activates o2 to produce h2o2 achieving efficient degradation of nitrobenzene s wang et al 2022a metal dopants such as ce zn cu and ni doped into catalytic materials modulate electronic structure and create oxygen vacancies by inducing charge redistribution lakshminarayanan et al 2011 sun et al 2019 the presence of oxygen vacancies ovs on the catalysts surface enhances the adsorption activation capability of o2 and accelerates the charge transfer in the catalytic system yang et al 2019a it is foreseeable that designing catalysts with abundant ovs and proper electronic structures has become an effective approach to energy efficient activation of o2 and on site generation of h2o2 most previous studies related to heterogeneous fenton or fenton like catalysis focused on improving the catalytic activity of the catalysts but ignored the burst consumption and low utilization efficiency of h2o2 which caused a waste of h2o2 on the one hand the main active species in traditional fenton process is hydroxyl radical oh generated via the haber weiss reaction koppenol 2001 but the utilization efficiency of h2o2 is very low due to the sluggish kinetics of fe ii generation zhang et al 2022 previous efforts have designed feocl fe iii ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid and carbon quantum dots mediated fe ii iii redox to improve the fe ii generation kinetics huang et al 2013 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 on the other hand the massive transform of superoxide o2 to o2 during the haber weiss cycle induced large consumption of h2o2 which is another primary cause of low h2o2 utilization efficiency in the fe based fenton like processes however few studies have paid attention to address this issue we hypothesize that if those locally generated o2 gas can be activated to generate h2o2 the h2o2 utilization efficiency could be greatly improved thus it is of scientific importance to elucidate the nature of o2 activation involved in enhancing h2o2 utilization efficiency in this work we synthesized a defective ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst for o2 activation and h2o2 catalysis by systematically comparing the electronic structure and catalytic behaviors of ternary binary and unary fe based catalysts we identified oxygen vacancies ovs with delocalized properties as the decisive factor for the catalytic superiority of ti doped fe mn spinel oxides in h2o2 utilization and singlet oxygen generation intriguingly ti mn3o4 fe3o4 acted as a shuttle that mediated the cycles among h2o2 superoxide o2 and singlet oxygen enabled unprecedent utilization of h2o2 through synergetic catalysis owning to ovs high valent active sites coupling moreover the stability and environmental robustness of the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalysts for decontamination were also investigated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials mn no3 2 feso4 ti so4

ofloxacin at room temperature under magnetic stirring at 300 rpm typically 30 mg of catalysts was dispersed in 100 ml contaminant solution of 10 mg l for 15 min to achieve the adsorption desorption

results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure of fe based ternary catalysts doped with titanium as shown in sem images fig 1 a fe3o4 presented a structure of spherical shape with an average size about 50 100 nm after introducing mn or mn ti the binary and ternary catalysts were formed as homogeneous circular nanostructures with smaller average size under higher magnification via tem ti mn3o4 fe3o4 exhibited a diameter of 10 20 nm fig 1b elemental mappings of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 in fig 1c showed the distribution of fe mn and ti were not entirely uniform the mosaic of mn and ti observed in the selected region implied sufficient contact between mn and ti the mosaic of fe and mn stated fe and mn were not uniformly dispersed in the nanoparticle demonstrating the mutual invasion of fe3o4 and mn3o4 similarly ti was sparsely distributed in most regions near fe collectively the ternary structure mainly exposed a mutual loading between fe3o4 and mn3o4 with ti selectively doping in mn3o4 hr tem images fig 1d of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 showed the lattice distances at 0 29 0 25 and 0 48 nm were well indexed to the fe3o4 220 mn3o4 fe3o4 311 and mn3o4 fe3o4 111 planes boruah and das 2020 wan and wang 2017b respectively however no crystalline lattice was ascribed to tiox moreover the xrd diffractogram fig 1e showed ti mn3o4 fe3o4 well preserved the cubic spinel phases of fe3o4 pdf 65 3107 and mn3o4 pdf 13 0162 28 with no diffraction peaks indexed to titanium titanium monoxide or titanium dioxide the eds mapping together with hr tem images indicated that ti element was well doped in mn3o4 crystalline both fe3o4 and mn3o4 fe3o4 catalysts exhibited distinct peaks at 2θ 30 1 35 5 43 1 53 5 57 0 and 62 5 corresponding to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 plane of fe3o4 or and mn3o4 wan and wang 2017b 3 2 design considerations of rich structure vacancies creation of structure vacancies has been demonstrated to be a versatile and effective defect engineering strategy for regulating the electronic structure and activity of the surrounding active sites for target reactions song et al 2022 in this work o2 activation was triggered to improve the h2o2 generation and utilization efficiency through modulating defects abundance in fe based catalysts the properties of defect structures in the prepared fe based catalysts were examined by raman and o 1 s xps spectroscopy as shown in the raman spectra of synthesized catalysts fig 1f the peaks observed at 330 525 and 675 cm 1 corresponding to fe o bond of fe3o4 while 655 cm 1 can be ascribed to mn3o4 wan and wang 2017a the fe o bond of binary and ternary catalysts are not as strong as pure fe3o4 or even disappeared which may be due to the forming of a compound bond by mn o bond 655 cm 1 and fe o bond 675 cm 1 in general the band intensity in the peak of 151 cm 1 related to the relative content of ti o vacancies rempel et al 2020 obviously a strong peak at 151 cm 1 was observed in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 demonstrating that an abundant amount of ti o structure vacancies were formed due to the doping of ti fig 1g i show the o 1 s xps information of fe3o4 mn3o4 fe3o4 and ti mn3o4 fe3o4 respectively the o 1 s signal divided as two bands one sub band with higher binding energy peaks corresponded to surface adsorbed oxygen oii such as o or o2 2 and another sub band with lower binding energy peaks ascribed to lattice oxygen o2 oi du et al 2019 gao et al 2013 li et al 2019 zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 with the introduction of mn and then mn ti together the surface adsorbed oxygen shifted from 533 3 ev to 532 5 ev and then to 531 3 ev while the lattice oxygen shifted from 530 8 ev to 530 0 ev and then to 529 6 ev demonstrating the changing of local chemical environment of oxygen species generally a higher oii oi ratio signifies a higher ovs concentration jia et al 2016 zhan et al 2020 in addition ti doping induced an obvious difference in the relative peak intensities of oi and oii in catalysts from xps fitting analysis the oii oi values of fe3o4 mn3o4 fe3o4 and ti mn3o4 fe3o4 were 0 68 0 87 and 1 71 respectively and it could be found that the oii oi values increased as the ti doping content increased fig s1a c with the ti doping content increasing from 0 1 to 0 5 the cubic spinel phases of fe3o4 pdf 65 3107 and mn3o4 pdf 13 0162 became more obvious in the xrd spectrums fig s1d furthermore the fe 2p mn 2p and ti 2p xps profiles fig s2 collectively demonstrated abundant low valent ti mn and fe sites were contained in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalyst low valent metal sites lead to the jahn teller distortion and then promote the formation of oxygen vacancy to maintain charge balance he et al 2020 the fe o bond binding energy represented by fe 2p3 2 shifted from 711 8 ev to 711 1 ev and then to a lower binding energy of 710 6 ev over unitary binary and ternary catalysts fig s2a c indicating the fe o bond in the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 was weakened by the interaction among fe mn and ti xiong et al 2021 compared with mn3o4 fe3o4 the mn o bond binding energy ascribed to mn 2p3 2 shifted from 642 1 ev to a lower binding energy 641 6 ev fig s2d e demonstrating the mn o bond was weakened by the ti dopant in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 xiong et al 2021 consequently ti doping endowed ti mn3o4 fe3o4 with plentiful active sites weak fe o bond and mn o bond and abundant ovs 3 3 h2o2 generation via activation of o2 by ternary catalyst inspired by the previous studies that structure vacancies played key roles in activating o2 for h2o2 production chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 wu and quan 2022 we investigated the performance of ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst in activation of o2 for h2o2 generation as shown in fig 2 a the average concentration of h2o2 reached 16 2 μmol l in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o and enhanced to 35 5 μmol l with extra o2 pumping into ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o in addition when bubbling with n2 to remove the dissolved oxygen in the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o almost no h2o2 was generated as expected there was no h2o2 produced in mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o o2 or fe3o4 h2o o2 systems the results demonstrated that the dissolved oxygen in water could be activated by ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 to produce h2o2 and purging o2 into the activation system boosted the production of h2o2 the performance of ternary catalyst in h2o2 production varied with the ph of solutions with o2 purging in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o the average concentration of h2o2 was measured to be 0 9 μmol l 5 5 μmol l 13 6 μmol l 35 5 μmol l and 53 4 μmol l under ph 11 0 9 0 7 0 5 5 and 4 0 respectively fig 2b this suggested aerobic and acid environment favored the production of h2o2 since ti mn3o4 fe3o4 possessed abundant structure vacancies that has proven to be critical to the activation of o2 chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 wu and quan 2022 we proposed an oxygen vacancy dominated pathway for h2o2 production via ti mn3o4 fe3o4 as shown in eq 1 oxygen vacancies served as electron donors and initiated o2 activation to produce h2o2 it was worth noting that the generation of h2o2 was the same under light and dark fig s3 indicating the on site generation of h2o2 was not caused by the photo driven catalysis compared with photocatalytic and electrochemical activation of o2 for h2o2 production that grabbing electrons from electron hole pairs or electricity wu and quan 2022 xia et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 the ovs induced activation system with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 does not require external energy input 1 2ov e o2 2h h2o2 the h2o2 production increased with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 dosage and reached plateau when dosage was higher than 1 0 g l see fig 2c with the catalyst dosage of 1 0 g l h2o2 concentration reached a high value of 54 1 μmol l with reaction time of 30 min in addition the h2o2 production increased with the appropriate ti doping content x molar ratio of ti mn fe x 1 1 as shown in fig s4 with the increase of ti content from 0 1 to 0 5 the h2o2 concentration showed an increasing trend and ti mn3o4 fe3o4 x 0 5 exhibited the maximal h2o2 production activity the increased ti content in ternary catalyst induced the formation of more oxygen vacancies fig s1 thus improved the generation of h2o2 the produced h2o2 aqueous solution could be an environmental benign and efficient oxidant for elimination of refractory organic pollutants given the reported catalytic performance of mnox and feox catalysts hu et al 2011 jin et al 2017 wan and wang 2017b wang et al 2018 ti mn3o4 fe3o4 as expected catalyzed the as produced h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species see fig s5 the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 o2 system was further evaluated for degrading organic contaminants as presented in fig 2d 38 of tiamulin tia was removed within 120 min in the fenton like systems using ti mn3o4 fe3o4 while the tia removal increased to 80 when pure oxygen was pumped into the system in contrast the tia removal decreased to 19 when the system was purged with n2 which could be attributed to the sole adsorption effect by ternary catalysts the contributions from degradation in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 o2 were further analyzed via identifying the degradation intermediates by lc ms ms as illustrated in fig s6 four main products e g c8h18nso2 m z 192 10 in positive mode c20h33o2 m z 305 05 c28h48o5ns m z 510 25 and c26h46o8ns m z 532 25 were detected the corresponding structure formulas of these intermediates were listed in table s1 since no h2o2 was produced in the systems with mn3o4 fe3o4 or fe3o4 catalysts negligible degradation of tia in those two systems was not unexpected the results emphasized that the ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst possessed the synergistic ability of activating o2 to produce h2o2 meanwhile catalyzing h2o2 to degrade organic contaminants 3 4 catalytic performance of ternary catalyst for pollutant degradation with high utilization efficiency of h2o2 as aforementioned high demand of h2o2 was required for efficient degradation of organic contaminants in fenton and fenton like processes due to the low utilization of h2o2 in this section the catalytic performance of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 and the utilization efficiency of h2o2 were evaluated by carrying out the fenton like experiments as shown in fig 3 a the degradation of tia in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 suspension reached 100 in only 30 min while 20 of tia was removed when using other catalysts such as mn3o4 fe3o4 or fe3o4 intriguingly only 45 8 of h2o2 was consumed in the fenton like system with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 while those with mn3o4 fe3o4 and fe3o4 consumed 99 6 and 74 8 of h2o2 fig s7 respectively the h2o2 utilization efficiency η of unitary binary and ternary catalysts was calculated for comparison the η is defined as the ratio of stoichiometric h2o2 consumption δ h2o2 s for tia mineralization to actual h2o2 consumption δ h2o2 a text s1 table s2 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 as depicted in fig 3b ti mn3o4 fe3o4 had the highest η which was about 19 folds of mn3o4 fe3o4 and 24 folds of fe3o4 the η values of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 for bisphenol bpa and ofloxacin ofx degradation were also one order of magnitude larger than those of mn3o4 fe3o4 and fe3o4 given the observed performance of ovs rich ti mn3o4 fe3o4 in activating o2 to produce h2o2 it was speculated that the generated o2 in the fenton like system was activated to in situ generate h2o2 and replenished the consumed h2o2 consequently realizing a high utilization efficiency of h2o2 in order to verify this speculation n2 was continuously purged into the fenton like system to expel the generated o2 during the haber weiss reaction as shown in fig 3c with continuous purging of n2 in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 tia system h2o2 was cosumed with η h2o2 decreased by over 75 while the tia removal was diminished with the kinetics k pseudo first order rate constant decreased by 82 this result confirmed our hypothesis that o2 produced in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 tia could be utilized to on site generate h2o2 and reduce the h2o2 demands for pollutants degradation 3 5 mechanisms of in situ o2 activation and high h2o2 utilization epr spectroscopy is a sensitive method used to detect the generated species by using dmpo and temp as trapping agents as shown in fig 4 a quadruple peak signals assigned to spin adduct dmpo oh were observed in fe3o4 h2o2 this represented a oh dominated traditional fenton like system where the sluggish kinetics of fe ii generation caused low generation efficiency of hydroxyl radicals and poor performance in tia degradation meanwhile production of oxygen through haber weiss chain reactions and the oh self quenching reaction resulted in low h2o2 utilization efficiency in contrast epr signals of the spin adducts dmpoo2 and temp 1o2 were detected in mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 fig 4b implying that the loading of mn3o4 in binary catalysts induced a non radical pathway however a large number of bubbles were observed in the binary catalytic system with the dissolved oxygen do concentration in reaction solution reached up to 20 mg l fig 4d oxygen was intensively generated and escaped resulting in a waste of h2o2 and low utilization of h2o2 thus we studied the route of o2 generation in the binary catalytic system and found that the intermediate species o2 played a critical role specifically with the addition of p benzoquinone pbq a typical quencher of o2 into the binary catalytic system the do concentration in the mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 decreased from 20 mg l to 9 3 mg l fig 4d the oxygen bubbles were barely observed indicating the quenching of o2 hindered the generation of oxygen similar to mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 signals assigned to spin adducts dmpoo2 and temp 1o2 were observed in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 but much more obvious than those in the former system fig 4c intriguingly few oxygen bubbles were observed in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 and the do concentration in solutions during the experiment was only 10 7 mg l fig 4d besides adding ti mn3o4 fe3o4 into mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 could reduce the do concentration implying ti mn3o4 fe3o4 utilized the produced o2 during the haber weiss reactions in mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 the strong o2 activation ability of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 ternary catalyst might have relationship to the electrical conductivity the electronic geometry of catalysts was then investigated by the solid epr spectroscopy see fig 4e it was observed that fe3o4 and mn3o4 fe3o4 exhibited relatively symmetric lorentz lines with g values of 2 3002 and 2 2734 respectively while ti mn3o4 fe3o4 displayed an asymmetrical dyson shape of the epr peak centered at g value 2 1515 and the asymmetry ratio a b of the low field and high field peak heights was 1 54 guy 1985 in general the epr peak asymmetry refers to the resonance absorption by mobile defects such as conduction delocalization electrons yaremchenko et al 2000 a larger asymmetry ratio means more electrons are delocalized in a bigger free motion space as shown in fig s8a with the ti content x molar ratio of ti mn fe x 1 1 increased from 0 1 0 3 to 0 5 the asymmetry ratio increased from 1 05 1 33 to 1 54 the epr results demonstrated that with the appropriate modification of ti the localized electrons resided in binary mn3o4 fe3o4 transformed into delocalized electron more importantly this unique electronic geometry could be optimized by adjusting the ti doping contents the electron delocalization enables ti mn3o4 fe3o4 to provide the high energy electrons enough for the activation of o2 by transferring them to the antibonding orbitals of o2 fang et al 2022 also evidenced by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis ti mn3o4 fe3o4 had the highest electronic conductivity than the other catalysts due to its smallest charge transfer resistance see fig 4f guo et al 2022 this might attribute to the abundant oxygen vacancies in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 with delocalized electrons the electron transferability was enhanced with the increasing ti contents from 0 1 to 0 5 fig s8b demonstrating the increased delocalized electrons in ternary catalysts boosted the electrical conductivity furthermore the o2 desorption peaks among the temperature range of 100 600 c in o2 tpd profiles see fig 4g showed that ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalyst possessed a strong adsorption affinity between the ovs and o2 song et al 2022 which benefited the utilization of locally generated o2 to produce h2o2 as aforementioned the abundant oxygen vacancies in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 yielded delocalization impacts on the chemical properties served as electron donors to boost the activation of o2 to generate o2 and further h2o2 that is the ovs mediated o2 o2 redox promote the o2 generation kinetics resulting in the efficient production of h2o2 and replenishment to the consumed h2o2 based on the abovementioned results the hypothesized catalytic routes for the in situ activation of o2 produced in fenton like process over ti mn3o4 fe3o4 are illustrated in fig 5 initially high valent active sites are reduced by h2o2 with o2 species produced eq 2 then o2 is catalyzed to be o2 and h eq 3 meanwhile o2 combines with each other to regenerate h2o2 and o2 eq 4 subsequently the as generated o2 grabs electrons from ovs in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 to regenerate o2 eq 5 in the meantime 1o2 is produced by the dismutation of o2 eq 6 li et al 2020 in this way the o2 o2 h2o2 redox cycles can be realized in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 fenton like catalysis via ovs high valent active sites coupling which greatly improve the regeneration of o2 and utilization efficiency of h2o2 in order to justify the soundness of the proposed cyclic routes the rate constants of those key reactions are discussed taken the widely studied fe element for example the rate constant k 1 for the reaction of catalyzing h2o2 to o2 by fe iii is 2 0 10 3 m 1 s 1 route 1 fig 5 hartmann et al 2010 munoz et al 2015 the rate constant k 2 for the step of catalyzing o2 to o2 by fe iii is 2 0 103 5 m 1 s 1 route 2 de laat and gallard 1999 the rate constant k 3 for the dismutation of o2 to generate h2o2 and o2 is 2 3 106 m 1 s 1 route 3 de laat and gallard 1999 munoz et al 2015 and the rate constant k 4 for the transformation of o2 to o2 is 2 0 1010 m 1 s 1 route 4 bielski et al 1985 obviously the kinetics of these four routes follow the order k 4 k 3 k 2 k 1 indicating the fastest route 4 triggers the chain reactions and the proposed cyclical routes are plausible as a result the ovs mediated o2 o2 h2o2 redox cycle enabled the production of active species for decontamination as well as the enhancement of h2o2 utilization efficiency 2 me n 1 h2o2 me n

transition metal element 3 6 stability and environment application with real water the catalytic stability of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 was evaluated with five cyclic experiments the used catalyst was collected by a magnet then washed and dried for the next cycle of catalysis without addition of fresh catalysts as shown in fig 6 a the tia removal reached 100 within 20 min after five cyclic experiments demonstrating the excellent reusability performance of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 moreover ti mn3o4 fe3o4 maintained excellent catalytic activities with 100 of tia removal in 20 min over a broad ph range from 4 0 to 11 0 fig 6b the results of ros quenching experiments fig s9a indicated singlet oxygen served as the decisive species for the tia degradation in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 besides 1o2 yield was quantitatively measured by the 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf conversion method liu et al 2022 the detailed quantitative detection of 1o2 was ascribed in text s5 as shown in fig s9b with ti mn3o4 fe3o4 dosage increased from 0 1 0 5 1 0 to 1 5 g l 818 2 1622 6 2270 3 and 2590 2 μmol g l of 1o2 was produced respectively furthermore a clo h2o2 system that generates sole 1o2 was used to study the degradation of tia maetzke and knak jensen 2006 as depicted in fig s9c d temp 1o2 signals gradually increased with the dosage of clo h2o2 increased from 1 mm to 50 mm leading to the tia removal rate increased from 12 3 to 54 4 these results indicated that 1o2 species was generated in ti mn3o4 fe3o4 h2o2 and contributed to tia degradation in contrast the fe3o4 h2o2 system was dominated by hydroxyl radical and catalytic activities showed strong ph dependence fig s9d the results implied the non radical ternary system presented a much more improved suitability in a broad ph range than the oh radical dominated fenton like system wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019b given the excellent catalytic activity and stability of ti mn3o4 fe3o4 fenton like process it was further used in a practical application to treat real waters catalytic membrane filtration technology has been studied as a potential strategy for water decontamination due to its high efficiency and sustainability compared to the dispersed catalyst suspensions wang et al 2022b wu et al 2021 zou et al 2021 in this study a homemade filtration device was assembled for continuous catalytic filtration experiments see fig 6c the ti mn3o4 fe3o4 membranes with an effective area of 12 6 cm2 were fabricated by vacuum assisted filtering ti mn3o4 fe3o4 suspensions on polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe substrates namely ptfe tmf ultrapure water tap water and surface water collected from a local drinking water treatment plant shenzhen china spiked with 10 mg l tia were used for tests the detailed parameters e g ph codmn toc uv254 turbidity and do of real water samples were summarized in table s3 as shown in fig 6d the pristine ptfe membrane and ptfe tmf membrane contributed nearly 0 85 and 20 rejection of tia during the 12 h continuous run respectively with the addition of h2o2 averagely 95 1 89 4 and 83 9 of tia were removal from ultrapure water tap water and surface water respectively this suggested the high activity of ptfe tmf towards h2o2 activation another superiority of ptfe tmf reactor lied in its leaching resistance as shown in fig s10 the average concentrations of ti below the detection limit mn 27 0 μg l and fe 6 2 μg l in the effluents of ptfe tmf h2o2 system were much lower than the limits of world health organization standards 300 μg l for fe and 100 μg l for mn the excellent reactivity high adaptability to ph change and strong stability of the green ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalyst in degrading refractory organic pollutants demonstrated its enormous potential for practical application in water and wastewater decontamination 4 conclusions this study presents convincing pieces of evidence that ti mn3o4 fe3o4 can strength the o2 o2 h2o2 redox cycles via ovs high valent active sites coupling to trigger the activation of o2 promote the regeneration of o2 and enhance the utilization efficiency of h2o2 the superoxide ions and singlet oxygen are the predominant active species in ternary catalysis and their production efficiency as well as h2o2 utilization efficiency increase obviously in comparison with that of the oxygen vacancies poor binary catalysis in addition the activation of o2 to produce h2o2 does not require external energy input e g light electricity ti mn3o4 fe3o4 catalysts with abundant ovs and delocalization electrons possess excellent catalytic activities toward both o2 activation and singlet oxygen dominated oxidation broadening the ph adaptability and enhancing the h2o2 utilization efficiency which shows great potential in water wastewater decontamination

from 3 to 9 ionic strength from 0 to 300 mm with ha 0 1 10 mg l 1 in suspension and in real water samples including tap water river water and sewage fes2 pi system could also efficiently disinfect gentamycin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis the generated reactive species including fe iv o2 and oh would attack cell membrane and overwhelmed intracellular defense system the intracellular kanamycin resistance genes in cells would be released and then degraded in fes2 pi system pi preferred to be adsorbed on fe site of fes2 with lower adsorption energy more occupancy of bonding state and stronger bonding strength the subsequent transfer of electron cloud from fe site to pi would cleave io bond to generate reactive species moreover fes2 pi system could also combine with sand filtration system to efficiently capture and disinfect arb therefore fes2 pi system is a promising approach to inactivate arb in different scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords periodate pyrite antibiotic resistant bacteria real water samples sand filtration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the abuse of antibiotics the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb has become a global problem li et al 2022c pepper et al 2018 the outbreak of covid 19 has been shown to aggravate the proliferation of arb through sewage units in wastewater treatment plants seriously threatening the safety of natural ecology and human health shi et al 2022 wang et al 2022b however traditional disinfection methods employed in wastewater treatment plants such as uv irradiation and chlorination could not completely remove arb he et al 2019 liu et al 2022b therefore it is urgent to develop robust and efficient approaches to eliminate arb in water via generation of reactive species advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton and fenton like reaction could efficiently inactivate arb ahmed et al 2020 2021 zhang et al 2016 inhibiting the spread of arb in aquatic environments however the production of iron sludge and difficulty in transportation of liquid form h2o2 limited the applications of these aops techniques in real treatment processes due to relatively easier transportation and storage aops based on the solid form oxidant of persulfate such as peroxydisulfate pds have attracted increasing attention for eliminating arb duan et al 2022 jin et al 2021 li et al 2022b yu et al 2021 for example by using sulfidated nano zero valent iron to activate pds yu et al 2021 found that kanamycin and tetracycline resistant bacteria could be removed via reactive species such as so4 and oh generated in the reaction system li et al 2022a reported that cuo could catalyze pds to selectively generate cu iii for the effective disinfection of sulfamethoxazole resistant e coli duan et al 2022 recently showed that o2 and so4 produced in soybean straw derived biochar pds system could efficiently inactivate tetracycline resistant bacteria as one of important solid form oxidants periodate pi has recently attracted increasing attention in the field of water treatment due to the generation of various reactive species such as iodate radicals io3 atomic oxygen radical anion o hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical anion o2 upon activation he et al 2022 ling et al 2022 liu et al 2022a long et al 2021 sun et al 2020 zong et al 2021 for example by using reductive hydroxylamine to activate pi at ph 3 2 sun et al 2020 found that oh o2 and 1o2 produced in the reaction system could degrade 4 chlorophenol and inactivate bacteria e coli and s aureus in water zong et al 2021 recently found that fe ii could activate pi to degrade eight different types of emerging organic contaminants at ph 5 via the produced fe iv and oh very recently ling et al 2022 showed that pi could also be activated by sulfide modified zero valent iron to produce reactive species such as io3 o2 1o2 fe iv and oh for sulfadiazine degradation at ph 3 it is expected that arb could also be disinfected by activation of pi however the relevant report is very limited to the best of our knowledge only our very recent study has shown that activation of pi by natural solar light could disinfect model arb through the generated oh and o2 liu et al 2022a however the use of natural solar light to activate pi would be relied on the weather it is imperative to develop relevant technique to activate pi without light irradiation to achieve effective arb disinfection with enriched ferrous iron and sulfur species with low valence zhou et al 2018 pyrite fes2 naturally abundant mineral is expected to be a favorable electron donor to activate pi via electron transfer to produce reactive species to inactivate arb however pi activation by pyrite has not been investigated for the disinfection of arb moreover there is still a lack of in depth exploration on how electrons transfer from the reactive sites e g fe site and s site on fes2 surface to pi which is thus worth investigating in this study naturally abundant mineral pyrite with low cost was employed to activate pi for the disinfection of model arb kanamycin resistant e coli the disinfection performance of fes2 pi system were systematically investigated in different conditions including different fes2 dosage initial viable bacterial concentrations solution ph ionic strength with humic acid ha in suspensions to testify the effects of complex water matrix the disinfection performance of fes2 pi system toward arb was further investigated in different types of real water samples tap water river water and sewage to examine the universality of fes2 pi system the disinfection efficiency of gentamycin resistance e coli and gram positive bacillus subtilis b subtilis was also tested the concentrations of intracellular and extracellular args in fes2 pi system were determined to evaluate the feasibility for args degradation quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr analysis were employed to determine the roles of reactive species in fes2 pi system various characterization combined with density functional theory calculation were employed to reveal the process of electron transfer from the reactive sites of fes2 to broaden its potential application fes2 pi system was combined with sand filtration system to capture and disinfect arb this study not only showed that fes2 pi system could be employed as a promising approach to efficiently disinfect arb but also provided deep insights into the mechanisms for pi activation by fes2 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the detailed information about all chemicals used in the present study was provided in text s1 2 2 arb disinfection experiments the catalytic disinfection performance of different systems was evaluated in a double walled beaker with circulating water system to keep the reaction temperature at 25 0 0 2 c fig s1 in this study e coli k 12 mg1655 containing kanamycin resistance gene kanr in the chromosome was chosen as the representative gram negative antibiotic resistant bacteria arb the disinfection performance against another arb gentamicin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis atcc6633 was also testified the detailed protocol about bacterial stock suspensions preparation could be found in text s2 for a typical disinfection experiment 300 mg l 1 of catalyst i e fes2 or other typical metal sulfide was well dispersed in 50 ml of sterilized saline ph 7 15 mm nacl followed by the addition of 0 2 ml bacterial stock suspensions containing about 2 5 109 colony forming units cfu ml viable cells under vigorous stirring subsequently 0 2 ml of pi stock solution 50 mm in ultrapure water was introduced into the system to initiate the reaction with the final concentration of 0 2 mm at given intervals 0 5 ml of reaction suspension would be sampled and then quenched by adding 10 μl of sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 80 mm the density of viable cells was subsequently determined by plate counting method text s2 with limit of detection lod of 10 cfu ml 1 the effects of catalyst dosage initial concentration of arb as well as water matrix e g ph ion strength with humic acid ha major component of natural organic matter in suspensions were systematically investigated details could be found in text s3 moreover the disinfection performance in real water samples including tap water river water as well as sewage were also examined details about real water samples were provided in text s3 the major parameters of real water samples were listed in table s1 all the experiments were performed at least in duplicate the details about the analysis of generated iodine species were provided in texts s4 to testify the potential application of fes2 pi system in different scenarios fes2 pi system was combined with sand filter system to improve arb capture and disinfection details about fes2 pi sand filtration system could be found in text s5 2 3 arb inactivation mechanisms confocal laser scanning microscopy alr si nikon japan and scanning electronic microscope sem merlin zeiss germany were employed to confirm the lysis of arb during the disinfection process the sod activity and the changes of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were evaluated by total superoxide dismutase assay kit s0101 boyotime text s6 and reactive oxygen species assay kit s0033 boyotime respectively text s7 the concentration of released k from the broken cells was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific usa at given intervals the intracellular and extracellular args were determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction q pcr text s8 to determine the potential of fes2 pi system to degrade args the degradation performance of nucleotide bases including cytosine thymine adenine and guanine by fes2 pi system was also investigated and the detailed information was provided in text s9 the reactivation experiments of treated arb were also conducted by the introduction of 100 μl final reaction suspension in different systems into 100 ml of culture media which was cultured for 7 days quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution of different reactive species to arb disinfection in fes2 pi system text s10 electron spin resonance spectrometry esr bruker emx plus was also employed to confirm the reactive species involved in fes2 pi system text s10 to explore the generation of high valent fe species the concentrations of methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography u3000 thermo fisher the 16o 18o isotope labeled pmso2 and

probe text s11 2 4 characterization of fes2 and density functional theory dft calculation the detailed information about the characterization of original fes2 was provided in text s12 in situ raman analysis i t curves x ray photoelectron spectra were employed to analyze the electron transfer of fes2 during the reaction text s12 dft calculation was employed to reveal the reaction sites and process in fes2 pi system via the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp text s13 3 results and discussion 3 1 arb disinfection performance in fes2 pi system under different conditions universality and reusability of fes2 pi without the presence of fes2 pi 0 2 mm exhibited negligible disinfection performance against model arb kanamycin resistant e coli as indicated by the no obvious change of viable arb density within 25 min with the kobs value of 0 024 0 001 10 2 min 2 figs 1 a and s2 detailed reason for choosing hom model with h 2 to describe disinfection kinetics was provided in text s14 and fig s3 the limited disinfection performance of pi under dark condition has also been reported previously sun et al 2020 solely 300 mg l 1 of fes2 in the absence of any oxidant could only inactivate 0 4 log viable arb with kobs value of 0 076 0 009 10 2 min 2 clearly fes2 alone contained limited arb inactivation performance which was consistent with previous study ahmed et al 2022 moradi et al 2022 interestingly fes2 300 mg l 1 combing with pi 0 2 mm could inactivate 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb below the lod within only 20 min with the kobs value of 1 9 0 1 10 2 min 2 the observation clearly showed that combination of fes2 and pi fes2 pi system could efficiently inactivate arb in water in contrast with the same concentration of oxidants 0 2 mm fes2 pds and fes2 h2o2 systems could only inactivate 2 3 log and 1 0 log of arb with kobs values of 0 46 0 09 10 2 min 1 and 0 19 0 05 10 2 min 2 respectively obviously fes2 pi exhibited superior arb inactivation performance than fes2 pds and fes2 h2o2 systems moreover the arb disinfection performance of fes2 pi kobs value of 1 9 0 1 10 2 min 2 was also higher than those of other metal sulfides pi systems including cu2s pi with kobs of 0 34 0 07 10 2 min 2 mos2 pi with kobs of 0 39 0 04 10 2 min 1 and fes pi with kobs of 0 83 0 09 10 2 min 2 figs 1b and s4 clearly comparing with these other metal sulfides fes2 could activate pi more efficiently note that increasing the dosage of fes2 could increase the reactive sites for pi activation the duration for disinfecting 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb below the lod in fes2 pi disinfection system thus shortened from 20 min to 10 min with increasing the dosage of fes2 from 300 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 fig s5 although decreasing the dosage of fes2 to 100 mg l 1 could decrease the disinfection kinetics yet inactivation of arb with initial concentration of 1 107 cfu ml 1 below the lod could still be achieved within 40 min the duration for complete inactivation of arb in fes2 pi system further shortened to 15 min and 10 min when the initial cell concentration was lowered to 1 106 cfu ml 1 and 1 105 cfu ml 1 respectively fig s6 similar to previous studies ling et al 2022 zong et al 2021 pi was transformed into nontoxic iodate within the reaction duration under the tested experimental condition fig s7 neither toxic hoi fig s8 nor i2 fig s9 was detected in fes2 pi system within experimental duration indicating that iodinated disinfection by products could be hardly generated during the reaction process shin et al 2018 comparing with other aop based disinfection systems fes2 pi systems exhibited great advantages in disinfection efficiency and cost table s2 clearly fes2 pi system is a promising technology for arb disinfection with low cost and high efficiency at a wide range of initial solution ph from 3 to 9 solely fes2 without pi contained limited arb inactivation performance fig s10a except at ph 3 solely pi exhibited negligible disinfection performance against arb at initial solution ph from 5 to 9 fig s10b in contrast fes2 pi system exhibited efficient arb disinfection performance at broad initial solution ph from 3 to 9 figs 1c and s11a specifically viable arb cells with initial concentration of 1 107 cfu ml 1 could be inactivated below the lod within 5 15 20 25 min at initial solution ph of 3 5 7 and 9 respectively the observation indicated that fes2 pi could disinfect arb more efficiently at lower ph conditions although the dissolved oxygen in fes2 pi disinfection system remained unchanged during the reaction process under all examined ph conditions fig s12a the solution ph of reaction system dropped in the first several mins then maintained stable during the disinfection process due to the capture of oh in h2o by fes2 via the ion exchange of s2 2 fig s12b xi et al 2021 xing et al 2018 the decrease of solution ph during the reaction duration in fe based catalysts reaction systems has also been previously reported li et al 2022a wu et al 2020 despite the drop of solution ph the trend of final solution ph was consistent with that of initial solution ph the higher initial solution ph the relatively higher final solution ph previous study has shown that the increased oxidation capability of reactive species at lower ph contributed to the improved disinfection performance kavitha and palanivelu 2005 moreover the more positive zeta potentials of fes2 at lower ph fig s13 could facilitate the attractive interaction between fes2 and arb with negative surface charge leading to the more efficient disinfection by reactive species in fes2 pi system at lower ph liu et al 2020 as a result more effective arb disinfection performance was achieved in fes2 pi system at lower initial ph condition unlike the inhibition of disinfection performance with increasing solution ion strength in some aop processes lado ribeiro et al 2019 yang et al 2014 increasing solution ionic strength nacl from 0 to 300 mm yet did not obviously influence the arb disinfection performance in fes2 pi system p 0 1 figs 1d and s11b the observation also indicated that the presence of chlorine ions as well as increasing its concentrations had negligible effect on the reactivity of fes2 pi system for arb disinfection similar to that without humic acid ha major component of natural organic matter present in water inactivating 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb below the lod could still be achieved within 20 min when ha with concentration of either 0 1 or 1 mg l 1 coexisted in fes2 pi system figs 1e and s11c although the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha in cell suspension slightly inhibited the disinfection performance 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb could be inactivated below the lod within 25 min with the kobs value of 1 2 0 1 10 2 min 2 efficient arb disinfection performance of fes2 pi system was also achieved in real water samples figs 1f and s11d specifically 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb could also be inactivated below the lod within 20 min in tap water river water as well as sewage clearly fes2 pi system exhibited efficient arb inactivation performance in complex water matrix condition as well as in real water samples in addition to kanamycin resistant e coli fes2 pi system could also efficiently inactivate 1 107 cfu ml 1 of gentamycin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis below the lod within 25 min and 30 min respectively figs 2 a and 2b the observation suggested the universality of fes2 pi disinfection system the reuse experiments showed that disinfection of 1 107 cfu ml 1 kanamycin resistant e coli below the lod could be obtained within 40 min even in the fifth cycle fig 2c obviously fes2 pi system could be repeatedly used unlike the obvious fe leaching reached 2 5 mg l 1 in fes2 alone system in the absence of pi at initial solution ph 7 no fe leaching was detected in fes2 pi system within 25 min at initial solution ph 7 fig s14 clearly the presence of pi could efficiently suppress fe leaching similar observation has also been reported previously long et al 2021 zong et al 2022 the weak steric hindrance effect of pi could facilitate the enhanced adsorption of pi on fes2 as well as the interaction between pi and fes2 zong et al 2022 consequently fe leaching was inhibited by pi the unchanged characteristic peaks for fes2 in xrd patterns after use fig 2d further suggested the stability of fes2 in fes2 pi system leading to its excellent reusability 3 2 disinfection mechanisms of arb reactive species generated in fes2 pi system would attack bacterial envelope changing the permeability of cell membrane and leading to the leakage of intracellular contents in arb jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 confocal images showed that prior to the disinfection process viable arb exhibited strong green fluorescence fig s15a the observation suggested that cell membrane of arb was intact before disinfection reaction which was also confirmed by the sem image of arb prior to the inactivation reaction fig 3 a after disinfection treatment for 5 min the numbers of dead cells with red fluorescence greatly increased fig s15b consistently the morphology of cells gradually became unregular with the presence of pores in cell membranes fig 3b after disinfection for 20 min all arb cells exhibited red fluorescence fig s15c suggested that all cells were completely inactivated the disinfected cells were concave with the severely damaged cell membrane fig 3c due to the destruction of cell membrane in fes2 pi system k in arb gradually released with the increase of disinfection duration and the final concentration reached 330 μg l 1 in the reaction suspension after 20 min reaction fig s16 the cell lesions mechanism induced by reactive species generated in fes2 pi system during the disinfection process were further investigated unlike the no obvious decrease of sod activity in fes2 alone system without pi or pi alone system without fes2 the sod activity in fes2 pi system decreased from 0 29 u ml 1 to 0 11 u ml 1 with the increasing reaction duration fig 3d the observation indicated that reactive species might induce oxidative stress and finally overwhelmed the defense system leading to the decrease of sod activity wang et al 2020 after disinfection for 1 min intracellular ros was found to be accumulated with the intensity of 3 78 fig 3e since the lysis of bacteria would lead to the dispersion of intracellular ros into solution li et al 2020 intracellular ros thus gradually decreased with the increase of disinfection duration from 1 min to 20 min note that the damage of cell membrane in fes2 pi system would release intracellular antibiotic resistance genes iargs into solution ahmed et al 2022 li et al 2020 meanwhile intracellular ros could also degrade portion of iargs thus the concentration of iargs decreased from 2 61 107 copies ml 1 to 0 35 107 copies ml 1 during the 20 min disinfection process fig 3f prolonged the reaction to 30 min could further decrease the concentration of iargs to 0 19 107 copies ml 1 the fast release of iargs into reaction solution lead to the gradual increase of extracellular args eargs in the first 10 min disinfection process subsequently the continuously generated reactive species in fes2 pi system would attack eargs liu et al 2022c yuan et al 2020 leading to the decrease of eargs concentration after disinfection for 30 min as a result the total args concentration decreased obviously with increasing reaction duration moreover great amounts of four nucleotide bases including cytosine thymine adenine and guanine with concentration of 1 μm could also be removed in fes2 pi system within 15 min fig s17 the observation indicated that reactive species produced in fes2 pi system could oxidize four tested nucleotide bases into small molecules clearly fes2 pi system also had the potential to degrade args released from arb the environmental risks of args thus could be reduced unlike the regrowth of arb observed in fes2 alone system without pi or pi alone system without fes2 arb inactivated by fes2 pi system could be hardly reactivated due to the destruction of cell membrane and intracellular defense system fig 3g wang et al 2021a specifically no obvious increase of od600 for culture media was observed during 7 day cultivation after inactivation in fes2 pi system while od600 either in solely fes2 system or pi system increased after 1 day cultivation the observation clearly showed that fes2 pi system could completely inactivate arb and inhibited their regrowth arb disinfection kinetics slightly decreased with addition of sod enzyme the scavenger of o2 into fes2 pi reaction suspension figs 4 a and s18 the slight reduction of kobs value from 1 9 0 1 10 2 min 2 without scavenger to 1 2 0 1 10 2 min 2 with addition of sod enzyme p 0 005 indicated that o2 had contribution to the arb disinfection process similar to the solely fes2 system esr analysis also showed the generation of o2 radicals in fes2 pi system fig 4b the intensity of tempol the probe for the detection of electron in esr spectra dramatically decreased when fes2 was added into suspension fig 4c indicating that fes2 could directly provide hydrated electrons eq s3 the capture of electrons by tempol was further confirmed by the product detection after attacked by electron the reduction product hydrogenated tempol m z 174 14775 rt 3 37 min esi was gradually generated with the increasing reaction time figs s19 and s20 purging o2 into reaction system could enhance the disinfection performance increased kobs value to 3 2 0 9 10 2 min 2 p 0 01 while n2 purging slightly decreased the disinfection kinetics decreased kobs value to 1 1 0 1 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 fig s21 the above observation clearly indicated that o2 was mainly generated via the reduction of dissolved o2 by hydrated electrons provided by fes2 eq s4 when h2o was substituted by 50 d2o the kobs value obviously increased to 7 2 1 3 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 suggesting that 1o2 also played a role in the catalytic disinfection process due to the self decay of pi eq s5 bokare and choi 2015 three typical peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 corresponding to 1o2 could be observed in the esr spectra of pi alone system fig 4d the peak intensities yet gradually decreased with increasing fes2 dosage that added into pi suspension which indicated that 1o2 might be consumed by fes2 to generate o2 an et al 2022 the prolonged lifetime of 1o2 in 50 d2o in fes2 pi system might enhance the interaction between 1o2 and fes2 to produce the reactive o2 for arb disinfection eq s6 the enhanced disinfection performance thus was achieved when water was replaced with 50 d2o the introduction of ipa the scavenger of oh into the reaction system significantly decreased the disinfection performance with the kobs value of 0 072 0 009 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 indicating that oh had significant contribution to the arb disinfection process unlike the absence of obvious peak in the esr spectra of solely fes2 system or pi alone system the typical characteristic peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to oh were present in the esr spectra of fes2 pi system fig 4e obviously oh was generated in fes2 pi system the generation of oh in fes2 pi system was further confirmed by the presence of fluorescence intensities of oh signals with using ta as a chemical probe fig s22 in contrast the introduction of phenol the scavenger of io3 did not affect the disinfection kinetics p 0 1 indicating io3 had negligible contribution to the arb disinfection clearly electrons generated by fes2 could reduce pi via cleavage of i o bond io3 and o thus were generated eq s7 via the protonation of o in h2o oh radical was subsequently generated eq s8 the introduction of dmso the scavenger of fe iv inhibited the disinfection kinetics with kobs value of 0 54 0 05 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 suggesting that fe iv contributed to the disinfection process previous studies reported that since pmso could be oxidized to pmso2 by fe iv pmso thus could be used as an indicator to detect fe iv zong et al 2021 2022 no obvious pmso2 was generated within 25 min in pi alone system yet around 5 μm of pmso2 was gradually generated within 25 min in fes2 pi system fig 4f the observation indicated that fe iv was present in fes2 pi system when water was replaced by h2 18o the 18o 16o isotope shift during the oxidation of pmso in h2 18o led to the generation of 18o labeled pmso2 pms16o18o with m z of 156 95 in fes2 pi system fig s23 the observation further confirmed the presence of fe iv in fes2 pi system via eq s9 the above results indicated that o2 oh and fe iv contributed to the disinfection of arb in fes2 pi system generally o2 and oh radicals broad spectrum oxidants with high reactivity would indiscriminately attack the cell membrane of arb richards et al 2021 wang et al 2021b meanwhile fe iv could selectively oxidize electron rich moieties such as amino acids with amino groups and monosaccharide with hydroxyl groups in cell membrane of arb dong et al 2020 working together these multiple reactive species generated in fes2 pi system could efficiently attack cell membrane of arb leading to the disinfection of arb 3 3 electron transfer process in disinfection system the mixture of fes2 supernatant and agno3 exhibited a wide adsorption curve indicating the formation of ag s complexation fig s24 xing et al 2018 clearly due to the release of unsaturated s atoms from the edges of fes2 sulfur species including s2 2 and s2 derived from the disproportion of s2 2 were present in fes2 supernatant xi et al 2021 via ion exchange of s2 2 fes2 could capture oh in h2o leading to the decreased ph value 5 01 of the fes2 suspension fig s25 due to the presence of limited amount of unsaturated s atoms at the edges of fes2 the ph value of fes2 suspension gradually increased to near neutral with increasing the washing times of fes2 particles by ultrapure water the decrease of sulfur species percentage on the surface of fes2 from 83 8 prior to disinfection experiment to 78 4 after the disinfection reaction table s3 further confirmed the release of sulfur species from the surface of fes2 particles the removal of unsaturated s atoms from fes2 surface could lead to the exposure of reactive fe sites which would provide hydrated electrons for the following disinfection process fig 4b liu et al 2018 no obvious peak was present in the raman spectra of solely pi solution while three characteristic peaks at 341 377 427 cm 1 corresponding to e1g a1g and t1g modes respectively were observed for fes2 fig 5 a similar observations have also been reported previously kment et al 2014 comparing with fes2 ia ie of 1 43 the peak intensity of a1g mode obviously decreased with smaller ia ie 1 30 in fes2 pi system the observation indicated the generation of sulfur vacancies on the surface of fes2 in fes2 pi system dong et al 2018 meanwhile the three characteristic peaks of fes2 in fes2 pi system were blue shifted by 2 cm 1 indicating that the energy of photons scattered by fes2 with the presence of pi was higher than that in fes2 alone system the observation suggested the transfer of electron clouds from the surface of fes2 to pi molecule dong et al 2021 the lower current of i t curve in fes2 electrode system with pi in suspension 9 6 10 7 a relative to that in blank electrode system without fes2 with pi in suspension 4 2 10 7 a fig 5b further confirmed electrons transfer from fes2 electrode to pi he et al 2022 the addition of arb into fes2 electrode system with pi in suspension did not obviously change i t curve which suggested that the electrons transfer process from fes2 electrode to pi was not influenced by arb clearly instead of directly attacking arb electrons provided by fes2 particles yet would activate pi to generate reactive species such as fe iv oh and o2 radicals to disinfect arb during the activation process of pi by fes2 particles fe iv would be generated eq s9 which would be quickly transformed into fe iii eq s10 however the generated fe iii would be subsequently reduced back to fe ii by diffusing o2 and reductive s species e g s2 2 eqs s11 and s12 due to the lower standard redox potentials of s s2 2 0 48 v and o2 o2 0 33 v than that of fe3 fe2 0 77 v yang et al 2022 as stated above the proportion of sulfur element on fes2 surface obviously decreased after the disinfection experiment table s3 while no obvious peak for s0 could be observed in the xrd pattern of used fes2 fig 2d xi et al 2021 these results suggested that the released s2 2 would be finally oxidized into soluble sulfur species e g so4 2 rather than insoluble s0 that would deposit onto the surface of fes2 in fes2 pi system eq s13 yang et al 2022 meanwhile the slight increase of fe iii peak area 6 in high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p of fes2 after the disinfection experiment fig 5c also indicated that only small amount of fe iii was eventually generated on the surface of fes2 during the reaction duration the regenerated fe ii from fe iii would further react with pi to produce reactive species to disinfect arb thus efficient arb disinfection performance was achieved in fes2 pi system xrd and tem analysis of fes2 indicated that 100 plane was the main exposed plane of fes2 text s16 and figs s26 s27 thus dft calculation was conducted on the 100 plane of fes2 surface to reveal the reactive sites on fes2 particles to activate pi specifically the adsorption energy between pi molecule and fe ii site was determined to be 3 39 ev which was negatively higher than that between pi and s i site 1 79 ev figs 5d and s28 the observation indicated instead of s i site pi molecule preferred to be adsorbed onto the fe ii site of fes2 crystal orbital hamilton population cohp calculation was employed to further analyze the interaction between pi and fe site or s site on fes2 fig 5e deringer et al 2011 wang et al 2022a specifically the purple area right side and pink area left side corresponded to the contributions of bonding and antibonding respectively comparing with s site the occupancy of bonding state of fes2 pi in fe site increased suggesting the enhanced interaction between pi and fes2 on fe site to quantitatively determine the bond strength the integrated cohp icohp values of pi o with either fe atom or s atom of fes2 were calculated deringer et al 2011 specifically the icohp value of fe o and s o bonds were calculated to be 4 28 and 0 27 respectively fig 5f indicating that fe site exhibited superior interaction with pi than s site to further reveal the electron transfer from the perspective of orbital interaction the projected density of states pdos of fes2 were calculated dai et al 2021 the valence band near to fermi level mainly consisted of fe 3d orbit rather than s 2p orbit fig 5g the observation demonstrated that the more readily excited electrons existed in fe 3d orbit which could transfer to pi the bader charge analysis revealed that 0 743 electrons would be transferred from fe site to pi while 0 732 electrons was transferred from s site to pi fig 5d the observation further confirmed that fe site more readily to transfer electron to pi relative to s site wang et al 2022a moreover the i o bond length 1 871 å in pi adsorbed on the fe ii site was longer than that on s i site 1 825 å fig s28 clearly i o bond would be relatively easier to be cleaved if pi was adsorbed onto fe ii site rather than on s i site of fes2 comparing with s site the energy of initial state 3 39 ev transition state 3 02 ev and final state 4 96 ev on fe site for pi activation were significantly lower figs 5d and 5h with low energy barrier of only 0 37 ev zhang et al 2021 pi adsorbed on fe site of fes2 could be easily dissociated to generate o and io3 consistent with above results about the reactive radicals generated in fes2 pi system overall pi molecules would be first adsorbed onto the fe site of fes2 surface with sulfur vacancies electron then would be transferred from fe site of fes2 to pi leading to the generation of fe iv and the cleavage of io bond in pi molecules to form o oh then would be formed via the protonation process meanwhile dissolved o2 or 1o2 self decay from pi could also be reduced by fes2 to generate o2 the finally formed fe iii from fe iv would be reduced to fe ii by the reductive sulfur species e g s2 2 and diffusing o2 the regenerated fe ii would further react with pi to produce reactive species thus efficient arb disinfection was achieved in fes2 pi system the schematic illustration of reactive species generation process in fes2 pi system was provided in fig 6 3 4 combination of fes2 pi with sand filtration system to capture and disinfect arb due to its low cost and easy operation sand filtration is one of most commonly used technique to remove pathogen from water freitas et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 however without modification bacteria removal performance of sand filtration system is low zhang et al 2022 moreover sand filtration system could only remove bacteria yet could not inactivate the captured bacteria note that fes2 exhibited positive surface charge at natural ph fig s13 addition of fes2 into sand filtration system shown in fig 7 a might improve the arb capture performance following that pi solution could be injected into fes2 modified sand filtration system to generate reactive species to inactivate the captured arb without addition of fes2 over 94 of arb broke through the quartz sand column fig 7b indicating that bare sand filtration system could only retain small portion of arb from water in contrast via the strong attractive electrostatic interaction complete capture of arb was achieved in sand filtration system with addition of 3 wt of fes2 into sand column fig 7b the observation showed that addition of small percentage of fes2 into sand filtration systems could greatly improve arb capture performance however arb cells captured in fes2 amended sand column were still alive with the viable cell density of 1 106 cfu g sand figs 7c and s29 as indicated by the strong green fluorescence of cells in confocal images figs 7d h to inactivate the viable arb captured in fes2 amended sand filtration system 0 5 mm of pi solution was then injected into the fes2 modified sand filtration system text s5 as stated above the reaction of pi with fes2 in sand filtration system could generate reactive species such as o2 oh and fe iv to disinfect the captured arb after the treatment by pi all captured arb at different segments of sand columns were disinfected below the lod figs 7c and s30 as indicated by the obvious red fluorescence of cells in confocal images fig 7i m the above results clearly showed that fes2 pi system could also combine with sand filtration system to facilitate arb capture and disinfection 4 conclusion this study reported a promising arb disinfection system by using natural mineral pyrite fes2 to activate pi 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb could be disinfected below the lod by fes2 pi system in different water matrix conditions e g ph from 3 to 9 ionic strength from 0 to 300 mm with ha 0 1 10 mg l 1 in suspension as well as in different types of real waters including tap water river water and sewage besides kanamycin resistant e coli fes2 pi system could also efficiently inactivate gentamycin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis cleary fes2 pi system has broad spectrum bacterial disinfection capability during the disinfection process the reactive species e g o2 generated via o2 or 1o2 reduction fe iv and oh could destroy cell membrane and intracellular enzyme defense system subsequently the released eargs from broken cells could also be degraded by fes2 pi system compared with s site pi preferred to be activated on fe site of fes2 with lower adsorption energy more occupancy of bonding state and higher bond strength then the transfer of electron cloud from fe site to pi would lead to the cleavage of io bond and the formation of fe iv and oh moreover eco friendly and low cost fes2 pi system could combine with sand filtration system to efficiently capture and inactivate arb thus fes2 pi system has the potential to disinfect arb in different scenario for the treatment of medical wastewater livestock wastewater fishery water as well as sewage that containing great amount of arb declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15157,the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb greatly endangers the ecological safety and human health this study employed pyrite fes2 naturally abundant mineral for periodate pi activation to disinfect arb fes2 pi system could disinfect 1 107 cfu ml 1 of kanamycin resistant e coli below the limit of detection in 20 min efficient arb inactivation performance was achieved in ph from 3 to 9 ionic strength from 0 to 300 mm with ha 0 1 10 mg l 1 in suspension and in real water samples including tap water river water and sewage fes2 pi system could also efficiently disinfect gentamycin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis the generated reactive species including fe iv o2 and oh would attack cell membrane and overwhelmed intracellular defense system the intracellular kanamycin resistance genes in cells would be released and then degraded in fes2 pi system pi preferred to be adsorbed on fe site of fes2 with lower adsorption energy more occupancy of bonding state and stronger bonding strength the subsequent transfer of electron cloud from fe site to pi would cleave io bond to generate reactive species moreover fes2 pi system could also combine with sand filtration system to efficiently capture and disinfect arb therefore fes2 pi system is a promising approach to inactivate arb in different scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords periodate pyrite antibiotic resistant bacteria real water samples sand filtration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the abuse of antibiotics the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb has become a global problem li et al 2022c pepper et al 2018 the outbreak of covid 19 has been shown to aggravate the proliferation of arb through sewage units in wastewater treatment plants seriously threatening the safety of natural ecology and human health shi et al 2022 wang et al 2022b however traditional disinfection methods employed in wastewater treatment plants such as uv irradiation and chlorination could not completely remove arb he et al 2019 liu et al 2022b therefore it is urgent to develop robust and efficient approaches to eliminate arb in water via generation of reactive species advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton and fenton like reaction could efficiently inactivate arb ahmed et al 2020 2021 zhang et al 2016 inhibiting the spread of arb in aquatic environments however the production of iron sludge and difficulty in transportation of liquid form h2o2 limited the applications of these aops techniques in real treatment processes due to relatively easier transportation and storage aops based on the solid form oxidant of persulfate such as peroxydisulfate pds have attracted increasing attention for eliminating arb duan et al 2022 jin et al 2021 li et al 2022b yu et al 2021 for example by using sulfidated nano zero valent iron to activate pds yu et al 2021 found that kanamycin and tetracycline resistant bacteria could be removed via reactive species such as so4 and oh generated in the reaction system li et al 2022a reported that cuo could catalyze pds to selectively generate cu iii for the effective disinfection of sulfamethoxazole resistant e coli duan et al 2022 recently showed that o2 and so4 produced in soybean straw derived biochar pds system could efficiently inactivate tetracycline resistant bacteria as one of important solid form oxidants periodate pi has recently attracted increasing attention in the field of water treatment due to the generation of various reactive species such as iodate radicals io3 atomic oxygen radical anion o hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical anion o2 upon activation he et al 2022 ling et al 2022 liu et al 2022a long et al 2021 sun et al 2020 zong et al 2021 for example by using reductive hydroxylamine to activate pi at ph 3 2 sun et al 2020 found that oh o2 and 1o2 produced in the reaction system could degrade 4 chlorophenol and inactivate bacteria e coli and s aureus in water zong et al 2021 recently found that fe ii could activate pi to degrade eight different types of emerging organic contaminants at ph 5 via the produced fe iv and oh very recently ling et al 2022 showed that pi could also be activated by sulfide modified zero valent iron to produce reactive species such as io3 o2 1o2 fe iv and oh for sulfadiazine degradation at ph 3 it is expected that arb could also be disinfected by activation of pi however the relevant report is very limited to the best of our knowledge only our very recent study has shown that activation of pi by natural solar light could disinfect model arb through the generated oh and o2 liu et al 2022a however the use of natural solar light to activate pi would be relied on the weather it is imperative to develop relevant technique to activate pi without light irradiation to achieve effective arb disinfection with enriched ferrous iron and sulfur species with low valence zhou et al 2018 pyrite fes2 naturally abundant mineral is expected to be a favorable electron donor to activate pi via electron transfer to produce reactive species to inactivate arb however pi activation by pyrite has not been investigated for the disinfection of arb moreover there is still a lack of in depth exploration on how electrons transfer from the reactive sites e g fe site and s site on fes2 surface to pi which is thus worth investigating in this study naturally abundant mineral pyrite with low cost was employed to activate pi for the disinfection of model arb kanamycin resistant e coli the disinfection performance of fes2 pi system were systematically investigated in different conditions including different fes2 dosage initial viable bacterial concentrations solution ph ionic strength with humic acid ha in suspensions to testify the effects of complex water matrix the disinfection performance of fes2 pi system toward arb was further investigated in different types of real water samples tap water river water and sewage to examine the universality of fes2 pi system the disinfection efficiency of gentamycin resistance e coli and gram positive bacillus subtilis b subtilis was also tested the concentrations of intracellular and extracellular args in fes2 pi system were determined to evaluate the feasibility for args degradation quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr analysis were employed to determine the roles of reactive species in fes2 pi system various characterization combined with density functional theory calculation were employed to reveal the process of electron transfer from the reactive sites of fes2 to broaden its potential application fes2 pi system was combined with sand filtration system to capture and disinfect arb this study not only showed that fes2 pi system could be employed as a promising approach to efficiently disinfect arb but also provided deep insights

this study e coli k 12 mg1655 containing kanamycin resistance gene kanr in the chromosome was chosen as the representative gram negative antibiotic resistant bacteria arb the disinfection performance against another arb gentamicin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis atcc6633 was also testified the detailed protocol about bacterial stock suspensions preparation could be found in text s2 for a typical disinfection experiment 300 mg l 1 of catalyst i e fes2 or other typical metal sulfide was well dispersed in 50 ml of sterilized saline ph 7 15 mm nacl followed by the addition of 0 2 ml bacterial stock suspensions containing about 2 5 109 colony forming units cfu ml viable cells under vigorous stirring subsequently 0 2 ml of pi stock solution 50 mm in ultrapure water was introduced into the system to initiate the reaction with the final concentration of 0 2 mm at given intervals 0 5 ml of reaction suspension would be sampled and then quenched by adding 10 μl of sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 80 mm the density of viable cells was subsequently determined by plate counting method text s2 with limit of detection lod of 10 cfu ml 1 the effects of catalyst dosage initial concentration of arb as well as water matrix e g ph ion strength with humic acid ha major component of natural organic matter in suspensions were systematically investigated details could be found in text s3 moreover the disinfection performance in real water samples including tap water river water as well as sewage were also examined details about real water samples were provided in text s3 the major parameters of real water samples were listed in table s1 all the experiments were performed at least in duplicate the details about the analysis of generated iodine species were provided in texts s4 to testify the potential application of fes2 pi system in different scenarios fes2 pi system was combined with sand filter system to improve arb capture and disinfection details about fes2 pi sand filtration system could be found in text s5 2 3 arb inactivation mechanisms confocal laser scanning microscopy alr si nikon japan and scanning electronic microscope sem merlin zeiss germany were employed to confirm the lysis of arb during the disinfection process the sod activity and the changes of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were evaluated by total superoxide dismutase assay kit s0101 boyotime text s6 and reactive oxygen species assay kit s0033 boyotime respectively text s7 the concentration of released k from the broken cells was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific usa at given intervals the intracellular and extracellular args were determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction q pcr text s8 to determine the potential of fes2 pi system to degrade args the degradation performance of nucleotide bases including cytosine thymine adenine and guanine by fes2 pi system was also investigated and the detailed information was provided in text s9 the reactivation experiments of treated arb were also conducted by the introduction of 100 μl final reaction suspension in different systems into 100 ml of culture media which was cultured for 7 days quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution of different reactive species to arb disinfection in fes2 pi system text s10 electron spin resonance spectrometry esr bruker emx plus was also employed to confirm the reactive species involved in fes2 pi system text s10 to explore the generation of high valent fe species the

analysis i t curves x ray photoelectron spectra were employed to analyze the electron transfer of fes2 during the reaction text s12 dft calculation was employed to reveal the reaction sites and process in fes2 pi system via the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp text s13 3 results and discussion 3 1 arb disinfection performance in fes2 pi system under different conditions universality and reusability of fes2 pi without the presence of fes2 pi 0 2 mm exhibited negligible disinfection performance against model arb kanamycin resistant e coli as indicated by the no obvious change of viable arb density within 25 min with the kobs value of 0 024 0 001 10 2 min 2 figs 1 a and s2 detailed reason for choosing hom model with h 2 to describe disinfection kinetics was provided in text s14 and fig s3 the limited disinfection performance of pi under dark condition has also been reported previously sun et al 2020 solely 300 mg l 1 of fes2 in the absence of any oxidant could only inactivate 0 4 log viable arb with kobs value of 0 076 0 009 10 2 min 2 clearly fes2 alone contained limited arb inactivation performance which was consistent with previous study ahmed et al 2022 moradi et al 2022 interestingly fes2 300 mg l 1 combing with pi 0 2 mm could inactivate 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb below the lod within only 20 min with the kobs value of 1 9 0 1 10 2 min 2 the observation clearly showed that combination of fes2 and pi fes2 pi system could efficiently inactivate arb in water in contrast with the same concentration of oxidants 0 2 mm fes2 pds and fes2 h2o2 systems could only inactivate 2 3 log and 1 0 log of arb with kobs values of 0 46 0 09 10 2 min 1 and 0 19 0 05 10 2 min 2 respectively obviously fes2 pi exhibited superior arb inactivation performance than fes2 pds and fes2 h2o2 systems moreover the arb disinfection performance of fes2 pi kobs value of 1 9 0 1 10 2 min 2 was also higher than those of other metal sulfides pi systems including cu2s pi with kobs of 0 34 0 07 10 2 min 2 mos2 pi with kobs of 0 39 0 04 10 2 min 1 and fes pi with kobs of 0 83 0 09 10 2 min 2 figs 1b and s4 clearly comparing with these other metal sulfides fes2 could activate pi more efficiently note that increasing the dosage of fes2 could increase the reactive sites for pi activation the duration for disinfecting 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb below the lod in fes2 pi disinfection system thus shortened from 20 min to 10 min with increasing the dosage of fes2 from 300 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 fig s5 although decreasing the dosage of fes2 to 100 mg l 1 could decrease the disinfection kinetics yet inactivation of arb with initial concentration of 1 107 cfu ml 1 below the lod could still be achieved within 40 min the duration for complete inactivation of arb in fes2 pi system further shortened to 15 min and 10 min when the initial cell concentration was lowered to 1 106 cfu ml 1 and 1 105 cfu ml 1 respectively fig s6 similar to previous studies ling et al 2022 zong et al 2021 pi was transformed into nontoxic iodate within the reaction duration under the tested experimental condition fig s7 neither toxic hoi fig s8 nor i2 fig s9 was detected in fes2 pi system within experimental duration indicating that iodinated disinfection by products could be hardly generated during the reaction process shin et al 2018 comparing with other aop based disinfection systems fes2 pi systems exhibited great advantages in disinfection efficiency and cost table s2 clearly fes2 pi system is a promising technology for arb disinfection with low cost and high efficiency at a wide range of initial solution ph from 3 to 9 solely fes2 without pi contained limited arb inactivation performance fig s10a except at ph 3 solely pi exhibited negligible disinfection performance against arb at initial solution ph from 5 to 9 fig s10b in contrast fes2 pi system exhibited efficient arb disinfection performance at broad initial solution ph from 3 to 9 figs 1c and s11a specifically viable arb cells with initial concentration of 1 107 cfu ml 1 could be inactivated below the lod within 5 15 20 25 min at initial solution ph of 3 5 7 and 9 respectively the observation indicated that fes2 pi could disinfect arb more efficiently at lower ph conditions although the dissolved oxygen in fes2 pi disinfection system remained unchanged during the reaction process under all examined ph conditions fig s12a the solution ph of reaction system dropped in the first several mins then maintained stable during the disinfection process due to the capture of oh in h2o by fes2 via the ion exchange of s2 2 fig s12b xi et al 2021 xing et al 2018 the decrease of solution ph during the reaction duration in fe based catalysts reaction systems has also been previously reported li et al 2022a wu et al 2020 despite the drop of solution ph the trend of final solution ph was consistent with that of initial solution ph the higher initial solution ph the relatively higher final solution ph previous study has shown that the increased oxidation capability of reactive species at lower ph contributed to the improved disinfection performance kavitha and palanivelu 2005 moreover the more positive zeta potentials of fes2 at lower ph fig s13 could facilitate the attractive interaction between fes2 and arb with negative surface charge leading to the more efficient disinfection by reactive species in fes2 pi system at lower ph liu et al 2020 as a result more effective arb disinfection performance was achieved in fes2 pi system at lower initial ph condition unlike the inhibition of disinfection performance with increasing solution ion strength in some aop processes lado ribeiro et al 2019 yang et al 2014 increasing solution ionic strength nacl from 0 to 300 mm yet did not obviously influence the arb disinfection performance in fes2 pi system p 0 1 figs 1d and s11b the observation also indicated that the presence of chlorine ions as well as increasing its concentrations had negligible effect on the reactivity of fes2 pi system for arb disinfection similar to that without humic acid ha major component of natural organic matter present in water inactivating 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb below the lod could still be achieved within 20 min when ha with concentration of either 0 1 or 1 mg l 1 coexisted in fes2 pi system figs 1e and s11c although the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha in cell suspension slightly inhibited the disinfection performance 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb could be inactivated below the lod within 25 min with the kobs value of 1 2 0 1 10 2 min 2 efficient arb disinfection performance of fes2 pi system was also achieved in real water samples figs 1f and s11d specifically 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb could also be inactivated below the lod within 20 min in tap water river water as well as sewage clearly fes2 pi system exhibited efficient arb inactivation performance in complex water matrix condition as well as in real water samples in addition to kanamycin resistant e coli fes2 pi system could also efficiently inactivate 1 107 cfu ml 1 of gentamycin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis below the lod within 25 min and 30 min respectively figs 2 a and 2b the observation suggested the universality of fes2 pi disinfection system the reuse experiments showed that disinfection of 1 107 cfu ml 1 kanamycin resistant e coli below the lod could be obtained within 40 min even in the fifth cycle fig 2c obviously fes2 pi system could be repeatedly used unlike the obvious fe leaching reached 2 5 mg l 1 in fes2 alone system in the absence of pi at initial solution ph 7 no fe leaching was detected in fes2 pi system within 25 min at initial solution ph 7 fig s14 clearly the presence of pi could efficiently suppress fe leaching similar observation has also been reported previously long et al 2021 zong et al 2022 the weak steric hindrance effect of pi could facilitate the enhanced adsorption of pi on fes2 as well as the interaction between pi and fes2 zong et al 2022 consequently fe leaching was inhibited by pi the unchanged characteristic peaks for fes2 in xrd patterns after use fig 2d further suggested the stability of fes2 in fes2 pi system leading to its excellent reusability 3 2 disinfection mechanisms of arb reactive species generated in fes2 pi system would attack bacterial envelope changing the permeability of cell membrane and leading to the leakage of intracellular contents in arb jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 confocal images showed that prior to the disinfection process viable arb exhibited strong green fluorescence fig s15a the observation suggested that cell membrane of arb was intact before disinfection reaction which was also confirmed by the sem image of arb prior to the inactivation reaction fig 3 a after disinfection treatment for 5 min the numbers of dead cells with red fluorescence greatly increased fig s15b consistently the morphology of cells gradually became unregular with the presence of pores in cell membranes fig 3b after disinfection for 20 min all arb cells exhibited red fluorescence fig s15c suggested that all cells were completely inactivated the disinfected cells were concave with the severely damaged cell membrane fig 3c due to the destruction of cell membrane in fes2 pi system k in arb gradually released with the increase of disinfection duration and the final concentration reached 330 μg l 1 in the reaction suspension after 20 min reaction fig s16 the cell lesions mechanism induced by reactive species generated in fes2 pi system during the disinfection process were further investigated unlike the no obvious decrease of sod activity in fes2 alone system without pi or pi alone system without fes2 the sod activity in fes2 pi system decreased from 0 29 u ml 1 to 0 11 u ml 1 with the increasing reaction duration fig 3d the observation indicated that reactive species might induce oxidative stress and finally overwhelmed the defense system leading to the decrease of sod activity wang et al 2020 after disinfection for 1 min intracellular ros was found to be accumulated with the intensity of 3 78 fig 3e since the lysis of bacteria would lead to the dispersion of intracellular ros into solution li et al 2020 intracellular ros thus gradually decreased with the increase of disinfection duration from 1 min to 20 min note that the damage of cell membrane in fes2 pi system would release intracellular antibiotic resistance genes iargs into solution ahmed et al 2022 li et al 2020 meanwhile intracellular ros could also degrade portion of iargs thus the concentration of iargs decreased from 2 61 107 copies ml 1 to 0 35 107 copies ml 1 during the 20 min disinfection process fig 3f prolonged the reaction to 30 min could further decrease the concentration of iargs to 0 19 107 copies ml 1 the fast release of iargs into reaction solution lead to the gradual increase of extracellular args eargs in the first 10 min disinfection process subsequently the continuously generated reactive species in fes2 pi system would attack eargs liu et al 2022c yuan et al 2020 leading to the decrease of eargs concentration after disinfection for 30 min as a result the total args concentration decreased obviously with increasing reaction duration moreover great amounts of four nucleotide bases including cytosine thymine adenine and guanine with concentration of 1 μm could also be removed in fes2 pi system within 15 min fig s17 the observation indicated that reactive species produced in fes2 pi system could oxidize four tested nucleotide bases into small molecules clearly fes2 pi system also had the potential to degrade args released from arb the environmental risks of args thus could be reduced unlike the regrowth of arb observed in fes2 alone system without pi or pi alone system without fes2 arb inactivated by fes2 pi system could be hardly reactivated due to the destruction of cell membrane and intracellular defense system fig 3g wang et al 2021a specifically no obvious increase of od600 for culture media was observed during 7 day cultivation after inactivation in fes2 pi system while od600 either in solely fes2 system or pi system increased after 1 day cultivation the observation clearly showed that fes2 pi system could completely inactivate arb and inhibited their regrowth arb disinfection kinetics slightly decreased with addition of sod enzyme the scavenger of o2 into fes2 pi reaction suspension figs 4 a and s18 the slight reduction of kobs value from 1 9 0 1 10 2 min 2 without scavenger to 1 2 0 1 10 2 min 2 with addition of sod enzyme p 0 005 indicated that o2 had contribution to the arb disinfection process similar to the solely fes2 system esr analysis also showed the generation of o2 radicals in fes2 pi system fig 4b the intensity of tempol the probe for the detection of electron in esr spectra dramatically decreased when fes2 was added into suspension fig 4c indicating that fes2 could directly provide hydrated electrons eq s3 the capture of electrons by tempol was further confirmed by the product detection after attacked by electron the reduction product hydrogenated tempol m z 174 14775 rt 3 37 min esi was gradually generated with the increasing reaction time figs s19 and s20 purging o2 into reaction system could enhance the disinfection performance increased kobs value to 3 2 0 9 10 2 min 2 p 0 01 while n2 purging slightly decreased the disinfection kinetics decreased kobs value to 1 1 0 1 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 fig s21 the above observation clearly indicated that o2 was mainly generated via the reduction of dissolved o2 by hydrated electrons provided by fes2 eq s4 when h2o was substituted by 50 d2o the kobs value obviously increased to 7 2 1 3 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 suggesting that 1o2 also played a role in the catalytic disinfection process due to the self decay of pi eq s5 bokare and choi 2015 three typical peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 corresponding to 1o2 could be observed in the esr spectra of pi alone system fig 4d the peak intensities yet gradually decreased with increasing fes2 dosage that added into pi suspension which indicated that 1o2 might be consumed by fes2 to generate o2 an et al 2022 the prolonged lifetime of 1o2 in 50 d2o in fes2 pi system might enhance the interaction between 1o2 and fes2 to produce the reactive o2 for arb disinfection eq s6 the enhanced disinfection performance thus was achieved when water was replaced with 50 d2o the introduction of ipa the scavenger of oh into the reaction system significantly decreased the disinfection performance with the kobs value of 0 072 0 009 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 indicating that oh had significant contribution to the arb disinfection process unlike the absence of obvious peak in the esr spectra of solely fes2 system or pi alone system the typical characteristic peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to oh were present in the esr spectra of fes2 pi system fig 4e obviously oh was generated in fes2 pi system the generation of oh in fes2 pi system was further confirmed by the presence of fluorescence intensities of oh signals with using ta as a chemical probe fig s22 in contrast the introduction of phenol the scavenger of io3 did not affect the disinfection kinetics p 0 1 indicating io3 had negligible contribution to the arb disinfection clearly electrons generated by fes2 could reduce pi via cleavage of i o bond io3 and o thus were generated eq s7 via the protonation of o in h2o oh radical was subsequently generated eq s8 the introduction of dmso the scavenger of fe iv inhibited the disinfection kinetics with kobs value of 0 54 0 05 10 2 min 2 p 0 005 suggesting that fe iv contributed to the disinfection process previous studies reported that since pmso could be oxidized to pmso2 by fe iv pmso thus could be used as an indicator to detect fe iv zong et al 2021 2022 no obvious pmso2 was generated within 25 min in pi alone system yet around 5 μm of pmso2 was gradually generated within 25 min in fes2 pi system fig 4f the observation indicated that fe iv was present in fes2 pi system when water was replaced by h2 18o the 18o 16o isotope shift during the oxidation of pmso in h2 18o led to the generation of 18o labeled pmso2 pms16o18o with m z of 156 95 in fes2 pi system fig s23 the observation further confirmed the presence of fe iv in fes2 pi system via eq s9 the above results indicated that o2 oh and fe iv contributed to the disinfection of arb in fes2 pi system generally o2 and oh radicals broad spectrum oxidants with high reactivity would indiscriminately attack the cell membrane of arb richards et al 2021 wang et al 2021b meanwhile fe iv could selectively oxidize electron rich moieties such as amino acids with amino groups and monosaccharide with hydroxyl groups in cell membrane of arb dong et al 2020 working together these multiple reactive species generated in fes2 pi system could efficiently attack cell membrane of arb leading to the disinfection of arb 3 3 electron transfer process in disinfection system the mixture of fes2 supernatant and agno3 exhibited a wide adsorption curve indicating the formation of ag s complexation fig s24 xing et al 2018 clearly due to the release of unsaturated s atoms from the edges of fes2 sulfur species including s2 2 and s2 derived from the disproportion of s2 2 were present in fes2 supernatant xi et al 2021 via ion exchange of s2 2 fes2 could capture oh in h2o leading to the decreased ph value 5 01 of the fes2 suspension fig s25 due to the presence of limited amount of unsaturated s atoms at the edges of fes2 the ph value of fes2 suspension gradually increased to near neutral with increasing the washing times of fes2 particles by ultrapure water the decrease of sulfur species percentage on the surface of fes2 from 83 8 prior to disinfection experiment to 78 4 after the disinfection reaction table s3 further confirmed the release of sulfur species from the surface of fes2 particles the removal of unsaturated s atoms from fes2 surface could lead to the exposure of reactive fe sites which would provide hydrated electrons for the following disinfection process fig 4b liu et al 2018 no obvious peak was present in the raman spectra of solely pi solution while three characteristic peaks at 341 377 427 cm 1 corresponding to e1g a1g and t1g modes respectively were observed for fes2 fig 5 a similar observations have also been reported previously kment et al 2014 comparing with fes2 ia ie of 1 43 the peak intensity of a1g mode obviously decreased with smaller ia ie 1 30 in fes2 pi system the observation indicated the generation of sulfur vacancies on the surface of fes2 in fes2 pi system dong et al 2018 meanwhile the three characteristic peaks of fes2 in fes2 pi system were blue shifted by 2 cm 1 indicating that the energy of photons scattered by fes2 with the presence of pi was higher than that in fes2 alone system the observation suggested the transfer of electron clouds from the surface of fes2 to pi molecule dong et al 2021 the lower current of i t curve in fes2 electrode system with pi in suspension 9 6 10 7 a relative to that in blank electrode system without fes2 with pi in suspension 4 2 10 7 a fig 5b further confirmed electrons transfer from fes2 electrode to pi he et al 2022 the addition of arb into fes2 electrode system with pi in suspension did not obviously change i t curve which suggested that the electrons transfer process from fes2 electrode to pi was not influenced by arb clearly instead of directly attacking arb electrons provided by fes2 particles yet would activate pi to generate reactive species such as fe iv oh and o2 radicals to disinfect arb during the activation process of pi by fes2 particles fe iv would be generated eq s9 which would be quickly transformed into fe iii eq s10 however the generated fe iii would be subsequently reduced back to fe ii by diffusing o2 and reductive s species e g s2 2 eqs s11 and s12 due to the lower standard redox potentials of s s2 2 0 48 v and o2 o2 0 33 v than that of fe3 fe2 0 77 v yang et al 2022 as stated above the proportion of sulfur element on fes2 surface obviously decreased after the disinfection experiment table s3 while no obvious peak for s0 could be observed in the xrd pattern of used fes2 fig 2d xi et al 2021 these results suggested that the released s2 2 would be finally oxidized into soluble sulfur species e g so4 2 rather than insoluble s0 that would deposit onto the surface of fes2 in fes2 pi system eq s13 yang et al 2022 meanwhile the slight increase of fe iii peak area 6 in high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p of fes2 after the disinfection experiment fig 5c also indicated that only small amount of fe iii was eventually generated on the surface of fes2 during the reaction duration the regenerated fe ii from fe iii would further react with pi to produce reactive species to disinfect arb thus efficient arb disinfection performance was achieved in fes2 pi system xrd and tem analysis of fes2 indicated that 100 plane was the main exposed plane of fes2 text s16 and figs s26 s27 thus dft calculation was conducted on the 100 plane of fes2 surface to reveal the reactive sites on fes2 particles to activate pi specifically the adsorption energy between pi molecule and fe ii site was determined to be 3 39 ev which was negatively higher than that between pi and s i site 1 79 ev figs 5d and s28 the observation indicated instead of s i site pi molecule preferred to be adsorbed onto the fe ii site of fes2 crystal orbital hamilton population cohp calculation was employed to further analyze the interaction between pi and fe site or s site on fes2 fig 5e deringer et al 2011 wang et al 2022a specifically the purple area right side and pink area left side corresponded to the contributions of bonding and antibonding respectively comparing with s site the occupancy of bonding state of fes2 pi in fe site increased suggesting the enhanced interaction between pi and fes2 on fe site to quantitatively determine the bond strength the integrated cohp icohp values of pi o with either fe atom or s atom of fes2 were calculated deringer et al 2011 specifically the icohp value of fe o and s o bonds were calculated to be 4 28 and 0 27 respectively fig 5f indicating that fe site exhibited superior interaction with pi than s site to further reveal the electron transfer from the perspective of orbital interaction the projected density of states pdos of fes2 were calculated dai et al 2021 the valence band near to fermi level mainly consisted of fe 3d orbit rather than s 2p orbit fig 5g the observation demonstrated that the more readily excited electrons existed in fe 3d orbit which could transfer to pi the bader charge analysis revealed that 0 743 electrons would be transferred from fe site to pi while 0 732 electrons was transferred from s site to pi fig 5d the observation further confirmed that fe site more readily to transfer electron to pi relative to s site wang et al 2022a moreover the i o bond length 1 871 å in pi adsorbed on the fe ii site was longer than that on s i site 1 825 å fig s28 clearly i o bond would be relatively easier to be cleaved if pi was adsorbed onto fe ii site rather than on s i site of fes2 comparing with s site the energy of initial state 3 39 ev transition state 3 02 ev and final state 4 96 ev on fe site for pi activation were significantly lower figs 5d and 5h with low energy barrier of only 0 37 ev zhang et al 2021 pi adsorbed on fe site of fes2 could be easily dissociated to generate o and io3 consistent with above results about the reactive radicals generated in fes2 pi system overall pi molecules would be first adsorbed onto the fe site of fes2 surface with sulfur vacancies electron then would be transferred from fe site of fes2 to pi leading to the generation of fe iv and the cleavage of io bond in pi molecules to form o oh then would be formed via the protonation process meanwhile dissolved o2 or 1o2 self decay from pi could also be reduced by fes2 to generate o2 the finally formed fe iii from fe iv would be reduced to fe ii by the reductive sulfur species e g s2 2 and diffusing o2 the regenerated fe ii would further react with pi to produce reactive species thus efficient arb disinfection was achieved in fes2 pi system the schematic illustration of reactive species generation process in fes2 pi system was provided in fig 6 3 4 combination of fes2 pi with sand filtration system to capture and disinfect arb due to its low cost and easy operation sand filtration is one of most commonly used technique to remove pathogen from water freitas et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 however without modification bacteria removal performance of sand filtration system is low zhang et al 2022 moreover sand filtration system could only remove bacteria yet could not inactivate the captured bacteria note that fes2 exhibited positive surface charge at natural ph fig s13 addition of fes2 into sand filtration system shown in fig 7 a might improve the arb capture performance following that pi solution could be injected into fes2 modified sand filtration system to generate reactive species to inactivate the captured arb without addition of fes2 over 94 of arb broke through the quartz sand column fig 7b indicating that bare sand filtration system could only retain small portion of arb from water in contrast via the strong attractive electrostatic interaction complete capture of arb was achieved in sand filtration system with addition of 3 wt of fes2 into sand column fig 7b the observation showed that addition of small percentage of fes2 into sand filtration systems could greatly improve arb capture performance however arb cells captured in fes2 amended sand column were still alive with the viable cell density of 1 106 cfu g sand figs 7c and s29 as indicated by the strong green fluorescence of cells in confocal images figs 7d h to inactivate the viable arb captured in fes2 amended sand filtration system 0 5 mm of pi solution was then injected into the fes2 modified sand filtration system text s5 as stated above the reaction of pi with fes2 in sand filtration system could generate reactive species such as o2 oh and fe iv to disinfect the captured arb after the treatment by pi all captured arb at different segments of sand columns were disinfected below the lod figs 7c and s30 as indicated by the obvious red fluorescence of cells in confocal images fig 7i m the above results clearly showed that fes2 pi system could also combine with sand filtration system to facilitate arb capture and disinfection 4 conclusion this study reported a promising arb disinfection system by using natural mineral pyrite fes2 to activate pi 1 107 cfu ml 1 of arb could be disinfected below the lod by fes2 pi system in different water matrix conditions e g ph from 3 to 9 ionic strength from 0 to 300 mm with ha 0 1 10 mg l 1 in suspension as well as in different types of real waters including tap water river water and sewage besides kanamycin resistant e coli fes2 pi system could also efficiently inactivate gentamycin resistant e coli and gram positive b subtilis cleary fes2 pi system has broad spectrum bacterial disinfection capability during the disinfection process the reactive species e g o2 generated via o2 or 1o2 reduction fe iv and oh could destroy cell membrane and intracellular enzyme defense system subsequently the released eargs from broken cells could also be degraded by fes2 pi system compared with s site pi preferred to be activated on fe site of fes2 with lower adsorption energy more occupancy of bonding state and higher bond strength then the transfer of electron cloud from fe site to pi would lead to the cleavage of io bond and the formation of fe iv and oh moreover eco friendly and low cost fes2 pi system could combine with sand filtration system to efficiently capture and inactivate arb thus fes2 pi system has the potential to disinfect arb in different scenario for the treatment of medical wastewater livestock wastewater fishery water as well as sewage that containing great amount of arb declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15158,a state of the art wide scope target screening of 2 362 chemicals and their transformation products tps was performed in samples collected within the joint danube survey 4 jds4 performed in 2019 the analysed contaminants of emerging concern cecs included three major categories plant protection products ppps industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in total 586 cecs were detected in the samples including 158 ppps 71 industrial chemicals 348 ppcps and 9 other chemicals a wide variety of sample matrices were collected including influent and effluent wastewater groundwater river water sediment and biota forty five cecs 19 ppps 8 industrial chemicals 18 ppcps were detected at levels above their ecotoxicological thresholds lowest predicted no effect concentration pnec values in one or more of the investigated environmental compartments indicating potential adverse effects on the impacted ecosystems among them 12 are legacy substances 33 are emerging and qualify as potential danube river basin specific pollutants rbsps moreover the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps was evaluated using 20 selected performance indicator chemicals wwtps showed effective removal removal rate 80 and medium removal removal rate 25 80 for 6 and 8 of the indicator chemicals respectively however numerous contaminants passed the wwtps with a lower removal rate further investigation on performance of wwtps is suggested at catchment level to improve their removal efficiency wwtp effluents are proven to be one of the major sources of contaminants in the danube river basin drb other sources include sewage discharges industrial and agricultural activities continuous monitoring of the detected cecs is suggested to ensure water quality of the studied area graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic pollutants danube river basin wastewater treatment plants target screening environmental risk assessment data availability data was included as supplementary material 1 introduction being the second largest catchment region in europe the danube river basin drb serves over 80 million people by providing drinking water industrial and agricultural water supply hydroelectric power generation tourism and fisheries among others alygizakis et al 2019 anthropogenic activities constantly introduce contaminants of emerging concern cecs into the drb such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps from domestic wastewater skrbic et al 2018 and plant protection products ppps from agricultural activities gasparotti 2014 industrial production could introduce industrial chemicals and ppcps to the environment all these chemicals are released to various environmental compartments at alarming levels across the globe thompson and darwish 2019 it is therefore essential to monitor the water quality of the drb the joint danube survey jds was conducted in 2001 2007 2013 and 2019 to collect data for water quality evaluation on the drb and its major tributaries the present study outlines some chemical findings from the joint danube survey 4 jds4 performed in 2019 ppps industrial chemicals and ppcps were selected for this study as these compounds could pose threats to the ecosystems and human via bioaccumulation or mobility depending on their physico chemical properties some of them tend to bioaccumulate in living organisms and could reach human and various organisms via the food chain al farsi et al 2017 kalyabina et al 2021 some ppps and industrial chemicals such as certain per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass could cause adverse reproductive and developmental effects in mammals and vertebrates blake and fenton 2020 and pesticides could reduce biodiversity by adversely affecting survival and reproduction of non target species geiger et al 2010 in addition some studied contaminants have mobile properties and could end up in groundwaters used for production of drinking water kampouris et al 2022 wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent plays a key role in chemical pollution including ppcps industrial chemicals and ppps of surface waters used as drinking water sources troger et al 2020 some ppcps are included in the eu watch list commission implementing decision 2022 however the regular monitoring of most ppcps is not requested by the current eu legislations despite their ubiquitous presence comprehensive occurrence data are required to support the future regulatory monitoring at the eu and basin scale the selected cecs are constantly emitted from various sources including anthropogenic activities and wwtp effluent discharge muller et al 2002 some cecs were found to pass the wwtps unaltered partially or fully and are being continuously introduced into the drb alygizakis et al 2019 wwtp effluents have been proven to be a major point source of ppcps in the aquatic ecosystems ebele et al 2017 some cecs found in effluent wastewater are persistent and barely undergo transformation in wwtps such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos thompson et al 2022 these substances from wwtps could also biomagnify in the food chain or enter groundwaters regarding their mobility aristi et al 2015 zhen et al 2018 it is therefore essential to evaluate the removal efficiency of wwtps and characterize the cecs emitted by the plants many reference laboratories collaborated to identify a wide spectrum of cecs in the drb this study reports the findings of four analytical laboratories the environmental institute ei slovakia the bavarian environmental agency lfu germany the joint research centre jrc italy and the university of athens uoa greece the laboratories are equipped with analytical methods and state of the art analytical instrumentation to perform multi residue target screening of the 2 362 analytes of interest full list available in the supplementary material chemical screening involved both legacy compounds and emerging contaminants the aims of this study were to 1 address the fate of a broad range of cecs and their tps in the drb 2 identify cecs that are emitted by the wwtps in the drb 3 evaluate the

chemical occurrence data 2022 when a contaminant was detected above its lod and below its loq the loq 2 value would be considered as the detected concentration level for reporting purposes as suggested by directive 2009 90 ec the commission of the european communities t 2009 2 2 sample preparation and instrumental analysis some compounds among the studied cecs were analyzed by more than one laboratory as shown in the screened compounds tab of the supplementary material for compounds detected by multiple laboratories the result was selected in the order of a the laboratory accredited for the analysis of the substance b the laboratory which performed the analysis of the substance with internal standard c the highest measured concentration a group of 69 polar and hydrophobic compounds was analyzed by the jrc including water framework directive wfd priority substances watch list compounds and danube river basin specific pollutants rbsps identified within jds3 brack 2019 liška et al 2015 a large volume solid phase extraction lvspe device mariani box mariani et al 2017 was adopted to obtain and extract effluent wastewater river water and groundwater samples the samples were filtered 7 l for groundwater 5 l for river water and 0 5 l for wastewater and spiked with a mix of stable isotope labelled internal standards subsequently solid phase extraction spe j2 scientific was performed on an atlantic hlb h spe disk horizont technology mounted in the mariani box prior to analysis the extracts were evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream details of the extraction process can be found elsewhere mariani et al 2020 gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry gc hrms dfs thermo and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms qtrap 5500 sciex were utilized for the determination of non polar and polar compounds respectively mariani et al 2017 a group of 141 pesticides and their tps was analyzed by lfu river water and groundwater samples underwent an on line spe using c18 material combined with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms qexactive thermo a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column agilent with dimensions 3 5 µm 2 1 150 mm was used details of the analytical method are included in the lc hrms method tab of the supplementary material a group of 2 290 cecs and their tps was analyzed in wastewater river water and groundwater samples samples were extracted in the laboratory of the ei following an automated extraction program alygizakis et al 2020 samples underwent spe with a horizon spe dex 4790 device usa then concentrated on atlantic hlb m disk with 47 mm disk holder the extracts were evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 50 50 methanol water 500 ul total volume extract samples extracts were shipped to the uoa for further analysis the treatment and extraction of sediment samples following a validated protocol gago ferrero et al 2015 treatment and extraction of biota samples using a multi residue optimized method for fish tissues dasenaki and thomaidis 2015 were both performed at the uoa two complementary instrumental methods were used for the screening of targeted cecs and their tps in the samples extracts extracted samples were analyzed for targeted compounds by an in house uhplc esi qtof method gago ferrero et al 2020 of which full scan ms and ms ms acquisition were adopted dionex ultimate 3000 rslc thermo fisher scientific coupled to a maxis impact qtof bruker was utilized for the analysis moreover a highly sensitive lc ms ms method using multiple reaction monitoring scan mode was utilized for the determination of 158 commonly consumed pharmaceuticals antibiotics illicit drugs drugs of abuse and their tps at trace levels alygizakis et al 2016 the specific and more sensitive lc ms ms method was used to detect specific contaminants occurring at low concentration levels the high resolution mass spectrometry analytical method is less sensitive but provides information for a broad range of contaminants 2 3 quality assurance and quality control a thorough quality assurance and quality control qa qc program was applied in the sample preparation procedures and instrumental analysis methods prior to extraction a mix of internal standards was added into each sample the generic sample preparation protocols that were used assure satisfactory recovery typically above 60 for the majority of the targeted compounds moreover six additional blank samples were used for quality control the blank samples were prepared and examined together with the samples this process checks for any external contamination which could be introduced during the sampling campaign sample preparation of the extracts and analytical procedures the field blank samples were milliq water brought to the field and extracted at the laboratory together with the real samples the signals observed in blank samples were subtracted from the signals observed in real samples the qa qc program and logistic planning of the sampling process are thoroughly described in the jds4 scientific report liška et al 2021 a collaborative trial on the three screening methods applied by jrc lfu and uoa was performed the performance of the methods on all 10 compounds commonly analyzed by the laboratories acetamiprid atrazine desethylterbutylazine dimethenamid imidacloprid metazachlor metolachlor simazine tebuconazole terbutryn was compared in terms of limits of quantification loqs detection frequencies and consistency with each other as shown in the comparison of methods tab of the supplementary material in general the jrc method showed better sensitivity as compared to the spe based screening methods as more concentrated extracts were analyzed difference in loqs for over an order of magnitude for some compounds atrazine imidacloprid metolachlor etc was observed thus higher sensitivity resulted in higher number of detections by the jrc method nonetheless determined concentrations of the 10 compounds by all methods showed a good agreement in most cases within a factor of 3 2 4 evaluation on removal efficiency of wwtps using indicator substances for the systematic assessment on the performance of wwtps in the wastewater abatement process a set of 20 compounds was selected as performance indicators based on the following criteria 1 are of high consumption and regularly found in wwtp influents 2 occur in most effluent of wwtps at detectable levels 3 are easily and routinely measured by as few as possible analytical methods optimally one method 4 cover a broad range of physico chemical properties and biodegradability which affects their removal rate at various treatment processes 5 undergo a similar degree of abatement in advanced treatment technologies e g ozonation or sorption to activated carbon ac and 6 are representative of a broad range of treatability features from biodegradable during conventional activated sludge treatment or biofiltration to not degradable during conventional activated sludge treatment or biofiltration but amenable to chemical oxidation or sorption to ac and not degradable during conventional activated sludge treatment or biofiltration and not amenable to chemical oxidation or sorption to ac the 20 compounds and their abatement rate are included in fig 2 the efficiency of wwtps was evaluated by its removal rate of the 20 performance indicators it should be noted that efficient removal of wwtp relates to a reduction in the concentration of a contaminant by 80 or above instead of complete removal of the substance this follows the waters protection ordinance of the swiss federal council which included 80 abatement as the target for the reduction of cecs in wwtp the swiss federal council 2018 2 5 risk assessment to assess the risk of the detected substances the concentrations of the contaminants were evaluated in relation to the respective predicted no effect concentration pnec values the occurrence of cecs with detected levels above pnec were considered to represent a potential risk for the impacted ecosystem pnec values for all detected substances were extracted from the norman ecotoxicology database norman norman ecotoxicology database 2023 a part of the norman database system dulio 2020 for compounds where no experimental toxicity data was available pnecs were derived by qsar models aalizadeh et al 2017 for risk assessment purposes the lowest pnec was selected in the order of a environmental quality standard eqs values b experimental pnec values from reference laboratories c in silico predicted pnec steroids in biota were considered as naturally occurring compounds and were not considered for the risk assessment 3 results and discussion category contributor norman id lod loq pnec at various studied matrix matrix specific frequency of appearance foa of minimum and maximum detected concentrations for the 586 detected cecs are included in the detected compounds tab of the supplementary material among them are 158 ppps 71 industrial chemicals 348 ppcps and 9 other chemicals sections 3 1 3 5 include the discussion of results by environmental matrix sections 3 6 and 3 7 include the discussion of cecs of concern by the distribution across environmental matrices 3 6 or by environmental risk assessment 3 7 3 1 river water in total 142 ppcps and their tps were detected in jds4 river water samples caffeine metformin sulfamethoxazole sucralose clarithromycin 19 norandrosterone carbamazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxy were detected in all 51 river water samples 100 foa meanwhile 59 ppcps 42 showed 10 foa most of the ppcps were detected at levels up to tens of ng l 1 exceptions include 19 norandrosterone with maximum concentration of 1171 ng l 1 highest among determined ppcps attention was drawn to six detected ppcps that were listed in the eu watch list eu 2022 1307 commission implementing decision 2022 including amoxicillin ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim venlafaxine and fluconazole the 6 legacy substances occur at low concentration levels and no pnec exceedance was observed nonetheless high foa 84 and 100 were observed for amoxicillin and sulfamethoxazole and therefore further emission should be strictly controlled among the 40 industrial chemicals determined in river water samples high foa was also observed in river water for six pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa foa 100 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos foa 96 1 perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa foa 94 1 perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs foa 90 2 perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs foa 86 3 and perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa foa 56 9 they were generally detected at low average concentration levels ranged from 0 6 ng l 1 pfbs to 3 2 ng l 1 pfhxa nevertheless their ubiquitous presence in river water is of concern as some of them possess a high bioaccumulation potential haukas et al 2007 wwtp effluent discharge was found to be a common point source of pfass as a result of inefficient removal of pfass at wwtps phong vo et al 2020 another important sub class of industrial chemicals detected was phenols including 2 4 dinitrophenol foa 100 average concentration 3 6 ng l 1 and 4 tert octylphenol 4 t op foa 88 2 average concentration 55 2 ng l 1 the latter one is a priority substance under the wfd echa substance infocard 4 1 1 3 3 tetramethylbutyl phenol 2021 four novel bisphenol a bpa related compounds were also detected bisphenol a diglycidyl ether bisphenol a 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl glycidyl ether bisphenol a 2 3 dihydroxypropyl glycidyl ether and bisphenol a bis 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl ether these bpa related compounds were detected only in the upper danube germany austria and slovakia at levels up to 535 8 ng l 1 bpa bis 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl ether in jds4 4 germany which indicates the presence of contamination sources of bpa in the upper danube this could be a warning signal as bpa is well known for its toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in living organisms michalowicz 2014 and bpa analogues could cause endocrine effects in aquatic species liu et al 2021 these compounds are of regulatory interest especially the prioritized phenols and bpa related compounds shown in section 3 7 among the 119 ppps detected in river water samples 28 showed high foa 80 majority of the determined ppp concentrations were below 10 ng l 1 there were exceptions including metolachlor and its tp metolachlor esa both compounds showed 100 foa with average concentrations of 24 and 42 ng l 1 respectively carbendazim was detected with a foa of 92 and an average concentration of 151 ng l 1 which has been banned in the eu since 2019 european commission commission implementing decision eu 2019 with exception on some biocidal products european commission commission implementing decision eu 2021 3 2 groundwater gw in total 124 of the 2362 targeted compounds were detected in the seven gw samples the results from each gw sample were compared with the results from the closest river water sample 1 41 km apart from the gw site to identify potential source of contaminants half of the detections were attributed to a monitoring pair a gw sample and the corresponding river water sample of highest proximity the detected compounds were mainly ppcps ppps and industrial chemicals such common presence of the detected cecs suggests river water as a potential contamination source which is commonly observed for compounds of high mobility see section 3 6 for the other sites and compounds local or regional activities could be the source of contamination the identification of contamination source is important for pollution control of gw of the drb in sum 48 ppps and their tps were determined in the seven gw samples the highest cumulative concentration of ppps was observed at the gw site in romania 140 ng l 1 the highest individual ppp concentration was observed at the same site for metolachlor esa 38 ng l 1 no exceedance of the quality standards under the eu groundwater directive was observed 100 ng l 1 and 500 ng l 1 for individual and total concentrations of pesticide substances and relevant metabolites respectively european parliament directive 2006 the same parametric values were listed under the eu drinking water directive as maximum permissible values the council of the european union e 1998 however further pollution should be strictly controlled a total of 48 ppcps were detected in the studied gw sites the highest cumulative concentration was observed at the gw site in croatia 650 ng l 1 the site also showed the highest individual ppcp concentration of 520 ng l 1 for the antiepileptics vigabatrin this is above the group total quality standard for pharmaceuticals of 500 ng l 1 as suggested in annex i of groundwater directive 2006 118 ec which is under discussion to bring the quality standard to a lower concentration scientific committee on health 2022 no exceedance of the quality standard was observed in other gw sites seven antibiotics were detected in the gw samples with up to 3 antibiotics bulgarian gw site in each sample the highest cumulative concentration of antibiotics was observed at the hungarian gw site 25 ng l 1 the site also showed the highest individual antibiotic concentration of 23 ng l 1 for sulfamethoxazole which is listed in the eu watch list eu 2022 1307 commission implementing decision 2022 nonetheless the detected concentration is well below the groundwater quality standard of 100 ng l 1 scientific committee on health 2022 in total 28 industrial chemicals were determined in the seven gw sites including phosphate flame retardants pfass benzotriazoles and benzothiazoles phenolic substances and other industrial chemicals the number of industrial chemicals observed per gw site ranges from 4 to 13 and the cumulative concentration per gw site ranges from 320 to 720 ng l 1 four pfass were each determined in gw samples at low concentrations ranging between 0 5 and 18 ng l 1 including pfos 3 gw sites pfhxa 4 gw sites pfoa and pfbus 5 gw sites each no exceedance of the quality standards proposed by eu drinking water directive was observed in the seven gw sites 100 ng l 1 for the sum of a list of selected 20 pfass and 500 ng l 1 for total pfas level european parliament directive eu 2020 it should be noted that bisphenol a was determined at all seven gw sites at concentration between 93 gw site in croatia and 159 ng l 1 gw site in romania which is well above the quality standard for bisphenol a of 10 ng l 1 that is under discussion for inclusion in the eu drinking water directive european parliament directive eu 2020 bisphenol a was not detected in river water samples which indicates other contamination sources to the gw in the drb this finding is alarming and is indicative of regulatory monitoring of these industrial chemicals in gw of the drb some of the detected cecs could act as endocrine disruptors by interfering with the hormone systems such as bisphenol a and pfoa liu et al 2021 chaparro ortega et al 2018 the occurrence of such compounds despite the levels below respective quality standards or permissible values is of concern as they could reach human via drinking water produced from gw and accumulate in human body moreover the presence of the 7 antibiotics in the gw of drb is also of concern as the continuous human exposure of antibiotics could introduce antibiotic resistance and potentially public health issues kampouris et al 2022 the investigation on the emission source of such compounds is essential to maintain the quality of gw of the drb which provides drinking water to millions of people alygizakis et al 2019 3 3 river sediments overall 31 ppcps and their tps were detected in the four analyzed samples antibiotics was the most frequently detected class of compounds 10 followed by antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs 7 clinical waste from hospitals is therefore worth investigating as a potential contamination source of such ppcps most of the detected ppcps were determined at levels up to tens of μg kg 1 dry weight the most abundant ppcps found were apophedrin maximum concentration of 213 μg kg 1 in jds4 6 germany the uv filter octocrylene maximum concentration of 162 μg kg 1 in jds4 47 bulgaria and the antibiotic sulfadiazine maximum concentration of 120 μg kg 1 in jds4 47 bulgaria eight out of the 31 ppcps and tps were detected in all four sediments samples foa 100 including triethylcitrate amisulpride citalopram bisoprolol apophedrin methocarbamol and galaxolidone most ppcps could have entered river sediment from the aquatic environment via the process of sedimentation after adsorption to suspended particulate matter vieno et al 2005 in total 19 industrial chemicals were detected in the sediment samples surfactants was the dominant category of industrial chemicals found in river sediments n 12 diglyme benzododecinium didecyldimethylammonium and triglyme with foa of 100 and lauryldiethanolamide tetraethyleneglycol monododecyl ether n n dimethyltetradecylamine n n dimethyltetradecylamine n oxide n n dimethyldodecylamine n methyldodecylamine tributylamine with foa 50 the most abundant industrial chemical found was the phthalate dehp with maximum detected concentration of 1342 μg kg 1 in jds4 24 hungary this finding is of high concern as dehp is a wfd priority substance and is toxic to reproduction and endocrine disrupting echa substance infocard bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate 2022 investigation on the emission source of such threatening compound at the region near the sampling site by the local authority is important to stop further pollution river sediments were less contaminated by ppps in comparison with other investigated matrices only 8 ppps were determined in the sediment samples the most frequently detected ppps was carboxin which was detected in all 4 sediment samples foa 100 with an average concentration 10 μg kg 1 it was followed by the pesticide barban with 75 foa and average concentration 67 μg kg 1 three ppps oxfendazole aramite and desisopropyl atrazine were detected at concentration levels below the respective limits of quantification loq the other 3 ppps methiocarb cadusafos and chlordimeform were detected at concentrations from 0 61 to 6 31 μg kg 1 despite the low number and amounts of ppps determined in sediment they could serve as a continuous source of ppps to the aquatic environment and biota and pose long term ecological threats akoto et al 2016 the accumulation of the detected cecs could be attributed to the low polarity logkow 3 for most of the detected compounds which facilitate their retention on the river sediment the variety and relative abundance of the detected cecs could shed light on the major contamination source such as the industrial production of the frequently detected compounds however it should be noted that only 4 sediment samples were investigated in this study which were insufficient to generate representative outputs for the occurrence profiles of cecs in the drb a study covering more sediment samples is required to serve such purposes 3 4 biota the analysis of 22 biota samples fish muscle revealed the presence of 9 industrial chemicals 20 ppps and 49 ppcps and their tps this indicates a potential for their persistence and bioaccumulation p and b criteria according to the reach legislation european parliament and council registration 2006 steroids were not reported for biota samples as they are naturally occurring compounds in fish in total 15 ppcps were detected in only one of the 22 biota samples the most abundant ppcps detected in biota were vigabatrin benserazide and apophedrin with maximum detected concentrations of 121 184 and 185 μg kg 1 wet weight respectively on the other hand 40 82 of the detected ppcps were found at lower levels 40 μg kg 1 the total cumulative concentration among the tested biota samples ranges from 154 jds4 43 l fc in bulgaria to 483 μg kg 1 jds4 49 r fc in romania among the 9 detected industrial chemicals in biota n methyl 2 pyrrolidone showed foa of 100 with average concentration of 22 μg kg 1 the compound was not found in the studied river water samples source identification could be vital due to the ubiquitous presence of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone the danube rbsp pfos was detected with foa 64 and maximum concentration of 41 μg kg 1 jds4 6 2 y fc in germany two pfass were detected in biota and not in river water perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna both of them were detected with much lower foa of 27 3 and at low average concentrations of 1 1 μg kg 1 three of the 20 detected ppps showed foa 50 in the studied biota samples including barban methoprene and 3 hydroxy carbofuran with average concentration of 25 5 3 and 3 6 μg kg 1 respectively alachlor oxa and pyrethrin i were the fourth most frequently detected ppps in biota both with foa 36 which was detected at average concentration of 11 and 23 μg kg 1 respectively the 15 other ppps were detected in the samples with foa below 20 present in only 1 4 of the 22 biota samples the presence of cecs in biota samples in the drb could pose threats to both public health and the ecosystem some of the detected ppcps and pfass possess a high bioaccumulation potential in aquatic biota and could reach higher level predators including human via the food web olsvik et al 2019 xie et al 2017 some of the detected ppps could inhibit cholinesterase activity and cause inflammatory responses in fish and they could also bioaccumulate in fish and the food chain european commission commission implementing decision eu 2018 continuous monitoring of cecs in biota of the drb are recommended in particular the ones prioritized in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of this study see section 3 7 3 5 influent and effluent wastewater influent and effluent wastewater samples 24h composite reflecting the hydraulic retention time of each wwtp were compared to obtain removal rate of compounds in order to draw robust results from the dataset the analysis on removal rate was restricted to substances that were detected in at least six out of the 22 11 influent and 11 effluent wastewater samples n 212 the result is included in the wastewater analysis tab of the supplementary material wwtps showed efficient removal rate 80 and medium removal rate 25 80 removal for 79 37 and 35 17 out of the 212 cecs it should be noted that the low or negative removal rates may not imply poor removal efficiency for some compounds as they could be tps produced during the treatment process of other cecs biodegradation denitrification ozonation etc for instance guanylurea citalopram n oxide and cetirizine n oxide are transformation products of metformin citalopram and cetirizine respectively they could be produced during the treatment process of the parent compounds which resulted in the low or negative removal rates this could account for the negative removal rate observed in 89 of the 212 compounds 42 some ppcps detected in the effluent wastewater samples are on various watch lists 17beta estradiol is included in the watch list established by the commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 european commission commission implementing decision eu 2018 it was detected in five effluent wastewater samples at levels from 2 02 to 4 04 ng l 1 five other compounds on the updated watch list of 2022 eu 2022 1307 commission implementing decision 2022 were also detected in the effluent wastewater samples including amoxicillin 90 273 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 29 617 ng l 1 sulfamethoxazole 103 1638 ng l 1 trimethoprim loq 89 ng l 1 and fluconazole 7 23 ng l 1 twenty compounds were selected as performance indicators for evaluation of performance of wwtps in the wastewater abatement process fig 2 demonstrates the removal rate of the 20 selected indicator substances one of the 20 indicators diclofenac has already been assigned as danube rbsp liška et al 2015 six out of the 20 indicator substances were efficiently removed by wwtps removal rates 80 medium removal rates 25 80 were observed for eight indicator substances as shown in fig 2 negative removal rates indicate higher levels of compounds detected in effluent wastewater than in influent wastewater observed in 5 indicators this phenomenon is sometimes observed for tps for example the industrial chemical methylbenzotriazole is also a tp of benzotriazole or compounds which are cleavage products of other substances brown and wong 2018 carbamazepine is a tp of its conjugated substances which could be re transformed into free form carbamazepine during biological treatment resulting in negative removal kumar et al 2022 wwtps were proven to facilitate the protection of the danube river ecosystems by providing medium effective removal to 70 of the indicator substances nevertheless more efficient treatment techniques should be established to achieve better removal of contaminants selection of wwtps by the icpdr was based on the size of population served and the dominant wastewater treatment technology of the country with the aim to get representative view on the wwtps of the drb the 11 studied wwtps all involve activated sludge system using sequencing batch reactors with reaction processes to remove carbon nitrogen and phosphorous such system setup is promising for removal of biological nutrient and organic compounds dutta and sarkar 2015 nonetheless further environmental studies covering a wider variety of wwtp removal systems such as the ones with submerged aerated filter system and rotating disc system could yield more comprehensive comparison of efficiency of different treatment plant systems future investigation on removal efficiency of wwtps at catchment level could shed light on their role in contaminant emission in the studied area such study would suggest goals for improvement in removal techniques of wwtps at the drb 3 6 cecs in the drb the whole story overall 339 out of the 586 detected compounds were found in more than one of the jds4 environmental matrices as shown in fig 3 commonly detected ppps industrial chemicals and ppcps are summarized in the commonly detected cecs tab of the supplementary material along with the matrices in which they were detected benzododecinium 4 t op wfd priority substance echa substance infocard 4 1 1 3 3 tetramethylbutyl phenol 2021 sulpiride and galaxolidone were detected in all of the studied environmental matrices among them 82 compounds were commonly detected in river water wastewater and groundwater while additional 121 and 26 compounds were commonly detected in river water wastewater and groundwater wastewater respectively this finding indicates a possible link in contamination profiles between these aquatic matrices contaminants that are not removed or degraded in wwtps could be introduced to river water and or groundwater of the drb kosma et al 2014 oluwole et al 2020 these compounds show high mobility and could pose threats to the environment direct effects on aquatic organisms and human consumption of drinking water produced from groundwater for instance exposure to pfass via polluted drinking water has been associated with increased incidence of tumours hormone disruption and adverse reproductive outcomes in humans and other animals gonsioroski et al 2020 in total 33 cecs were detected in both river water and biota samples which indicates the high potential for bioaccumulation of these compounds they pose potential health risk to various trophic levels and especially to top predators in the food web including humans through fish consumption ahrens and bundschuh 2014 significant increase in human cancer risk could be potentially associated with the consumption of pesticide polluted fish gerber et al 2016 among the 33 contaminants seven were not detected in wastewater samples vigabatrin rivastigmine tramadol nor tramadol n desmethyl 4 piperidinecarboxamide benserazide metolachlor met metolachlor oa cga 351916 cga 51202 imazamox which suggests sources other than wwtps discharge or analytical reasons such as concentration below lod it was found that sewage discharge hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are common sources of pharmaceutical pollution in river water wilkinson 2022 agriculture aquaculture and forestry could contribute to ppps in aquatic biota and ecosystems siddiqui 2018 sewage discharges and industrial wastes are the major contributors of industrial chemicals in river water and aquatic biota bashir et al 2020 the other 26 compounds were also detected in wastewater samples indicating that wwtp discharge could be a point source of such compounds on top of the aforementioned sources further studies are required to accurately identify sources of these compounds in the drb the present study utilizing target screening provides insights on the 586 detected contaminants at the drb full list available in the detected compounds tab of the supplementary material suspect screening has been proven to be a powerful analytical to reveal cecs in environmental samples which is a great complement to target screening hug et al 2014 complementary suspect screening of the jds4 samples was performed which covered 65 000 cecs and their tps norman jds4 suspect screening 2022 the norman network has been working on the harmonization of the suspect screening approach the suspect list exchange sle platform taha 2022 norman suspect list exchange norman sle 2015 established by the norman network includes various suspect lists of cecs which enables suspect screening of thousands of cecs in environmental samples for instance suspect screening revealed the presence of 72 additional pfass in jds4 samples in another study ng et al 2022 future investigation involving both target and suspect screening would yield more comprehensive results on the occurrence source and fate of cecs present in the environment 3 7 risk assessment the measured concentrations of all the detected compounds were compared to their lowest pnec values retrieved from the norman ecotoxicology database dulio 2020 which contains pnecs for freshwater marine waters sediments and biota table 1 summarizes the list of compounds that exceeded their pnecs in the jds4 river waters sediments and biota samples all substances listed in table 1 require further attention of the regulators and the researchers one should note that 18 out of the 24 cecs detected with pnec exceedance in river waters originated at least partially from wwtp effluent discharge indicated with in table 1 among the prioritized 45 cecs 12 are legacy substances indicated with ls in table 1 which are previously proposed danube rbsps wfd priority substances or watch list candidates the other 33 emerging contaminants determined in the risk assessment are candidates for danube rbsps some prioritized ppps e g barban and imazapyr were detected in biota samples at highest concentration in german sites these compounds are not in the list of authorised plant protection products of the german federal office of consumer protection and food safety information on authorised plant protection products 2023 and were not in use e g in germany for the last decades this is indicative of pollution sources other than agricultural activities 4 conclusions a novel approach was presented demonstrating the usefulness of wide scope target screening of 2362 ppps industrial chemicals ppcps and their tps in influent and effluent wastewater river water groundwater sediments and biota samples collected in the jds4 such application of chemical screening provided insight on the potential source and fate of a wide spectrum of cecs in the drb facilitated the performance evaluation of studied wwtps and revealed the potential candidates for danube rbsps the application of hrms screening methodology revealed the presence of 586 of these chemicals in the jds4 samples including 158 ppps 71 industrial chemicals 348 ppcps and nine other chemicals the removal of contaminants by wwtps was investigated their fate in the catchment was reported wwtps were proven to effectively remove removal rate 80 6 of the 20 indicator chemicals selected to evaluate performance of wwtp medium removal rates 25 80 were observed for eight indicator substances wwtps managed to significantly reduce concentration levels of the vast majority of studied contaminants nevertheless some contaminants passed wwtps unaltered in the effluent discharges more efficient treatment techniques are required to improve removal of contaminants at wwtps effluent wastewater sewage discharge and other anthropogenic activities e g industrial production and agricultural activities are among the major sources of cecs in the drb attention was drawn to 19 ppps 8 industrial chemicals and 18 ppcps that exceeded their respective ecotoxicological thresholds in various matrices 33 of them are emerging contaminants and thus qualify as danube rbsps as the number of samples provides only a snapshot of the distribution of cecs in various matrices single outstanding results have to be verified by additional investigations continuous monitoring programme in the drb would help to keep these cecs at acceptable levels in the studied area by triggering mitigation measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments authors gratefully acknowledge the international commission

15158,a state of the art wide scope target screening of 2 362 chemicals and their transformation products tps was performed in samples collected within the joint danube survey 4 jds4 performed in 2019 the analysed contaminants of emerging concern cecs included three major categories plant protection products ppps industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in total 586 cecs were detected in the samples including 158 ppps 71 industrial chemicals 348 ppcps and 9 other chemicals a wide variety of sample matrices were collected including influent and effluent wastewater groundwater river water sediment and biota forty five cecs 19 ppps 8 industrial chemicals 18 ppcps were detected at levels above their ecotoxicological thresholds lowest predicted no effect

chemicals wwtps showed effective removal removal rate 80 and medium removal removal rate 25 80 for 6 and 8 of the indicator chemicals respectively however numerous contaminants passed the wwtps with a lower removal rate further investigation on performance of wwtps is suggested at catchment level to improve their removal efficiency wwtp effluents are proven to be one of the major sources of contaminants in the danube river basin drb other sources include sewage discharges industrial and agricultural activities continuous monitoring of the detected cecs is suggested to ensure water

availability data was included as supplementary material 1 introduction being the second largest catchment region in europe the danube river basin drb serves over 80 million people by providing drinking water industrial and agricultural water supply hydroelectric power generation tourism and fisheries among others alygizakis et al 2019 anthropogenic activities constantly introduce contaminants of emerging concern cecs into the drb such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps from domestic wastewater skrbic et al 2018 and plant protection products ppps from agricultural activities gasparotti 2014 industrial production could introduce industrial chemicals and ppcps to the environment all these chemicals are released to various environmental compartments at alarming levels across the globe thompson and darwish 2019 it is therefore essential to monitor the water quality of the drb the joint danube survey jds was conducted in 2001 2007 2013 and 2019 to collect data for water quality evaluation on the drb and its major tributaries the present study outlines some chemical findings from the joint danube survey 4 jds4 performed in 2019 ppps industrial chemicals and ppcps were selected for this study as these compounds could pose threats to the ecosystems and human via bioaccumulation or mobility depending on their physico chemical properties some of them tend to bioaccumulate in living organisms and could reach human and various organisms via the food chain al farsi et al 2017 kalyabina et al 2021 some ppps and industrial chemicals such as certain per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass could cause adverse reproductive and developmental effects in mammals and vertebrates blake and fenton 2020 and pesticides could reduce biodiversity by adversely affecting survival and reproduction of non target species geiger et al 2010 in addition some studied contaminants have mobile properties and could end up in groundwaters used for production of drinking water kampouris et al 2022 wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent plays a key role in chemical pollution including ppcps industrial chemicals and ppps of surface waters used as drinking water sources troger et al 2020 some ppcps are included in the eu watch list commission implementing decision 2022 however the regular monitoring of most ppcps is not requested by the current eu legislations despite their ubiquitous presence comprehensive occurrence data are required to support the future regulatory monitoring at the eu and basin scale the selected cecs are constantly emitted from various sources including anthropogenic activities and wwtp effluent discharge muller et al 2002 some cecs were found to pass the wwtps unaltered partially or fully and are being continuously introduced into the drb alygizakis et al 2019 wwtp effluents have been proven to be a major point source of ppcps in the aquatic ecosystems ebele et al 2017 some cecs found in effluent wastewater are persistent and barely undergo transformation in wwtps such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos thompson et al 2022 these substances from wwtps could also biomagnify in the food chain or enter groundwaters regarding their mobility aristi et al 2015 zhen et al 2018 it is therefore essential to evaluate the removal efficiency of wwtps and characterize the cecs emitted by the plants many reference laboratories collaborated to identify a wide spectrum of cecs in the drb this study reports the findings of four analytical laboratories the environmental institute ei slovakia the bavarian environmental agency lfu germany the joint research centre jrc italy and the university of athens uoa greece the laboratories are equipped with analytical methods and state of the art analytical instrumentation to perform multi residue target screening of the 2 362 analytes of interest full list available in the supplementary material chemical screening involved both legacy compounds and emerging contaminants the aims of this study were to 1 address the fate of a broad range of cecs and their tps in the drb 2 identify cecs that are emitted by the wwtps in the drb 3 evaluate the

compounds was analyzed by the jrc including water framework directive wfd priority substances watch list compounds and danube river basin specific pollutants rbsps identified within jds3 brack 2019 liška et al 2015 a large volume solid phase extraction lvspe device mariani box mariani et al 2017 was adopted to obtain and extract effluent wastewater river water and groundwater samples the samples were filtered 7 l for groundwater 5 l for river water and 0 5 l for wastewater and spiked with a mix of stable isotope labelled internal standards subsequently solid phase extraction spe j2 scientific was performed on an atlantic hlb h spe disk horizont technology mounted in the mariani box prior to analysis the extracts were evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream details of the extraction process can be found elsewhere mariani et al 2020 gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry gc hrms dfs thermo and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms qtrap 5500 sciex

multiple reaction monitoring scan mode was utilized for the determination of 158 commonly consumed pharmaceuticals antibiotics illicit drugs drugs of abuse and their tps at trace levels alygizakis et al 2016 the specific and more sensitive lc ms ms method was used to detect specific contaminants occurring at low concentration levels the high resolution mass spectrometry analytical method is less sensitive but provides information for a broad range of contaminants 2 3 quality assurance and quality control a thorough quality assurance and quality control qa qc program was applied in the sample preparation procedures and instrumental analysis methods prior to extraction a mix of internal standards was added into each sample the generic sample preparation protocols that were used assure satisfactory recovery typically above 60 for the majority of the targeted compounds moreover six additional blank samples were used for quality control the blank samples were prepared and examined together with the samples this process checks for any external contamination which could be introduced during the sampling campaign sample preparation of the extracts and analytical procedures the field blank samples were milliq water brought to the field and extracted at the laboratory together with the real samples the signals observed in blank samples were subtracted from the signals observed in real samples the qa qc program and logistic planning of the sampling process are thoroughly described in the jds4 scientific report liška et al 2021 a collaborative trial on the three screening methods applied by jrc lfu and uoa was performed the performance of the methods on all 10 compounds commonly analyzed by the laboratories acetamiprid atrazine desethylterbutylazine dimethenamid imidacloprid metazachlor metolachlor simazine tebuconazole terbutryn was compared in terms of limits of quantification loqs detection frequencies and consistency with each other as shown in the comparison of methods tab of the supplementary material in general the jrc method showed better sensitivity as compared to the spe based screening methods as more concentrated extracts were analyzed difference in loqs for over an order of magnitude for some compounds atrazine imidacloprid metolachlor etc was observed thus higher sensitivity resulted in higher number of detections by the jrc method nonetheless determined concentrations of the 10 compounds by all methods showed a good agreement in most cases within a factor of 3 2 4 evaluation on removal efficiency of wwtps using indicator substances for the systematic assessment on the performance of wwtps in the wastewater abatement process a set of 20 compounds was selected as performance indicators based on the following criteria 1 are of high consumption and regularly found in wwtp influents 2 occur in most effluent of wwtps at detectable levels 3 are easily and routinely measured by as few as possible analytical methods optimally one method 4 cover a broad range of physico chemical properties and biodegradability which affects their removal rate at various treatment processes 5 undergo a similar degree of abatement in advanced treatment technologies e g ozonation or sorption to activated carbon ac and 6 are representative of a broad range of treatability features from biodegradable during conventional activated sludge treatment or biofiltration to not degradable during conventional activated sludge treatment or biofiltration but amenable to chemical oxidation or sorption to ac and not degradable during conventional activated sludge treatment or biofiltration and not amenable to chemical oxidation or sorption to ac the 20 compounds and their abatement rate are included in fig 2 the efficiency of wwtps was evaluated by its removal rate of the 20 performance indicators it should be noted that efficient removal of wwtp relates to a reduction in the concentration of a contaminant by 80 or above instead of complete removal of the substance this follows the waters protection ordinance of the swiss federal council which included 80 abatement as the target for the reduction of cecs in wwtp the swiss federal council 2018 2 5 risk assessment to assess the risk of the detected substances the concentrations of the contaminants were evaluated in relation to the respective predicted no effect concentration pnec values the occurrence of cecs with detected levels above pnec were considered to represent a potential risk for the impacted ecosystem pnec values for all detected substances were extracted from the norman ecotoxicology database norman norman ecotoxicology database 2023 a part of the norman database system dulio 2020 for compounds where no experimental toxicity data was available pnecs were derived by qsar models aalizadeh et al 2017 for risk assessment purposes the lowest pnec was selected in the order of a environmental quality standard eqs values b experimental pnec values from reference laboratories c in silico predicted pnec steroids in biota were considered as naturally occurring compounds and were not considered for the risk assessment 3 results and

carbamazepine 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxy were detected in all 51 river water samples 100 foa meanwhile 59 ppcps 42 showed 10 foa most of the ppcps were detected at levels up to tens of ng l 1 exceptions include 19 norandrosterone with maximum concentration of 1171 ng l 1 highest among determined ppcps attention was drawn to six detected ppcps that were listed in the eu watch list eu 2022 1307 commission implementing decision 2022 including amoxicillin ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim venlafaxine and fluconazole the 6 legacy substances occur at low concentration levels and no pnec exceedance was observed nonetheless high foa 84 and 100 were observed for amoxicillin and sulfamethoxazole and therefore further emission should be strictly controlled among the 40 industrial chemicals determined in river water samples high foa was also observed in river water for six pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa foa 100 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos foa 96 1 perfluorohexanoic

concentration levels ranged from 0 6 ng l 1 pfbs to 3 2 ng l 1 pfhxa nevertheless their ubiquitous presence in river water is of concern as some of them possess a high bioaccumulation potential haukas et al 2007 wwtp effluent discharge was found to be a common point source of pfass as a result of inefficient removal of pfass at wwtps phong vo et al 2020 another important sub class of industrial chemicals detected was phenols including 2 4 dinitrophenol foa 100 average concentration 3 6 ng l 1 and 4 tert octylphenol 4 t op foa 88 2 average concentration 55 2 ng l 1 the latter one is a priority substance under the wfd echa substance infocard 4 1 1 3 3 tetramethylbutyl phenol 2021 four novel bisphenol a bpa related compounds were also detected bisphenol a diglycidyl ether bisphenol a 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl glycidyl ether bisphenol a 2 3 dihydroxypropyl glycidyl ether and bisphenol a bis 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl ether these bpa related compounds were detected only in the upper danube germany austria and slovakia at levels up to 535 8 ng l 1 bpa bis 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl ether in jds4 4 germany which indicates the presence of contamination sources of bpa in the upper danube this could be a warning signal as bpa is well known for its toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in living organisms michalowicz 2014 and bpa analogues could cause endocrine effects in aquatic species liu et al 2021 these compounds are of regulatory interest especially the prioritized phenols and bpa related compounds shown in section 3 7 among the 119 ppps detected in river water samples 28 showed high foa 80 majority of the determined ppp concentrations were below 10 ng l 1 there were exceptions including metolachlor and its tp metolachlor esa both compounds showed 100 foa with average concentrations of 24 and 42 ng l 1 respectively carbendazim was detected with a foa of 92 and an average concentration of 151 ng l 1 which has been banned in the eu since 2019 european commission commission implementing decision eu 2019 with exception on some biocidal products european commission commission implementing decision eu 2021 3 2 groundwater gw in total 124 of the 2362 targeted compounds were detected in the seven gw samples the results from each gw sample were compared with the results from the closest river water sample 1 41 km apart from the gw site to identify potential source of contaminants half of the detections were attributed to a monitoring pair a gw sample and the corresponding river water sample of highest proximity the detected compounds were mainly ppcps ppps and industrial chemicals such common presence of the detected cecs suggests river water as a potential contamination source which is commonly observed for compounds of high mobility see section 3 6 for the other sites and compounds local or regional activities could be the source of contamination the identification of contamination source is important for pollution control of gw of the drb in sum 48 ppps and their tps were determined in the seven gw samples the highest cumulative concentration of ppps was observed at the gw site in romania 140 ng l 1 the highest individual ppp concentration was observed at the same site for metolachlor esa 38 ng l 1 no exceedance of the quality standards under the eu groundwater directive was observed 100 ng l 1 and 500 ng l 1 for individual and total concentrations of pesticide substances and relevant metabolites respectively european parliament directive 2006 the same parametric values were listed under the eu drinking water directive as maximum permissible values the council of the european union e 1998 however further pollution should be strictly controlled a total of 48 ppcps were detected in the studied gw sites the highest cumulative concentration was observed at the gw site in croatia 650 ng l 1 the site also showed the highest individual ppcp concentration of 520 ng l 1 for the antiepileptics vigabatrin this is above the group total quality standard for pharmaceuticals of 500 ng l 1 as suggested in annex i of groundwater directive 2006 118 ec which is under discussion to bring the quality standard to a lower concentration scientific committee on health 2022 no exceedance of the quality standard was observed in other gw sites seven antibiotics were detected in the gw samples with up to 3 antibiotics bulgarian gw site in each sample the highest cumulative concentration of antibiotics was observed at the hungarian gw site 25 ng l 1 the site also showed the highest individual antibiotic concentration of 23 ng l 1 for sulfamethoxazole which is listed in the eu watch list eu 2022 1307 commission implementing decision 2022 nonetheless the detected concentration is well below the groundwater quality standard of 100 ng l 1 scientific committee on health 2022 in total 28 industrial chemicals were determined in the seven gw sites including phosphate flame retardants pfass benzotriazoles and benzothiazoles phenolic substances and other industrial chemicals the number of industrial chemicals observed per gw site ranges from 4 to 13 and the cumulative concentration per gw site ranges from 320 to 720 ng l 1 four pfass were each determined in gw samples at low concentrations ranging between 0 5 and 18 ng l 1 including pfos 3 gw sites pfhxa 4 gw sites pfoa and pfbus 5 gw sites each no exceedance of the quality standards proposed by eu drinking water directive was observed in the seven gw sites 100 ng l 1 for the sum of a list of selected 20 pfass and 500 ng l 1 for total pfas level european parliament directive eu 2020 it should be noted that bisphenol a was determined at all seven gw sites at concentration between 93 gw site in croatia and 159 ng l 1 gw site in romania which is well above the quality standard for bisphenol a of 10 ng l 1 that is under discussion for inclusion in the eu drinking water directive european parliament directive eu 2020 bisphenol a was not detected in river water samples which indicates other contamination sources to the gw in the drb this finding is alarming and is indicative of regulatory monitoring of these industrial chemicals in gw of the drb some of the detected cecs could act as endocrine disruptors by interfering with the hormone systems such as bisphenol a and pfoa liu et al 2021 chaparro ortega et al 2018 the occurrence of such compounds despite the levels below respective quality standards or permissible values is of concern as they could reach human via drinking water produced from gw and accumulate in human body moreover the presence of the 7 antibiotics in the gw of drb is also of concern as the continuous human exposure of antibiotics could introduce antibiotic resistance and potentially public health issues kampouris et al 2022 the investigation on the emission source of such compounds is essential to maintain the quality of gw of the drb which provides drinking water to millions of people alygizakis et al 2019 3 3 river sediments overall 31 ppcps and their tps were detected in the four analyzed samples antibiotics was the most frequently detected class of compounds 10 followed by antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs 7 clinical waste from hospitals is therefore worth investigating as a potential contamination source of such ppcps most of the detected ppcps were determined at levels up to tens of μg kg 1 dry weight the most abundant ppcps found were apophedrin maximum concentration of 213 μg kg 1 in jds4 6 germany the uv filter octocrylene maximum concentration of 162 μg kg 1 in jds4 47 bulgaria and the antibiotic sulfadiazine maximum concentration of 120 μg kg 1 in jds4 47 bulgaria eight out of the 31 ppcps and tps were detected in all four sediments samples foa 100 including triethylcitrate amisulpride citalopram bisoprolol apophedrin methocarbamol and galaxolidone most ppcps could have entered river sediment from the aquatic environment via the process of sedimentation after adsorption to suspended particulate matter vieno et al 2005 in total 19 industrial chemicals were detected in the sediment samples surfactants was the dominant category of industrial chemicals found in river sediments n 12 diglyme benzododecinium didecyldimethylammonium and triglyme with foa of 100 and lauryldiethanolamide tetraethyleneglycol monododecyl ether n n dimethyltetradecylamine n n dimethyltetradecylamine n oxide n n dimethyldodecylamine n methyldodecylamine tributylamine with foa 50 the most abundant industrial chemical found was the phthalate dehp with maximum detected concentration of 1342 μg kg 1 in jds4 24 hungary this finding is of high concern as dehp is a wfd priority substance and is toxic to reproduction and endocrine disrupting echa substance infocard bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate 2022 investigation on the emission source of such threatening compound at the region near the sampling site by the local authority is important to stop further pollution river sediments were less contaminated by ppps in comparison with other investigated matrices only 8 ppps were determined in the sediment samples the most frequently detected ppps was carboxin which was detected in all 4 sediment samples foa 100 with an average concentration 10 μg kg 1 it was followed by the pesticide barban with 75 foa and average concentration 67 μg kg 1 three ppps oxfendazole aramite and desisopropyl atrazine were detected at concentration levels below the respective limits of quantification loq the other 3 ppps methiocarb cadusafos and chlordimeform were detected at concentrations from 0 61 to 6 31 μg kg 1 despite the low number and amounts of ppps determined in sediment they could serve as a continuous source of ppps to the aquatic environment and biota and pose long term ecological threats akoto et al 2016 the accumulation of the detected cecs could be attributed to the low polarity logkow 3 for most of the detected compounds which facilitate their retention on the river sediment the variety and relative abundance of the detected cecs could shed light on the major contamination source such as the industrial production of the frequently detected compounds however it should be noted that only 4 sediment samples were investigated in this study which were insufficient to generate representative outputs for the occurrence profiles of cecs in the drb a study covering more sediment samples is required to serve such purposes 3 4 biota the analysis of 22 biota samples fish muscle revealed the presence of 9 industrial chemicals 20 ppps and 49 ppcps and their tps this indicates a potential for their persistence and bioaccumulation p and b criteria according to the reach legislation european parliament and council registration 2006 steroids were not reported for biota samples as they are naturally occurring compounds in fish in total 15 ppcps were detected in only one of the 22 biota samples the most abundant ppcps detected in biota were vigabatrin benserazide and apophedrin with maximum detected concentrations of 121 184 and 185 μg kg 1 wet weight respectively on the other hand 40 82 of the detected ppcps were found at lower levels 40 μg kg 1 the total cumulative concentration among the tested biota samples ranges from 154 jds4 43 l fc in bulgaria to 483 μg kg 1 jds4 49 r fc in romania among the 9 detected industrial chemicals in biota n methyl 2 pyrrolidone showed foa of 100 with average concentration of 22 μg kg 1 the compound was not found in the studied river water samples source identification could be vital due to the ubiquitous presence of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone the danube rbsp pfos was detected with foa 64 and maximum concentration of 41 μg kg 1 jds4 6 2 y fc in germany two pfass were detected in biota and not in river water perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna both of them were detected with much lower foa of 27 3 and at low average concentrations of 1 1 μg kg 1 three of the 20 detected ppps showed foa 50 in the studied biota samples including barban methoprene and 3 hydroxy carbofuran with average concentration of 25 5 3 and 3 6 μg kg 1 respectively alachlor oxa and pyrethrin i were the fourth most frequently detected ppps in biota both with foa 36 which was detected at average concentration of 11 and 23 μg kg 1 respectively the 15 other ppps were detected in the samples with foa below 20 present in only 1 4 of the 22 biota samples the presence of cecs in biota samples in the drb could pose threats to both public health and the ecosystem some of the detected ppcps and pfass possess a high bioaccumulation potential in aquatic biota and could reach higher level predators including human via the food web olsvik et al 2019 xie et al 2017 some of the detected ppps could inhibit cholinesterase activity and cause inflammatory responses in fish and they could also bioaccumulate in fish and the food chain european commission commission implementing decision eu 2018 continuous monitoring of cecs in biota of the drb are recommended in particular the ones prioritized in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of this study see section 3 7 3 5 influent and effluent wastewater influent and effluent wastewater samples 24h composite reflecting the hydraulic retention time of each wwtp were compared to obtain removal rate of compounds in order to draw robust results from the dataset the analysis on removal rate was restricted to substances that were detected in at least six out of the 22 11 influent and 11 effluent wastewater samples n 212 the result is included in the wastewater analysis tab of the supplementary material wwtps showed efficient removal rate 80 and medium removal rate 25 80 removal for 79 37 and 35 17 out of the 212 cecs it should be noted that the low or negative removal rates may not imply poor removal efficiency for some compounds as they could be tps produced during the treatment process of other cecs biodegradation denitrification ozonation etc for instance guanylurea citalopram n oxide and cetirizine n oxide are transformation products of metformin citalopram and cetirizine respectively they could be produced during the treatment process of the parent compounds which resulted in the low or negative removal rates this could account for the negative removal rate observed in 89 of the 212 compounds 42 some ppcps detected in the effluent wastewater samples are on various watch lists 17beta estradiol is included in the watch list established by the commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 european commission commission implementing decision eu 2018 it was detected in five effluent wastewater samples at levels from 2 02 to 4 04 ng l 1 five other compounds on the updated watch list of 2022 eu 2022 1307 commission implementing decision 2022 were also detected in the effluent wastewater samples including amoxicillin 90 273 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 29 617 ng l 1 sulfamethoxazole 103 1638 ng l 1 trimethoprim loq 89 ng l 1 and fluconazole 7 23 ng l 1 twenty compounds were selected as performance indicators for evaluation of performance of wwtps in the wastewater abatement process fig 2 demonstrates the removal rate of the 20 selected indicator substances one of the 20 indicators diclofenac has already been assigned as danube rbsp liška et al 2015 six out of the 20 indicator substances were efficiently removed by wwtps removal rates 80 medium removal rates 25 80 were observed for eight indicator substances as shown in fig 2 negative removal rates indicate higher levels of compounds detected in effluent wastewater than in influent wastewater observed in 5 indicators this phenomenon is sometimes observed for tps for example the industrial chemical methylbenzotriazole is also a tp of benzotriazole or compounds which are cleavage products of other substances brown and wong 2018 carbamazepine is a tp of its conjugated substances which could be re transformed into free form carbamazepine during biological treatment resulting in negative removal kumar et al 2022 wwtps were proven to facilitate the protection of the danube river ecosystems by providing medium effective removal to 70 of the indicator substances nevertheless more efficient treatment techniques should be established to achieve better removal of contaminants selection of wwtps by the icpdr was based on the size of population served and the dominant wastewater treatment technology of the country with the aim to get representative view on the wwtps of the drb the 11 studied wwtps all involve activated sludge system using sequencing batch reactors with reaction processes to remove carbon nitrogen and phosphorous such system setup is promising for removal of biological nutrient and organic compounds dutta and sarkar 2015 nonetheless further environmental studies covering a wider variety of wwtp removal systems such as the ones with submerged aerated filter system and rotating disc system could yield more comprehensive comparison of efficiency of different treatment plant systems future investigation on removal efficiency of wwtps at catchment level could shed light on their role in contaminant emission in the studied area such study would suggest goals for improvement in removal techniques of wwtps at the drb 3 6 cecs in the drb the whole story overall 339 out of the 586 detected compounds were found in more than one of the jds4 environmental matrices as shown in fig 3 commonly detected ppps industrial chemicals and ppcps are summarized in the commonly detected cecs tab of the supplementary material along with the matrices in which they were detected benzododecinium 4 t op wfd priority substance echa substance infocard 4 1 1 3 3 tetramethylbutyl phenol 2021 sulpiride and galaxolidone were detected in all of the studied environmental matrices among them 82 compounds were commonly detected in river water wastewater and groundwater while additional 121 and 26 compounds were commonly detected in river water wastewater and groundwater wastewater respectively this finding indicates a possible link in contamination profiles between these aquatic matrices contaminants that are not removed or degraded in wwtps could be introduced to river water and or groundwater of the drb kosma et al 2014 oluwole et al 2020 these compounds show high mobility and could pose threats to the environment direct effects on aquatic organisms and human consumption of drinking water produced from groundwater for instance exposure to pfass via polluted drinking water has been associated with increased incidence of tumours hormone disruption and adverse reproductive outcomes in humans and other animals gonsioroski et al 2020 in total 33 cecs were detected in both river water and biota samples which indicates the high potential for bioaccumulation of these compounds they pose potential health risk to various trophic levels and especially to top predators in the food web including humans through fish consumption ahrens and bundschuh 2014 significant increase in human cancer risk could be potentially associated with the consumption of pesticide polluted fish gerber et al 2016 among the 33 contaminants seven were not detected in wastewater samples vigabatrin rivastigmine tramadol nor tramadol n desmethyl 4 piperidinecarboxamide benserazide metolachlor met metolachlor oa cga 351916 cga 51202 imazamox which suggests sources other than wwtps discharge or analytical reasons such as concentration below lod it was found that sewage discharge hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are common sources of pharmaceutical pollution in river water wilkinson 2022 agriculture aquaculture and forestry could contribute to ppps in aquatic biota and ecosystems siddiqui 2018 sewage discharges and industrial wastes are the major contributors of industrial chemicals in river water and aquatic biota bashir et al 2020 the other 26 compounds were also detected in wastewater samples indicating that wwtp discharge could be a point source of such compounds on top of the aforementioned sources further studies are required to accurately identify sources of these compounds in the drb the present study utilizing target screening provides insights on the 586 detected contaminants at the drb full list available in the detected compounds tab of the supplementary material suspect screening has been proven to be a powerful analytical to reveal cecs in environmental samples which is a great complement to target screening hug et al 2014 complementary suspect screening of the jds4 samples was performed which covered 65 000 cecs and their tps norman jds4 suspect screening 2022 the norman network has been working on the harmonization of the suspect screening approach the suspect list exchange sle platform taha 2022 norman suspect list exchange norman sle 2015 established by the norman network includes various suspect lists of cecs which enables suspect screening of thousands of cecs in environmental samples for instance suspect screening revealed the presence of 72 additional pfass in jds4 samples in another study ng et al 2022 future investigation involving both target and suspect screening would yield more comprehensive results on the occurrence source and fate of cecs present in the environment 3 7 risk assessment the measured concentrations of all the detected compounds were compared to their lowest pnec values retrieved from the norman ecotoxicology database dulio 2020 which contains pnecs for freshwater marine waters sediments and biota table 1 summarizes the list of compounds that exceeded their pnecs in the jds4 river waters sediments and biota samples all substances listed in table 1 require further attention of the regulators and the researchers one should note that 18 out of the 24 cecs detected with pnec exceedance in river waters originated at least partially from wwtp effluent discharge indicated with in table 1 among the prioritized 45 cecs 12 are legacy substances indicated with ls in table 1 which are previously proposed danube rbsps wfd priority substances or watch list candidates the other 33 emerging contaminants determined in the risk assessment are candidates for danube rbsps some prioritized ppps e g barban and imazapyr were detected in biota samples at highest concentration in german sites these compounds are not in the list of authorised plant protection products of the german federal office of consumer protection and food safety information on authorised plant protection products 2023 and were not in use e g in germany for the last decades this is indicative of pollution sources other than agricultural activities 4 conclusions a novel approach was presented demonstrating the usefulness of wide scope target screening of 2362 ppps industrial chemicals ppcps and their tps in influent and effluent wastewater river water groundwater sediments and biota samples collected in the jds4 such application of chemical screening provided insight on the potential source and fate of a wide spectrum of cecs in the drb facilitated the performance evaluation of studied wwtps and revealed the potential candidates for danube rbsps the application of hrms screening methodology revealed the presence of 586 of these chemicals in the jds4 samples including 158 ppps 71 industrial chemicals 348 ppcps and nine other chemicals the removal of contaminants by wwtps was investigated their fate in the catchment was reported wwtps were proven to effectively remove removal rate 80 6 of the 20 indicator chemicals selected to evaluate performance of wwtp medium removal rates 25 80 were observed for eight indicator substances wwtps managed to significantly reduce concentration levels of the vast majority of studied contaminants nevertheless some contaminants passed wwtps unaltered in the effluent discharges more efficient treatment techniques are required to improve removal of contaminants at wwtps effluent wastewater sewage discharge and other anthropogenic activities e g industrial production and agricultural activities are among the major sources of cecs in the drb attention was drawn to 19 ppps 8 industrial chemicals and 18 ppcps that exceeded their respective ecotoxicological thresholds in various matrices 33 of them are emerging contaminants and thus qualify as danube rbsps as the number of samples provides only a snapshot of the distribution of cecs in various matrices single outstanding results have to be verified by additional investigations continuous monitoring programme in the drb would help to keep these cecs at acceptable levels in the

15159,immobilized and visible light active titanium dioxide tio2 is widely used for water treatment however the accelerated generation of degradation byproducts is a potential risk of tio2 based photocatalysis this study aimed to investigate the structural effect of engineered tio2 samples on the formation of major nitrosamines during photocatalysis the nitrogen containing impurities and leached metal ions from doped tio2 samples could exacerbate nitrosamine formation potential fp in distilled water secondary effluent and chloraminated water doped tio2 with 2 ethylimidazole trimethylamine triethylamine and n carbon nanotubes could leach in the range of 47 64 ng l 1 nitrosamines including n nitrosomethylethylamine n nitrosodiethylamine n nitrosodimethylamine and n nitrosopyrrolidine even under dark conditions furthermore we investigated the role of metal dopants on nitrosamine fp during the chloramination of precursors such as dimethylamine and microcystin lr metal ions such as cu that leached from the metal doped catalysts may catalyze the nitrosamine fp therefore pre purification washing and immobilization of doped tio2 samples on substrates are suggested to remove a considerable amount of nitrosamines however during the prolonged tryout the selection of substrates was critical polymeric supports such as polyimide and polyvinylpyrrolidone can produce up to 85 ng l 1 nitrosamine whereas tio2 immobilized onto steel mesh can remove nitrosamine formation during photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination this study systematically screened a diverse range of dopants supports and solvents in engineered tio2 photocatalysts in 61 samples and provided novel insights into their effect on nitrosamine formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalysis doped titanium dioxide nitrosamine immobilization chloramination data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction titanium dioxide tio2 is the most studied and prevalent photoactive engineered nanomaterial tio2 based photocatalysis is a sustainable and green remedy method due to its simple and inexpensive operation with excellent performance keller and lazareva 2014 schneider et al 2014 srikanth et al 2017 studies have focused on improving the practical applicability of tio2 such as recyclability and visible light activity immobilization of tio2 on metal and polymeric substrates was found to improve the stability and recovery of spent nano sized tio2 srikanth et al 2017 moreover doping defect control and functionalization of tio2 with various metals copper and non metals carbon nanotubes cnts increase its performance by controlling band structures and extending light absorbance asahi et al 2014 park et al 2013 a variety of doped and immobilized engineered tio2 catalysts is widely employed in aqueous environments these are highly efficient in the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and abatement of pollutants schneider et al 2019 triantis et al 2012 yang et al 2020 tio2 based photocatalytic disinfection and or decontamination shows great promise for water purification schneider et al 2014 srikanth et al 2017 the use of uv tio2 before chlorination improves disinfection while maintaining the required chlorine residual concentrations in potable water systems richardson et al 1996 rodríguez et al 2018 more recently adding chlorine to a uv tio2 system was found to increase the rate of water decontamination by several orders of magnitude compared to a sole photocatalytic system zhang et al 2022 however the adverse effect of intensifying the formation of degradation disinfection byproducts dbps is a potential risk of photocatalysis particularly for the use of uv tio2 in drinking water where water dechlor am ination is expected photocatalysis can trigger the formation of dbps by a direct oxidative transformation of potential surrogates to dbps for instance richardson et al identified a single carbonaceous dbp 3 methyl 2 4 hexanedione during photocatalytic treatment of drinking water richardson et al 1996 when chlorine is used as a secondary disinfectant post chlorination several halogenated and carbonaceous dbps trihalomethane and haloacetic acid are generated gora et al 2018 metch et al 2015 richardson et al 1996 selcuk et al 2006 tugulea et al 2014 nevertheless no previous study has addressed the structural impact of engineered tio2 on emerging dbps such as nitrosamines n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which have a higher carcinogenic potential and negative effects on human health munch and bassett 2004 various inorganic metals and organic molecules carbon and nitrogen are used as dopants and substrates for the structural modification of engineered tio2 metals such as copper and palladium and organics including cnts activated carbon and nitrogen containing compounds such as trimethylamine tma ionic liquids and diethanolamine dea are used as dopants of tio2 photocatalyst asahi et al 2014 park et al 2013 a majority of these dopants themselves are a possible source of nitrosamines during chloramination hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 vander meulen et al 2020 verdugo et al 2014 zhang and andrews 2013 nitrogen containing polymeric substrates are used in immobilizing tio2 nanoparticles these can cause nitrosamine formation during the chloramination ersan et al 2015 li et al 2017 the release of leachable constituents from doped immobilized tio2 during photocatalysis could cause nitrosamine formation with the extensive development of engineered tio2 using various inorganic organic dopants and substrates a systematic investigation of their nitrosamine formation potential fp should be demonstrated to this end we investigated the potential formation of nitrosamines during tio2 based photocatalysis a total of 61 samples with a variety of commonly used dopants supports and solvents for the production of engineered tio2 photocatalyst were screened for nitrosamine fp during chloramination in comparison with dimethylamine dma as a control ndma precursor to mimic water treatment scenarios chloramination with a higher nitrosamine yield was chosen as a secondary oxidant furthermore the photocatalytic performance of engineered tio2 samples with selected dopants and supports was evaluated given the release of nitrosamines under different light conditions finally the effects of pre purification washing and substrate immobilization of doped tio2 on their photocatalytic performance against microcystin lr mclr and the consequent nitrosamine fp with subsequent chloramination in pure water and secondary wastewater effluent were investigated 2

nitrosamine formation under photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination conditions to simulate the realistic water disinfection conditions nitrosamine formation was assessed during photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination post chloramination in a typical experiment the targeted engineered tio2 samples were used for photodegradation of mclr mclr 20 µg l 1 catalyst load 10 mg l 1 and or 2 5 5 0 cm2 pieces of immobilized tio2 samples i e 14 mg l 1 ph 5 7 and 2 h visible light irradiation after 2 h light irradiation the reaction solution was centrifuged to remove the spent catalyst subsequently the samples were quenched with chloramine and incubated as described in section 2 3 1 further to show the nitrosamine formation in repeated cycles selected doped tio2 samples were subjected to four cycles of photocatalysis against mclr after each cycle the reaction solution was quenched with chloramine and incubated for 72 h for nitrosamine analysis to elucidate the impact of pretreatment of the doped tio2 samples before photocatalysis the as prepared samples were additionally purified through four centrifugal washes the pre purified doped tio2 samples were compared to their immobilized and pristine doped analogs 2 4 analytical methods in si text s3 table s1 and fig s1 detailed analytical methods for measuring chloramines mclr nitrosamines and dissolved organic carbon concentrations are presented 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of dopants and supports for nitrosamine formation potential fig 1a shows the observed ndma formation from single metal and metal oxides in chloraminated water with and without dma respectively in the absence of dma as a precursor metals and metal oxides produced insignificant amounts of ndma fig 1a notably a control experiment without metal oxide s in chloraminated water showed the ndma concentration of 2 5 ng l 1 which is the level for a limit of quantitation fig s2 in contrast the ndma concentrations from metal oxide s are substantially influenced by the presence of dma fig 1a the control batch without metal oxide s produced ndma up to 33 1 ng l 1 by chloramination of dma fig s2 therefore some metals exhibit accelerated ndma formation after preliminary screening among the tested metals cd hg cu and pb showed a high tendency to enhance ndma fp producing a maximum of 145 ng l 1 from cu fig 1a in line with earlier reports liu et al 2016 zhang and andrews 2013 enhanced formation of ndma in the presence of metals like cd hg cu and pb is attributed to the metal catalyzed decomposition of nh2cl and the formation of dichloramine nhcl2 schreiber and mitch 2006 zhang and andrews 2013 liu et al 2016 indeed the presence of these metals in nh2cl solutions significantly increased the concentration of nhcl2 fig s3 notably ndma formed in nhcl2 solution was equivalent to ndma formed in nh2cl with metals e g cu and cd fig s4 indicating that the metal triggered nhcl2 generation played a critical role in enhanced ndma formation huang et al 2018 other metal oxide s ag mg ca tio2 and ceo2 did not exhibit any significant effects on ndma fp however some metals pd mn and fe and metal oxides nife2o4 cuo and mno2 specifically hindered the ndma fp of dma exhibiting a lower ndma concentration compared to that in the control batch without any metals fig s2 the decreased ndma formation due to the sorption of precursors on metal oxides like cuo has also been reported by zhang and andrews 2013 notably with dma as a precursor ndma was the major nitrosamine while other nitrosamines such as n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr nnitrosodi n propylamine ndpa n nitrosodiethylamine ndea and n nitrosodi n butylamine ndba were not detected in line with earlier reports hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 organic dopants and supports such as nitrogen containing cnts dea 1em 2em tea tetramethylammonium tema tma urea polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp sheet chitosan film polyimide pi film polyacrylonitrile pan fabric and nylon film directly generated a variety of nitrosamines including ndma nmea ndea and npyr 5 6 153 7 ng l 1 regardless of the presence of dma fig 1b indicating that organic dopants and supports themselves can play a role as nitrosamine precursors however nitrosamine fps were not observed for quartz activated carbon cloth stainless steel ss mesh silica gel polystyrene alginate and glass beads as readily expected trace amounts of ndma were found in chloraminated poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf mat samples despite the high durability the trace ndma concentration from pvdf samples is probably derived from residual solvents such as dimethylformamide dmf and dimethylacetamide dmc which generate ndma upon chloramination hinneh et al 2019 therefore based on the preliminary results metals pd cu cd and pb non metals cnts as carbon precursor and urea tea tma 1me and 2me as nitrogen precursor and substrates ss pvdf pvp and pi were selected for further doping and immobilizing studies to fabricate the engineered tio2 samples 3 2 photocatalytic activity of engineered tio2 with selected dopants and substrates the fabricated tio2 samples were subjected to photodegradation of mclr to evaluate their intrinsic catalytic performance table s2 presents mclr degradation by engineered tio2 samples under uv and visible light irradiation using slurry p25 bare tio2 under uv irradiation mclr was completely degraded within 15 min with a pseudo first order kinetics kobs constant of 0 24 min 1 this agrees with the results from earlier reports triantis et al 2012 yang et al 2020 however immobilized tio2 samples such as ss tio2 pi tio2 pvdf tio2 and pvp tio2 can easily remove mclr within 70 80 min of uv irradiation table s2 increased photocatalytic efficiency from slurry p25 can be attributed to increased contact opportunity between mclr and photocatalysts resulting in higher mass transfer and enhanced degradation efficiency ramasundaram et al 2015 the degradation efficacies of immobilized photocatalysts kobs 0 026 0 063 min 1 were higher than that of tio2 coated glass plate 0 012 0 059 min 1 antoniou et al 2009 and irradiated porous tio2 membrane 0 0035 min 1 schneider et al 2019 under visible light λ 400 nm bare tio2 showed negligible photocatalytic performance however the photocatalytic activity was markedly enhanced when various dopants were incorporated into p25 tio2 pd tio2 displayed the best photocatalytic activity against mclr followed by cnt tio2 urea tio2 and other doped tio2 samples in addition more than 90 degradation of mclr was observed with doped and immobilized tio2 photocatalysts such as pd ss tio2 within 240 min table s2 the higher activity of pd tio2 can be attributed to the formation of pd0 nanoparticles that can act as an active site for improved charge separation and transport lee et al 2015 the enhanced photocatalytic activity of pd tio2 was evidenced by an effective generation of reactive oxygen species ros fig s5 the possible mechanism of ros production and nitrosamine degradation on pd tio2 is presented in si text s4 5 table s3 4 and scheme s1 engineered tio2 samples with selected dopants and substrates were capable of eliminating mclr under both uv and visible light exposure despite the high photoactivity the stability of engineered tio2 is of particular concern with respect to nitrosamine and dbp formation therefore we assessed the impact of engineered tio2 samples on the generation of nitrosamine under various light conditions dark visible and uv illumination 3 3 effect of dopants and supports on nitrosamine formation under different light conditions 3 3 1 nitrogen and carbon doped tio2 photocatalysts fig 2 illustrates that n tio2 and c tio2 produced nitrosamines under various light conditions across a range of concentrations notably even under dark conditions in di water without dma addition cnt tio2 and tma tio2 leached 47 0 and 40 2 ng l 1 of ndma respectively while urea tio2 released less than 6 0 ng l 1 of ndma fig 2a tea tio2 mainly released ndea 10 3 ng l 1 however other nitrosamines were not detected fig s6 in contrast a variety of nitrosamines were detected from 2em and 1em doped tio2 samples npyr and nmea were released in significant amounts 23 ng l 1 from 2em tio2 compared to that from 1em tio2 15 6 ng l 1 nmea fig 2a less than 5 0 ng l 1 of ndma was detected in both 1em and 2em doped tio2 samples fig s6 with n tio2 and c tio2 samples almost identical ndma concentrations were observed with and without the addition of dma fig 2a and 2b demonstrating that modified tio2 samples with organic dopants are the primary source of leached nitrosamines further the doped tio2 samples produced slightly more nitrosamines in chloraminated water under dark conditions most likely due to the chloramination of residual dopant and terminal moieties in doped tio2 samples the concentrations of the four nitrosamines in chloraminated water ranged from 14 1 to 68 3 ng l 1 and 10 4 63 6 ng l 1 with and without dma respectively fig 2c and 2d when as prepared doped tio2 samples were subjected to light irradiation fewer nitrosamines were leached in both di and chloraminated water conditions in the presence of uv irradiation the detected maximum nitrosamine level from the cnt tio2 samples 31 ng l 1 was much lower than that in the absence of light irradiation 47 ng l 1 in di water fig 2a and b in contrast the variation of the nitrosamine concentration under the visible light irradiation was marginal 45 6 ng l 1 further the maximum nitrosamine concentration in chloraminated water fig 2c and d was lower in the uv irradiated cnt tio2 samples 36 8 ng l 1 than that in the samples exposed to visible light 59 6 ng l 1 the observed decrease in the nitrosamine concentration under uv irradiation could be attributed to the photolysis of nitrosamines lee et al 2005 although varied the high level of nitrosamine concentrations in the solutions with n tio2 and c tio2 samples could have originated from the nitrogen containing moiety in the dopants or impurities that behave as an ndma precursor in a study by verdugo et al amide and polymer functionalized cnts leached more ndma than aminated cnts verdugo et al 2014 additionally tea with longer alkyl chains showed relatively lower molar yields of nitrosamine compared to that from tma during chloramination kodamatani et al 2021 it is possible that the differences in the nitrosamine yields resulting from 2em tio2 and 1em tio2 caused the differences in the photochemical transformation rates of the imidazolium and pyrrolidinium cation moieties respectively the results from vander meulen et al also showed trace nitrosamine yields from chloraminated ionic liquids with imidazolium moieties than from pyrrolidinium cation derived ionic liquids van der meulen et al 2020 therefore the sub structure of the dopants having nitrogen containing moiety is the driving factor for nitrosamine formation and nitrosamines are likely to be formed as a surface product from the impurities included during the catalyst preparation such as the doping and drying process to support the effect of the preparation processes we compared as received powders cnts and urea were chosen as representatives and as prepared tio2 samples with and without drying the concentrations of leached ndma were significant for the cnts up to 22 ng l 1 while only negligible nitrosamine release was observed for the as received urea powders fig s7 verdugo et al 2014 reported the release of ndma from as received cnt powders up to 60 µg l 1 presumably ndma originates as a residue from the nitrogen containing surface group during cnt manufacturing verdugo et al 2014 notably after drying both as received cnt and urea powders and as prepared tio2 samples generated up to 47 0 ng l 1 ndma indicating the effect of thermal treatment of tio2 on ndma formation abe et al 2020 however we found no evidence of quantifiably leached nitrosamines with undoped p25 tio2 fig s7 the observed difference suggests that post modification of tio2 samples with nitrogen containing constituents can induce the formation of nitrosamine on the surface of tio2 samples however this must be further elucidated 3 3 2 metal doped tio2 photocatalysts m tio2 by themselves did not generate leach quantifiable levels of nitrosamines e g ndma in both di and chloraminated water matrixes fig 3 a c where the ndma levels were not greater than 2 5 ng l 1 which is similar to that in the raw di water in the m tio2 samples the ndma formation was significantly hindered under light exposure however their effect on ndma formation was more pronounced when the ndma precursor e g dma was available in chloraminated water fig 3d regardless of light irradiation m tio2 samples such as cd pb and cu tio2 displayed a noticeable increase in ndma concentrations and they catalytically enhanced the ndma fp fig 3d the mean ndma fp of dma was significantly increased by 1 9 2 5 and 3 2 folds in the presence of cd tio2 pb tio2 and cu tio2 respectively compared to that in dma chloramination alone 33 1 ng l 1 fig s2 in contrast ndma formation was likely inhibited by pd tio2 samples while bare tio2 samples produced considerable ndma fp fig 3d the reduction of ndma fp by pd tio2 can be attributed to the adsorption of ndma itself on the catalytic surface chen et al 2016 and nh2cl decay over time fig s3 as shown in fig s8 in the presence of pd tio2 ndma concentrations decreased with increasing contact time however in the absence of pd tio2 samples the concentration of ndma rapidly reached a plateau within 24 h 3 3 3 immobilized tio2 photocatalysts fig 4 depicts the concentration of nitrosamine in the leachate from immobilized tio2 photocatalysts which were sonicated in di and chlorinated water with and without the addition of dma in the ss tio2 samples no significant nitrosamines were found in both di and chloraminated water conditions regardless of light illumination fig 4a c even with the presence of dma in chloraminated water fig 4d ndma formation from ss tio2 was relatively low which further decreased under light irradiation in contrast polymer supported tio2 samples are unsuitable in terms of nitrosamine formation because significant increases in nitrosamine were observed during the prolonged tryout in chloraminated water trace nitrosamines were leached or generated from polymer supported tio2 samples after uv irradiation in di water fig 4a and 4b however amine containing polymer supported tio2 samples such as pvp tio2 and pi tio2 formed up to 70 ng l 1 nmea and 85 ng l 1 ndma respectively in chloraminated water even without the presence of dma fig 4c d notably the trace concentration of ndma in pvdf tio2 was likely derived from residual solvents corresponding to the result from bare pvdf fig 1d in contrast the interaction between free radicals and n moieties in the polymer matrix is liable for the generation of nitrosamines in di water for pvp tio2 and pi tio2 particularly under light exposure amine containing compounds can be partially oxidized to nitroso functionalities in chloraminated water and promote nitrosamine formation soltermann et al 2013 ss tio2 and pi tio2 were selected and their structural changes were identified using optical microscopy fe sem and ftir unused samples were nearly clear and free from surface defects or ti metal corrosion fig s9a however after the samples were exposed to chloraminated water rusty grain like boundaries appeared on the surface of the pi tio2 samples clearly demonstrating that chloramination induced physical damage to the supported tio2 samples sem studies supported the microscopic results fig s9b compared to unused pi tio2 with a smooth and bright rice like tio2 the recycled samples showed disorganized and scattered tio2 nanoparticles icp oes analysis detected up to 23 3 μg l 1 of leached ti in the effluent from pi tio2 table s5 indicating that the polymer supported tio2 system is not reusable in contrast there was no physical damage or leaching of metal particles from the ss tio2 samples and a nearly identical morphology was observed ftir spectra also support the high stability of ss tio2 fig s10 where broadband changes in the regions of 830 450 cm 1 metal oxygen stretching vibrations as ti o ti ti o gabelich et al 2005 zhang et al 2018 and 1080 cm 1 ti o c bridging vibrations were negligible unlike ss tio2 polymer supported tio2 samples were more susceptible to photochemical oxidation and lost their stability this resulted in the formation of trace nitrosamines during chloramination this was consistent with the observations from earlier studies chloramine promotes the oxidative degradation of polymers pvp and pi and changes their morphological properties dasilva et al 2006 gabelich et al 2005 the products served as precursors for chlorinated byproducts such as nitrosamines ersan et al 2015 xie et al 2015 3 4 the proposed mechanism for nitrosamine release and formation from engineered tio2 scheme 1 displays the proposed mechanism for nitrosamine e g ndma release and or formation from the engineered tio2 broadly consistent with the previous mechanistic findings liu et al 2016 spahr et al 2017 according to our results ndma can be produced by engineered tio2 with non metallic dopants and support e g c n doped tio2 and pi tio2 via two distinct mechanisms first nitrosamines can be formed from the c and n tio2 samples with organic impurities and gradually leach into the solution via hydrolysis scheme 1a this is supported by the findings as shown in fig 2a and fig s7 indicating that nitrosamines can be found in as prepared engineered tio2 even in the absence of chloramine second previous research has shown that the nitrogen containing moiety in dopants and supports e g tma and pi respectively generates nitrosamines hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 briefly chloramine may generate reaction intermediates like dimethylhydrazine type compounds and n centered like nh2 radicals through nucleophilic substitution on dma following oxidation with aqueous o2 n peroxyl radicals are formed which are the source of the ndma nitroso bond scheme 1b as a result residual dopants and terminal moieties on the surface of engineered tio2 may react with chloramine to form ndma scheme 1c corresponding to the observations shown in fig 2 and fig 4 in the case of m tio2 leached metal ions from dopants rather than tio2 itself played an important role in the formation of ndma the icp results showed that the concentrations of leached cu cd and pb from the respective m tio2 samples were up to 80 µg l 1 within this concentration range a synergetic effect was observed between the metal ion and ndma fp while the effect of ti on ndma formation was negligible fig s11 this agrees with other chloramination studies which have indicated the enhancement of ndma fp via the generation of a metal chloramine complex e g cu ii nh2cl and metal nitroso complexes e g cdono liu et al 2016 zhang and andrews 2013 in particular nhcl2 which is derived from the metal chloramine complex fig s3 and is a better nucleophilic substitution of dma than nh2cl huang et al 2018 can accelerate ndma formation schreiber and mitch 2006 zhang and andrews 2013 scheme 1d illustrates a plausible ndma formation mechanism from the chloramination of m tio2 notably however the presence of nitrite has a strong influence on the release of n2o3 from metal nitroso complexes liu et al 2016 to qualitatively identify the role of n2o3 we conducted a chloramination experiment in the presence of 1 mm nitrite dma 10 µg l 1 cd 100 µg l 1 nh2cl 5 0 mg cl2 l 1 ph 8 0 and 24 h however the presence of nitrite had no effect on ndma formation data not shown indicating that n2o3 formation via cdono complexes was not likely a pathway underlying enhanced ndma formation 3 5 nitrosamine formation after photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination tio2 photocatalysis is a powerful tool for micropollutants remediation table s2 and s4 however engineered tio2 photocatalysts could alleviate or intensify nitrosamine fp under conditions relevant to water treatment conditions leached metal ions from dopants or impurities in polymeric supports could exacerbate the nitrosamine level in post chloramination especially when tio2 photocatalysis was employed as a pretreatment strategy therefore we evaluated the impact of engineered tio2 on the generation of nitrosamines from photocatalytic pretreatment of mclr and subsequent chloramination the chloramination of mclr without photocatalyst produced five major nitrosamines including ndma nmea npyr ndpa and ndba after 72 h of chloramination fig s12 regardless of the type of water matrix di water or secondary effluent the maximum concentration of ndma generated from mclr was 53 1 ng l 1 while the other nitrosamines were generated at concentrations between 13 7 and 33 4 ng l 1 fig s12 when photodegradation of mclr preceded chloramination the formation of nitrosamines varied significantly compared to that in the control chloramination of mclr without photocatalysis the concentration of ndma in di water decreased by 13 8 and 8 4 in the pretreatment using cnt tio2 and tma tio2 respectively fig 5 a the generation of other nitrosamines was markedly reduced up to 44 2 by both cnt tio2 and tma tio2 similarly the pretreatment with tea tio2 reduced the generation of the majority of nitrosamines in di water nonetheless pretreatment with cnt tma and tea tio2 was less effective for reducing nitrosamine fps in secondary effluent during post chloramination fig 5b a considerably higher amount of npyr and nmea were formed after the photocatalytic pretreatment of mclr with 1em and 2em tio2 the levels of ndma and nmea and ndpa fps were moderately alleviated in both di water and secondary effluent fig 5 the pretreatment of mclr using urea tio2 reduced nitrosamine fp up to 79 and 62 8 in di water and secondary effluent respectively the pretreatment with pd tio2 resulted in a substantial reduction in ndma fp 68 and nmea fp 71 while a marginal decrease of ndba ndpa and nypr fp was observed in both di water and secondary effluent in both pure and complex water conditions analogous irradiation with cu cd and pb tio2 enhanced nitrosamines fp up to 2 4 1 5 and 1 7 fold respectively compared to that in untreated controls fig 5 these results suggest that the enhanced formation of nitrosamines is mostly due to leached metal ions and nitrogen containing moieties from dopants even in actual secondary effluent samples the leached metal ions show increased nitrosamine generation therefore to mitigate the adverse effect of photocatalytic treatment using engineered tio2 their stability in the water treatment process must be addressed the interaction between chloramine and dopants must be further elucidated especially when tio2 is doped with metals and longer n alkyl chains additional strategies for the end user for engineered tio2 such as pre purification excessive washing and immobilization with ndma free supports should be considered 3 6 minimizing nitrosamine generation driven by engineered tio2 photocatalysis to develop an effective strategy for minimizing nitrosamine formation from engineered tio2 pre purification with cnt urea cu and pd tio2 was evaluated the photocatalytic degradation of mclr with doped tio2 was followed by chloramination the formation of nitrosamines was investigated for four cycles all doped tio2 samples exhibited excellent performance for photocatalytic oxidation of mclr in the four cycles fig 6 a d the maximum ndma fp of each cycle was maintained at almost the same level for urea and pd tio2 samples however the ndma fp marginally increased for cnt tio2 and cu tio2 samples excessive pre purification of doped tio2 samples removed a significant amount of nitrosamine the nitrosamine concentration of washed cnts and amine based polymers was significantly lower than that of the unwashed samples park et al 2009 verdugo et al 2014 however excessive washing influenced the photocatalytic activity during the recovery of spent doped tio2 samples fig 6 which requires further study overall urea tio2 outperformed cnt and other m tio2 samples in terms of mclr degradation performance and ndma fp even after pre purification tio2 immobilization on metallic supports such as ss was promising for nitrosamine fp reduction although a slight decrease in mclr degradation efficiency was observed fig 7 in contrast to the doped tio2 in a slurry texture immobilized cnt tio2 fig 7a and cu tio2 fig 7b contributed less to the formation of ndma that was leached or produced in chloraminated water however under polymeric supports such as pi the immobilized photocatalyst could deteriorate the nitrosamine fp during chloramination fig 7 restricting potential applications in real water treatment the selected dopant and supports should enable optimizing the engineered tio2 for better performance without increasing nitrosamine fp overall the nitrosamine yields for n tio2 and cnt tio2 samples are very similar to that reported for the chloramination of nitrogen containing precursors and other amine functional constituents hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 li et al 2017 the concentrations of nitrosamines obtained from cu tio2 were 42 3 fold higher than the regulatory limits of 3 10 ng l 1 for epa and california respectively california environmental protection agency 2006 munch and bassett 2004 the contributions of engineered tio2 to nitrosamine formation outweigh the potential risks of long term use which need immediate action furthermore the stability and reusability of engineered tio2 are important properties in environmental feasibility a careful selection of dopants and supports in the production of engineered tio2 is necessary to minimize the problems associated with nitrosamine formation 4 conclusion we investigated the nitrosamine fp of various engineered tio2 samples during photocatalysis in di secondary effluent and chloraminated water conditions most of the engineered tio2 samples exhibited a significant impact on nitrosamine formation among the six different types of non metal doped tio2 photocatalysts the highest levels of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodiethylamine n nitrosopyrrolidine and n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea were leached in carbon nanotubes triethylamine 2 ethylimidazole and 1 ethyl 1 methylpyrrolidinium doped tio2 samples respectively metal doped tio2 photocatalysts such as cu cd and pb tio2 enhanced the formation of ndma from photodegradation and post chloramination of microcystin lr the metal ions and nitrogen containing moieties leached from dopants and supports on engineered tio2 were responsible for nitrosamine formation during post chloramination compared to tio2 coated steel mesh polymer supported tio2s i e tio2 patterned polyamide film and tio2 coated poly vinylpyrrolidone flat sheet were significant precursors for ndma and nmea respectively pre purification washing of doped tio2 samples reduced ndma fp in general and was particularly effective for carbon and nitrogen doped tio2 the nitrosamine yields from doped and immobilized tio2 samples 5 2 to 85 ng l 1 were very similar to those reported for chloramination of nitrogen containing organic precursors the stability assessment of doped and immobilized engineered nanomaterials should be accompanied by an evaluation of their photocatalytic applications such as water disinfection and

15159,immobilized and visible light active titanium dioxide tio2 is widely used for water treatment however the accelerated generation of degradation byproducts is a potential risk of tio2 based photocatalysis this study aimed to investigate the structural effect of engineered tio2 samples on the formation of major nitrosamines during photocatalysis the nitrogen containing impurities and leached metal ions from doped tio2 samples could exacerbate nitrosamine formation potential fp in distilled water secondary effluent and chloraminated water doped tio2 with 2 ethylimidazole trimethylamine triethylamine and n carbon nanotubes could leach in the range of 47 64 ng l 1 nitrosamines including n nitrosomethylethylamine n nitrosodiethylamine n nitrosodimethylamine and n nitrosopyrrolidine even under dark conditions furthermore we investigated the role of metal dopants on nitrosamine fp during the chloramination of precursors such as dimethylamine and microcystin lr metal ions such as cu that leached from the metal doped catalysts may catalyze the nitrosamine fp therefore pre purification washing and immobilization of doped tio2 samples on substrates are suggested to remove a considerable amount of nitrosamines however during the prolonged tryout the selection of substrates was critical polymeric supports such as polyimide and polyvinylpyrrolidone can produce up to 85 ng l 1 nitrosamine whereas tio2 immobilized onto steel mesh can remove nitrosamine formation during photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination this study systematically screened a diverse range of dopants supports and solvents in engineered tio2 photocatalysts in 61 samples and provided novel insights into their effect on nitrosamine formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalysis doped titanium dioxide nitrosamine immobilization chloramination data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction titanium dioxide tio2 is the most studied and prevalent photoactive engineered nanomaterial tio2 based photocatalysis is a sustainable and green remedy method due to its simple and inexpensive operation with excellent performance keller and lazareva 2014 schneider et al 2014 srikanth et al 2017 studies have focused on improving the practical applicability of tio2 such as recyclability and visible light activity immobilization of tio2 on metal and polymeric substrates was found to improve the stability and recovery of spent nano sized tio2 srikanth et al 2017 moreover doping defect control and functionalization of tio2 with various metals copper and non metals carbon nanotubes cnts increase its performance by controlling band structures and extending light absorbance asahi et al 2014 park et al 2013 a variety of doped and immobilized engineered tio2 catalysts is widely employed in aqueous environments these are highly efficient in the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and abatement of pollutants schneider et al 2019 triantis et al 2012 yang et al 2020 tio2 based photocatalytic disinfection and or decontamination shows great promise for water purification schneider et al 2014 srikanth et al 2017 the use of uv tio2 before chlorination improves disinfection while maintaining the required chlorine residual concentrations in potable water systems richardson et al 1996 rodríguez et al 2018 more recently adding chlorine to a uv tio2 system was found to increase the rate of water decontamination by several orders of magnitude compared to a sole photocatalytic system zhang et al 2022 however the adverse effect of intensifying the formation of degradation disinfection byproducts dbps is a potential risk of photocatalysis particularly for the use of uv tio2 in drinking water where water dechlor am ination is expected photocatalysis can trigger the formation of dbps by a direct oxidative transformation of potential surrogates to dbps for instance richardson et al identified a single carbonaceous dbp 3 methyl 2 4 hexanedione during photocatalytic treatment of drinking water richardson et al 1996 when chlorine is used as a secondary disinfectant post chlorination several halogenated and carbonaceous dbps trihalomethane and haloacetic acid are generated gora et al 2018 metch et al 2015 richardson et al 1996 selcuk et al 2006 tugulea et al 2014 nevertheless no previous study has addressed the structural impact of engineered tio2 on emerging dbps such as nitrosamines n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which have a higher carcinogenic potential and negative effects on human health munch and bassett 2004 various inorganic metals and organic molecules carbon and nitrogen are used as dopants and substrates for the structural modification of engineered tio2 metals such as copper and palladium and organics including cnts activated carbon and nitrogen containing compounds such as trimethylamine tma ionic liquids and diethanolamine dea are used as dopants of tio2 photocatalyst asahi et al 2014 park et al 2013 a majority of these dopants themselves are a possible source of nitrosamines during chloramination hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 vander meulen et al 2020 verdugo et al 2014 zhang and andrews 2013 nitrogen containing polymeric substrates are used in immobilizing tio2 nanoparticles these can cause nitrosamine formation during the chloramination ersan et al 2015 li et al 2017 the release of leachable constituents from doped immobilized tio2 during photocatalysis could cause nitrosamine formation with the extensive development of engineered tio2 using various inorganic organic dopants and substrates a systematic investigation of their nitrosamine formation potential fp should be demonstrated to this end we investigated the potential formation of nitrosamines during tio2 based photocatalysis a total of 61 samples with a variety of commonly used dopants supports and solvents for the production of engineered tio2 photocatalyst were screened for nitrosamine fp during chloramination in comparison with dimethylamine dma as a control ndma precursor to mimic water treatment scenarios chloramination with a higher nitrosamine yield was chosen as a secondary oxidant furthermore the photocatalytic performance of engineered tio2 samples with selected dopants and supports was evaluated given the release of nitrosamines under different light conditions finally the effects of pre purification washing and substrate immobilization of doped tio2 on their photocatalytic performance against microcystin lr mclr and the consequent nitrosamine fp with subsequent chloramination in pure water and secondary wastewater effluent were investigated 2

di with 10 mg of powder samples per liter or 2 5 5 0 cm2 pieces of immobilized samples corresponding to 14 mg l 1 without a ph adjustment initial ph 5 7 six 4 w fluorescence 350 650 nm philips co poland and blacklight blue lamps uva 350 400 nm f10t8 sankyo denki japan were used as visible and uv light sources respectively the light intensity was 0 67 mw cm 2 for visible light driven photocatalysis a uv cut off filter blocking light below 400 nm was used 2 3 analysis of nitrosamine formation 2 3 1 pre screening of dopants and supports for nitrosamine formation nitrosamine formation was determined according to uniform formation conditions the chloramination procedures were performed as previously described with a slight modification using chloramination conditions krasner et al 2018 in typical batch chloramination 5 0 mg cl2 l 1 preformed nh2cl experiments targeted compounds such as cnts solvents polymers ionic liquids 100 µg l 1 metals 25 µg l 1 metal oxides 15 µg l 1 and substrate materials stainless steel chitosan film nylon film carbon cloth and silica gel in 2 5 5 cm2 size were incubated under dark condition at a ph of 8 0 10 mm phosphate buffer for 72 h with or without 10 µg l 1 dma selected as a benchmark precursor these materials were selected based on their frequent application in the production of engineered tio2 keller and lazareva 2014 schneider et al 2014 srikanth et al 2017 the initial dma and metal oxide concentrations used in this study were of the same order of magnitude as the average values detected in surface waters and wastewater effluents keller and lazareva 2014 lee and son 2019 pandey et al 2019 the initial polymers and ionic liquids concentrations were selected to ensure the generation of nitrosamine at measurable levels 2 3 2 nitrosamine release and or formation from engineered tio2 samples under different light conditions nitrosamine release and or formation from engineered tio2 samples was evaluated through sonicating tio2 samples as proposed earlier with certain modifications verdugo et al 2014 briefly tio2 samples 10 mg l 1 powder or 2 5 5 0 cm2 immobilized catalyst i e 14 mg l 1 were subjected to sonication and successive light irradiation in di and chloraminated waters the chloraminated water condition was used to assess the formation of nitrosamines from the reaction between chloramine and tio2 samples to ensure the generation of nitrosamine under sonication and light irradiation conditions a control batch with dma was sonicated and subjected to light irradiation with and without tio2 samples a bath type sonicator jac ultrasonic 2010 kodo korea was operated at 40 khz for 4 h the light irradiation conditions were varied to examine light induced acceleration and or degradation of nitrosamines after the sonication ph 7 0 and at a temperature of 30 ºc tio2 samples were subjected to light illumination for 2 h under different light conditions dark visible light and uv illumination using 4 w fluorescence and blacklight blue lamps finally 15 ml samples were withdrawn and quenched with excess thiosulfate prior to nitrosamine analysis for quantification of leached metal concentration in the reaction solution ti and other metal dopants aliquots 20 0 ml were withdrawn from the reactor acidified and analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes agilent 730 series usa to show the stability of immobilized tio2 used sonicated and uv irradiated and unused samples were dried at 60 c and analyzed using the eclipse ni series

nitrosamine formation under photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination conditions to simulate the realistic water disinfection conditions nitrosamine formation was assessed during photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination post chloramination in a typical experiment the targeted engineered tio2 samples were used for photodegradation of mclr mclr 20 µg l 1 catalyst load 10 mg l 1 and or 2 5 5 0 cm2 pieces of immobilized tio2 samples i e 14 mg l 1 ph 5 7 and 2 h visible light irradiation after 2 h light irradiation the reaction solution was centrifuged to remove the spent catalyst subsequently the samples were quenched with chloramine and incubated as described in section 2 3 1 further to show the nitrosamine formation in repeated cycles selected doped tio2 samples were subjected to four cycles of photocatalysis against mclr after each cycle the reaction solution was quenched with chloramine and incubated for 72 h for nitrosamine analysis to elucidate the impact of pretreatment of the doped tio2 samples before photocatalysis the as prepared samples were additionally purified through four centrifugal washes the pre purified doped tio2 samples were compared to their immobilized and pristine doped analogs 2 4 analytical methods in si text s3 table s1 and fig s1 detailed analytical methods for measuring chloramines mclr nitrosamines and dissolved organic carbon concentrations are presented 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of dopants and supports for nitrosamine formation potential fig 1a shows the observed ndma formation from single metal and metal oxides in chloraminated water with and without dma respectively in the absence of dma as a precursor metals and metal oxides produced insignificant amounts of ndma fig 1a notably a control experiment without metal oxide s in chloraminated water showed the ndma concentration of 2 5 ng l 1 which is the level for a limit of quantitation fig s2 in contrast the ndma concentrations from metal oxide s are substantially influenced by the presence of dma fig 1a the control batch without metal oxide s produced ndma up to 33 1 ng l 1 by chloramination of dma fig s2 therefore some metals exhibit accelerated ndma formation after preliminary screening among the tested metals cd hg cu and pb showed a high tendency to enhance ndma fp producing a maximum of 145 ng l 1 from cu fig 1a in line with earlier reports liu et al 2016 zhang and andrews 2013 enhanced formation of ndma in the presence of metals like cd hg cu and pb is attributed to the metal catalyzed decomposition of nh2cl and the formation of dichloramine nhcl2 schreiber and mitch 2006 zhang and andrews 2013 liu et al 2016 indeed the presence of these metals in nh2cl solutions significantly increased the concentration of nhcl2 fig s3 notably ndma formed in nhcl2 solution was equivalent to ndma formed in nh2cl with metals e g cu and cd fig s4 indicating that the metal triggered nhcl2 generation played a critical role in enhanced ndma formation huang et al 2018 other metal oxide s ag mg ca tio2 and ceo2 did not exhibit any significant effects on ndma fp however some metals pd mn and fe and metal oxides nife2o4 cuo and mno2 specifically hindered the ndma fp of dma exhibiting a lower ndma concentration compared to that in the control batch without any metals fig s2 the decreased ndma formation due to the sorption of precursors on metal oxides like cuo has also been reported by zhang and andrews 2013 notably with dma as a precursor ndma was the major nitrosamine while other nitrosamines such as n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr nnitrosodi n propylamine ndpa n nitrosodiethylamine ndea and n nitrosodi n butylamine ndba were not detected in line with earlier reports hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 organic dopants and supports such as nitrogen containing cnts dea 1em 2em tea tetramethylammonium tema tma urea polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp sheet chitosan film polyimide pi film polyacrylonitrile pan fabric and nylon film directly generated a variety of nitrosamines including ndma nmea ndea and npyr 5 6 153 7 ng l 1 regardless of the presence of dma fig 1b indicating that organic dopants and supports themselves can play a role as nitrosamine precursors however nitrosamine fps were not observed for quartz activated carbon cloth stainless steel ss mesh silica gel polystyrene alginate and glass beads as readily expected trace amounts of ndma were found in chloraminated poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf mat samples despite the high durability the trace ndma concentration from pvdf samples is probably derived from residual solvents such as dimethylformamide dmf and dimethylacetamide dmc which generate ndma upon chloramination hinneh et al 2019 therefore based on the preliminary results metals pd cu cd and pb non metals cnts as carbon precursor and urea tea tma 1me and 2me as nitrogen precursor and substrates ss pvdf pvp and pi were selected for further doping and immobilizing studies to fabricate the engineered tio2 samples 3 2 photocatalytic activity of engineered tio2 with selected dopants and substrates the fabricated tio2 samples were subjected to photodegradation of mclr to evaluate their intrinsic catalytic performance table s2 presents mclr degradation by engineered tio2 samples under uv and visible light irradiation using slurry p25 bare tio2 under uv irradiation mclr was completely degraded within 15 min with a pseudo first order kinetics kobs constant of 0 24 min 1 this agrees with the results from earlier reports triantis et al 2012 yang et al 2020 however immobilized tio2 samples such as ss tio2 pi tio2 pvdf tio2 and pvp tio2 can easily remove mclr within 70 80 min of uv irradiation table s2 increased photocatalytic efficiency from slurry p25 can be attributed to increased contact opportunity between mclr and photocatalysts resulting in higher mass transfer and enhanced degradation efficiency ramasundaram et al 2015 the degradation efficacies of immobilized photocatalysts kobs 0 026 0 063 min 1 were higher than that of tio2 coated glass plate 0 012 0 059 min 1 antoniou et al 2009 and irradiated porous tio2 membrane 0 0035 min 1 schneider et al 2019 under visible light λ 400 nm bare tio2 showed negligible photocatalytic performance however the photocatalytic activity was markedly enhanced when various dopants were incorporated into p25 tio2 pd tio2 displayed the best photocatalytic activity against mclr followed by cnt tio2 urea tio2 and other doped tio2 samples in addition more than 90 degradation of mclr was observed with doped and immobilized tio2 photocatalysts such as pd ss tio2 within 240 min table s2 the higher activity of pd tio2 can be attributed to the formation of pd0 nanoparticles that can act as an active site for improved charge separation and transport lee et al 2015 the enhanced photocatalytic activity of pd tio2 was evidenced by an effective generation of reactive oxygen species ros fig s5 the possible mechanism of ros production and nitrosamine degradation on pd tio2 is presented in si text s4 5 table s3 4 and scheme s1 engineered tio2 samples with selected dopants and substrates were capable of eliminating mclr under both uv and visible light exposure despite the high photoactivity the stability of engineered tio2 is of particular concern with respect to nitrosamine and dbp formation therefore we assessed the impact of engineered tio2 samples on the generation of nitrosamine under various light conditions dark visible and uv illumination 3 3 effect of dopants and supports on nitrosamine formation under different light conditions 3 3 1 nitrogen and carbon doped tio2 photocatalysts fig 2 illustrates that n tio2 and c tio2 produced nitrosamines under various light conditions across a range of concentrations notably even under dark conditions in di water without dma addition cnt tio2 and tma tio2 leached 47 0 and 40 2 ng l 1 of ndma respectively while urea tio2 released less than 6 0 ng l 1 of ndma fig 2a tea tio2 mainly released ndea 10 3 ng l 1 however other nitrosamines were not detected fig s6 in contrast a variety of nitrosamines were detected from 2em and 1em doped tio2 samples npyr and nmea were released in significant amounts 23 ng l 1 from 2em tio2 compared to that from 1em tio2 15 6 ng l 1 nmea fig 2a less than 5 0 ng l 1 of ndma was detected in both 1em and 2em doped tio2 samples fig s6 with n tio2 and c tio2 samples almost identical ndma concentrations were observed with and without the addition of dma fig 2a and 2b demonstrating that modified tio2 samples with organic dopants are the primary source of leached nitrosamines further the doped tio2 samples produced slightly more nitrosamines in chloraminated water under dark conditions most likely due to the chloramination of residual dopant and terminal moieties in doped tio2 samples the concentrations of the four nitrosamines in chloraminated water ranged from 14 1 to 68 3 ng l 1 and 10 4 63 6 ng l 1 with and without dma respectively fig 2c and 2d when as prepared doped tio2 samples were subjected to light irradiation fewer nitrosamines were leached in both di and chloraminated water conditions in the presence of uv irradiation the detected maximum nitrosamine level from the cnt tio2 samples 31 ng l 1 was much lower than that in the absence of light irradiation 47 ng l 1 in di water fig 2a and b in contrast the variation of the nitrosamine concentration under the visible light irradiation was marginal 45 6 ng l 1 further the maximum nitrosamine concentration in chloraminated water fig 2c and d was lower in the uv irradiated cnt tio2 samples 36 8 ng l 1 than that in the samples exposed to visible light 59 6 ng l 1 the observed decrease in the nitrosamine concentration under uv irradiation could be attributed to the photolysis of nitrosamines lee et al 2005 although varied the high level of nitrosamine concentrations in the solutions with n tio2 and c tio2 samples could have originated from the nitrogen containing moiety in the dopants or impurities that behave as an ndma precursor in a study by verdugo et al amide and polymer functionalized cnts leached more ndma than aminated cnts verdugo et al 2014 additionally tea with longer alkyl chains showed relatively lower molar yields of nitrosamine compared to that from tma during chloramination kodamatani et al 2021 it is possible that the differences in the nitrosamine yields resulting from 2em tio2 and 1em tio2 caused the differences in the photochemical transformation rates of the imidazolium and pyrrolidinium cation moieties respectively the results from vander meulen et al also showed trace nitrosamine yields from chloraminated ionic liquids with imidazolium moieties than from pyrrolidinium cation derived ionic liquids van der meulen et al 2020 therefore the sub structure of the dopants having nitrogen containing moiety is the driving factor for nitrosamine formation and nitrosamines are likely to be formed as a surface product from the impurities included during the catalyst preparation such as the doping and drying process to support the effect of the preparation processes we compared as received powders cnts and urea were chosen as representatives and as prepared tio2 samples with and without drying the concentrations of leached ndma were significant for the cnts up to 22 ng l 1 while only negligible nitrosamine release was observed for the as received urea powders fig s7 verdugo et al 2014 reported the release of ndma from as received cnt powders up to 60 µg l 1 presumably ndma originates as a residue from the nitrogen containing surface group during cnt manufacturing verdugo et al 2014 notably after drying both as received cnt and urea powders and as prepared tio2 samples generated up to 47 0 ng l 1 ndma indicating the effect of thermal treatment of tio2 on ndma formation abe et al 2020 however we found no evidence of quantifiably leached nitrosamines with undoped p25 tio2 fig s7 the observed difference suggests that post modification of tio2 samples with nitrogen containing constituents can induce the formation of nitrosamine on the surface of tio2 samples however this must be further elucidated 3 3 2 metal doped tio2 photocatalysts m tio2 by themselves did not generate leach quantifiable levels of nitrosamines e g ndma in both di and chloraminated water matrixes fig 3 a c where the ndma levels were not greater than 2 5 ng l 1 which is similar to that in the raw di water in the m tio2 samples the ndma formation was significantly hindered under light exposure however their effect on ndma formation was more pronounced when the ndma precursor e g dma was available in chloraminated water fig 3d regardless of light irradiation m tio2 samples such as cd pb and cu tio2 displayed a noticeable increase in ndma concentrations and they catalytically enhanced the ndma fp fig 3d the mean ndma fp of dma was significantly increased by 1 9 2 5 and 3 2 folds in the presence of cd tio2 pb tio2 and cu tio2 respectively compared to that in dma chloramination alone 33 1 ng l 1 fig s2 in contrast ndma formation was likely inhibited by pd tio2 samples while bare tio2 samples produced considerable ndma fp fig 3d the reduction of ndma fp by pd tio2 can be attributed to the adsorption of ndma itself on the catalytic surface chen et al 2016 and nh2cl decay over time fig s3 as shown in fig s8 in the presence of pd tio2 ndma concentrations decreased with increasing contact time however in the absence of pd tio2 samples the concentration of ndma rapidly reached a plateau within 24 h 3 3 3 immobilized tio2 photocatalysts fig 4 depicts the concentration of nitrosamine in the leachate from immobilized tio2 photocatalysts which were sonicated in di and chlorinated water with and without the addition of dma in the ss tio2 samples no significant nitrosamines were found in both di and chloraminated water conditions regardless of light illumination fig 4a c even with the presence of dma in chloraminated water fig 4d ndma formation from ss tio2 was relatively low which further decreased under light irradiation in contrast polymer supported tio2 samples are unsuitable in terms of nitrosamine formation because significant increases in nitrosamine were observed during the prolonged tryout in chloraminated water trace nitrosamines were leached or generated from polymer supported tio2 samples after uv irradiation in di water fig 4a and 4b however amine containing polymer supported tio2 samples such as pvp tio2 and pi tio2 formed up to 70 ng l 1 nmea and 85 ng l 1 ndma respectively in chloraminated water even without the presence of dma fig 4c d notably the trace concentration of ndma in pvdf tio2 was likely derived from residual solvents corresponding to the result from bare pvdf fig 1d in contrast the interaction between free radicals and n moieties in the polymer matrix is liable for the generation of nitrosamines in di water for pvp tio2 and pi tio2 particularly under light exposure amine containing compounds can be partially oxidized to nitroso functionalities in chloraminated water and promote nitrosamine formation soltermann et al 2013 ss tio2 and pi tio2 were selected and their structural changes were identified using optical microscopy fe sem and ftir unused samples were nearly clear and free from surface defects or ti metal corrosion fig s9a however after the samples were exposed to chloraminated water rusty grain like boundaries appeared on the surface of the pi tio2 samples clearly demonstrating that chloramination induced physical damage to the supported tio2 samples sem studies supported the microscopic results fig s9b compared to unused pi tio2 with a smooth and bright rice like tio2 the recycled samples showed disorganized and scattered tio2 nanoparticles icp oes analysis detected up to 23 3 μg l 1 of leached ti in the effluent from pi tio2 table s5 indicating that the polymer supported tio2 system is not reusable in contrast there was no physical damage or leaching of metal particles from the ss tio2 samples and a nearly identical morphology was observed ftir spectra also support the high stability of ss tio2 fig s10 where broadband changes in the regions of 830 450 cm 1 metal oxygen stretching vibrations as ti o ti ti o gabelich et al 2005 zhang et al 2018 and 1080 cm 1 ti o c bridging vibrations were negligible unlike ss tio2 polymer supported tio2 samples were more susceptible to photochemical oxidation and lost their stability this resulted in the formation of trace nitrosamines during chloramination this was consistent with the observations from earlier studies chloramine promotes the oxidative degradation of polymers pvp and pi and changes their morphological properties dasilva et al 2006 gabelich et al 2005 the products served as precursors for chlorinated byproducts such as nitrosamines ersan et al 2015 xie et al 2015 3 4 the proposed mechanism for nitrosamine release and formation from engineered tio2 scheme 1 displays the proposed mechanism for nitrosamine e g ndma release and or formation from the engineered tio2 broadly consistent with the previous mechanistic findings liu et al 2016 spahr et al 2017 according to our results ndma can be produced by engineered tio2 with non metallic dopants and support e g c n doped tio2 and pi tio2 via two distinct mechanisms first nitrosamines can be formed from the c and n tio2 samples with organic impurities and gradually leach into the solution via hydrolysis scheme 1a this is supported by the findings as shown in fig 2a and fig s7 indicating that nitrosamines can be found in as prepared engineered tio2 even in the absence of chloramine second previous research has shown that the nitrogen containing moiety in dopants and supports e g tma and pi respectively generates nitrosamines hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 briefly chloramine may generate reaction intermediates like dimethylhydrazine type compounds and n centered like nh2 radicals through nucleophilic substitution on dma following oxidation with aqueous o2 n peroxyl radicals are formed which are the source of the ndma nitroso bond scheme 1b as a result residual dopants and terminal moieties on the surface of engineered tio2 may react with chloramine to form ndma scheme 1c corresponding to the observations shown in fig 2 and fig 4 in the case of m tio2 leached metal ions from dopants rather than tio2 itself played an important role in the formation of ndma the icp results showed that the concentrations of leached cu cd and pb from the respective m tio2 samples were up to 80 µg l 1 within this concentration range a synergetic effect was observed between the metal ion and ndma fp while the effect of ti on ndma formation was negligible fig s11 this agrees with other chloramination studies which have indicated the enhancement of ndma fp via the generation of a metal chloramine complex e g cu ii nh2cl and metal nitroso complexes e g cdono liu et al 2016 zhang and andrews 2013 in particular nhcl2 which is derived from the metal chloramine complex fig s3 and is a better nucleophilic substitution of dma than nh2cl huang et al 2018 can accelerate ndma formation schreiber and mitch 2006 zhang and andrews 2013 scheme 1d illustrates a plausible ndma formation mechanism from the chloramination of m tio2 notably however the presence of nitrite has a strong influence on the release of n2o3 from metal nitroso complexes liu et al 2016 to qualitatively identify the role of n2o3 we conducted a chloramination experiment in the presence of 1 mm nitrite dma 10 µg l 1 cd 100 µg l 1 nh2cl 5 0 mg cl2 l 1 ph 8 0 and 24 h however the presence of nitrite had no effect on ndma formation data not shown indicating that n2o3 formation via cdono complexes was not likely a pathway underlying enhanced ndma formation 3 5 nitrosamine formation after photocatalytic oxidation followed by chloramination tio2 photocatalysis is a powerful tool for micropollutants remediation table s2 and s4 however engineered tio2 photocatalysts could alleviate or intensify nitrosamine fp under conditions relevant to water treatment conditions leached metal ions from dopants or impurities in polymeric supports could exacerbate the nitrosamine level in post chloramination especially when tio2 photocatalysis was employed as a pretreatment strategy therefore we evaluated the impact of engineered tio2 on the generation of nitrosamines from photocatalytic pretreatment of mclr and subsequent chloramination the chloramination of mclr without photocatalyst produced five major nitrosamines including ndma nmea npyr ndpa and ndba after 72 h of chloramination fig s12 regardless of the type of water matrix di water or secondary effluent the maximum concentration of ndma generated from mclr was 53 1 ng l 1 while the other nitrosamines were generated at concentrations between 13 7 and 33 4 ng l 1 fig s12 when photodegradation of mclr preceded chloramination the formation of nitrosamines varied significantly compared to that in the control chloramination of mclr without photocatalysis the concentration of ndma in di water decreased by 13 8 and 8 4 in the pretreatment using cnt tio2 and tma tio2 respectively fig 5 a the generation of other nitrosamines was markedly reduced up to 44 2 by both cnt tio2 and tma tio2 similarly the pretreatment with tea tio2 reduced the generation of the majority of nitrosamines in di water nonetheless pretreatment with cnt tma and tea tio2 was less effective for reducing nitrosamine fps in secondary effluent during post chloramination fig 5b a considerably higher amount of npyr and nmea were formed after the photocatalytic pretreatment of mclr with 1em and 2em tio2 the levels of ndma and nmea and ndpa fps were moderately alleviated in both di water and secondary effluent fig 5 the pretreatment of mclr using urea tio2 reduced nitrosamine fp up to 79 and 62 8 in di water and secondary effluent respectively the pretreatment with pd tio2 resulted in a substantial reduction in ndma fp 68 and nmea fp 71 while a marginal decrease of ndba ndpa and nypr fp was observed in both di water and secondary effluent in both pure and complex water conditions analogous irradiation with cu cd and pb tio2 enhanced nitrosamines fp up to 2 4 1 5 and 1 7 fold respectively compared to that in untreated controls fig 5 these results suggest that the enhanced formation of nitrosamines is mostly due to leached metal ions and nitrogen containing moieties from dopants even in actual secondary effluent samples the leached metal ions show increased nitrosamine generation therefore to mitigate the adverse effect of photocatalytic treatment using engineered tio2 their stability in the water treatment process must be addressed the interaction between chloramine and dopants must be further elucidated especially when tio2 is doped with metals and longer n alkyl chains additional strategies for the end user for engineered tio2 such as pre purification excessive washing and immobilization with ndma free supports should be considered 3 6 minimizing nitrosamine generation driven by engineered tio2 photocatalysis to develop an effective strategy for minimizing nitrosamine formation from engineered tio2 pre purification with cnt urea cu and pd tio2 was evaluated the photocatalytic degradation of mclr with doped tio2 was followed by chloramination the formation of nitrosamines was investigated for four cycles all doped tio2 samples exhibited excellent performance for photocatalytic oxidation of mclr in the four cycles fig 6 a d the maximum ndma fp of each cycle was maintained at almost the same level for urea and pd tio2 samples however the ndma fp marginally increased for cnt tio2 and cu tio2 samples excessive pre purification of doped tio2 samples removed a significant amount of nitrosamine the nitrosamine concentration of washed cnts and amine based polymers was significantly lower than that of the unwashed samples park et al 2009 verdugo et al 2014 however excessive washing influenced the photocatalytic activity during the recovery of spent doped tio2 samples fig 6 which requires further study overall urea tio2 outperformed cnt and other m tio2 samples in terms of mclr degradation performance and ndma fp even after pre purification tio2 immobilization on metallic supports such as ss was promising for nitrosamine fp reduction although a slight decrease in mclr degradation efficiency was observed fig 7 in contrast to the doped tio2 in a slurry texture immobilized cnt tio2 fig 7a and cu tio2 fig 7b contributed less to the formation of ndma that was leached or produced in chloraminated water however under polymeric supports such as pi the immobilized photocatalyst could deteriorate the nitrosamine fp during chloramination fig 7 restricting potential applications in real water treatment the selected dopant and supports should enable optimizing the engineered tio2 for better performance without increasing nitrosamine fp overall the nitrosamine yields for n tio2 and cnt tio2 samples are very similar to that reported for the chloramination of nitrogen containing precursors and other amine functional constituents hinneh et al 2019 kodamatani et al 2021 li et al 2017 the concentrations of nitrosamines obtained from cu tio2 were 42 3 fold higher than the regulatory limits of 3 10 ng l 1 for epa and california respectively california environmental protection agency 2006 munch and bassett 2004 the contributions of engineered tio2 to nitrosamine formation outweigh the potential risks of long term use which need immediate action furthermore the stability and reusability of engineered tio2 are important properties in environmental feasibility a careful selection of dopants and supports in the production of engineered tio2 is necessary to minimize the problems associated with nitrosamine formation 4 conclusion we investigated the nitrosamine fp of various engineered tio2 samples during photocatalysis in di secondary effluent and chloraminated water conditions most of the engineered tio2 samples exhibited a significant impact on nitrosamine formation among the six different types of non metal doped tio2 photocatalysts the highest levels of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodiethylamine n nitrosopyrrolidine and n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea were leached in carbon nanotubes triethylamine 2 ethylimidazole and 1 ethyl 1 methylpyrrolidinium doped tio2 samples respectively metal doped tio2 photocatalysts such as cu cd and pb tio2 enhanced the formation of ndma from photodegradation and post chloramination of microcystin lr the metal ions and nitrogen containing moieties leached from dopants and supports on engineered tio2 were responsible for nitrosamine formation during post chloramination compared to tio2 coated steel mesh polymer supported tio2s i e tio2 patterned polyamide film and tio2 coated poly vinylpyrrolidone flat sheet were significant precursors for ndma and nmea respectively pre purification washing of doped tio2 samples reduced ndma fp in general and was particularly effective for carbon and nitrogen doped tio2 the nitrosamine yields from doped and immobilized tio2 samples 5 2 to 85 ng l 1 were very similar to those reported for chloramination of nitrogen containing organic precursors the stability assessment of doped and immobilized engineered nanomaterials should be accompanied by an evaluation of their photocatalytic applications such as water disinfection and
