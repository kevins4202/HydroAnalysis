sustainable development policies in a manner compatible with legally defined mining transformations depending on the initial morphology of the mine subsidence area mining can lead to the transformation of the aquatic environment including the occurrence of floods inundated lands water logging surface drying and or the threat of flooding this concerns artificially drained mining and post mining areas and may result from the restoration of free water flows turning off pumping stations this article refers specifically to the permanent flooding and or threat of flooding of parts of mine subsidence areas in active mine subsidence areas of hard coal mines the surface relief is permanently subsided for this reason the identified flood hazards only have short term relevance special hydromorphological elements of the environment of artificially drained mine subsidence areas first formulated by the author can set new standards of quality in environmental policies the paper contains a description of the most important of these the base of natural outflow of water the normal hydrometric reference point the relative elevations of the surface of the mine subsidence areas

subsidence area s relief used to assess the threat of flooding the novel elements have a range of applications including flood insurance flood risk management water management remediation of mining damage and sustainable spatial planning additionally the method allows the qualification of existing and recoverable mineral resources for economic usability taking into account the needs of sustainable planning as well as responsible mining techniques keywords mining area threat of flooding numerical model of terrain water management spatial planning 1 introduction spatial planning in areas where underground mineral resources occur requires special and sound environmental policies the occurrence of such mineral deposits exploitation of which may bring economic benefits to mining companies and the mining region as a whole such as jobs and socio economic development requires national regional and local authorities to plan for coordinated development of many specifically identified environmental elements it should be noted that the exploitation of minerals is a public goal and interest in the legislation of many countries and should be subordinated to the good of individual citizens as well as smaller companies representing other non mining industries borecki et al 1980 fan et al 2012 marschalko et al 2014 ignacy 2018 depending on the existing ongoing and planned mining transformations of the environment spatial policy should be based on proper identification and planning of sustainable development policies in a manner compatible with legally defined mining transformations such conditions occur on the surface of hundreds of square kilometers in many countries where mining existed or exists and the mining areas are artificially drained these areas are usually densely urbanized borecki et al 1980 ignacy 2017b c the direct effect of underground mining are excavations mining works and post mining secondary voids generated by the collapse of rocks above and in the immediate vicinity of these mining works these voids in the form of fissures or caverns can move towards the surface of mine subsidence areas msa s in different time periods sometimes this process takes place within a year and sometimes it may last longer than 100 years rogoż and posyłek 2000 drobniewski and telenga 2011 it depends on the geological structure of the deposits and the depth of the mining works this phenomenon is accompanied by changes in hydrogeological and hydrological conditions such as drainage of the rock mass and surface inundation the end effect of the wandering of the post mining void on the surface of the msa s are subsidence basins depending on the initial morphology of the mining area mining induced subsidence can lead to the transformation of the aquatic environment on the surface this may manifest itself in the occurrence of floods inundated areas water logging surface drying pazdro 1983 rogoż and posyłek 2000 wilk ed al 2003 bukowski 2006 glȁßer et al 2010 wu and huang 2010 fan et al 2012 marschalko et al 2014 witthüser et al 2015 and the occurrence of the threat of flooding bukowski 1995 ignacy 2017 2018 ignacy and bukowski 2017 this last concerns artificially drained mining and post mining subsidence areas and may result from the restoration of free water flows after the cessation of pumping these issues have been the subject of numerous previous articles the accumulation of water and simulation of interaction between surface water and groundwater of mining subsidence basins were studied and described using different distributed hydrological models among others by sophocleous et al 1999 harbaugh et al modflow 2000 hughes and liu mike she 2008 they require various different factors and extensive and detailed data sets characterizing the environment of mining subsidence areas which are subject to permanent changes in surface and underground water flows difficulty in parameterization cartographic and geodesic methods for studying environmental changes have been described among others by jankowska and lisiewicz 1998 artugyan and urdea 2016 dacian paul 2017 who delineated methods of monitoring analyzing and controlling the land with the aid of digital elevation models of the terrain the threat of flooding on the surface of non mining areas was described by ni et al 2010 kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kia et al 2012 degiorgis et al 2012 2013 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 alvarez et al 2016 hydrological research methods for this hazard can be used without any limitations in the cases of post mining areas where the natural water flows have been completely restored and the full hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters has been reestablished hydrological research methods can be applied to active mining areas but requires good geological and hydrological reconnaissance it should be noted that in active underground hard coal mines the msa s surface relief is permanently subsided on the basis of the author s experiences the size of these subsidences often exceeds 0 2 m per day and in some areas of the surface may exceed 3 0 m during the year therefore in such msa s the identified surfaces characterized by different flood hazards only have short term validity and relevance the relatively shallow depth up to 100 m deep of exploited coal seams as well the impact of large scale mining causing the disruption of the hydro insulating characteristics of the original hydrogeologically covered overburden atop the deposits may lead to a partial interruption of surface water flows and even complete disappearance of surface waters photo 1 photo 2 and fig 1 it should be emphasized that forecasting deformations of the rock mass transformations of aquifers as well the surface is subject to errors lack of suitable methods of forecasting this in turn translates into errors in the modeling of groundwater and surface water flows in mining areas the ongoing and creeping urbanization of such areas additionally changes surface water flows to summarize surface subsidences in underground msas are often extensive and may exceed 30 m pazdro 1983 rogoż and posyłek 2000 popiołek 2009 the above aspects have contributed to the development of a novel method for assessing flood threats of a portion of the surface areas of the msa in which the surface elevations became the basic research material this article refers specifically to the permanent flooding and or threat of permanent flooding of msa s as one of the most important environmental aspects of such areas these phenomena have been identified in the form of one specific type of a potential reservoir which is the most important type of reservoir used in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of flood threat assessment in a msa ignacy 2017a the following chapters contain a detailed description of the four novel elements of this method this constitutes the most important part of this method this paper describes a novel and specific way of mapping the surface of the msa with the aid of these four elements in field assessments it has proven to be unquestionably useful for flood management repairing of mining damage and spatial planning development this approximate method has been developed as a supplement to probabilistic flood threat methods used to test many hydraulically connected msas the relief of which is subject to significant mining subsidences as well as mining drainage and or the transfer of water causing dynamic transformations of the aquatic environment in distributed hydrologic models the presented elements of this method can be used to provide a framework reference states for water levels at the places of their outflow from their respective msas the most important of these hydromorfological elements are described below 2 materials and methods in contrast to complex distributed hydrological models the hydromorphological and cartographic method for assessing the threat of flooding of artificially drained msa ignacy 2017a elaborated by the author of the article is simple to apply and to use it describes the surface water flows and parameterizes the types of innundations potential water reservoirs by examining and referring to the characteristic hydrological water levels at the site of water outflow from the msa the method has been successfully tried and tested in a number of msas in poland one of the reference areas for the above mentioned survey method is the szczyglowice msa located in the central part of the upper silesian coal basin fig 1 this msa is characterized by the presence of hydrogeologically isolating type of carboniferous overburden thus within its boundaries there occur conditions for a close hydraulic relationship of surface waters with the waters of the first aquifer the large bierawka river a tributary of the oder river flows through its surface the best research material for this type of analysis is the numerical model of terrain nmt of the msa in existing studies of past surface conditions when the nmt did not yet exist the research material may be historical situational and elevation surface maps in the case of future projection of surface conditions nmt s of the predicted surface relief of the msa prepared by mining surveyors are used these geodetic data document the state of surface water at the moment of the geodetic survey of the surface their use makes possible the study of surface water runoff at individual points of the surface area and the levels of water outflow the subject of the research in the new method is the surface area of a single msa whose boundaries were determined separately by the mining concession decision for a single mining entrepreneur by the term mine subsidence area msa for solid mineral deposits the author understands those parts of the rock mass and the surface in the vicinity of exploited deposits in particular those parts subject to continuous and discontinuous deformations as currently legally defined in terms of range and intensity for a full understanding of the content of the article it should be mentioned that the referred definition of msa is not a concept commonly used in the global mining community they should be distinguished from the term commonly used in english language hydrogeology mining subsidence area which may refer to many neighboring msas many mines and sometimes the entire mining subregion the specificity of the terminology referred to in this article also distinguishes the concept of msa from another commonly used term mining area the author drew the understanding of the last term mining area from polish geological and mining law which describes 3d volumes not the surface area of the rock mass in which mining works can be carried out exploitation of mineral resources see fig 4 the chapters below contain a detailed description of four innovative elements of this method 2 1 base level of natural outflow of water from the mine subsidence area instead of the concept of the base level of drainage outflow of water commonly used in hydrogeology the author proposes to use another of the basic elements of the environment of the msa the base level of natural outflow of water it may refer to the outflow of surface water from a reservoir basin or msa ignacy 2017a in this new concept the adjective natural was added specifically to emphasize the occurrence of natural conditions in the outflow places free flows of water and to distinguish the concept of the base level of drainage this last concept may be associated for example with an artificial reservoir at the pumping station in which forced flows drainage of waters takes place the bierawka river bed in the lower part of the szczyglowice msa assumed 18 m mining subsidences nevertheless in this channel in the place of the outflow of waters from the msa there is a hydraulic balance between the erosion and sedimentation processes of material transported by water this is evidenced by the small variability of normal water states over a period of almost twenty years the measurements concern the period after the last deepening works of the river bed and were conducted periodically most often once a year they are presented in the data below table 1 and fig 2 table 1 and fig 2 illustrate a small range of changes in river water states measured in the period from 2001 to 2017 from 221 62 to 222 20 m above sea level these results cannot be treated uniformly accurate in the whole variable area and the researched set of results does not form a homogenous series because it does not capture full water states variations the arithmetic mean is not in relation to the appropriate measure of the central tendency of such a set fig 2 shows in this case that the better measure of the central tendency is the median value median of the set of observations it is 221 90 m above sea level this value is the base level of natural outflow of water from the szczyglowice msa the concept of the base level of natural outflow of water from a msa is of fundamental importance in the method of assessing the threat of flooding of the msa as elaborated by the author it allowed for the introduction of another key element of msa the hydrometric reference point section 2 2 2 2 hydrometric reference point for a catchment located in a mine subsidence area normal and conditional the new term of hydrometric reference point elaborated by author is used to study the threat of flooding in all mining areas for both underground and open pit mines see fig 3 recalling the definition the hydrometric reference point is a characteristic base for the exact time section and for relative elevations of the catchment area of the main watercourse draining the msa this point is located at the intersection of the boundary of msa with the axis of the main watercourse draining the msa figs 4 5 and 7 in contrast to the main rivers watercourses commonly used in hydrology by the new term main watercourse draining the msa the author understands each naturally flowing watercourse that crosses the boundary of the msa fig 7 in special cases it may also be channeled surface or underground stream there are two types of hydrometric reference points a normal hydrometric reference point and a conditional hydrometric reference point ignacy 2017a new concept the normal hydrometric reference point is a kind of hydrometric reference point whose elevation corresponds to the elevation of the base level of the natural outflow of water from the msa rounded up to the value of the contour line on the flood hazard map of the msa usually it is rounded up to the nearest whole number expressed in meters above sea level the reason for locating of the hydrometric reference point on the boundary of the msa at the outflow side is the possibility of comparing the states of relief of the surface of the msa at different times and for different phases of its deformation development in terms of the threat of flooding the rationale for the definitive determination of the elevation of hydrometric reference points by rounding up the base levels of the natural outflow of water from the msa are the following premises ignacy 2017a the need to conduct a flood threat analysis on based on contours lines which map the state of relief of the msa the elevation of the hydrometric reference point should reference to the elevation of a contour line from a numerical model of terrain for present and future states of surface relief when the nmt is not available the elevation is referenced from a historical contour map the possibility of assigning to the same contour lines continuous in the neighborhood of watersheds different values of relative elevations of the surface in separate catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa fig 7 accepting the least favorable conditions as a rule in the assessment of hazards which means accepting higher than normal average state of water as the elevation of this point extending the timespan of positive value of the relative elevations of the surface due to possible mining impacts on this point possible subsidence of the elevation of the hydrometric reference point results in an increase in the relative elevations of the surface of the msa and thus increases the possibility of gravitational drainage of the surface of the msa fig 3 taking into consideration the eventual increase in the elevation of the base level of natural outflow of water resulting from natural flow of mine water through the bed of the main watercourse draining the msa turning off pumps the reasons for the possible changes in the normal hydrometric reference point occurring during mining operations may be a lowering of the elevation of this point resulting either from the impact of mining inside its own msa or mining impacts of the neighboring mineral deposits or deepening of the main channel of the watercourse draining the msa for the szczyglowice msa whose main watercourse is the bierawka river fig 4 the elevation of the normal hydrometric reference point determined in table 1 and fig 2 is 222 0 m above sea level in this case the elevation of the normal hydrometric reference point is 0 10 m higher than the base level of the natural outflow of water from the msa by definition the value of this rounding may in extreme cases reach an incomplete value of 1 00 m the above is very important for the proposed concept the boundary of potential backwater section 2 3 at this point it should be stated that in special cases temporary disappearance of surface outflow due to mine drainage by pumping it is possible to determine the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa based on archival and not current water levels the second type of hydrometric reference point used after legal administrative acceptance process of relevant technical documentation is the so called conditional hydrometric reference point the situational location of the conditional hydrometric reference point is analogous to the normal hydrometric reference point the new concept of a conditional hydrometric reference point requires a detailed discussion the definition of this element is given by the author below new concept the conditional hydrometric reference point is a type of hydrometric reference point whose elevation is the designated normal average water level after deepening as a result of hydrotechnical works and or subsidence due to mining exploitation of the neighboring mineral deposits rounded up to the value of the contour line on the flood hazard map of the msa usually it is rounded up to the nearest whole number expressed in meters above sea level 2 3 the boundary of potential backwater this article only describes the most important of five types potential reservoirs highlighted by the author in the hydromorphological and cartographic method fig 6 it is new term the reservoir covered by the boundary of potential backwater fig 3 by definition ignacy 2017a its range corresponds to a terrain contour line which is equal to the elevation of the hydrometric reference point specifically determined for each catchment area of the main watercourse draining the msa s the significance of the boundary of potential backwater is highlighted by the following property generally it is possible to limit the surface area of reservoirs occurring in separate catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa to the minimum area of possible and permanent flooding encompassed by the boundary of potential backwater fig 3 this property also applies to the other four types of potential reservoirs fig 6 subject to the threat of flooding which would occur as a result of the restoration of free water flows in the msa and normal conditions this type of potential reservoir is of paramount importance to environmental policy in msas because it describes the framework of permanent flooding of these areas after the restoration of natural water flows turning off pumping stations fig 3 the boundary of potential backwater is inherently and inseparably connected with another most important new concept the relative elevations of the msa 2 4 relative elevations of the surface of the mine subsidence area in the works of staszewski 1992 dedicated to the mechanisms of the formation of floodplain areas in the upper silesian coal basin the surface above the local base level of water outflow were called the relative elevations of the surface area according to this author the conditions of gravitational outflow of water at a point of the surface of the msa depend on the relative elevation of this point above the local base level of water outflow in conditions of large height differences of barriers limiting the flow of surface waters the values of the relative elevations of points of the surface of the msa above the local base level of water outflow determine the distribution of inflow and outflow zones and the network of water streams in the catchment area the hydrometric reference point was indicated as the local base of water outflow for the entire surface of the catchment area located in the msa ignacy 2017a the introduction of the new concept hydrometric reference points allows for purpose prepared spatial mapping of the msa by describing its surface using elevations relative to the hydrometric reference point figs 3 4 5 and 7 the adoption of the hydrometric reference point as the basis for the relative elevations of the surface of the msa is fundamental to assess the possibility of draining this area fig 3 3 results and discussion the author of the discussed method was a survey and geological engineer of the hard coal mine szczyglowice in poland fig 1 for 27 years during this period he constantly managed geodetic measurements of the surface of the mining area including in particular measurements of the water environment table 1 experiences from these measurements and two huge floods in this msa in 1997 and 2010 allowed the author to gather large amounts of pertinent data and consolidate the views presented in the following chapters 3 1 constancy of normal water levels in the lower sections of beds of the main watercourses draining the mine subsidence areas the formation of a subsidence basin on the surface of the msa is accompanied by a change in the slopes of riverbeds of the surface watercourses on the basis of a single exploitation area in the szczyglowice msa where mining exploitation resulted in a subsidence basin with a maximum depth of 12 m and a span of 1 5 km the change in slopes of the terrain reached a maximum of approximately 16 this amount combined with an original watercourse slope of about 1 6 for the river and up to about 3 for its tributaries caused the occurrence of negative slopes on the downstream bank of the morphological basin at the place of outflow as well as significant increases in the longitudinal slopes on the upstream side of the basin the effect of large scale mine subsidence experienced by the lower section of the bierawka river bed in the szczyglowice msa is a reduction of the initial longitudinal slope of water level to a critical value of 0 01 at a bump in the riverbed on the boundary of the msa such a minimal slope currently occurs on a 2600 m section of the riverbed between the 39 0th and 41 6th km of the river in this section the water is constantly silting the bottom of the riverbed with material sand transported by the water the depth of the river has been constant for 30 observed years and is about 0 6 m similar stability of normal water levels occurred historically in a section about 1 km longer both in the riverbed and its tributaries current changes in the river s slope resulted among others from regulation of the riverbed above this section the river currently has a relatively large slope of 7 0 a similar decrease in the slopes of surface watercourses above their outflow points from the msa s occurs in the riverbeds of many main watercourses draining such areas which have experienced significant mining impacts and still maintain gravitational water flows similar permanent flooding of the valleys of surface watercourses in the upper silesian coal basin were also identified among others on the section of 3300 m from 55 7th to 59 0th km of the klodnica river a tributary of the odra river in the makoszowy post mining area on the 1200 m section from 6 6th to 7 8th km the bielszowicki stream a tributary of the klodnica river in the halemba i ii mining area and on the 2400 m section from 3 0th to 5 4th km of the bolina stream in the janow post mining area on these sections of the main watercourses draining the msa the level of the water table is close to the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa 3 2 the elevetion of the hydrometric reference point and the extent of the boundary of potential backwater as determinants of permanent flooding of mine subsidence areas to illustrate the properties of areas covered by the boundary of a potential backwater one should answer the following question what area of land covered by the boundary of a potential backwater may not be permanently flooded after the restoration of natural water flows in the msa it depends on the following hydrological conditions of the msa climate zone and precipitation levels on the difference in the elevation of the accepted hydrometric reference point in relation to the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa from the slopes of the banks of this potential reservoir the size of the reservoir and in particular the linear distance of the edge points of its bowl from the hydrometric reference point hydrogeological conditions of the basin of this reservoir depth of the first aquifer underground outflows and inflows of water to illustrate these properties an analysis of a hypothetical example was made where the boundary of potential backwater is based on the elevation of a normal hydrometric reference point 0 9 m higher than the elevation of the base level of natural water outflow from the msa the worst case for this example a slope of 0 5 of the main watercourse draining the msa on the lower section of the msa was adopted which provides a hydraulic balance in the riverbed with such a slope in the watercourse one can talk about the possibility of draining the catchment area within the boundary of potential backwater characterized by elevations up to 0 9 m higher than the elevation of the base level of natural water outflow from the msa and located in the watercourse riverbed 1 8 km from the hydrometric reference point 1800 m 0 5 mm m 900 mm since the line of the boundary of potential backwater is 0 9 m above the base level of the natural outflow of water the level of groundwater under this line may occur at a depth of 0 9 m below ground level when there is hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters on the example of the surface of the szczyglowice msa the average slopes in the lower part of the msa are in the range from 1 to 2 for the average value of this interval 1 5 an elevation difference of 0 9 m occurs on the length of the 34 4 m slope on the shore of the reservoir thus in strips of land with a calculated width within the boundary of potential backwater the average water depth to the water table aquifer may be in the range from 0 0 to 0 9 m below ground level under normal flows of water based on the presented reasoning and definition of a normal hydrometric reference point it can be stated that under conditions of hydraulic relationship of surface with underground waters under normal water states the boundary of potential backwater may include in its border areas waterlogged terrain instead of those permanently flooded higher than normal water states will then be accompanied by periodic flooding of the entire area covered by the boundary of a potential backwater including the analyzed border belt under conditions of hydraulic relationship of surface and underground waters and after restoring natural water flows the further away from the hydrometric reference point the reservoir is located the normal water level in the msa could be higher and thus the higher the probability of flooding of the entire area covered by the boundary of potential backwater due to higher than average water levels at this point it is worth to illustrate with hydrometric measurements the frequency of the occurrence of higher than average water states in larger surface watercourses this depends on the total surface area of the catchment of the main watercourse that drains the msa the amount of precipitation and relief of the msa and above the msa for example the bierawka river was observed daily during the last 18 hydrological years i e from 2001 to 2017 by the polish institute of meteorology and water management in the water gauge tworog maly section for 365 days during this period water levels were higher than the average state by 10 cm similarly for 100 days during this period water levels were higher than the average state by 30 cm for 30 days during this period water levels were higher than the average level by 50 cm lastly for 8 days during this period water levels were higher than the average level by 90 cm most of this occurring in a one week period during the last flood prone hydrological year 2010 when the flood culmination exceeded 4 2 m above average water level it should be noted however that the cited hydrometric measurements relate to a point of the watercourse located 18 4 km below the szczyglowice msa therefore the fluctuations in water levels within the boundaries of the msa can have smaller amplitudes similarly in this case the lower rise in the level of the groundwater table will be analogous to waterlogging occurring in the border zones of the boundary of potential backwater will be lower the obvious condition of such a mechanism of the appearance of water logging at the borders of the boundary of potential backwater is the occurrence of hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters for completeness of the presented characteristics one should additionally refer to mining areas covered by the boundary of potential backwater under conditions of loss of hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters such conditions occur most frequently in regions where mineral deposits are hydrogeologically exposed and the need to protect against mine water hazard forced the need to seal the riverbeds of watercourses at least under conditions of normal water states this is most often the case for many msas many mines whose mining works and post mining operations are hydraulically connected considering hydrogeological conditions in such msa s after the cessation of artificial drainage cessation of drainage of all mines connected hydraulically and liquidation of surface water pumping stations on their mining areas the levels of groundwater in mines and the rock mass in individual msa s can be correspondingly lower than the elevations of individual the base levels of natural outflow of water from these msa s these levels will be related to the level of natural outflow of groundwater to surface waters in the lowest msa among those hydraulically connected and will result from the elevation of hydraulically connected mining works and goafs in the flows between these msas the above is the same as the uncertainty of water logging of potential reservoirs covered by the boundary of potential backwater where the hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters was disrupted in conditions of normal water states after the restoration of free water flows investigation of flood events of the janow post mining area located in the center of the upper silesian coal basin fig 1 and characterized by hydrogeologically non insulating overburden of the carboniferous deposit conducted by the central mining institute in poland ignacy 2017b indicated that large floodwater runoff culminating during the last flood in upper silesian coal basin on 18 05 2010 caused flooding inside the boundaries of potential backwater this occurred despite the drainage of water into mine works which in the case of natural surface water states resulted in the lack of flooding in many potential reservoirs in this post mining area on the basis of the above mentioned cases and due to frequently poor identification of hydrogeological conditions of the bowls of these potential reservoirs and based on the principle of accepting a worst case scenario in threat assessments it should be assumed that flooding and or water logging after the restoration of free water flows of all mining areas covered by the boundaries of potential backwater will occur regardless of the above after the restoration of hydraulic relationship between the surface and underground waters this type of potential reservoir will be flooded or waterlogged after the rock mass below has been sealed and the reservoir bowl has been clogged it should be emphasized that for the hydrological conditions described above by natural water levels in the narrow surface of the msa such a conclusion does not require additional probabilistic evaluation of inundation 3 3 the use of relative elevations of the surface to assess the possibility of planning the drainage of the mine subsidence areas the introduction of relative elevations of the surface above the hydrometric reference point allows for purpose prepared spatial mapping of the msa s relief used to assess the threat of flooding this mapping is carried out separately in individual catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa in this simple way it is possible to create transparent hypsometric thematic maps for easy identification of mining areas threatened with excessive flooding after the restoration of free water flows the surfaces of the msa located above the elevation of the hydrometric reference point have positive relative elevations and those below negative negative relative elevations of the surface of the msa indirectly indicate the depth of potential backwater in areas of underground outflow and or artificial capture and transfer of surface waters using the relative elevations of the surface of the msa it is possible to develop and analyze any transformed surface relief of the msa including archival current and forecasted states in terms of their changes and changes in their surfaces for example those characterized by negative relative elevations in particular at any state of subsidence in the msa it is possible to quickly check for the threat of flooding for specific environmental elements with known relative elevations it is also possible to make comparisons of the surfaces of various msa s in terms of the possibility of these taking on unspecified mining surface subsidence for example those resulting from planned long term extraction of minerals figs 5 and 6 it is also possible to compare different states of the transformed relief of the msa in terms of the time line to the moment of exceeding the permissible sustainable impact in specific exploitation parts of the deposit and the surface of the msa subsidence of surface points of the msa is allowed corresponding to their relative elevations minus the drop of a watercourse from this point to the hydrometric reference point necessary for gravitational drainage surfaces of mining and post mining areas identified as flooded or waterlogged as well as those artificially drained but under the threat of flooding may be naturally drained after the restoration of natural water flows if they are characterized by positive relative elevations it should be emphasized that this principle applies regardless of the essence of the water transformation of the msa and the types of waters that participate in these transformations this applies to normal states of surface water as well as flood waters and groundwater remaining in full hydraulic relationship with surface waters if the relative elevations of these waters in the msa is zero or a negative number such waters will stagnate in the reservoirs after the restoration of natural conditions the essence of drainage works is to lower the places of water outflow from potential reservoirs it is reasonable to lower the banks of potential reservoirs to the elevation of the hydrometric reference point it allows limiting the surface area of such reservoirs to a minimum area of possible flooding encircled by a contour line with zero relative elevation that is to the boundary of potential backwater in active mining areas this may occur as a result of planned hydrotechnical works preventive construction and or repair works and in particular due to the planned impact of mine subsidence types of hydrotechnical drainage works commonly implemented as part of mining management in msa s may include regulation deepening of surface watercourses construction of flood embankments culverts valves etc construction of pumping stations for surface waters it is worth emphasizing an important aspect of msa maps with indicated relative elevations of the surface covering more than one catchment of the main watercourses draining the msa in the vicinity of watersheds in separate catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa the surface has different relative elevations their identification allows to indicate the eventual possibility of drainage works consisting in the capture of waters from one catchment characterized by lower relative elevations to another characterized by higher relative elevations fig 7 3 4 the use of relative elevations of the surface for spatial planning development in the mine subsidence areas the widespread existence of forced water flows in msa s and the reduction of longitudinal slopes of surface watercourses as a result of mining impacts are the reasons that maps modeling the surface of msa s with relative elevations are the best documents for spatial planning development of such areas it should be emphasized that they may relate to for example future forecasted states e g after planned approved mining impacts on maps of artificially drained msa s the revealed negative relative elevations of the surface can be identical with the certainty of permanent flooding after the restoration of free water flows and the necessity of subsequent changes in spatial planning development the environmentally sustainable spatial policies for msa s in mining communes should include flood management and in particular take into account flood planning and the threat of flooding as well as limiting these phenomena flood threat planning must be closely related to the permissible mining impact balanced in terms of the occurrence and development of individual special elements of the environment below distinguished the following essential elements of the environment including the aquatic environment five types of potential reservoir should be subject to analysis and planning and in the final determinations of sustainable environmental policy in msas fig 6 current surface relief of the msa current permanent flooding with normal water and waterlogging of msas surface watercourses ponds

culverts and locks valves etc identification of land strips to build such facilities strips of land for the regulation of water and water flows necessary for planned mining impact deepening of riverbeds construction of deep urban sewerage mains strips of land necessary as embankments of main communication routes resulting from threat of flooding duet to the impact of mining infrastructure residential service and industrial together with zones for spatial development restrictions and zones of demolition of buildings and utility networks current and planned areas needed for reclamation mining areas threatened by flooding artificially drained require a detailed identification of possible directions of spatial development in such areas this applies particularly to changes in the existing development and the way this development takes place if the future mining exploitation of minerals is assumed at the governmental level detailed planning is required to safeguard newly built infrastructure facilities and their optimal location should be planned to exclude the zones threatened with flooding in parallel with the above spatial planning in msas requires planning for the elimination and or limitation of flooding and or the threat of flooding by setting aside strips of land necessary for carrying out preventive and corrective works in order to carry out preventive and corrective works planned by mining entrepreneurs spatial planning in msa s should include a construction ban and planned decommissioning of buildings and surface and underground infrastructure unsecured against flooding in zones that are or will be covered by a legally agreed threat of flooding in which it is not possible to eliminate such a threat ignacy 2017b 2017c it should be emphasized that failure to take into account planned preventive and repair works and the threat of surface flooding in local spatial development plans may result in the necessity of permanent pumping in msa s threatened with flooding 4 aplications of the described elements of the method elements of the hydromorphological and cartographic method described in this paper allow the introduction of a new level of quality in the formulation of environmental policies for mining areas in particular knowledge about the elevations of hydrometric reference points for specific catchments of the main watercourses draining msas enables control of the subsidence process of these areas in a transparent way the hydromorphological elements of the method also simplify reaching a legal definition of mining concession decisions thus establishing a framework for permissible transformations of the water environment of mining areas making such data available to the public domain makes it possible by any and all interested parties to track the depressions of surface waters and or first aquifer and to monitor the relative elevations of the bottoms of individual potential reservoirs present on the surface of mining areas additionally such knowledge provides sufficient lead time to take appropriate preventive measures and or works including stopping mining operations which may exceed the legally agreed to and defined limits of the threat of flooding such data will be of primary interest to property owners environmental policy authorities local government officials water management bodies spatial and urban planning entities property insurers project finance institutions and mining enterprises and authorities the described method makes possible continuous near real time tracking of the scale of enlargement of zones under the threat of flooding in active msas correspondingly it also allows assessment of the occurrence of artificial surface drainage due to the transfer of water by pumping stations of both mining areas and post mining areas further the transparency of this public data defined by the new method allows avoiding the construction of those road and rail embankments in mining and post mining areas which could enlarge the areas covered by the threat of flooding none of the existing flood threat assessment methods known to the author allow for such applications and possibilities 5 conclusions spatial planning in areas where there are strategic mineral resources for the development of the state requires special and sound environmental policies this is particularly important in built up areas subject to further urbanization national policies for the safeguarding of mineral deposits for current and future mining exploitation must contain provisions for spatial planning sustainable environmental spatial policies in such areas should include flood management considerations and in particular take into account contingency planning for flooding and or the threat of flooding together with the elimination and limiting of such phenomena depending on completed current and planned mining transformations of the environment such policies should be based on proper identification and planning of spatial development directions in a sustainable manner within approved mining transformations in such policies it is proposed to use special hydromorphological elements of the environment pointed out by the author in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in msas referring to the most important of these presented in this article the following conclusions are presented 1 one of the basic concepts describing the environment of msas is the base of natural outflow of water in this concept the adjective natural was added specifically to emphasize the occurrence of natural hydrological and hydrogeological conditions free flow of waters and to distinguish it from the base of outflow drainage of waters which may result from forced water flows 2 an innovative element of the msa environment current planned and post mining is the normal hydrometric reference point located at the intersection of the boundary of mine subsidence area with the axis of the main watercourse draining the mine subsidence area at the place of water outflow the elevation of the normal hydrometric reference point is rounded up to the whole number to the elevation of the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa higher than average water state 3 the introduction of hydrometric reference points allows for special and spatial mapping of the mine subsidence area by describing its surface with relative elevations above the hydrometric reference point such an innovative way of surface mapping is carried out separately in individual catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa the adoption of a hydrometric reference point as the basis for the relative elevations is fundamental for assessing the drainage capacity of the msas 4 maps showing the surface of msas with the aid of relative elevations above the hydrometric reference point are the best materials for spatial planning development identification of mining areas characterized by negative relative elevations is identical with the certainty of permanent flooding after the restoration of natural water flows and the necessity to change spatial development of such areas 5 the boundary of potential backwater is the range of the most important potential reservoir as defined by the author its range coincides with the terrain contour line with the elevation of hydrometric reference point mining areas covered by the boundary of potential backwater are characterized by the certainty of permanent flooding after the restoration of free water flows they require special directions changes in their development 6 flood management in spatial planning on the surface of msas requires consideration of the occurrence of permanent flooding by identifying the range of all planned potential reservoirs as well as planning for the elimination and or limitation of flooding or threat of flooding for this purpose it is necessary to identify strips of land essential for carrying out preventive and corrective works 7 spatial planning development in msas should include a future construction ban and planned demolition of buildings and infrastructure surface and underground unprotected against flooding in zones that are or will be covered by a legally agreed threat of flooding in identified potential water reservoirs where it is not possible to eliminate this threat 8 failure to take account of planned preventive and remediation works and the threat of surface flooding in local spatial development plans as well as in future studies of the conditions and directions in spatial development may result in the necessity of constantly pumping water in urbanized mining areas threatened with flooding declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
6400,spatial planning in areas where underground mineral resources occur requires specific and sound environmental policies spatial policy should be based on proper identification and planning of sustainable development policies in a manner compatible with legally defined mining transformations depending on the initial morphology of the mine subsidence area mining can lead to the transformation of the aquatic environment including the occurrence of floods inundated lands water logging surface drying and or the threat of flooding this concerns artificially drained mining and post mining areas and may result from the restoration of free water flows turning off pumping stations this article refers specifically to the permanent flooding and or threat of flooding of parts of mine subsidence areas in active mine subsidence areas of hard coal mines the surface relief is permanently subsided for this reason the identified flood hazards only have short term relevance special hydromorphological elements of the environment of artificially drained mine subsidence areas first formulated by the author can set new standards of quality in environmental policies the paper contains a description of the most important of these the base of natural outflow of water the normal hydrometric reference point the relative elevations of the surface of the mine subsidence areas and the boundary of potential backwater the introduction of relative elevations of the surface above the hydrometric reference point makes possible purpose prepared spatial mapping of the mine subsidence area s relief used to assess the threat of flooding the novel elements have a range of applications including flood insurance flood risk management water management remediation of mining damage and sustainable spatial planning additionally the method allows the qualification of existing and recoverable mineral resources for economic usability taking into account the needs of sustainable planning as well as responsible mining techniques keywords mining area threat of flooding numerical model of terrain water management spatial planning 1 introduction spatial planning in areas where underground mineral resources occur requires special and sound environmental policies the occurrence of such mineral deposits exploitation of which may bring economic benefits to mining companies and the mining region as a whole such as jobs and socio economic development requires national regional and local authorities to plan for coordinated development of many specifically identified environmental elements it should be noted that the exploitation of minerals is a public goal and interest in the legislation of many countries and should be subordinated to the good of individual citizens as well as smaller companies representing other non mining industries borecki et al 1980 fan et al 2012 marschalko et al 2014 ignacy 2018 depending on the existing ongoing and planned mining transformations of the environment spatial policy should be based on proper identification and planning of sustainable development policies in a manner compatible with legally defined mining transformations such conditions occur on the surface of hundreds of square kilometers in many countries where mining existed or exists and the mining areas are artificially drained these areas are usually densely urbanized borecki et al 1980 ignacy 2017b c the direct effect of underground mining are excavations mining works and post mining secondary voids generated by the collapse of rocks above and in the immediate vicinity of these mining works these voids in the form of fissures or caverns can move towards the surface of mine subsidence areas msa s in different time periods sometimes this process takes place within a year and sometimes it may last longer than 100 years rogoż and posyłek 2000 drobniewski and telenga 2011 it depends on the geological structure of the deposits and the depth of the mining works this phenomenon is accompanied by changes in hydrogeological and hydrological conditions such as drainage of the rock mass and surface inundation the end effect of the wandering of the post mining void on the surface of the msa s are subsidence basins depending on the initial morphology of the mining area mining induced subsidence can lead to the transformation of the aquatic environment on the surface this may manifest itself in the occurrence of floods inundated areas water logging surface drying pazdro 1983 rogoż and posyłek 2000 wilk ed al 2003 bukowski 2006 glȁßer et al 2010 wu and huang 2010 fan et al 2012 marschalko et al 2014 witthüser et al 2015 and the occurrence of the threat of flooding bukowski 1995 ignacy 2017 2018 ignacy and bukowski 2017 this last concerns artificially drained mining and post mining subsidence areas and may result from the restoration of free water flows after the cessation of pumping these issues have been the subject of numerous previous articles the accumulation of water and simulation of interaction between surface water and groundwater of mining subsidence basins were studied and described using different distributed hydrological models among others by sophocleous et al 1999 harbaugh et al modflow 2000 hughes and liu mike she 2008 they require various different factors and extensive and detailed data sets characterizing the environment of mining subsidence areas which are subject to permanent changes in surface and underground water flows difficulty in parameterization cartographic and geodesic methods for studying environmental changes have been described among others by jankowska and lisiewicz 1998 artugyan and urdea 2016 dacian paul 2017 who delineated methods of monitoring analyzing and controlling the land with the aid of digital elevation models of the terrain the threat of flooding on the surface of non mining areas was described by ni et al 2010 kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kia et al 2012 degiorgis et al 2012 2013 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 alvarez et al 2016 hydrological research methods for this hazard can be used without any limitations in the cases of post mining areas where the natural water flows have been completely restored and the full hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters has been reestablished hydrological research methods can be applied to active mining areas but requires good geological and hydrological reconnaissance it should be noted that in active underground hard coal mines the msa s surface relief is permanently subsided on the basis of the author s experiences the size of these subsidences often exceeds 0 2 m per day and in some areas of the surface may exceed 3 0 m during the year therefore in such msa s the identified surfaces characterized by different flood hazards only have short term validity and relevance the relatively shallow depth up to 100 m deep of exploited coal seams as well the impact of large scale mining causing the disruption of the hydro insulating characteristics of the original hydrogeologically covered overburden atop the deposits may lead to a partial interruption of surface water flows and even complete disappearance of surface waters photo 1 photo 2 and fig 1 it should be emphasized that forecasting deformations of the rock mass transformations of aquifers as well the surface is subject to errors lack of suitable methods of forecasting this in turn translates into errors in the modeling of groundwater and surface water flows in mining areas the ongoing and creeping urbanization of such areas additionally changes surface water flows to summarize surface subsidences in underground msas are often extensive and may exceed 30 m pazdro 1983 rogoż and posyłek 2000 popiołek 2009 the above aspects have contributed to the development of a novel method for assessing flood threats of a portion of the surface areas of the msa in which the surface elevations became the basic research material this article refers specifically to the permanent flooding and or threat of permanent flooding of msa s as one of the most important environmental aspects of such areas these phenomena have been identified in the form of one specific type of a potential reservoir which is the most important type of reservoir used in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of flood threat assessment in a msa ignacy 2017a the following chapters contain a detailed description of the four novel elements of this method this constitutes the most important part of this method this paper describes a novel and specific way of mapping the surface of the msa with the aid of these four elements in field assessments it has proven to be unquestionably useful for flood management repairing of mining damage and spatial planning development this approximate method has been developed as a supplement to probabilistic flood threat methods used to test many hydraulically connected msas the relief of which is subject to significant mining subsidences as well as mining drainage and or the transfer of water causing dynamic transformations of the aquatic environment in distributed hydrologic models the presented elements of this method can be used to provide a framework reference states for water levels at the places of their outflow from their respective msas the most important of these hydromorfological elements are described below 2 materials and methods in contrast to complex distributed hydrological models the hydromorphological and cartographic method for assessing the threat of flooding of artificially drained msa ignacy 2017a elaborated by the author of the article is simple to apply and to use it describes the surface water flows and parameterizes the types of innundations potential water reservoirs by examining and referring to the characteristic hydrological water levels at the site of water outflow from the msa the method has been successfully tried and tested in a number of msas in poland one of the reference areas for the above mentioned survey method is the szczyglowice msa located in the central part of the upper silesian coal basin fig 1 this msa is characterized by the presence of hydrogeologically isolating type of carboniferous overburden thus within its boundaries there occur conditions for a close hydraulic relationship of surface waters with the waters of the first aquifer the large bierawka river a tributary of the oder river flows through its surface the best research material for this type of analysis is the numerical model of terrain nmt of the msa in existing studies of past surface conditions when the nmt did not yet exist the research material may be historical situational and elevation surface maps in the case of future projection of surface conditions nmt s of the predicted surface relief of the msa prepared by mining surveyors are used these geodetic data document the state of surface water at the moment of the geodetic survey of the surface their use makes possible the study of surface water runoff at individual points of the surface area and the levels of water outflow the subject of the research in the new method is the surface area of a single msa whose boundaries were determined separately by the mining concession decision for a single mining entrepreneur by the term mine subsidence area msa for solid mineral deposits the author understands those parts of the rock mass and the surface in the vicinity of exploited deposits in particular those parts subject to continuous and discontinuous deformations as currently legally defined in terms of range and intensity for a full understanding of the content of the article it should be mentioned that the referred definition of msa is not a concept commonly used in the global mining community they should be distinguished from the term commonly used in english language hydrogeology mining subsidence area which may refer to many neighboring msas many mines and sometimes the entire mining subregion the specificity of the terminology referred to in this article also distinguishes the concept of msa from another commonly used term mining area the author drew the understanding of the last term mining area from polish geological and mining law which describes 3d volumes not the surface area of the rock mass in which mining works can be carried out exploitation of mineral resources see fig 4 the chapters below contain a detailed description of four innovative elements of this method 2 1 base level of natural outflow of water from the mine subsidence area instead of the concept of the base level of drainage outflow of water commonly used in hydrogeology the author proposes to use another of the basic elements of the environment of the msa the base level of natural outflow of water it may refer to the outflow of surface water from a reservoir basin or msa ignacy 2017a in this new concept the adjective natural was added specifically to emphasize the occurrence of natural conditions in the outflow places free flows of water and to distinguish the concept of the base level of drainage this last concept may be associated for example with an artificial reservoir at the pumping station in which forced flows drainage of waters takes place the bierawka river bed in the lower part of the szczyglowice msa assumed 18 m mining subsidences nevertheless in this channel in the place of the outflow of waters from the msa there is a hydraulic balance between the erosion and sedimentation processes of material transported by water this is evidenced by the small variability of normal water states over a period of almost twenty years the measurements concern the period after the last deepening works of the river bed and were conducted periodically most often once a year they are presented in the data below table 1 and fig 2 table 1 and fig 2 illustrate a small range of changes in river water states measured in the period from 2001 to 2017 from 221 62 to 222 20 m above sea level these results cannot be treated uniformly accurate in the whole variable area and the researched set of results does not form a homogenous series because it does not capture full water states variations the arithmetic mean is not in relation to the appropriate measure of the central tendency of such a set fig 2 shows in this case that the better measure of the central tendency is the median value median of the set of observations it is 221 90 m above sea level this value is the base level of natural outflow of water from the szczyglowice msa the concept of the base level of natural outflow of water from a msa is of fundamental importance in the method of assessing the threat of flooding of the msa as elaborated by the author it allowed for the introduction of another key element of msa the hydrometric reference point section 2 2 2 2 hydrometric reference point for a catchment located in a mine subsidence area normal and conditional the new term of hydrometric reference point elaborated by author is used to study the threat of flooding in all mining areas for both underground and open pit mines see fig 3 recalling the definition the hydrometric reference point is a characteristic base for the exact time section and for relative elevations of the catchment area of the main watercourse draining the msa this point is located at the intersection of the boundary of msa with the axis of the main watercourse draining the msa figs 4 5 and 7 in contrast to the main rivers watercourses commonly used in hydrology by the new term main watercourse draining the msa the author understands each naturally flowing watercourse that crosses the boundary of the msa fig 7 in special cases it may also be channeled surface or underground stream there are two types of hydrometric reference points a normal hydrometric reference point and a conditional hydrometric reference point ignacy 2017a new concept the normal hydrometric reference point is a kind of hydrometric reference point whose elevation corresponds to the elevation of the base level of the natural outflow of water from the msa rounded up to the value of the contour line on the flood hazard map of the msa usually it is rounded up to the nearest whole number expressed in meters above sea level the reason for locating of the hydrometric reference point on the boundary of the msa at the outflow side is the possibility of comparing the states of relief of the surface of the msa at different times and for different phases of its deformation development in terms of the threat of flooding the rationale for the definitive determination of the elevation of hydrometric reference points by rounding up the base levels of the natural outflow of water from the msa are the following premises ignacy 2017a the need to conduct a flood threat analysis on based on contours lines which map the state of relief of the msa the elevation of the hydrometric reference point should reference to the elevation of a contour line from a numerical model of terrain for present and future states of surface relief when the nmt is not available the elevation is referenced from a historical contour map the possibility of assigning to the same contour lines continuous in the neighborhood of watersheds different values of relative elevations of the surface in separate catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa fig 7 accepting the least favorable conditions as a rule in the assessment of hazards which means accepting higher than normal average state of water as the elevation of this point extending the timespan of positive value of the relative elevations of the surface due to possible mining impacts on this point possible subsidence of the elevation of the hydrometric reference point results in an increase in the relative elevations of the surface of the msa and thus increases the possibility of gravitational drainage of the surface of the msa fig 3 taking into consideration the eventual increase in the elevation of the base level of natural outflow of water resulting from natural flow of mine water through the bed of the main watercourse draining the msa turning off pumps the reasons for the possible changes in the normal hydrometric reference point occurring during mining operations may be a lowering of the elevation of this point resulting either from the impact of mining inside its own msa or mining impacts of the neighboring mineral deposits or deepening of the main channel of the watercourse draining the msa for the szczyglowice msa whose main watercourse is the bierawka river fig 4 the elevation of the normal hydrometric reference point determined in table 1 and fig 2 is 222 0 m above sea level in this case the elevation of the normal hydrometric reference point is 0 10 m higher than the base level of the natural outflow of water from the msa by definition the value of this rounding may in extreme cases reach an incomplete value of 1 00 m the above is very important for the proposed concept the boundary of potential backwater section 2 3 at this point it should be stated that in special cases temporary disappearance of surface outflow due to mine drainage by pumping it is possible to determine the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa based on archival and not current water levels the second type of hydrometric reference point used after legal administrative acceptance process of relevant technical documentation is the so called conditional hydrometric reference point the situational location of the conditional hydrometric reference point is analogous to the normal hydrometric reference point the new concept of a conditional hydrometric reference point requires a detailed discussion the definition of this element is given by the author below new concept the conditional hydrometric reference point is a type of hydrometric reference point whose elevation is the designated normal average water level after deepening as a result of hydrotechnical works and or subsidence due to mining exploitation of the neighboring mineral deposits rounded up to the value of the contour line on the flood hazard map of the msa usually it is rounded up to the nearest whole number expressed in meters above sea level 2 3 the boundary of potential backwater this article only describes the most important of five types potential reservoirs highlighted by the author in the hydromorphological and cartographic method fig 6 it is new term the reservoir covered by the boundary of potential backwater fig 3 by definition ignacy 2017a its range corresponds to a terrain contour line which is equal to the elevation of the hydrometric reference point specifically determined for each catchment area of the main watercourse draining the msa s the significance of the boundary of potential backwater is highlighted by the following property generally it is possible to limit the surface area of reservoirs occurring in separate catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa to the minimum area of possible and permanent flooding encompassed by the boundary of potential backwater fig 3 this property also applies to the other four types of potential reservoirs fig 6 subject to the threat of flooding which would occur as a result of the restoration of free water flows in the msa and normal conditions this type of potential reservoir is of paramount importance to environmental policy in msas because it describes the framework of permanent flooding of these areas after the restoration of natural water flows turning off pumping stations fig 3 the boundary of potential backwater is inherently and inseparably connected with another most important new concept the relative elevations of the msa 2 4 relative elevations of the surface of the mine subsidence area in the works of staszewski 1992 dedicated to the mechanisms of the formation of floodplain areas in the upper silesian coal basin the surface above the local base level of water outflow were called the relative elevations of the surface area according to this author the conditions of gravitational outflow of water at a point of the surface of the msa depend on the relative elevation of this point above the local base level of water outflow in conditions of large height differences of barriers limiting the flow of surface waters the values of the relative elevations of points of the surface of the msa above the local base level of water outflow determine the distribution of inflow and outflow zones and the network of water streams in the catchment area the hydrometric reference point was indicated as the local base of water outflow for the entire surface of the catchment area located in the msa ignacy 2017a the introduction of the new concept hydrometric reference points allows for purpose prepared spatial mapping of the msa by describing its surface using elevations relative to the hydrometric reference point figs 3 4 5 and 7 the adoption of the hydrometric reference point as the basis for the relative elevations of the surface of the msa is fundamental to assess the possibility of draining this area fig 3 3 results and discussion the author of the discussed method was a survey and geological engineer of the hard coal mine szczyglowice in poland fig 1 for 27 years during this period he constantly managed geodetic measurements of the surface of the mining area including in particular measurements of the water environment table 1 experiences from these measurements and two huge floods in this msa in 1997 and 2010 allowed the author to gather large amounts of pertinent data and consolidate the views presented in the following chapters 3 1 constancy of normal water levels in the lower sections of beds of the main watercourses draining the mine subsidence areas the formation of a subsidence basin on the surface of the msa is accompanied by a change in the slopes of riverbeds of the surface watercourses on the basis of a single exploitation area in the szczyglowice msa where mining exploitation resulted in a subsidence basin with a maximum depth of 12 m and a span of 1 5 km the change in slopes of the terrain reached a maximum of approximately 16 this amount combined with an original watercourse slope of about 1 6 for the river and up to about 3 for its tributaries caused the occurrence of negative slopes on the downstream bank of the morphological basin at the place of outflow as well as significant increases in the longitudinal slopes on the upstream side of the basin the effect of large scale mine subsidence experienced by the lower section of the bierawka river bed in the szczyglowice msa is a reduction of the initial longitudinal slope of water level to a critical value of 0 01 at a bump in the riverbed on the boundary of the msa such a minimal slope currently occurs on a 2600 m section of the riverbed between the 39 0th and 41 6th km of the river in this section the water is constantly silting the bottom of the riverbed with material sand transported by the water the depth of the river has been constant for 30 observed years and is about 0 6 m similar stability of normal water levels occurred historically in a section about 1 km longer both in the riverbed and its tributaries current changes in the river s slope resulted among others from regulation of the riverbed above this section the river currently has a relatively large slope of 7 0 a similar decrease in the slopes of surface watercourses above their outflow points from the msa s occurs in the riverbeds of many main watercourses draining such areas which have experienced significant mining impacts and still maintain gravitational water flows similar permanent flooding of the valleys of surface watercourses in the upper silesian coal basin were also identified among others on the section of 3300 m from 55 7th to 59 0th km of the klodnica river a tributary of the odra river in the makoszowy post mining area on the 1200 m section from 6 6th to 7 8th km the bielszowicki stream a tributary of the klodnica river in the halemba i ii mining area and on the 2400 m section from 3 0th to 5 4th km of the bolina stream in the janow post mining area on these sections of the main watercourses draining the msa the level of the water table is close to the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa 3 2 the elevetion of the hydrometric reference point and the extent of the boundary of potential backwater as determinants of permanent flooding of mine subsidence areas to illustrate the properties of areas covered by the boundary of a potential backwater one should answer the following question what area of land covered by the boundary of a potential backwater may not be permanently flooded after the restoration of natural water flows in the msa it depends on the following hydrological conditions of the msa climate zone and precipitation levels on the difference in the elevation of the accepted hydrometric reference point in relation to the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa from the slopes of the banks of this potential reservoir the size of the reservoir and in particular the linear distance of the edge points of its bowl from the hydrometric reference point hydrogeological conditions of the basin of this reservoir depth of the first aquifer underground outflows and inflows of water to illustrate these properties an analysis of a hypothetical example was made where the boundary of potential backwater is based on the elevation of a normal hydrometric reference point 0 9 m higher than the elevation of the base level of natural water outflow from the msa the worst case for this example a slope of 0 5 of the main watercourse draining the msa on the lower section of the msa was adopted which provides a hydraulic balance in the riverbed with such a slope in the watercourse one can talk about the possibility of draining the catchment area within the boundary of potential backwater characterized by elevations up to 0 9 m higher than the elevation of the base level of natural water outflow from the msa and located in the watercourse riverbed 1 8 km from the hydrometric reference point 1800 m 0 5 mm m 900 mm since the line of the boundary of potential backwater is 0 9 m above the base level of the natural outflow of water the level of groundwater under this line may occur at a depth of 0 9 m below ground level when there is hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters on the example of the surface of the szczyglowice msa the average slopes in the lower part of the msa are in the range from 1 to 2 for the average value of this interval 1 5 an elevation difference of 0 9 m occurs on the length of the 34 4 m slope on the shore of the reservoir thus in strips of land with a calculated width within the boundary of potential backwater the average water depth to the water table aquifer may be in the range from 0 0 to 0 9 m below ground level under normal flows of water based on the presented reasoning and definition of a normal hydrometric reference point it can be stated that under conditions of hydraulic relationship of surface with underground waters under normal water states the boundary of potential backwater may include in its border areas waterlogged terrain instead of those permanently flooded higher than normal water states will then be accompanied by periodic flooding of the entire area covered by the boundary of a potential backwater including the analyzed border belt under conditions of hydraulic relationship of surface and underground waters and after restoring natural water flows the further away from the hydrometric reference point the reservoir is located the normal water level in the msa could be higher and thus the higher the probability of flooding of the entire area covered by the boundary of potential backwater due to higher than average water levels at this point it is worth to illustrate with hydrometric measurements the frequency of the occurrence of higher than average water states in larger surface watercourses this depends on the total surface area of the catchment of the main watercourse that drains the msa the amount of precipitation and relief of the msa and above the msa for example the bierawka river was observed daily during the last 18 hydrological years i e from 2001 to 2017 by the polish institute of meteorology and water management in the water gauge tworog maly section for 365 days during this period water levels were higher than the average state by 10 cm similarly for 100 days during this period water levels were higher than the average state by 30 cm for 30 days during this period water levels were higher than the average level by 50 cm lastly for 8 days during this period water levels were higher than the average level by 90 cm most of this occurring in a one week period during the last flood prone hydrological year 2010 when the flood culmination exceeded 4 2 m above average water level it should be noted however that the cited hydrometric measurements relate to a point of the watercourse located 18 4 km below the szczyglowice msa therefore the fluctuations in water levels within the boundaries of the msa can have smaller amplitudes similarly in this case the lower rise in the level of the groundwater table will be analogous to waterlogging occurring in the border zones of the boundary of potential backwater will be lower the obvious condition of such a mechanism of the appearance of water logging at the borders of the boundary of potential backwater is the occurrence of hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters for completeness of the presented characteristics one should additionally refer to mining areas covered by the boundary of potential backwater under conditions of loss of hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters such conditions occur most frequently in regions where mineral deposits are hydrogeologically exposed and the need to protect against mine water hazard forced the need to seal the riverbeds of watercourses at least under conditions of normal water states this is most often the case for many msas many mines whose mining works and post mining operations are hydraulically connected considering hydrogeological conditions in such msa s after the cessation of artificial drainage cessation of drainage of all mines connected hydraulically and liquidation of surface water pumping stations on their mining areas the levels of groundwater in mines and the rock mass in individual msa s can be correspondingly lower than the elevations of individual the base levels of natural outflow of water from these msa s these levels will be related to the level of natural outflow of groundwater to surface waters in the lowest msa among those hydraulically connected and will result from the elevation of hydraulically connected mining works and goafs in the flows between these msas the above is the same as the uncertainty of water logging of potential reservoirs covered by the boundary of potential backwater where the hydraulic relationship between surface and underground waters was disrupted in conditions of normal water states after the restoration of free water flows investigation of flood events of the janow post mining area located in the center of the upper silesian coal basin fig 1 and characterized by hydrogeologically non insulating overburden of the carboniferous deposit conducted by the central mining institute in poland ignacy 2017b indicated that large floodwater runoff culminating during the last flood in upper silesian coal basin on 18 05 2010 caused flooding inside the boundaries of potential backwater this occurred despite the drainage of water into mine works which in the case of natural surface water states resulted in the lack of flooding in many potential reservoirs in this post mining area on the basis of the above mentioned cases and due to frequently poor identification of hydrogeological conditions of the bowls of these potential reservoirs and based on the principle of accepting a worst case scenario in threat assessments it should be assumed that flooding and or water logging after the restoration of free water flows of all mining areas covered by the boundaries of potential backwater will occur regardless of the above after the restoration of hydraulic relationship between the surface and underground waters this type of potential reservoir will be flooded or waterlogged after the rock mass below has been sealed and the reservoir bowl has been clogged it should be emphasized that for the hydrological conditions described above by natural water levels in the narrow surface of the msa such a conclusion does not require additional probabilistic evaluation of inundation 3 3 the use of relative elevations of the surface to assess the possibility of planning the drainage of the mine subsidence areas the introduction of relative elevations of the surface above the hydrometric reference point allows for purpose prepared spatial mapping of the msa s relief used to assess the threat of flooding this mapping is carried out separately in individual catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa in this simple way it is possible to create transparent hypsometric thematic maps for easy identification of mining areas threatened with excessive flooding after the restoration of free water flows the surfaces of the msa located above the elevation of the hydrometric reference point have positive relative elevations and those below negative negative relative elevations of the surface of the msa indirectly indicate the depth of potential backwater in areas of underground outflow and or artificial capture and transfer of surface waters using the relative elevations of the surface of the msa it is possible to develop and analyze any transformed surface relief of the msa including archival current and forecasted states in terms of their changes and changes in their surfaces for example those characterized by negative relative elevations in particular at any state of subsidence in the msa it is possible to quickly check for the threat of flooding for specific environmental elements with known relative elevations it is also possible to make comparisons of the surfaces of various msa s in terms of the possibility of these taking on unspecified mining surface subsidence for example those resulting from planned long term extraction of minerals figs 5 and 6 it is also possible to compare different states of the transformed relief of the msa in terms of the time line to the moment of exceeding the permissible sustainable impact in specific exploitation parts of the deposit and the surface of the msa subsidence of surface points of the msa is allowed corresponding to their relative elevations minus the drop of a watercourse from this point to the hydrometric reference point necessary for gravitational drainage surfaces of mining and post mining areas identified as flooded or waterlogged as well as those artificially drained but under the threat of flooding may be naturally drained after the restoration of natural water flows if they are characterized by positive relative elevations it should be emphasized that this principle applies regardless of the essence of the water transformation of the msa and the types of waters that participate in these transformations this applies to normal states of surface water as well as flood waters and groundwater remaining in full hydraulic relationship with surface waters if the relative elevations of these waters in the msa is zero or a negative number such waters will stagnate in the reservoirs after the restoration of natural conditions the essence of drainage works is to lower the places of water outflow from potential reservoirs it is reasonable to lower the banks of potential reservoirs to the elevation of the hydrometric reference point it allows limiting the surface area of such reservoirs to a minimum area of possible flooding encircled by a contour line with zero relative elevation that is to the boundary of potential backwater in active mining areas this may occur as a result of planned hydrotechnical works preventive construction and or repair works and in particular due to the planned impact of mine subsidence types of hydrotechnical drainage works commonly implemented as part of mining management in msa s may include regulation deepening of surface watercourses construction of flood embankments culverts valves etc construction of pumping stations for surface waters it is worth emphasizing an important aspect of msa maps with indicated relative elevations of the surface covering more than one catchment of the main watercourses draining the msa in the vicinity of watersheds in separate catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa the surface has different relative elevations their identification allows to indicate the eventual possibility of drainage works consisting in the capture of waters from one catchment characterized by lower relative elevations to another characterized by higher relative elevations fig 7 3 4 the use of relative elevations of the surface for spatial planning development in the mine subsidence areas the widespread existence of forced water flows in msa s and the reduction of longitudinal slopes of surface watercourses as a result of mining impacts are the reasons that maps modeling the surface of msa s with relative elevations are the best documents for spatial planning development of such areas it should be emphasized that they may relate to for example future forecasted states e g after planned approved mining impacts on maps of artificially drained msa s the revealed negative relative elevations of the surface can be identical with the certainty of permanent flooding after the restoration of free water flows and the necessity of subsequent changes in spatial planning development the environmentally sustainable spatial policies for msa s in mining communes should include flood management and in particular take into account flood planning and the threat of flooding as well as limiting these phenomena flood threat planning must be closely related to the permissible mining impact balanced in terms of the occurrence and development of individual special elements of the environment below distinguished the following essential elements of the environment including the aquatic environment five types of potential reservoir should be subject to analysis and planning and in the final determinations of sustainable environmental policy in msas fig 6 current surface relief of the msa current permanent flooding with normal water and waterlogging of msas surface watercourses ponds

threatened by flooding as a result of restoration of natural flows of groundwater and surface water cessation of mine drainage and cessation of surface water transfer areas under threat of flooding

culverts and locks valves etc identification of land strips to build such facilities strips of land for the regulation of water and water flows necessary for planned mining impact deepening of riverbeds construction of deep urban sewerage mains strips of land necessary as embankments of main communication routes resulting from threat of flooding duet to the impact of mining infrastructure residential service and industrial together with zones for spatial development restrictions and zones of demolition of buildings and utility networks current and planned areas needed for reclamation mining areas threatened by flooding artificially drained require a detailed identification of possible directions of spatial development in such areas this applies particularly to changes in the existing development and the way this development takes place if the future mining exploitation of minerals is assumed at the governmental level detailed planning is required to safeguard newly built infrastructure facilities and their optimal location should be planned to exclude the zones threatened with flooding in parallel with the above spatial planning in msas requires planning for the elimination and or limitation of flooding and or the threat of flooding by setting aside strips of land necessary for carrying out preventive and corrective works in order to carry out preventive and corrective works planned by mining entrepreneurs spatial planning in msa s should include a construction ban and planned decommissioning of buildings and surface and underground infrastructure unsecured against flooding in zones that are or will be covered by a legally agreed threat of flooding in which it is not possible to eliminate such a threat ignacy 2017b 2017c it should be emphasized that failure to take into account planned preventive and repair works and the threat of surface flooding in local spatial development plans may result in the necessity of permanent pumping in msa s threatened with flooding 4 aplications of the described elements of the method elements of the hydromorphological and cartographic method described in this paper allow the introduction of a new level of quality in the formulation of environmental policies for mining areas in particular knowledge about the elevations of hydrometric reference points for specific catchments of the main watercourses draining msas enables control of the subsidence process of these areas in a transparent way the hydromorphological elements of the method also simplify reaching a legal definition of mining concession decisions thus establishing a framework for permissible transformations of the water environment of mining areas making such data available to the public domain makes it possible by any and all interested parties to track the depressions of surface waters and or first aquifer and to monitor the relative elevations of the bottoms of individual potential reservoirs present on the surface of mining areas additionally such knowledge provides sufficient lead time to take appropriate preventive measures and or works including stopping mining operations which may exceed the legally agreed to and defined limits of the threat of flooding such data will be of primary interest to property owners environmental policy authorities local government officials water management bodies spatial and urban planning entities property insurers project finance institutions and mining enterprises and authorities the described method makes possible continuous near real time tracking of the scale of enlargement of zones under the threat of flooding in active msas correspondingly it also allows assessment of the occurrence of artificial surface drainage due to the transfer of water by pumping stations of both mining areas and post mining areas further the transparency of this public data defined by the new method allows avoiding the construction of those road and rail embankments in mining and post mining areas which could enlarge the areas covered by the threat of flooding none of the existing flood threat assessment methods known to the author allow for such applications and possibilities 5 conclusions spatial planning in areas where there are strategic mineral resources for the development of the state requires special and sound environmental policies this is particularly important in built up areas subject to further urbanization national policies for the safeguarding of mineral deposits for current and future mining exploitation must contain provisions for spatial planning sustainable environmental spatial policies in such areas should include flood management considerations and in particular take into account contingency planning for flooding and or the threat of flooding together with the elimination and limiting of such phenomena depending on completed current and planned mining transformations of the environment such policies should be based on proper identification and planning of spatial development directions in a sustainable manner within approved mining transformations in such policies it is proposed to use special hydromorphological elements of the environment pointed out by the author in the hydromorphological and cartographic method of assessing the threat of flooding in msas referring to the most important of these presented in this article the following conclusions are presented 1 one of the basic concepts describing the environment of msas is the base of natural outflow of water in this concept the adjective natural was added specifically to emphasize the occurrence of natural hydrological and hydrogeological conditions free flow of waters and to distinguish it from the base of outflow drainage of waters which may result from forced water flows 2 an innovative element of the msa environment current planned and post mining is the normal hydrometric reference point located at the intersection of the boundary of mine subsidence area with the axis of the main watercourse draining the mine subsidence area at the place of water outflow the elevation of the normal hydrometric reference point is rounded up to the whole number to the elevation of the base level of natural outflow of water from the msa higher than average water state 3 the introduction of hydrometric reference points allows for special and spatial mapping of the mine subsidence area by describing its surface with relative elevations above the hydrometric reference point such an innovative way of surface mapping is carried out separately in individual catchments of the main watercourses draining the msa the adoption of a hydrometric reference point as the basis for the relative elevations is fundamental for assessing the drainage capacity of the msas 4 maps showing the surface of msas with the aid of relative elevations above the hydrometric reference point are the best materials for spatial planning development identification of mining areas characterized by negative relative elevations is identical with the certainty of permanent flooding after the restoration of natural water flows and the necessity to change spatial development of such areas 5 the boundary of potential backwater is the range of the most important potential reservoir as defined by the author its range coincides with the terrain contour line with the elevation of hydrometric reference point mining areas covered by the boundary of potential backwater are characterized by the certainty of permanent flooding after the restoration of free water flows they require special directions changes in their development 6 flood management in spatial planning on the surface of msas requires consideration of the occurrence of permanent flooding by identifying the range of all planned potential reservoirs as well as planning for the elimination and or limitation of flooding or threat of flooding for this purpose it is necessary to identify strips of land essential for carrying out preventive and corrective works 7 spatial planning development in msas should include a future construction ban and planned demolition of buildings and infrastructure surface and underground unprotected against flooding in zones that are or will be covered by a legally agreed threat of flooding in identified potential water reservoirs where it is not possible to eliminate this threat 8 failure to take account of planned preventive and remediation works and the threat of surface flooding in local spatial development plans as well as in future studies of the conditions and directions in spatial development may result in the necessity of constantly pumping water in urbanized mining areas threatened with flooding declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
6401,the identification of factors affecting the first flush phenomenon is important for the control of urban nonpoint source pollution this study developed machine learning algorithms the regression tree rt and random forest rf algorithms to predict the mass first flush ratio mffn from seven rainfall related variables we also evaluated the prediction performance of the two algorithms and the relative importance of the seven variables in model prediction the rf algorithm outperformed the rt algorithm in terms of akaike information criterion aic values in general the target variables simulated using the rf algorithm had lower aic values than did those of the rt algorithm except for t n and t p the rf algorithm also provided acceptable performance statistics for the mff10 to mff20 of biochemical oxygen demand bod r2 0 71 and 0 67 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 67 and 0 52 chemical oxygen demand cod r2 0 70 and 0 71 nse 0 66 and 0 62 total organic carbon toc r2 0 70 and 0 63 nse 0 56 and 0 57 and total phosphorus t p r2 0 72 and 0 71 nse 0 68 and 0 58 suspended solids ss predicted by the rf algorithm showed an acceptable value for r2 0 68 and 0 64 but a low nse for the mff20 nse 0 48 however the prediction of mff30 was unacceptable for all target variables the rainfall related variables showed different relative importance estimates among the water quality parameters in the mffn prediction results also showed that bod and cod were closely associated with rainfall intensity ri toc and t p showed strong relationships with ri and antecedent rainfall ar ss was closely related to ri and rainfall duration rdur t n showed strong relationships with rdur respectively this study demonstrated that the rf algorithm could be a useful tool to predict the mff10 and mff20 of bod cod toc and t p on the basis of rainfall characteristics in urban catchments keywords urban stormwater water quality regression tree random forest mass first flush ratio first flush effect 1 introduction urbanization involving removing vegetation and developing infrastructure is commonly accompanied by a rapid increase in impervious areas and it has been occurring worldwide berndtsson 2010 dams et al 2013 guan et al 2015 urbanization usually leads to changes in the hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics of a watershed and thus its runoff hydrographs goonetilleke et al 2005 yao et al 2016 furthermore nonpoint source pollution by urban runoff has caused degradation of the quality of receiving water usepa 1998 lee et al 2002 jung et al 2013 field and pitt 1990 have found that the loads of several pollutants such as suspended solids ss nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants are greater from urban surfaces than from rural areas consequently the control of urban stormwater pollutants has become an important factor in efforts to preserve water quality one important feature of urban runoff is that pollutant discharge in the initial period of stormwater runoff is substantially higher than that in later periods of the runoff process this is called the first flush effect ffe gupta and saul 1996 deletic 1998 lee et al 2002 sansalone and cristina 2004 the estimation of the strength of the ffe is very important for understanding urban runoff characteristics and achieving nonpoint source pollution control deletic 1998 soller et al 2005 dimensionless mass volume curves representing the distribution of pollutant mass versus volume in stormwater discharge are commonly used to evaluate the pollutant discharge patterns for different rainfall events and catchments verdaguer et al 2014 deletic 1998 suggested that the ffe means that most of the pollutant load is transferred from the first 20 of the runoff volume other researchers saget et al 1995 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 defined the occurrence of the ffe when at least 80 of the pollutant load is transferred in the first 30 of the runoff volume recently bach et al 2010 suggested that the ffe should be defined by absolute runoff volumes and absolute pollutant concentrations instead of proportions another methodology to define the ffe is called the mass first flush ratio mffn which is helpful for describing the percentage of pollutants emitted as a function of the normalized storm duration in other words the mffn is a method to analyze the ffe by quantifying the first flush intensity after analyzing the accumulated load according to cumulative runoff by the duration of the rainfall runoff event ma et al 2002 han et al 2006 barco et al 2008 when the value of the mffn is greater than or equal to 1 it can be explained by the first flush for example if the mff30 value is 2 3 then the pollutant mass export ratio is 69 in the first 30 of the runoff volume many researchers have tried to determine the relationship between the ffe and various parameters previous studies wanielista and yousef 1993 gupta and saul 1996 taebi and droste 2004 have shown that the ffe is affected by watershed areas impervious areas peak rainfall intensity ri rainfall duration rdur and antecedent dry days adds saget et al 1995 on the other hand insisted that there is no correlation between the shape of the cumulative load curves and site characteristics area time to concentration and average slope or rainfall event characteristics rainfall amount r maximum intensity and antecedent dry period based on simple statistical analysis other researchers hongbing et al 2009 ouyang et al 2012 kato et al 2009 also tried modeling or monitoring to estimate the ffe in urban areas but could not find a clear correlation between the ffe and rainfall characteristics thus complex and high resolution physically based models have been applied to estimate the ffe as the models include storm swmm and hydroworks infoworks cs these models show good performance for simulating the ffe but are difficult to apply in many cases owing to data availability qin et al 2016 recently the use of machine learning algorithms such as regression tree rt and random forest rf has become an efficient technique in many research areas wu et al 2014 wang et al 2015b creaco et al 2016 the rt algorithm is tree based and it can predict the value of continuous variables from continuous and or categorical predictor variables razi and athappilly 2005 the rf algorithm uses a bootstrap with a randomized subset it has some benefits a it can be used when there are more variables than observations b it does not overfit and c it shows excellent performance even when the predictive variables are irregular diaz uriate and de andrés 2006 despite these advantages the rt and rf algorithms have not been widely used for estimating the mffn or urban runoff characteristics in this study we developed machine learning algorithms rf and rt to predict the quality of urban runoff from variables characterizing rainfall events including add r 10 d antecedent rainfall ar10 15 d ar ar15 mean ri rimean maximum ri rimax and rdur then this study evaluated their performance in predicting the mffn in two urban watersheds in the modeling experiment we also investigated the relative importance of the rainfall variables to evaluate their influence on the urban stormwater quality the potential and limitations of the rf and rt algorithms as a tool to predict the quality of urban runoff were discussed based on the modeling results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study sites were located in the sang mu district gwangju city south korea we selected commercial area 1 ca 1 35 09 33 0 n 126 50 45 5 e and commercial area 2 ca 2 35 09 22 0 n 126 50 56 8 e fig 1 which were close to the gwangju river the sangmu district has been developed since the 1990s the city hall of gwangju and some public institutions are located in the sang mu district the study site ca 1 drainage area of approximately 12 500 m2 was characterized by various impervious covers 85 including paved parking lots commercial buildings and residential areas the ca 2 site drainage area of approximately 10 000 m2 also has a large impervious area 83 which however mostly consists of commercial buildings the mean annual temperature and precipitation for the study sites were 13 8 c and 1391 mm respectively 2 2 first flush effect analysis the ffe can be explained in many ways but plotting the normalized cumulative pollutant mass for each time t l versus the normalized cumulative runoff volume at each time t v is a common method for assessing the ffe hathaway et al 2012 these relationships can be defined by eq 1 and 2 we estimated the mffn by using eq 3 to investigate the ffe using runoff data and the total pollution load from the study sites 1 l 0 t c t q t d t m 2 v 0 t q t d t v 3 m f f n 0 t c t q t d t m 0 t q t d t v where q t and c t are the runoff volume and pollutant concentration as a function of time respectively and n is the point in the storm and percentage of the runoff volume range is from 0 to 100 m and v are the total mass of the emitted pollutant and total runoff volume respectively 2 3 monitoring and load calculation the number of samples at both study sites ca 1 and ca 2 was 62 09 04 2008 to 18 06 2013 except for that of chemical oxygen demand cod which was 55 the rainfall data were acquired from the automatic weather system managed by the korea meteorological administration which is located in unam dong gwangju city approximately 3 km from the study sites to measure runoff a flow meter flo tote3 usa was installed at the end of the rain water drainage conduit and the flow rate was measured every 1 min the samples for water quality analysis were manually collected at 15 min intervals for the first 2 h and then sampled at approximately 1 2 h intervals until the runoff ceased using an automatic sampler isco portable sampler 6712 usa water quality parameters including biochemical oxygen demand bod cod total organic carbon toc ss total nitrogen t n and total phosphorus t p were analyzed according to the apha method 2001 the pollutant load was calculated using the monitored flow rate and corresponding concentrations of water quality parameters 2 4 regression tree and random forest methods the rt algorithm subdivides a dataset by decision rules on the target variables to obtain preferably homogeneous subgroups with regard to the response variable breiman et al 1984 ließ et al 2012 an application of the rt can be summarized into two stages the first stage involves growing trees in an optimal split which is selected and evaluated by the least square deviation lsd hasanipanah et al 2017 the variance in nodes is calculated using eq 4 the optimal split is chosen as the difference between the mother node and the left child node and the right child node is maximized eq 5 ließ et al 2012 granata et al 2017 4 r t 1 n t i 1 n y i t y t 2 5 r t r t l r t r where r t is the variance in node t and node t is divided into the left child node t l and right child node t r n is the number of observations and y is the predicted mean value in a second stage the rt algorithm prunes the trees by removing tree sections or nodes that have little explanatory power if there are too many nodes then it can create problems such as overfitting the outputs or predictions of an overfitted model do not respond sensitively to newly added data and the overfitting may introduce additional uncertainty into the outputs breiman et al 1984 rf is a combination of tree predictors and each tree or node is determined based on the values of a random vector sampled from the same distribution for all trees in the forest breiman 2001 rf is similar to bagging trees in the sense that they bootstrap samples the difference is that each tree is grown with a randomized subset of variables prasad et al 2006 in short the rf algorithm builds as a number of trees ntree and averages the result of each tree eq 6 6 f x 1 k k 1 k t x where f x is the result of the rf k is the ntree and t x is the result of each rt the ntree node size and number of features tried at each node mtry are defined by users studies demonstrated that prediction errors would converge to an asymptotic value in model tests and the rf would not be overfitted when ntree increased appropriately breiman 2001 peters et al 2007 the rf has the advantage of calculating the relative importance of parameters which can be estimated by two methods gini impurity gi and mean square error mse the gi is used to calculate the quality of each split for the variables in a tree and mse calculates the mean decrease in prediction accuracy due to splits on every predictor breiman 2001 ouedraogo et al 2018 genuer et al 2010 argued that the use of mse could provide more reliable estimates of the relative importance than that of the gi because the gi method is not fair in favor of predictor variables with many categories thus we selected the mse method to estimate the relative importance in this study it is important to understand how each rainfall related variable influences the ffe of each water quality parameter and both the rt and rf methods can provide the relative importance rate of the influencing variables rodriguez galiano et al 2012 the predictions of the rt method may vary depending on the characteristics of training sets provided and such sensitivity issue can be solved by implementing bootstrapping when selecting training data diaz uriate and de andrés 2006 the rt method can be quickly trained regardless of the number of trees and classes but the learning time of the rf method can be much longer depending on ntree values selected the ntree value was decided by estimating the mse which could be affected by ntree values the sensitivity of mse to ntree is depicted in fig 2 the mses were quickly stabilized even when the ntree value reached 200 and then they slowly decreased until the ntree value hit 1000 we selected the ntree value of 1000 in this study the other attribute values including node size of five and mtry one third of the total number of predictors were selected from literature wang et al 2015a the overall application procedures of the rt and rf methods are described in fig 3 matlab software r2018b mathworks inc was used to develop the rt and rf algorithms to predict the mffn of bod cod toc ss t n and t p model output using seven rainfall characteristic variables model input in commercial areas the modeling was conducted using an intel i5 8500 3 00 ghz cpu with 16 0 gb of ram 2 5 data normalization data normalization is the process of rescaling the data to specific ranges such as 0 to 1 normalization is required when variables of interest have different value ranges as the learning rates of machine learning techniques are sensitive to the value ranges ioffe and szegedy 2015 for example ar15 showed the highest learning rate among the input variables due to its larger upper limit compared to those of the others and it was followed by ar10 r rimax add rdur and rimean in this study all variables were normalized using eq 7 to ensure an equal learning rate for the variables 7 x x m i n x max x m i n x where x is the normalized value of the data set range of 0 to 1 and x is the original value 2 6 model validation the rt and rf models were trained with a part 80 of the water quality observations or samples and then tested using the remaining dataset 20 afendras and markatou 2015 2019 which is often called the hold out validation the datasets were randomly selected for the two parts to minimize the amount of bias to be potentially introduced in the model evaluation there are several other methods to train and test the models the k fold cross validation is one commonly used method a study demonstrated that a k fold method might provide better performance than a hold out method in terms of the amount of bias and variance yadav and shukla 2016 however there are critical disadvantages to employing a k fold method genuer et al 2010 showed that the k fold cross validation required much more computational power and thus the quality of model training and validation comes at the expense of computing resources in addition they demonstrated that the k fold cross validation could behave unsatisfactorily if the data set is small on the other hand the hold out validation is relatively much fast compared to the k fold method although the results of the hold out validation are dependent on the characteristics of data sets used the issue can be solved by employing statistical techniques such as bootstrapping in this study we selected the hold out validation method because 1 the size of observation is not large 2 the method has been frequently used and 3 its efficiency has been proved by many other studies rodriguez galiano et al 2012 mondal et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 granata et al 2017 singh et al 2017 sihag et al 2018 to validate the models four different criteria were used including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 p value and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 which are suitable for selecting the best model among a number of models snipes and taylor 2014 model evaluation with these four criteria was conducted using the r software packages hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2017 and usingr verzani 2018 8 n s e 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 9 r 2 i 1 n x i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 10 a i c 2 k 2 l n l where xi and yi are the predicted value and observed value from site i respectively and n is the number of samples in the aic k is the number of parameters and l is the likelihood function for example if the aic shows a lower score then it can be interpreted by a better model the range in nse is from to 1 perfect fit an efficiency of lower than 0 indicates that the mean value of the observed time series would have had better prediction performance than the model nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 is interpreted as the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable or explainable by the independent variables its value ranges from 0 to 1 a value of 1 indicates that the dependent variables can be perfectly predicted by the independent ones usually nse and r2 greater than 0 5 are considered as acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 first flush analysis the mffn was calculated from mff0 to mff100 in study sites with similar impervious ratios ca 1 and ca 2 an example of the mffn for each runoff event is presented in fig 4 in this study we focused on mff10 to mff30 as previous studies have shown that ffe can be effectively understood with pollutant loads created in the first 30 of runoff volume saget et al 1995 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 the mff30 values of water quality parameters and the ffe criterion dotted line are presented in fig 5 the average pollutant mass export ratio of bod cod toc ss t n and t p in the first 30 of the runoff volume was calculated as 47 43 39 44 39 and 44 for ca 1 respectively and those for ca 2 were 41 37 38 48 35 and 37 respectively there must be many factors that make the difference between mffn values calculated for the study sites ca 1 and ca 2 including difference in the land use the microtopography of the surface and thus stormwater hydraulics the layout of the sewer system and the use of street sweepers to remove pollutants dirt and debris the first flush has relatively heavy loadings of bod cod ss and t p over 40 of the pollutant mass export ratio in the first 30 of the runoff volume in this study in ca 1 and ss and bod in ca 2 the statistics of mff10 30 are presented in table 1 and the mffn prediction performance of the both rt and rf models are presented in fig 6 hongbing et al 2009 observed that bod cod and tss show a strong first flush in most rainfall events but a weak first flush for t n and t p in industrial and residential areas lee and bang 2000 also reported that the strength of the ffe in the order of cod ss po4 p no3 n for industrial areas and residential areas which means that the ffe of ss and organic matter is stronger than that of nutrients in urban catchments 3 2 variables to predict the mass first flush ratio by random forest and regression tree seven variables add ar10 ar15 rimean rimax r and rdur were incorporated into the rt and rf models as independent variables to predict mff10 30 the add ranged from 0 d to 34 d ar10 ranged from 0 mm to 301 6 mm ar15 ranged from 0 3 mm to 516 9 mm rimean ranged from approximately 0 32 mm h to 17 31 mm h rimax ranged from 1 mm h to 70 mm h r ranged from 1 mm to 217 mm and rdur ranged from 1 13 h to 29 1 h the characteristics of all the runoff events are summarized in table 2 3 3 regression tree and random forest algorithm performance in mass first flush ratio prediction the mffn values of bod cod toc ss t n and t p were predicted using the rt and rf models as mentioned earlier the seven variables were normalized from 0 to 1 because during the rt or rf model processing different scales of each variable could affect the results then the rt and rf models were trained with a set of training data 80 randomly selected from the entire date set and then the trained models were tested using the other data set 20 to evaluate the performance of the models razakamanarivo et al 2011 reported that the bagging regression tree model shows better prediction accuracy for predicting soil organic carbon stocks than that of multiple linear models moreover oliveira et al 2012 also reported that the rf model shows better prediction performance for modeling spatial patterns of fire occurrence than that of multiple linear models therefore we assumed that the results obtained by the machine learning algorithm were better than those obtained by multiple linear models we did not try multiple linear modeling and only discussed the results of the rf and rt models in this study we evaluated the results of the mff10 mff50 predictions and found that the prediction after mff30 was likely not strongly affected by the rainfall characteristics lang et al 2013 also showed similar results that the mffn of nitrogen and phosphorus over mff30 showed no correlations with rainfall runoff characteristics therefore we only discussed up to the prediction of mff30 the performances of predicting mff10 30 are summarized in tables 3 5 considering the results acquired for mff10 with two different algorithms the results of the rt model is presented in fig 7 and those of the rf model is presented in fig 8 the rt model showed acceptable r2 0 5 and nse 0 5 results for bod cod and t p but the r2 and nse of other target variables toc ss and t n showed lower values than those of the rf algorithm on average the performance of the rt and rf models could be evaluated by the aic values i e a lower value indicates higher performance the aic values of bod cod toc ss t n and t p are presented in table 3 in general the target variables simulated using the rf algorithm had lower aic values than did those of the rt algorithm except for t n and t p ao et al 2018 compared the performance of the rt and rf models for predicting formation properties for shale and reported better performance of the rf model than the rt model however the rt model showed the advantage of running time in our study the rt model took only 0 4 s to be trained but 2 8 s were required to train the rf method the scatter plot of the rf model performance on mff10 is presented in fig 8 the rf model showed acceptable prediction power r2 0 5 and nse 0 5 and p values 0 005 for bod cod toc ss and t p however t n showed low prediction performance r2 0 29 and nse 0 05 one of the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance for t n was that clear relationships between stormwater runoff and water quality for t n are not established in urban areas lee and bang 2000 and more precise monitoring is recommended to obtain better results mannina and viviani 2010 the results of mff20 are presented in table 4 and figs s2 s3 the r2 value was less than 0 5 for most variables for the rt model only cod showed an acceptable r2 value but the nse presented a low value nse 0 11 the rt model seemed to have lower prediction performance owing to the intrinsic problem of predicting different values depending on the data collected for the study sets on the other hand the rf model provided better prediction performance for bod cod toc and t p ss showed an acceptable r2 value of 0 64 but a low nse of 0 48 however t n showed poor prediction performance with an r2 value of 0 25 and an nse of 0 04 the prediction performance results of mff30 are presented in table 5 and figs s4 s5 the rt model showed poor prediction performance for all target variables similarly the r2 values of most of the target variables were less than 0 5 except for bod and t p using the rf model and the nse also showed unacceptable values for all target variables thus to improve the prediction of mff30 more samples or different variables are required which will influence the calculation of mff30 3 4 relative importance rate of each variable to predict the mass first flush ratio the relative importance rate of each variable was estimated by 100 runs of the rt and rf models the relative importance results are presented in figs 9 and 10 and they were normalized to 100 the most significant difference between the results of the rt and rf models was the range in the importance rate for example the predicted values for t p using the rt model showed a wide relative importance range for ar15 0 0 39 3 while the range obtained by the rf model was 14 0 26 3 this could be explained by the fact that the rt model trained the data with 80 of the data set and the relative importance rate could be changed according to data set selected however the relative importance of the rt model showed a similar tendency with the rf model but as mentioned above the range in the importance rate showed a large difference between the rt and rf models for the rf model the variables of organic matter indicators bod and cod showed stronger relationships with the ri than other variables toc showed stronger relationship rates for the ri ar and rdur ss showed higher values for the ri and rdur t n showed a strong relationship with rdur but the range in importance rate was wider than that of other variables thus the correlation between t n and rainfall characteristics requires more research t p showed a relationship between ar and ri in summary the ar ri and or rdur showed a greater influence than other variables for bod cod toc and t p however add which could influence the buildup of pollutants showed a low importance rate for most of the water quality parameters liu et al 2013 also found that ri and rdur have a stronger relationship with stormwater quality than add 4 conclusion this study estimated the mff10 to mff30 of six different water quality parameters and investigated the relationship between the target variables and rainfall characteristics using rt and rf models the mffn was predicted from normalized rainfall related variables including add ar10 and ar15 rimean rimax r and rdur using the trained rt and rf models the observed ffe showed relatively strong intensity for bod cod ss and t p in ca 1 and for ss and bod in ca 2 such results demonstrated that ffe is a function of urban land cover types and their areas as well as rainfall characteristics the rt model showed a relatively wide range of the relative importance when predicting the mffn which implies there might be relatively considerable uncertainty in the prediction of the rt model compared to that of the rf model in contrast the rf model showed a narrow range in the prediction which should be attributed to the bootstrapping implemented to fairly select training data in addition the rt model was relatively quickly trained compared to the rf model thus the rt model would be preferred when computing resources are limited with a large amount of data to be investigated in terms of accuracy however the rf outperformed the rt model when predicting the mffn the rf model predicted the mff10 and mff20 of bod cod toc and t p at acceptable accuracy levels in the case of ss the model provided acceptable r2 statistics but low nse values in addition the model failed to predict t n accurately both rf and rt models predicted the mff30 of all the target variables inaccurately such limitations suggest additional research is needed to determine the parameters that influence the ffe of ss and t n and the relationship between mff30 and other variables that can be relatively easily monitored the importance rate determined by the rf and rt models showed that water quality parameters were influenced by different rainfall related variables bod and cod were closely associated with ri and toc and t p showed strong relationships with ri and ar ss and t n were closely related to ri and rdur respectively the range of the importance rate for t n was wider than those of the other parameters implying that t n will require further research to determine the specific influential factors this study demonstrated the potential and limitations of the rt and rf algorithms as a tool to estimate mffn and help better understand urban stormwater quality processes as computing algorithms and resources have advanced rapidly machine learning techniques are expected to be more commonly employed in hydrologic studies especially when a quick analysis and solution is required with the limited number of observations there are many existing and emerging machine learning algorithms applicable to urban stormwater studies such as neural network and support vector machine and it is critical to explore and realize their full potential for improved understanding of urban stormwater processes

6401,the identification of factors affecting the first flush phenomenon is important for the control of urban nonpoint source pollution this study developed machine learning algorithms the regression tree rt and random forest rf algorithms to predict the mass first flush ratio mffn from seven rainfall related variables we also evaluated the prediction performance of the two algorithms and the relative importance of the seven variables in model prediction the rf algorithm outperformed the rt algorithm in terms of akaike information criterion aic values in general the target variables simulated using the rf algorithm had lower aic values than did those of the rt algorithm except for t n and t p the rf algorithm also provided acceptable performance statistics for the mff10 to mff20 of biochemical oxygen demand bod r2 0 71 and 0 67 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 67 and 0 52 chemical oxygen demand cod r2 0 70 and 0 71 nse 0 66 and 0 62 total organic carbon toc r2 0 70 and 0 63 nse 0 56 and 0 57 and total phosphorus t p r2 0 72 and 0 71 nse 0 68 and 0 58 suspended solids ss predicted by the rf algorithm showed an acceptable value for r2 0 68 and 0 64 but a low nse for the mff20 nse 0 48 however the prediction of mff30 was unacceptable for all target variables the rainfall related variables showed different relative importance estimates among the water quality parameters in the mffn prediction results also showed that bod and cod were closely associated with rainfall intensity ri toc and t p showed strong relationships with ri and antecedent rainfall ar ss was closely related to ri and rainfall duration rdur t n showed strong relationships with rdur respectively this study demonstrated that the rf algorithm could be a useful tool to predict the mff10 and mff20 of bod cod toc and t p on the basis of rainfall characteristics in urban catchments keywords urban stormwater water quality regression tree random forest mass first flush ratio first flush effect 1 introduction urbanization involving removing vegetation and developing infrastructure is commonly accompanied by a rapid increase in impervious areas and it has been occurring worldwide berndtsson 2010 dams et al 2013 guan et al 2015 urbanization usually leads to changes in the hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics of a watershed and thus its runoff hydrographs goonetilleke et al 2005 yao et al 2016 furthermore nonpoint source pollution by urban runoff has caused degradation of the quality of receiving water usepa 1998 lee et al 2002 jung et al 2013 field and pitt 1990 have found that the loads of several pollutants such as suspended solids ss nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants are greater from urban surfaces than from rural areas consequently the control of urban stormwater pollutants has become an important factor in efforts to preserve water quality one important feature of urban runoff is that pollutant discharge in the initial period of stormwater runoff is substantially higher than that in later periods of the runoff process this is called the first flush effect ffe gupta and saul 1996 deletic 1998 lee et al 2002 sansalone and cristina 2004 the estimation of the strength of the ffe is very important for understanding urban runoff characteristics and achieving nonpoint source pollution control deletic 1998 soller et al 2005 dimensionless mass volume curves representing the distribution of pollutant mass versus volume in stormwater discharge are commonly used to evaluate the pollutant discharge patterns for different rainfall events and catchments verdaguer et al 2014 deletic 1998 suggested that the ffe means that most of the pollutant load is transferred from the first 20 of the runoff volume other researchers saget et al 1995 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 defined the occurrence of the ffe when at least 80 of the pollutant load is transferred in the first 30 of the runoff volume recently bach et al 2010 suggested that the ffe should be defined by absolute runoff volumes and absolute pollutant concentrations instead of proportions another methodology to define the ffe is called the mass first flush ratio mffn which is helpful for describing the percentage of pollutants emitted as a function of the normalized storm duration in other words the mffn is a method to analyze the ffe by quantifying the first flush intensity after analyzing the accumulated load according to cumulative runoff by the duration of the rainfall runoff event ma et al 2002 han et al 2006 barco et al 2008 when the value of the mffn is greater than or equal to 1 it can be explained by the first flush for example if the mff30 value is 2 3 then the pollutant mass export ratio is 69 in the first 30 of the runoff volume many researchers have tried to determine the relationship between the ffe and various parameters previous studies wanielista and yousef 1993 gupta and saul 1996 taebi and droste 2004 have shown that the ffe is affected by watershed areas impervious areas peak rainfall intensity ri rainfall duration rdur and antecedent dry days adds saget et al 1995 on the other hand insisted that there is no correlation between the shape of the cumulative load curves and site characteristics area time to concentration and average slope or rainfall event characteristics rainfall amount r maximum intensity and antecedent dry period based on simple statistical analysis other researchers hongbing et al 2009 ouyang et al 2012 kato et al 2009 also tried modeling or monitoring to estimate the ffe in urban areas but could not find a clear correlation between the ffe and rainfall characteristics thus complex and high resolution physically based models have been applied to estimate the ffe as the models include storm swmm and hydroworks infoworks cs these models show good performance for simulating the ffe but are difficult to apply in many cases owing to data availability qin et al 2016 recently the use of machine learning algorithms such as regression tree rt and random forest rf has become an efficient technique in many research areas wu et al 2014 wang et al 2015b creaco et al 2016 the rt algorithm is tree based and it can predict the value of continuous variables from continuous and or categorical predictor variables razi and athappilly 2005 the rf algorithm uses a bootstrap with a randomized subset it has some benefits a it can be used when there are more variables than observations b it does not overfit and c it shows excellent performance even when the predictive variables are irregular diaz uriate and de andrés 2006 despite these advantages the rt and rf algorithms have not been widely used for estimating the mffn or urban runoff characteristics in this study we developed machine learning algorithms rf and rt to predict the quality of urban runoff from variables characterizing rainfall events including add r 10 d antecedent rainfall ar10 15 d ar ar15 mean ri rimean maximum ri rimax and rdur then this study evaluated their performance in predicting the mffn in two urban watersheds in the modeling experiment we also investigated the relative importance of the rainfall variables to evaluate their influence on the urban stormwater quality the potential and limitations of the rf and rt algorithms as a tool to predict the quality of urban runoff were discussed based on the modeling results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study sites were located in the sang mu district gwangju city south korea we selected commercial area 1 ca 1 35 09 33 0 n 126 50 45 5 e and commercial area 2 ca 2 35 09 22 0 n 126 50 56 8 e fig 1 which were close to the gwangju river the sangmu district has been developed since the 1990s the city hall of gwangju and some public institutions are located in the sang mu district the study site ca 1 drainage area of approximately 12 500 m2 was characterized by various impervious covers 85 including paved parking lots commercial buildings and residential areas the ca 2 site drainage area of approximately 10 000 m2 also has a large impervious area 83 which however mostly consists of commercial buildings the mean annual temperature and precipitation for the study sites were 13 8 c and 1391 mm respectively 2 2 first flush effect analysis the ffe can be explained in many ways but plotting the normalized cumulative pollutant mass for each time t l versus the normalized cumulative runoff volume at each time t v is a common method for assessing the ffe hathaway et al 2012 these relationships can be defined by eq 1 and 2 we estimated the mffn by using eq 3 to investigate the ffe using runoff data and the total pollution load from the study sites 1 l 0 t c t q t d t m 2 v 0 t q t d t v 3 m f f n 0 t c t q t d t m 0 t q t d t v where q t and c t are the runoff volume and pollutant concentration as a function of time respectively and n is the point in the storm and percentage of the runoff volume range is from 0 to 100 m and v are the total mass of the emitted pollutant and total runoff volume respectively 2 3 monitoring and load calculation the number of samples at both study sites ca 1 and ca 2 was 62 09 04 2008 to 18 06 2013 except for that of chemical oxygen demand cod which was 55 the rainfall data were acquired from the automatic weather system managed by the korea meteorological administration which is located in unam dong gwangju city approximately 3 km from the study sites to measure runoff a flow meter flo tote3 usa was installed at the end of the rain water drainage conduit and the flow rate was measured every 1 min the samples for water quality analysis were manually collected at 15 min intervals for the first 2 h and then sampled at approximately 1 2 h intervals until the runoff ceased using an automatic sampler isco portable sampler 6712 usa water quality parameters including biochemical oxygen demand bod cod total organic carbon toc ss total nitrogen t n and total phosphorus t p were analyzed according to the apha method 2001 the pollutant load was calculated using the monitored flow rate and corresponding concentrations of water quality parameters 2 4 regression tree and random forest methods the rt algorithm subdivides a dataset by decision rules on the target variables to obtain preferably homogeneous subgroups with regard to the response variable breiman et al 1984 ließ et al 2012 an application of the rt can be summarized into two stages the first stage involves growing trees in an optimal split which is selected and evaluated by the least square deviation lsd hasanipanah et al 2017 the variance in nodes is calculated using eq 4 the optimal split is chosen as the difference between the mother node and the left child node and the right child node is maximized eq 5 ließ et al 2012 granata et al 2017 4 r t 1 n t i 1 n y i t y t 2 5 r t r t l r t r where r t is the variance in node t and node t is divided into the left child node t l and right child node t r n is the number of observations and y is the predicted mean value in a second stage the rt algorithm prunes the trees by removing tree sections or nodes that have little explanatory power if there are too many nodes then it can create problems such as overfitting the outputs or predictions of an overfitted model do not respond sensitively to newly added data and the overfitting may introduce additional uncertainty into the outputs breiman et al 1984 rf is a combination of tree predictors and each tree or node is determined based on the values of a random vector sampled from the same distribution for all trees in the forest breiman 2001 rf is similar to bagging trees in the sense that they bootstrap samples the difference is that each tree is grown with a randomized subset of variables prasad et al 2006 in short the rf algorithm builds as a number of trees ntree and averages the result of each tree eq 6 6 f x 1 k k 1 k t x where f x is the result of the rf k is the ntree and t x is the result of each rt the ntree node size and number of features tried at each node mtry are defined by users studies demonstrated that prediction errors would converge to an asymptotic value in model tests and the rf would not be overfitted when ntree increased appropriately breiman 2001 peters et al 2007 the rf has the advantage of calculating the relative importance of parameters which can be estimated by two methods gini impurity gi and mean square error mse the gi is used to calculate the quality of each split for the variables in a tree and mse calculates the mean decrease in prediction accuracy due to splits on every predictor breiman 2001 ouedraogo et al 2018 genuer et al 2010 argued that the use of mse could provide more reliable estimates of the relative importance than that of the gi because the gi method is not fair in favor of predictor variables with many categories thus we selected the mse method to estimate the relative importance in this study it is important to understand how each rainfall related variable influences the ffe of each water quality parameter and both the rt and rf methods can provide the relative importance rate of the influencing variables rodriguez galiano et al 2012 the predictions of the rt method may vary depending on the characteristics of training sets provided and such sensitivity issue can be solved by implementing bootstrapping when selecting training data diaz uriate and de andrés 2006 the rt method can be quickly trained regardless of the number of trees and classes but the learning time of the rf method can be much longer depending on ntree values selected the ntree value was decided by estimating the mse which could be affected by ntree values the sensitivity of mse to ntree is depicted in fig 2 the mses were quickly stabilized even when the ntree value reached 200 and then they slowly decreased until the ntree value hit 1000 we selected the ntree value of 1000 in this study the other attribute values including node size of five and mtry one third of the total number of predictors were selected from literature wang et al 2015a the overall application procedures of the rt and rf methods are described in fig 3 matlab software r2018b mathworks inc was used to develop the rt and rf algorithms to predict the mffn of bod cod toc ss t n and t p model output using seven rainfall characteristic variables model input in commercial areas the modeling was conducted using an intel i5 8500 3 00 ghz cpu with 16 0 gb of ram 2 5 data normalization data normalization is the process of rescaling the data to specific ranges such as 0 to 1 normalization is required when variables of interest have different value ranges as the learning rates of machine learning techniques are sensitive to the value ranges ioffe and szegedy 2015 for example ar15 showed the highest learning rate among the input variables due to its larger upper limit compared to those of the others and it was followed by ar10 r rimax add rdur and rimean in this study all variables were normalized using eq 7 to ensure an equal learning rate for the variables 7 x x m i n x max x m i n x where x is the normalized value of the data set range of 0 to 1 and x is the original value 2 6 model validation the rt and rf models were trained with a part 80 of the water quality observations or samples and then tested using the remaining dataset 20 afendras and markatou 2015 2019 which is often called the hold out validation the datasets were randomly selected for the two parts to minimize the amount of bias to be potentially introduced in the model evaluation there are several other methods to train and test the models the k fold cross validation is one commonly used method a study demonstrated that a k fold method might provide better performance than a hold out method in terms of the amount of bias and variance yadav and shukla 2016 however there are critical disadvantages to employing a k fold method genuer et al 2010 showed that the k fold cross validation required much more computational power and thus the quality of model training and validation comes at the expense of computing resources in addition they demonstrated that the k fold cross validation could behave unsatisfactorily if the data set is small on the other hand the hold out validation is relatively much fast compared to the k fold method although the results of the hold out validation are dependent on the characteristics of data sets used the issue can be solved by employing statistical techniques such as bootstrapping in this study we selected the hold out validation method because 1 the size of observation is not large 2 the method has been frequently used and 3 its efficiency has been proved by many other studies rodriguez galiano et al 2012 mondal et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 granata et al 2017 singh et al 2017 sihag et al 2018 to validate the models four different criteria were used including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 p value and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 which are suitable for selecting the best model among a number of models snipes and taylor 2014 model evaluation with these four criteria was conducted using the r software packages hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2017 and usingr verzani 2018 8 n s e 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 9 r 2 i 1 n x i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 10 a i c 2 k 2 l n l where xi and yi are the predicted value and observed value from site i respectively and n is the number of samples in the aic k is the number of parameters and l is the likelihood function for example if the aic shows a lower score then it can be interpreted by a better model the range in nse is from to 1 perfect fit an efficiency of lower than 0 indicates that the mean value of the observed time series would have had better prediction performance than the model nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 is interpreted as the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable or explainable by the independent variables its value ranges from 0 to 1 a value of 1 indicates that the dependent variables can be perfectly predicted by the independent ones usually nse and r2 greater than 0 5 are considered as acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 first flush analysis the mffn was calculated from mff0 to mff100 in study sites with similar impervious ratios ca 1 and ca 2 an example of the mffn for each runoff event is presented in fig 4 in this study we focused on mff10 to mff30 as previous studies have shown that ffe can be effectively understood with pollutant loads created in the first 30 of runoff volume saget et al 1995 bertrand krajewski et al 1998 the mff30 values of water quality parameters and the ffe criterion dotted line are presented in fig 5 the average pollutant mass export ratio of bod cod toc ss t n and t p in the first 30 of the runoff volume was calculated as 47 43 39 44 39 and 44 for ca 1 respectively and those for ca 2 were 41 37 38 48 35 and 37 respectively there must be many factors that make the difference between mffn values calculated for the study sites ca 1 and ca 2 including difference in the land use the microtopography of the surface and thus stormwater hydraulics the layout of the sewer system and the use of street sweepers to remove pollutants dirt and debris the first flush has relatively heavy loadings of bod cod ss and t p over 40 of the pollutant mass export ratio in the first 30 of the runoff volume in this study in ca 1 and ss and bod in ca 2 the statistics of mff10 30 are presented in table 1 and the mffn prediction performance of the both rt and rf models are presented in fig 6 hongbing et al 2009 observed that bod cod and tss show a strong first flush in most rainfall events but a weak first flush for t n and t p in industrial and residential areas lee and bang 2000 also reported that the strength of the ffe in the order of cod ss po4 p no3 n for industrial areas and residential areas which means that the ffe of ss and organic matter is stronger than that of nutrients in urban catchments 3 2 variables to predict the mass first flush ratio by random forest and regression tree seven variables add ar10 ar15 rimean rimax r and rdur were incorporated into the rt and rf models as independent variables to predict mff10 30 the add ranged from 0 d to 34 d ar10 ranged from 0 mm to 301 6 mm ar15 ranged from 0 3 mm to 516 9 mm rimean ranged from approximately 0 32 mm h to 17 31 mm h rimax ranged from 1 mm h to 70 mm h r ranged from 1 mm to 217 mm and rdur ranged from 1 13 h to 29 1 h the characteristics of all the runoff events are summarized in table 2 3 3 regression tree and random forest algorithm performance in mass first flush ratio prediction the mffn values of bod cod toc ss t n and t p were predicted using the rt and rf models as mentioned earlier the seven variables were normalized from 0 to 1 because during the rt or rf model processing different scales of each variable could affect the results then the rt and rf models were trained with a set of training data 80 randomly selected from the entire date set and then the trained models were tested using the other data set 20 to evaluate the performance of the models razakamanarivo et al 2011 reported that the bagging regression tree model shows better prediction accuracy for predicting soil organic carbon stocks than that of multiple linear models moreover oliveira et al 2012 also reported that the rf model shows better prediction performance for modeling spatial patterns of fire occurrence than that of multiple linear models therefore we assumed that the results obtained by the machine learning algorithm were better than those obtained by multiple linear models we did not try multiple linear modeling and only discussed the results of the rf and rt models in this study we evaluated the results of the mff10 mff50 predictions and found that the prediction after mff30 was likely not strongly affected by the rainfall characteristics lang et al 2013 also showed similar results that the mffn of nitrogen and phosphorus over mff30 showed no correlations with rainfall runoff characteristics therefore we only discussed up to the prediction of mff30 the performances of predicting mff10 30 are summarized in tables 3 5 considering the results acquired for mff10 with two different algorithms the results of the rt model is presented in fig 7 and those of the rf model is presented in fig 8 the rt model showed acceptable r2 0 5 and nse 0 5 results for bod cod and t p but the r2 and nse of other target variables toc ss and t n showed lower values than those of the rf algorithm on average the performance of the rt and rf models could be evaluated by the aic values i e a lower value indicates higher performance the aic values of bod cod toc ss t n and t p are presented in table 3 in general the target variables simulated using the rf algorithm had lower aic values than did those of the rt algorithm except for t n and t p ao et al 2018 compared the performance of the rt and rf models for predicting formation properties for shale and reported better performance of the rf model than the rt model however the rt model showed the advantage of running time in our study the rt model took only 0 4 s to be trained but 2 8 s were required to train the rf method the scatter plot of the rf model performance on mff10 is presented in fig 8 the rf model showed acceptable prediction power r2 0 5 and nse 0 5 and p values 0 005 for bod cod toc ss and t p however t n showed low prediction performance r2 0 29 and nse 0 05 one of the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance for t n was that clear relationships between stormwater runoff and water quality for t n are not established in urban areas lee and bang 2000 and more precise monitoring is recommended to obtain better results mannina and viviani 2010 the results of mff20 are presented in table 4 and figs s2 s3 the r2 value was less than 0 5 for most variables for the rt model only cod showed an acceptable r2 value but the nse presented a low value nse 0 11 the rt model seemed to have lower prediction performance owing to the intrinsic problem of predicting different values depending on the data collected for the study sets on the other hand the rf model provided better prediction performance for bod cod toc and t p ss showed an acceptable r2 value of 0 64 but a low nse of 0 48 however t n showed poor prediction performance with an r2 value of 0 25 and an nse of 0 04 the prediction performance results of mff30 are presented in table 5 and figs s4 s5 the rt model showed poor prediction performance for all target variables similarly the r2 values of most of the target variables were less than 0 5 except for bod and t p using the rf model and the nse also showed unacceptable values for all target variables thus to improve the prediction of mff30 more samples or different variables are required which will influence the calculation of mff30 3 4 relative importance rate of each variable to predict the mass first flush ratio the relative importance rate of each variable was estimated by 100 runs of the rt and rf models the relative importance results are presented in figs 9 and 10 and they were normalized to 100 the most significant difference between the results of the rt and rf models was the range in the importance rate for example the predicted values for t p using the rt model showed a wide relative importance range for ar15 0 0 39 3 while the range obtained by the rf model was 14 0 26 3 this could be explained by the fact that the rt model trained the data with 80 of the data set and the relative importance rate could be changed according to data set selected however the relative importance of the rt model showed a similar tendency with the rf model but as mentioned above the range in the importance rate showed a large difference between the rt and rf models for the rf model the variables of organic matter indicators bod and cod showed stronger relationships with the ri than other variables toc showed stronger relationship rates for the ri ar and rdur ss showed higher values for the ri and rdur t n showed a strong relationship with rdur but the range in importance rate was wider than that of other variables thus the correlation between t n and rainfall characteristics requires more research t p showed a relationship between ar and ri in summary the ar ri and or rdur showed a greater influence than other variables for bod cod toc and t p however add which could influence the buildup of pollutants showed a low importance rate for most of the water quality parameters liu et al 2013 also found that ri and rdur have a stronger relationship with stormwater quality than add 4 conclusion this study estimated the mff10 to mff30 of six different water quality parameters and investigated the relationship between the target variables and rainfall characteristics using rt and rf models the mffn was predicted from normalized rainfall related variables including add ar10 and ar15 rimean rimax r and rdur using the trained rt and rf models the observed ffe showed relatively strong intensity for bod cod ss and t p in ca 1 and for ss and bod in ca 2 such results demonstrated that ffe is a function of urban land cover types and their areas as well as rainfall characteristics the rt model showed a relatively wide range of the relative importance when predicting the mffn which implies there might be relatively considerable uncertainty in the prediction of the rt model compared to that of the rf model in contrast the rf model showed a narrow range in the prediction which should be attributed to the bootstrapping implemented to fairly select training data in addition the rt model was relatively quickly trained compared to the rf model thus the rt model would be preferred when computing resources are limited with a large amount of data to be investigated in terms of accuracy however the rf outperformed the rt model when predicting the mffn the rf model predicted the mff10 and mff20 of bod cod toc and t p at acceptable accuracy levels in the case of ss the model provided acceptable r2 statistics but low nse values in addition the model failed to predict t n accurately both rf and rt models predicted the mff30 of all the target variables inaccurately such limitations suggest additional research is needed to determine the parameters that influence the ffe of ss and t n and the relationship between mff30 and other variables that can be relatively easily monitored the importance rate determined by the rf and rt models showed that water quality parameters were influenced by different rainfall related variables bod and cod were closely associated with ri and toc and t p showed strong relationships with ri and ar ss and t n were closely related to ri and rdur respectively the range of the importance rate for t n was wider than those of the other parameters implying that t n will require further research to determine the specific influential factors this study demonstrated the potential and limitations of the rt and rf algorithms as a tool to estimate mffn and help better understand urban stormwater quality processes as computing algorithms and resources have advanced rapidly machine learning techniques are expected to be more commonly employed in hydrologic studies especially when a quick analysis and solution is required with the limited number of observations there are many existing and emerging machine learning algorithms applicable to urban stormwater studies such as neural network and support vector machine and it is critical to explore and realize their full potential for improved understanding of urban stormwater processes

6402,rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas easily triggers flashy floods urban drainage systems conveying stormwater out of cities are key infrastructure elements for flood mitigation this study develops an intelligent urban flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage through optimizing the multi objective operation rules of pumping stations for effectual flood management in taipei city the yu cheng pumping station constitutes the study case and a large number of datasets collected from 17 typhoon storm events are adopted for model construction and validation three objective functions are designed to minimize 1 the sum of water level fluctuations in the flood storage pond fsp 2 the sum of peak fsp water levels and 3 the mean absolute difference of pump switches between

objectives we next formulate the optimal operation rules through a two tier sorting process based on a compromised pareto optimal solution the comparison of the simulated results obtained from both the optimal operation rules and current operation rules indicate that the optimal operation rules outperform current operation rules for all three objectives with improvement rates reaching 43 obj1 3 obj2 and 71 obj3 respectively we demonstrate that the derived intelligent urban flood drainage system can serve as reliable and efficient operational strategies for urban flood management and flood risk mitigation keywords real time urban flood control flood risk mitigation pump operation rules multi objective optimization non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii 1 introduction the fast growing urban population in the world is an inevitable fact the rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas causes less water infiltration but flashy floods which invariably increases flood risks large scale floods are ravaging the globe and often leave fatal consequences in their wake global attention nowadays has been intensively drawn to flood prevention for the protection of life and property cohesive development and adaptation of new knowledge should be made not only to reduce flood risks but to increase the flood preparedness of residents and professionals becker et al 2014 chang et al 2014 girons lopez et al 2017 hsu et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2014 methodologies for the design of a sewer system control hierarchy using temporal decomposition were explored mollerup et al 2016 developing the optimal management of weirs pumping stations reservoirs and inlets at floodwater retention areas can significantly control the consequences brought by floods implementing advanced technologies and operational strategies for the combined sewer systems would be an important means to address challenges encountered in urban drainage lund et al 2018 provided an overview of methods and tools for performing model predictive control mpc within the field of urban drainage and they pointed out the concept of smart cities might lead to new operational goals such that mpc could be useful to migrate urban drainage systems from passive traditional infrastructure systems to proactive adaptive systems based on a high level of intelligent measures intelligent urban flood control systems explored by artificial intelligence ai could promote the efficiency and reliability of drainage infrastructures chen et al 2017 liu and cheng 2014 mollerup et al 2016 it is desirable and beneficial to have a collaborative development and applications of new knowledge and advanced technologies to improve decision making increase community and flood resilience and reduce flood related damages this will increase the potential in finding solutions to coping with highly complex problems such as multiple objectives pump operation in response to the rapid rise of flood flow during extreme events the traditional urban flood control strategy is to build embankments along river banks to prevent cities from flooding besides pumping stations are set up around the drainage outlets behind embankments to pump flood water out of cities because gravity draining may fail during extreme events undoubtedly pumping stations play a decisive role in urban flood control systems pumping stations unable to perform drainage functions properly would bring flood disasters which usually cause property losses and residents resentment accordingly there is an urgent need for the optimal utilization of available means to flood prevention nevertheless current pump operation guidelines were set up a long time ago and no pump operation rule was established particularly to cope with urbanization and climate change such phenomena occur in many developed cities in asia for instance hiramitsu and abe 2001 stated that no well defined concept of pump operation control was built in japan several approaches were explored to improve such conditions chiang et al 2011 proposed rule based fuzzy neural networks to on line predict the number of open and closed pumps of a pumping station in taipei city up to a lead time of 20 min yazdi and kim 2015 developed a real time optimization approach to searching the optimal policies for collaborative operation of drainage facilities in a portion of an urban drainage system in seoul the operation and maintenance cost of a pump station depends on a number of factors including climatic conditions hydrological conditions the type and age of pumps quality of operation and operator experience makaremi et al 2017 conventional pump operation guidelines are often vague and difficult to follow and therefore skilled and experienced operators are required to overcome such disadvantages there is an imperative need to create new multi objective operation rules for governing real time pump operation based on careful consideration of current hydrological conditions and various pump operation objectives through systematical analyses and optimization mechanisms to protect cities from the ravages of floods countermeasures to flooding should make a close collaboration with sewerage systems and river management the optimal control of urban drainage networks would aim at tackling the problem and generating intelligent control strategies ahead of flood occurrence based on the monitoring data transmitted from telemetry systems for minimizing flooding and sewer overflows this becomes a great challenge on account of the high complexity and uncertainty of the flood control system as well as the societal pressure on the efficient generation of solutions in this study we implement a state of the art technology to propose efficient multi objective pump operation rules for real time urban flood control management previous studies facilitated ai techniques such as genetic algorithms gas artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy inference to construct humanlike operation strategies regarding urban drainage systems chang et al 2008 yazdi and kim 2015 optimal pumping control cembrano 2004 zhuan and xia 2013 urban flood forecast chiang et al 2010 hsu et al 2013 noymanee et al 2017 and flood deference tamotoet et al 2008 wang et al 2013 for securing cities of interest nevertheless there were few studies addressing the development of the optimal pump operation rules in urban drainage systems using multi objective optimization methods yazdi et al 2016 among them a global optimal control system was implemented in a sewer network of quebec to real time manage flows and water levels for reducing the frequency and volumes of combined sewer overflows discharged into rivers pleau et al 2005 fiorelli et al 2013 proposed a control approach for a combined sewer network in luxembourg which considered three optimization goals for sewer systems and relied on a simple hydraulic model of the sewer system plenty of real world optimization problems are non linear in nature and have multiple conflicting objectives subject to various constraints deb 2005 conventionally such problems could be solved by being artificially converted into a single objective problem with development in advanced technologies multi objective optimization can be achieved nowadays which has a tremendous practical importance yet difficulties arise because such problems introduce a set of trade off optimal solutions i e pareto optimal solutions instead of a single optimum solution it then becomes critical to find as many of pareto optimal solutions as possible because any two optimal solutions form a trade off between the objectives such that users will be in a better position to make an adequate choice from compromised trade off solutions theevolutionary algorithm ea inspired bybiological evolution is a generic population basedmetaheuristicoptimizationalgorithm the ea can identify a diverse set of pareto optimal solutions to provides a spread of solutions that well converge to the non dominated set for the problem investigated coello et al 2006 goldberg and kuo 1987 the compromised solutions produced from eas usually perform better than traditional optimization solutions and their tradeoffs are very useful when making a sound decision from alternative options the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 belongs to contemporary multi objective eas the nsga ii contains few tuning parameters but exhibits high performance which makes itself very applicable to various kinds of optimization problems nicklow et al 2010 there is noticeably increasing interest in the development and applicability of biologically based eas for solving multi objective optimization problems in diversified water resources management issues such as reservoir management chang and chang 2009 davidsen et al 2015 ehteram et al 2017 lerma et al 2015 srinivasan and kumar 2018 tsai et al 2015 2016 water utilization davijani et al 2016 li et al 2018 matrosov et al 2015 ormsbee and lansey 2015 zheng et al 2015 urban drainage system barreto et al 2009 li et al 2015 rathnayake 2016 yazdi et al 2016 energy management and conversion feng et al 2018 karami et al 2018 peralta et al 2014 yang et al 2015 sustainable groundwater modeling sadeghi tabas et al 2017 sreekanth et al 2016 yeh 2015 and flood forecasting chang et al 2016 taormina et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 these studies showed that eas were flexible and powerful tools in solving an array of complex water resources problems although the optimal control in urban drainage networks has recently caught the attention of numerous policy making and regulatory agencies it has been rarely addressed regarding the integrated engineering system for its planning regulation and management in an interdisciplinary way this work specifically fills this gap by addressing the integrated multi site flood control system in particular this study intends to develop a methodology that determines the optimal multi objective pump operation rules using eas so that the pump operation system can be more intelligent in optimizing its efficiency effectiveness and flexibility for flood control management the requirements and basic components of the optimal pump operation rules accounting for carryover storage are presented and discussed the yu cheng pumping station and its drainage area in taipei taiwan forms the study case the applicability and reliability of the proposed methodology is examined in light of the limitations on the existing pump operation and operator acceptance 2 study area and datasets taiwan is located in the subtropical jet stream monsoon zone of the north pacific ocean taipei city is the political economic and cultural center of taiwan and the taipei metropolitan area has a population over 7 million taipei city is surrounded by three confluent rivers flowing to the ocean through a narrow estuary it is difficult for the city to effectively discharge massive flood water such that flood hazards may take place easily during typhoon storm periods consequently high levees were built along the river for preventing the city from flooding typhoons are usually coupled with intensive rainfalls and thus urban flooding could occur within a few hours in taipei city because of high levees floodwater inside the levee system has become the main threat to the city nowadays therefore pumping stations are facilitated to manage internal storm water for flood mitigation the yu cheng catchment located in southeastern taipei is the study area fig 1 a this catchment occupying an area of about 1627 ha constitutes the biggest drainage system in taipei city the yu cheng pumping station with two operational sites is the largest pumping station in the city the original pumping capacity is 184 1 cms which can deal with rainfall intensity up to 42 5 mm hr a near by station expansion with a pumping capacity of 50 0 cms was built later on to join pump operation for coping with rainfall intensity of 56 mm hr consequently the total pumping capacity reaches 234 1 cms the joint operation of the two connected sites did achieve expected performance during typhoon storm events however due to climate change in recent years it is imperative to make some adjustments on pump operation based on the accumulated experience in managing water levels to ensure the safety of residents in the future the station is equipped with a total of 11 pumps site 1 installs 7 pumps 1 7 with an overall pumping capacity reaching 184 1 cms 26 3 cms pump while site 2 installs 4 pumps 8 11 with an overall pumping capacity reaching 50 0 cms 12 5 cms pump fig 1 b shows the hydrological hydraulic connections between site 1 and site 2 where sites 1 and 2 are connected by a water diversion box culvert of size 5 0 m 3 2 m and a back up box culvert of size 4 1 m 3 5 m it is noted that pumps 26 3 cms pump in site 1 have the same performance curve which means all pumps have equal pumping capacity similarly for discharge rate under the same water level and water head pumps 12 5 cms pump in site 2 also have the same performance curve however the performance curves of site 1 and site 2 are different pump operation highly depends on the water level of the flood storage pond fsp i e carryover storage for site 1 pumps are activated with a 3 minute warm up if the fsp water level reaches the warning level 1 8 m then inner water will be pumped out to the surrounding river i e the keelung river of the station as soon as the fsp water level reaches the start level 2 2 m similar actions will be taken for site 2 whose warning and start levels are 2 4 m and 2 6 m respectively pump operation begins with site 1 and site 2 will join the operation as soon as all the 7 pumps in site 1 are activated in this study the investigative data were collected from 17 typhoon storm events at a temporal resolution of 10 min during 2004 and 2014 including fsp water levels river water levels historical pumping records and pump performance curves a total of 2 789 datasets are adopted to construct the optimal pump operation model in which the numbers of datasets allocated into training and testing phases are 2 473 13 storm events and 316 4 storm events respectively table 1 3 methodology the optimization model of an urban drainage system involves a set of equations that give an evaluation of the system s variables and their responses to control actions at the gates the main objective of this study is to develop an intelligent flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage that optimizes multi objective pump operation rules for minimizing the urban flood risk for the largest pumping station in taipei city during storm events we propose a two tier sorting process based on pareto optimal solutions of the nsga ii to formulate the optimal multi objective pump operation rules the proposed methodology first adopts 13 storm events to construct the optimal pump operation rules and then uses 4 storm events to evaluate the reliability and practicability of the constructed rules through an operational comparison between the optimal operation rules and the current ones the research framework is presented in fig 2 and a detailed description of the methodology is introduced as follows 3 1 nsga ii the goal of an optimization model is to recognize the best control trajectory for each actuator during the upcoming control horizon the best set of control trajectories is the one that optimizes the objectives under the given constraints lund et al 2018 in this study the optimal pump operation is conducted by the nsga ii for mitigating unban flood risk as well as reducing energy consumption the nsga ii has the merit of coping better with computational complexity non elitism approach and the need for specifying a sharing parameter it can obtain a much better spread of pareto optimal solutions and better convergence compared to other multi objective optimization algorithms e g pareto archived evolution strategy and strength pareto ea two other elitist multi objective eas deb 2002 the implementation procedure of the nsga ii is briefly summarized as follows step 1 randomly initialize a population p 0 of size n apply the fast non dominated sorting and compute the crowding distances of the population step 2 implement reproduction crossover and mutation to generate an offspring population q t step 3 evaluate the fitness values calculate the fast non dominated sorting and crowding distances of p t and q t to generate an offspring population p t 1 of size n step 4 repeat steps 3 and 4 until reaching the stop criterion p0 denotes the n sets of operation rules that are randomly generated in this study each set of operation rules contains 22 points 11 fsp water levels x axis and 11 water heads y axis which support the nsga ii to conduct the optimal search model optimization involves both decision variables and constraints we adapt a simple constraint handling strategy to the nsga ii the strategy assigns each infeasible solution with an overall constraint violation value while assigns a feasible solution with a zero value of constraint violation each feasible solution receives a better non domination rank than all infeasible solutions correspondingly an infeasible solution would receive a better non domination rank if it has a smaller overall constraint violation value than the others the parameter setting of the nsga ii model is listed in table 2 multi objective optimization commonly has two goals converging to the pareto front and maintaining the diversity of the pareto optimal solutions the diversity metric δ is defined as eq 1 1 δ d f d 1 i 1 n 1 d i d d f d l n 1 d where di is the euclidean distance between consecutive solutions in the pareto optimal set of solutions df and dl are the distances between the extreme solutions and the boundary solutions respectively d f d l 0 in this case and d is the average distance of all distances di 3 2 objectives the purpose of applying the optimal control is to compute feasible strategies for the actuators in the network which produces the best admissible states of the network the goals of urban drainage systems are generally concerned with flood prevention and minimization of the combined sewer overflow to the environment in this study case flood prevention gains the top priority flood damages can be greatly mitigated through careful scheduling of pump operation which is highly sensitive to the fsp water level according to pump performance curves the water head i e the water level difference between the fsp and the river significantly influences pumping capacity the larger the water head is the lesser the water a pump discharges this study aims at developing the optimal multi objective pump operation rules using the nsga ii with a close assessment on the collaborative impacts of fsp water level and water head on pump operation we consider three objectives which are 1 obj1 that minimizes the sum of fsp water level fluctuation to make smooth pump operation 2 obj2 that minimizes the sum of peak fsp water levels to reduce urban flood hazards and 3 obj3 that minimizes the accumulated absolute difference of pump switches between two consecutive times along the operation sequence to avoid frequent switch on off of a pump within a short time obj1 minimizes the sum of fsp water level fluctuations for typhoon events as shown in eq 2 2 min o b j 1 m k 1 k t 2 t wl k t wl k t 1 where wl k t is the fsp water level k is the number of training events 13 in this study case k is the training event t is the number of time steps in the k th event and t is the time step in the k th event the time interval is 10 min in our case one way to reduce the risk of urban flood hazard is to minimize the peak fsp water level which can be achieved through rapidly starting up pumps to discharge the inner storm water into the surrounding river therefore obj2 minimizes the sum of the peak fsp water levels for typhoon events which is formulated in eq 3 3 min o b j 2 m k 1 k m a x wl k where m a x wl k is the peak of the fsp water level in the k th event pump operation should avoid frequent switch on off of a pump within a short time otherwise it would increase energy consumption and damage the pump and therefore raise its maintenance cost we notice that considering the number of pump switches instead of real maintenance cost is a means to simplifying the problem for formulating it mathematically makaremi et al 2017 the third objective function proposed in this study aims at tackling this issue by minimizing the number of pump switches to provide operators with optimal scheduling programs the formulation of the third objective function obj3 is to minimize the mean absolute difference in the numbers of duty pumps between t and t 1 along operation sequences as shown in eq 4 4 m i n o b j 3 p u m p s t i m e s t e p k 1 k t 1 t np k t np k t 1 k 1 k ts k where np k t is the number of duty pumps in the k th event at time step t and ts k is the total number of time steps in the k th event 3 3 constraints constraint setting usually confines the search space and avoids the occurrence of abnormal conditions for instance when the fsp water level is higher than the maximum fsp water level or the number of duty pumps exceeds the maximum number of available pumps in this study constraints involve the number of pumps fsp water level and water head the number of duty pumps should fall between 0 and the number of available pumps eq 5 5 0 n p k t np max where np k t is the number of duty pumps in the k th event at time step t and np max is the maximum number of available pumps due to urbanization and climate change flash floods usually cause a very quick increase in the fsp water level in practice operators may activate pumps to discharge water even though the fsp water level is lower than the start level 2 2 m of current operation rules therefore the start level is re designed as 1 8 m for adapting to practical operation when searching for the optimal operation rules in this study these constraints are formulated as follows 6 1 8 m wl p 2 7 m p 1 7 s i t e 1 7 2 7 m wl p 5 0 m p 8 11 s i t e 2 where wl p is the fsp water level for the pth pump 8 0 wh p 5 20 m p 1 7 s i t e 1 9 0 wh p 7 25 m p 8 11 s i t e 2 where wh p is the water head the water level difference between the fsp and the river for the pth pump 10 wl k t 1 wl k t w l inflow k t w l outflow k t where k is the training event t is the time step in the k th event wl inflow k t and wl outflow k t are the fsp water levels converted from inflow and outflow in the kth event at time step t respectively consequently the performance of the obtained optimal pump operation rules is compared with that of current pump operation rules to evaluate the reliability and practicability of the proposed model the nsga ii algorithm implemented in this study was re written using microsoft visual studio c programming language based on the nsga ii algorithm written in c language released in deb 2002 4 results and discussion this study proposes an optimization framework determining a set of pump operating rules that are optimal with respect to multiple objectives for an integrated urban drainage river system accounting for carryover storage across a variety of typhoon storm events 4 1 optimization of multi objective pump operation for a nontrivial multi objective optimization problem objective functions may conflict with each other while there are a set of pareto compromised solutions that are considered equally good our mission is to find a set of pareto optimal solutions that satisfy the diverse preferences of decision makers the search for the pareto front of the optimal operation rules subject to objectives and constraints is conducted by the nsga ii based on 2 473 datasets of 13 storm events fig 3 indicates that the nsga ii search procedure can well converge before 100 generations for all the three objectives i e the three objective functions converge into relatively small ranges after a certain number of search generations fig 4 presents the pareto front of 1 000 converged solutions in a three dimensional view corresponding to the three objectives fig 4 a shows that the solutions to obj1 fall within 137 m 145 m the solutions to obj2 fall within 37 6 m 38 4 m and the solutions to obj3 fall within 0 37 pumps time step 0 45 pumps time step fig 4 b d show the results of obj1 vs obj2 obj1 vs obj3 and obj2 vs obj3 respectively in sum obj2 has negative correlations with obj1 and obj3 fig 4 b and d while obj1 and obj3 are positively correlated fig 4 c it appears that there exist several short horizontal lines that aggregate many solutions in fig 4 b and d which suggest the sum of peak fsp water levels obj2 remains the same while the other two objectives would fluctuate widely it is noted that solutions i 5 and i 632 produce the highest values for obj2 but the lowest values for obj1 and obj3 while solutions i 209 and i 267 produce the lowest values for obj2 but the highest values for obj1 and obj3 fig 4 d 4 2 assessment of the optimal pump operation fig 5 illustrates the simulated results number of duty pumps and fsp water level along the time sequence of typhoon saola 2012 concerning four selected optimal solutions obtained from the nsga ii fig 5 a and b show that the number of duty pumps and the fsp water level associated with solutions i 5 and i 632 do not make much difference over time except for only a few time points time steps fig 5 c and d show similar results for solution i 5 and i 632 that is to say the number of duty pumps and the fsp water level associated with these two solutions are almost the same along the time sequence except for only a few time points after the 121th time step 4 3 features of the optimal pump operation the 1000 optimal solutions displayed in fig 4 c can be clearly distinguished into three groups i e groups 1 3 we further explore the specific features of groups 1 3 using 3d representation as shown in fig 6 a c respectively fig 6 a displays the optimal solutions representative of larger peak fsp water levels obj2 red or yellow but smaller fsp water level fluctuations obj1 and smaller differences in the number of duty pumps obj3 in contrast fig 6 c displays the optimal solutions representative of smaller peak fsp water levels obj2 from light blue to blue but larger fsp water level fluctuations obj1 and larger differences in the number of duty pumps obj3 alternatively fig 6 b displays the optimal solutions representative of medium sized peak fsp water levels obj2 green or light blue 4 4 comparison between the optimal operation rules and current operation rules table 3 shows the comparison of the pump operational results between the optimal rules obtained from the nsga ii and the current rules for obj1 the minimal value of the optimal operation rules occurs at 137 22 m which is approximately half of the value 247 98 m of current operation rules it means current operation rules would produce more fluctuations in the fsp water levels and therefore cause operators to switch on off pumps more frequently which suggests the optimal operation rules are much more effective than current operation rules for obj2 the minimal value 37 72 m of the optimal operation rules is less than that 39 01 m of the current operation values which suggests the optimal operation rules produce a better result effectively decrease the peak fsp water level as well as reduce the flood risk for obj3 the minimal value 0 38 pumps time step of the optimal operation rules is only about 1 4 of the value 1 46 pumps time step of current operation rules which shows the efficiency switch on off pumps less frequently of the optimal operation rules in brief the optimal operation rules deliver superior results than current operation rules in the perspectives of all the three objectives table 3 also shows the objective values of a compromised solution the black dot shown in fig 4 randomly selected from the 1000 pareto optimal solutions it appears that the compromised solution performs much better than the current pump operation rules in terms of all three objective functions obj1 obj3 which evidently explains the true meaning benefit effectiveness of the pareto front in a trade off sense as a result the optimal operation rules obtained from the nsga ii not only could significantly decrease the frequency of switching on off pumps but could effectively mitigate the fluctuations of the fsp water level besides the optimal operation rules could effectively reduce the peak fsp water levels during typhoon events and therefore significantly decrease the risk of overflow from the fsp into the city the pareto optimal solutions suggest practical management options for decision makers and operators to manage the pump operational system when comparing the existing and alternative pump operational schemes the nsga ii results alternative schemes would significantly improve the performance of the three objective functions obj1 obj3 for the pump operational system where the number of duty pumps could be reduced and the peak fsp water level could be decreased during flood events we conclude that the optimal pump operation rules obtained from the nsga ii could significantly mitigate the flood risk of taipei city 4 5 optimal operation rules and performance evaluation fig 7 presents the optimal pump operation rules associated with the selected compromised solution the black dot shown in fig 4 and the current pump operation rules it is noted that the yu cheng pumping station has eleven pumps seven in site 1 and four in site 2 which are jointly operated site 1 gains higher priority in operation than site 2 to better depict the joint operation each subfigure of fig 7 is divided into two zones the blue zone represents the operation of site 1 only and the brown zone represents the joint operation of site 1 and site 2 the number shown in each sub zone stripe denotes the number of duty pumps between two operation rules i e the laddered fsp water level numbers in green denote duty pumps of site 1 while numbers in red denote duty pumps of site 2 fig 7 a reveals that the activation of pumping activity under current operation rules depends solely on the fsp water level which inevitably causes operators to frequently switch on off pumps in response to the dynamic fluctuations of the fsp water level especially when flash floods occur such a phenomenon can be observed in figs 8 and 9 operation hydrographs of a training case and a test case respectively in contrast the optimal operation rules configured by the nsga ii consider the fsp water level and the water head simultaneously fig 7 b shows the optimal operation rules of the selected compromised solution the pump operation in site 1 follows eqs 6 and 8 i e the fsp water level 1 8 m 2 7 m and the water head 0 m 5 2 m while the pump operation in site 2 follows eqs 7 and 9 i e the fsp water level 2 7 m 5 0 m and the water head 0 m 7 25 m the optimal operation rules of each compromised solution in the pareto front could be derived from a two tier sorting process introduced as follows the number of duty pumps associated with fsp water level and water head can be drawn by sorting the 22 chromosomes table 2 the two tier sorting process begins with the sorting of the 22 chromosomes in an increasing order along the y axis water head followed by the sorting along the x axis fsp water level the sorted pairs are denoted as x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x11 y11 where xi xi 1 i 1 11 and yj yj 1 j 1 11 the sorted pairs can be used to construct the optimal operation rules by linking these pairs in the following way 1 linking coordinates xi 5 2 i 1 7 eq 8 and 2 linking coordinates xi 7 25 i 8 11 eq 9 according to the optimal operation rules shown in fig 7 b point a 2 35 m fsp water level and 3 m water head requires 4 duty pumps point b 2 8 m fsp water level and 3 m water head requires 8 duty pumps and point c 2 8 m fsp water level and 0 5 m water head requires 6 duty pumps fig 7 b further demonstrates that the number of duty pumps can be determined collaboratively by fsp water level and water head it is noted that the optimal operation rules require fewer duty pumps than current operation rules under the same fsp water level when the fsp water level exceeds 2 6 m for instance the optimal operation rules associated with point c require only 6 pumps but current operation rules require 10 pumps when the fsp water level is less than 2 6 m the optimal operation rules require more duty pumps than current operation rules at the same fsp water level the reason is that for lower fsp water levels less than2 6 m it is advised to reserve more flood storage capacity by discharging water from the fsp at the early stage such that the possible serious fluctuation of the fsp water level can be reduced in future pump operation such advantages can be observed from fig 5 which shows the hydrographs of the optimal and current operation rules respectively for flood risk mitigation decisions often have to be made based on complex information we have noticed that researchers have endeavored to develop mathematical decision making models in consideration of flood risks the optimal pump operation rules proposed in this study provide more flexibility stability and reliability in pump operation than current operation rules by collaboratively incorporating the water head into pump operation this study further evaluates the performance of the proposed methodology based on one training case and four test cases table 4 presents the individual performance of the optimal operation rules and current operation rules for these five events respectively the results demonstrate that the optimal operation rules make significant improvement improvements rates 19 8 72 4 for obj1 1 0 6 3 for obj2 and 53 9 86 4 for obj3 taking current operation rules as the benchmark we noticed that the total number of pump switches along the operation sequence differed event by event because storm durations were different from each other therefore obj3 is defined as the total pump switches divided by the total time steps pumps time step this is the reason why a decimal point may occur in the optimal results of obj3 when applying the obj3 results to actual operation the number of activated pumps during control horizon could simply be identified based on the corresponding fsp water level and water head according to the optimal operation rules of fig 7 b examples are shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 shows the comparative results of the optimal operation rules and current operation rules for the 612 storm event a training case respectively we notice from fig 8 a that the number of duty pumps derived from the optimal operation rules generally increases over time in the rising stage of the fsp water level then keeps nearly flat in the peak stage and decreases over time in the descending stage nevertheless current operation rules make frequent jumps drops on the number of duty pumps throughout the whole operational sequence fig 8 b reveals that the curve of the fsp water level associated with the optimal operation rules is much more stable and smoother than that of current operation rules this also indicates that the optimal operation rules can avoid switching pumps on and off frequently these results also disclose the advantages of the optimal operation rules fig 9 shows the comparative results of the optimal operation rules and current operation rules for the event of typhoon kong rey a test case respectively fig 9 a reveals that the number of duty pumps suggested by the optimal operation rules fluctuates at each time step less than that for current operation rules especially during the 21th and the 60th time steps the peak stage of the fsp water level besides the maximum numbers of duty pumps are 7 and 10 for the optimal operation rules and current operation rules respectively fig 9 b reveals that the fsp water level of the optimal operation rules is more stable and smoother than that of the current rules this again demonstrates that the optimal operation rules can avoid frequent switch on off of pumps the results also give the evidence on the advantages of the optimal operation rules 5 conclusion intelligent management of urban drainage systems is an efficient way to take full advantage on the capacity of a drainage system to reduce flood risks this study proposes an ai based design of urban stormwater detention facilities accounting for carryover storage to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the drainage infrastructure the proposed model transforms pump operation into three main objectives for increasing the efficiency of pump operation and reducing flood risks with a close assessment on the collaborative impacts of fsp water level and water head on pump operation the results of four test cases demonstrate the superiority of the optimal operation rules to current operation rules in the perspectives of all the three objectives with improvement rates reaching 43 obj1 3 obj2 and 71 obj3 respectively the optimal operation rules could diminish flood risk decrease the total number of duty pumps significantly and avoid switching on and off pumps frequently which largely reduce energy consumption as well as wear and tear of pumping facilities moreover the obtained optimal results favorably fulfill the expectation of experienced operators in other words the optimal operation rules are reliable and applicable and they can satisfactorily benefit and assist operators in practice furthermore the urban drainage system is a complex task and requires a number of mutually interdependent choices therefore the formulation of an optimization model is a crux choice from the beginning which would involve trade offs between the number of optimization variables and the degree of details lying in the internal systems lund et al 2018 the multi objective optimization approach proposed in this study demonstrates to well fit these key considerations within the wider urban drainage control literature we conclude that the optimal operation rules proposed by our methodology could mitigate the fluctuation of the fsp water level and minimize the total number of duty pumps during the whole operation period so as to reduce the flood risk in taipei city consequently the socio economic welfare of the society can be maximized future study can incorporate predictions of the future system state and climatic forecasts to enhance the multi objective pump operation several steps ahead while reducing the uncertainty of the drainage system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6402,rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas easily triggers flashy floods urban drainage systems conveying stormwater out of cities are key infrastructure elements for flood mitigation this study develops an intelligent urban flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage through optimizing the multi objective operation rules of pumping stations for effectual flood management in taipei city the yu cheng pumping station constitutes the study case and a large number of datasets collected from 17 typhoon storm events are adopted for model construction and validation three objective functions are designed to minimize 1 the sum of water level fluctuations in the flood storage pond fsp 2 the sum of peak fsp water levels and 3 the mean absolute difference of pump switches between two consecutive times along operation sequence the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is applied to searching the pareto optimal solutions that optimize the trade off between the objectives we next formulate the optimal operation rules through a two tier sorting process based on a compromised pareto optimal solution the comparison of the simulated results obtained from both the optimal operation rules and current operation rules indicate that the optimal operation rules outperform current operation rules for all three objectives with improvement rates reaching 43 obj1 3 obj2 and 71 obj3 respectively we demonstrate that the derived intelligent urban flood drainage system can serve as reliable and efficient operational strategies for urban flood management and flood risk mitigation keywords real time urban flood control flood risk mitigation pump operation rules multi objective optimization non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii 1 introduction the fast growing urban population in the world is an inevitable fact the rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas causes less water infiltration but flashy floods which invariably increases flood risks large scale floods are ravaging the globe and often leave fatal consequences in their wake global attention nowadays has been intensively drawn to flood prevention for the protection of life and property cohesive development and adaptation of new knowledge should be made not only to reduce flood risks but to increase the flood preparedness of residents and professionals becker et al 2014 chang et al 2014 girons lopez et al 2017 hsu et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2014 methodologies for the design of a sewer system control hierarchy using temporal decomposition were explored mollerup et al 2016 developing the optimal management of weirs pumping stations reservoirs and inlets at floodwater retention areas can significantly control the consequences brought by floods implementing advanced technologies and operational strategies for the combined sewer systems would be an important means to address challenges encountered in urban drainage lund et al 2018 provided an overview of methods and tools for performing model predictive control mpc within the field of urban drainage and they pointed out the concept of smart cities might lead to new operational goals such that mpc could be useful to migrate urban drainage systems from passive traditional infrastructure systems to proactive adaptive systems based on a high level of intelligent measures intelligent urban flood control systems explored by artificial intelligence ai could promote the efficiency and reliability of drainage infrastructures chen et al 2017 liu and cheng 2014 mollerup et al 2016 it is desirable and beneficial to have a collaborative development and applications of new knowledge and advanced technologies to improve decision making increase community and flood resilience and reduce flood related damages this will increase the potential in finding solutions to coping with highly complex problems such as multiple objectives pump operation in response to the rapid rise of flood flow during extreme events the traditional urban flood control strategy is to build embankments along river banks to prevent cities from flooding besides pumping stations are set up around the drainage outlets behind embankments to pump flood water out of cities because gravity draining may fail during extreme events undoubtedly pumping stations play a decisive role in urban flood control systems pumping stations unable to perform drainage functions properly would bring flood disasters which usually cause property losses and residents resentment accordingly there is an urgent need for the optimal utilization of available means to flood prevention nevertheless current pump operation guidelines were set up a long time ago and no pump operation rule was established particularly to cope with urbanization and climate change such phenomena occur in many developed cities in asia for instance hiramitsu and abe 2001 stated that no well defined concept of pump operation control was built in japan several approaches were explored to improve such conditions chiang et al 2011 proposed rule based fuzzy neural networks to on line predict the number of open and closed pumps of a pumping station in taipei city up to a lead time of 20 min yazdi and kim 2015 developed a real time optimization approach to searching the optimal policies for collaborative operation of drainage facilities in a portion of an urban drainage system in seoul the operation and maintenance cost of a pump station depends on a number of factors including climatic conditions hydrological conditions the type and age of pumps quality of operation and operator experience makaremi et al 2017 conventional pump operation guidelines are often vague and difficult to follow and therefore skilled and experienced operators are required to overcome such disadvantages there is an imperative need to create new multi objective operation rules for governing real time pump operation based on careful consideration of current hydrological conditions and various pump operation objectives through systematical analyses and optimization mechanisms to protect cities from the ravages of floods countermeasures to flooding should make a close collaboration with sewerage systems and river management the optimal control of urban drainage networks would aim at tackling the problem and generating intelligent control strategies ahead of flood occurrence based on the monitoring data transmitted from telemetry systems for minimizing flooding and sewer overflows this becomes a great challenge on account of the high complexity and uncertainty of the flood control system as well as the societal pressure on the efficient generation of solutions in this study we implement a state of the art technology to propose efficient multi objective pump operation rules for real time urban flood control management previous studies facilitated ai techniques such as genetic algorithms gas artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy inference to construct humanlike operation strategies regarding urban drainage systems chang et al 2008 yazdi and kim 2015 optimal pumping control cembrano 2004 zhuan and xia 2013 urban flood forecast chiang et al 2010 hsu et al 2013 noymanee et al 2017 and flood deference tamotoet et al 2008 wang et al 2013 for securing cities of interest nevertheless there were few studies addressing the development of the optimal pump operation rules in urban drainage systems using multi objective optimization methods yazdi et al 2016 among them a global optimal control system was implemented in a sewer network of quebec to real time manage flows and water levels for reducing the frequency and volumes of combined sewer overflows discharged into rivers pleau et al 2005 fiorelli et al 2013 proposed a control approach for a combined sewer network in luxembourg which considered three optimization goals for sewer systems and relied on a simple hydraulic model of the sewer system plenty of real world optimization problems are non linear in nature and have multiple conflicting objectives subject to various constraints deb 2005 conventionally such problems could be solved by being artificially converted into a single objective problem with development in advanced technologies multi objective optimization can be achieved nowadays which has a tremendous practical importance yet difficulties arise because such problems introduce a set of trade off optimal solutions i e pareto optimal solutions instead of a single optimum solution it then becomes critical to find as many of pareto optimal solutions as possible because any two optimal solutions form a trade off between the objectives such that users will be in a better position to make an adequate choice from compromised trade off solutions theevolutionary algorithm ea inspired bybiological evolution is a generic population basedmetaheuristicoptimizationalgorithm the ea can identify a diverse set of pareto optimal solutions to provides a spread of solutions that well converge to the non dominated set for the problem investigated coello et al 2006 goldberg and kuo 1987 the compromised solutions produced from eas usually perform better than traditional optimization solutions and their tradeoffs are very useful when making a sound decision from alternative options the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 belongs to contemporary multi objective eas the nsga ii contains few tuning parameters but exhibits high performance which makes itself very applicable to various kinds of optimization problems nicklow et al 2010 there is noticeably increasing interest in the development and applicability of biologically based eas for solving multi objective optimization problems in diversified water resources management issues such as reservoir management chang and chang 2009 davidsen et al 2015 ehteram et al 2017 lerma et al 2015 srinivasan and kumar 2018 tsai et al 2015 2016 water utilization davijani et al 2016 li et al 2018 matrosov et al 2015 ormsbee and lansey 2015 zheng et al 2015 urban drainage system barreto et al 2009 li et al 2015 rathnayake 2016 yazdi et al 2016 energy management and conversion feng et al 2018 karami et al 2018 peralta et al 2014 yang et al 2015 sustainable groundwater modeling sadeghi tabas et al 2017 sreekanth et al 2016 yeh 2015 and flood forecasting chang et al 2016 taormina et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 these studies showed that eas were flexible and powerful tools in solving an array of complex water resources problems although the optimal control in urban drainage networks has recently caught the attention of numerous policy making and regulatory agencies it has been rarely addressed regarding the integrated engineering system for its planning regulation and management in an interdisciplinary way this work specifically fills this gap by addressing the integrated multi site flood control system in particular this study intends to develop a methodology that determines the optimal multi objective pump operation rules using eas so that the pump operation system can be more intelligent in optimizing its efficiency effectiveness and flexibility for flood control management the requirements and basic components of the optimal pump operation rules accounting for carryover storage are presented and discussed the yu cheng pumping station and its drainage area in taipei taiwan forms the study case the applicability and reliability of the proposed methodology is examined in light of the limitations on the existing pump operation and operator acceptance 2 study area and datasets taiwan is located in the subtropical jet stream monsoon zone of the north pacific ocean taipei city is the political economic and cultural center of taiwan and the taipei metropolitan area has a population over 7 million taipei city is surrounded by three confluent rivers flowing to the ocean through a narrow estuary it is difficult for the city to effectively discharge massive flood water such that flood hazards may take place easily during typhoon storm periods consequently high levees were built along the river for preventing the city from flooding typhoons are usually coupled with intensive rainfalls and thus urban flooding could occur within a few hours in taipei city because of high levees floodwater inside the levee system has become the main threat to the city nowadays therefore pumping stations are facilitated to manage internal storm water for flood mitigation the yu cheng catchment located in southeastern taipei is the study area fig 1 a this catchment occupying an area of about 1627 ha constitutes the biggest drainage system in taipei city the yu cheng pumping station with two operational sites is the largest pumping station in the city the original pumping capacity is 184 1 cms which can deal with rainfall intensity up to 42 5 mm hr a near by station expansion with a pumping capacity of 50 0 cms was built later on to join pump operation for coping with rainfall intensity of 56 mm hr consequently the total pumping capacity reaches 234 1 cms the joint operation of the two connected sites did achieve expected performance during typhoon storm events however due to climate change in recent years it is imperative to make some adjustments on pump operation based on the accumulated experience in managing water levels to ensure the safety of residents in the future the station is equipped with a total of 11 pumps site 1 installs 7 pumps 1 7 with an overall pumping capacity reaching 184 1 cms 26 3 cms pump while site 2 installs 4 pumps 8 11 with an overall pumping capacity reaching 50 0 cms 12 5 cms pump fig 1 b shows the hydrological hydraulic connections between site 1 and site 2 where sites 1 and 2 are connected by a water diversion box culvert of size 5 0 m 3 2 m and a back up box culvert of size 4 1 m 3 5 m it is noted that pumps 26 3 cms pump in site 1 have the same performance curve which means all pumps have equal pumping capacity similarly for discharge rate under the same water level and water head pumps 12 5 cms pump in site 2 also have the same performance curve however the performance curves of site 1 and site 2 are different pump operation highly depends on the water level of the flood storage pond fsp i e carryover storage for site 1 pumps are activated with a 3 minute warm up if the fsp water level reaches the warning level 1 8 m then inner water will be pumped out to the surrounding river i e the keelung river of the station as soon as the fsp water level reaches the start level 2 2 m similar actions will be taken for site 2 whose warning and start levels are 2 4 m and 2 6 m respectively pump operation begins with site 1 and site 2 will join the operation as soon as all the 7 pumps in site 1 are activated in this study the investigative data were collected from 17 typhoon storm events at a temporal resolution of 10 min during 2004 and 2014 including fsp water levels river water levels historical pumping records and pump performance curves a total of 2 789 datasets are adopted to construct the optimal pump operation model in which the numbers of datasets allocated into training and testing phases are 2 473 13 storm events and 316 4 storm events respectively table 1 3 methodology the optimization model of an urban drainage system involves a set of equations that give an evaluation of the system s variables and their responses to control actions at the gates the main objective of this study is to develop an intelligent flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage that optimizes multi objective pump operation rules for minimizing the urban flood risk for the largest pumping station in taipei city during storm events we propose a two tier sorting process based on pareto optimal solutions of the nsga ii to formulate the optimal multi objective pump operation rules the proposed methodology first adopts 13 storm events to construct the optimal pump operation rules and then uses 4 storm events to evaluate the reliability and practicability of the constructed rules through an operational comparison between the optimal operation rules and the current ones the research framework is presented in fig 2 and a detailed description of the methodology is introduced as follows 3 1 nsga ii the goal of an optimization model is to recognize the best control trajectory for each actuator during the upcoming control horizon the best set of control trajectories is the one that optimizes the objectives under the given constraints lund et al 2018 in this study the optimal pump operation is conducted by the nsga ii for mitigating unban flood risk as well as reducing energy consumption the nsga ii has the merit of coping better with computational complexity non elitism approach and the need for specifying a sharing parameter it can obtain a much better spread of pareto optimal solutions and better convergence compared to other multi objective optimization algorithms e g pareto archived evolution strategy and strength pareto ea two other elitist multi objective eas deb 2002 the implementation procedure of the nsga ii is briefly summarized as follows step 1 randomly initialize a population p 0 of size n apply the fast non dominated sorting and compute the crowding distances of the population step 2 implement reproduction crossover and mutation to generate an offspring population q t step 3 evaluate the fitness values calculate the fast non dominated sorting and crowding distances of p t and q t to generate an offspring population p t 1 of size n step 4 repeat steps 3 and 4 until reaching the stop criterion p0 denotes the n sets of operation rules that are randomly generated in this study each set of operation rules contains 22 points 11 fsp water levels x axis and 11 water heads y axis which support the nsga ii to conduct the optimal search model optimization involves both decision variables and constraints we adapt a simple constraint handling strategy to the nsga ii the strategy assigns each infeasible solution with an overall constraint violation value while assigns a feasible solution with a zero value of constraint violation each feasible solution receives a better non domination rank than all infeasible solutions correspondingly an infeasible solution would receive a better non domination rank if it has a smaller overall constraint violation value than the others the parameter setting of the nsga ii model is listed in table 2 multi objective optimization commonly has two goals converging to the pareto front and maintaining the diversity of the pareto optimal solutions the diversity metric δ is defined as eq 1 1 δ d f d 1 i 1 n 1 d i d d f d l n 1 d where di is the euclidean distance between consecutive solutions in the pareto optimal set of solutions df and dl are the distances between the extreme solutions and the boundary solutions respectively d f d l 0 in this case and d is the average distance of all distances di 3 2 objectives the purpose of applying the optimal control is to compute feasible strategies for the actuators in the network which produces the best admissible states of the network the goals of urban drainage systems are generally concerned with flood prevention and minimization of the combined sewer overflow to the environment in this study case flood prevention gains the top priority flood damages can be greatly mitigated through careful scheduling of pump operation which is highly sensitive to the fsp water level according to pump performance curves the water head i e the water level difference between the fsp and the river significantly influences pumping capacity the larger the water head is the lesser the water a pump discharges this study aims at developing the optimal multi objective pump operation rules using the nsga ii with a close assessment on the collaborative impacts of fsp water level and water head on pump operation we consider three objectives which are 1 obj1 that minimizes the sum of fsp water level fluctuation to make smooth pump operation 2 obj2 that minimizes the sum of peak fsp water levels to reduce urban flood hazards and 3 obj3 that minimizes the accumulated absolute difference of pump switches between two consecutive times along the operation sequence to avoid frequent switch on off of a pump within a short time obj1 minimizes the sum of fsp water level fluctuations for typhoon events as shown in eq 2 2 min o b j 1 m k 1 k t 2 t wl k t wl k t 1 where wl k t is the fsp water level k is the number of training events 13 in this study case k is the training event t is the number of time steps in the k th event and t is the time step in the k th event the time interval is 10 min in our case one way to reduce the risk of urban flood hazard is to minimize the peak fsp water level which can be achieved through rapidly starting up pumps to discharge the inner storm water into the surrounding river therefore obj2 minimizes the sum of the peak fsp water levels for typhoon events which is formulated in eq 3 3 min o b j 2 m k 1 k m a x wl k where m a x wl k is the peak of the fsp water level in the k th event pump operation should avoid frequent switch on off of a pump within a short time otherwise it would increase energy consumption and damage the pump and therefore raise its maintenance cost we notice that considering the number of pump switches instead of real maintenance cost is a means to simplifying the problem for formulating it mathematically makaremi et al 2017 the third objective function proposed in this study aims at tackling this issue by minimizing the number of pump switches to provide operators with optimal scheduling programs the formulation of the third objective function obj3 is to minimize the mean absolute difference in the numbers of duty pumps between t and t 1 along operation sequences as shown in eq 4 4 m i n o b j 3 p u m p s t i m e s t e p k 1 k t 1 t np k t np k t 1 k 1 k ts k where np k t is the number of duty pumps in the k th event at time step t and ts k is the total number of time steps in the k th event 3 3 constraints constraint setting usually confines the search space and avoids the occurrence of abnormal conditions for instance when the fsp water level is higher than the maximum fsp water level or the number of duty pumps exceeds the maximum number of available pumps in this study constraints involve the number of pumps fsp water level and water head the number of duty pumps should fall between 0 and the number of available pumps eq 5 5 0 n p k t np max where np k t is the number of duty pumps in the k th event at time step t and np max is the maximum number of available pumps due to urbanization and climate change flash floods usually cause a very quick increase in the fsp water level in practice operators may activate pumps to discharge water even though the fsp water level is lower than the start level 2 2 m of current operation rules therefore the start level is re designed as 1 8 m for adapting to practical operation when searching for the optimal operation rules in this study these constraints are formulated as follows 6 1 8 m wl p 2 7 m p 1 7 s i t e 1 7 2 7 m wl p 5 0 m p 8 11 s i t e 2 where wl p is the fsp water level for the pth pump 8 0 wh p 5 20 m p 1 7 s i t e 1 9 0 wh p 7 25 m p 8 11 s i t e 2 where wh p is the water head the water level difference between the fsp and the river for the pth pump 10 wl k t 1 wl k t w l inflow k t w l outflow k t where k is the training event t is the time step in the k th event wl inflow k t and wl outflow k t are the fsp water levels converted from inflow and outflow in the kth event at time step t respectively consequently the performance of the obtained optimal pump operation rules is compared with that of current pump operation rules to evaluate the reliability and practicability of the proposed model the nsga ii algorithm implemented in this study was re written using microsoft visual studio c programming language based on the nsga ii algorithm written in c language released in deb 2002 4 results and discussion this study proposes an optimization framework determining a set of pump operating rules that are optimal with respect to multiple objectives for an integrated urban drainage river system accounting for carryover storage across a variety of typhoon storm events 4 1 optimization of multi objective pump operation for a nontrivial multi objective optimization problem objective functions may conflict with each other while there are a set of pareto compromised solutions that are considered equally good our mission is to find a set of pareto optimal solutions that satisfy the diverse preferences of decision makers the search for the pareto front of the optimal operation rules subject to objectives and constraints is conducted by the nsga ii based on 2 473 datasets of 13 storm events fig 3 indicates that the nsga ii search procedure can well converge before 100 generations for all the three objectives i e the three objective functions converge into relatively small ranges after a certain number of search generations fig 4 presents the pareto front of 1 000 converged solutions in a three dimensional view corresponding to the three objectives fig 4 a shows that the solutions to obj1 fall within 137 m 145 m the solutions to obj2 fall within 37 6 m 38 4 m and the solutions to obj3 fall within 0 37 pumps time step 0 45 pumps time step fig 4 b d show the results of obj1 vs obj2 obj1 vs obj3 and obj2 vs obj3 respectively in sum obj2 has negative correlations with obj1 and obj3 fig 4 b and d while obj1 and obj3 are positively correlated fig 4 c it appears that there exist several short horizontal lines that aggregate many solutions in fig 4 b and d which suggest the sum of peak fsp water levels obj2 remains the same while the other two objectives would fluctuate widely it is noted that solutions i 5 and i 632 produce the highest values for obj2 but the lowest values for obj1 and obj3 while solutions i 209 and i 267 produce the lowest values for obj2 but the highest values for obj1 and obj3 fig 4 d 4 2 assessment of the optimal pump operation fig 5 illustrates the simulated results number of duty pumps and fsp water level along the time sequence of typhoon saola 2012 concerning four selected optimal solutions obtained from the nsga ii fig 5 a and b show that the number of duty pumps and the fsp water level associated with solutions i 5 and i 632 do not make much difference over time except for only a few time points time steps fig 5 c and d show similar results for solution i 5 and i 632 that is to say the number of duty pumps and the fsp water level associated with these two solutions are almost the same along the time sequence except for only a few time points after the 121th time step 4 3 features of the optimal pump operation the 1000 optimal solutions displayed in fig 4 c can be clearly distinguished into three groups i e groups 1 3 we further explore the specific features of groups 1 3 using 3d representation as shown in fig 6 a c respectively fig 6 a displays the optimal solutions representative of larger peak fsp water levels obj2 red or yellow but smaller fsp water level fluctuations obj1 and smaller differences in the number of duty pumps obj3 in contrast fig 6 c displays the optimal solutions representative of smaller peak fsp water levels obj2 from light blue to blue but larger fsp water level fluctuations obj1 and larger differences in the number of duty pumps obj3 alternatively fig 6 b displays the optimal solutions representative of medium sized peak fsp water levels obj2 green or light blue 4 4 comparison between the optimal operation rules and current operation rules table 3 shows the comparison of the pump operational results between the optimal rules obtained from the nsga ii and the current rules for obj1 the minimal value of the optimal operation rules occurs at 137 22 m which is approximately half of the value 247 98 m of current operation rules it means current operation rules would produce more fluctuations in the fsp water levels and therefore cause operators to switch on off pumps more frequently which suggests the optimal operation rules are much more effective than current operation rules for obj2 the minimal value 37 72 m of the optimal operation rules is less than that 39 01 m of the current operation values which suggests the optimal operation rules produce a better result effectively decrease the peak fsp water level as well as reduce the flood risk for obj3 the minimal value 0 38 pumps time step of the optimal operation rules is only about 1 4 of the value 1 46 pumps time step of current operation rules which shows the efficiency switch on off pumps less frequently of the optimal operation rules in brief the optimal operation rules deliver superior results than current operation rules in the perspectives of all the three objectives table 3 also shows the objective values of a compromised solution the black dot shown in fig 4 randomly selected from the 1000 pareto optimal solutions it appears that the compromised solution performs much better than the current pump operation rules in terms of all three objective functions obj1 obj3 which evidently explains the true meaning benefit effectiveness of the pareto front in a trade off sense as a result the optimal operation rules obtained from the nsga ii not only could significantly decrease the frequency of switching on off pumps but could effectively mitigate the fluctuations of the fsp water level besides the optimal operation rules could effectively reduce the peak fsp water levels during typhoon events and therefore significantly decrease the risk of overflow from the fsp into the city the pareto optimal solutions suggest practical management options for decision makers and operators to manage the pump operational system when comparing the existing and alternative pump operational schemes the nsga ii results alternative schemes would significantly improve the performance of the three objective functions obj1 obj3 for the pump operational system where the number of duty pumps could be reduced and the peak fsp water level could be decreased during flood events we conclude that the optimal pump operation rules obtained from the nsga ii could significantly mitigate the flood risk of taipei city 4 5 optimal operation rules and performance evaluation fig 7 presents the optimal pump operation rules associated with the selected compromised solution the black dot shown in fig 4 and the current pump operation rules it is noted that the yu cheng pumping station has eleven pumps seven in site 1 and four in site 2 which are jointly operated site 1 gains higher priority in operation than site 2 to better depict the joint operation each subfigure of fig 7 is divided into two zones the blue zone represents the operation of site 1 only and the brown zone represents the joint operation of site 1 and site 2 the number shown in each sub zone stripe denotes the number of duty pumps between two operation rules i e the laddered fsp water level numbers in green denote duty pumps of site 1 while numbers in red denote duty pumps of site 2 fig 7 a reveals that the activation of pumping activity under current operation rules depends solely on the fsp water level which inevitably causes operators to frequently switch on off pumps in response to the dynamic fluctuations of the fsp water level especially when flash floods occur such a phenomenon can be observed in figs 8 and 9 operation hydrographs of a training case and a test case respectively in contrast the optimal operation rules configured by the nsga ii consider the fsp water level and the water head simultaneously fig 7 b shows the optimal operation rules of the selected compromised solution the pump operation in site 1 follows eqs 6 and 8 i e the fsp water level 1 8 m 2 7 m and the water head 0 m 5 2 m while the pump operation in site 2 follows eqs 7 and 9 i e the fsp water level 2 7 m 5 0 m and the water head 0 m 7 25 m the optimal operation rules of each compromised solution in the pareto front could be derived from a two tier sorting process introduced as follows the number of duty pumps associated with fsp water level and water head can be drawn by sorting the 22 chromosomes table 2 the two tier sorting process begins with the sorting of the 22 chromosomes in an increasing order along the y axis water head followed by the sorting along the x axis fsp water level the sorted pairs are denoted as x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x11 y11 where xi xi 1 i 1 11 and yj yj 1 j 1 11 the sorted pairs can be used to construct the optimal operation rules by linking these pairs in the following way 1 linking coordinates xi 5 2 i 1 7 eq 8 and 2 linking coordinates xi 7 25 i 8 11 eq 9 according to the optimal operation rules shown in fig 7 b point a 2 35 m fsp water level and 3 m water head requires 4 duty pumps point b 2 8 m fsp water level and 3 m water head requires 8 duty pumps and point c 2 8 m fsp water level and 0 5 m water head requires 6 duty pumps fig 7 b further demonstrates that the number of duty pumps can be determined collaboratively by fsp water level and water head it is noted that the optimal operation rules require fewer duty pumps than current operation rules under the same fsp water level when the fsp water level exceeds 2 6 m for instance the optimal operation rules associated with point c require only 6 pumps but current operation rules require 10 pumps when the fsp water level is less than 2 6 m the optimal operation rules require more duty pumps than current operation rules at the same fsp water level the reason is that for lower fsp water levels less than2 6 m it is advised to reserve more flood storage capacity by discharging water from the fsp at the early stage such that the possible serious fluctuation of the fsp water level can be reduced in future pump operation such advantages can be observed from fig 5 which shows the hydrographs of the optimal and current operation rules respectively for flood risk mitigation decisions often have to be made based on complex information we have noticed that researchers have endeavored to develop mathematical decision making models in consideration of flood risks the optimal pump operation rules proposed in this study provide more flexibility stability and reliability in pump operation than current operation rules by collaboratively incorporating the water head into pump operation this study further evaluates the performance of the proposed methodology based on one training case and four test cases table 4 presents the individual performance of the optimal operation rules and current operation rules for these five events respectively the results demonstrate that the optimal operation rules make significant improvement improvements rates 19 8 72 4 for obj1 1 0 6 3 for obj2 and 53 9 86 4 for obj3 taking current operation rules as the benchmark we noticed that the total number of pump switches along the operation sequence differed event by event because storm durations were different from each other therefore obj3 is defined as the total pump switches divided by the total time steps pumps time step this is the reason why a decimal point may occur in the optimal results of obj3 when applying the obj3 results to actual operation the number of activated pumps during control horizon could simply be identified based on the corresponding fsp water level and water head according to the optimal operation rules of fig 7 b examples are shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 shows the comparative results of the optimal operation rules and current operation rules for the 612 storm event a training case respectively we notice from fig 8 a that the number of duty pumps derived from the optimal operation rules generally increases over time in the rising stage of the fsp water level then keeps nearly flat in the peak stage and decreases over time in the descending stage nevertheless current operation rules make frequent jumps drops on the number of duty pumps throughout the whole operational sequence fig 8 b reveals that the curve of the fsp water level associated with the optimal operation rules is much more stable and smoother than that of current operation rules this also indicates that the optimal operation rules can avoid switching pumps on and off frequently these results also disclose the advantages of the optimal operation rules fig 9 shows the comparative results of the optimal operation rules and current operation rules for the event of typhoon kong rey a test case respectively fig 9 a reveals that the number of duty pumps suggested by the optimal operation rules fluctuates at each time step less than that for current operation rules especially during the 21th and the 60th time steps the peak stage of the fsp water level besides the maximum numbers of duty pumps are 7 and 10 for the optimal operation rules and current operation rules respectively fig 9 b reveals that the fsp water level of the optimal operation rules is more stable and smoother than that of the current rules this again demonstrates that the optimal operation rules can avoid frequent switch on off of pumps the results also give the evidence on the advantages of the optimal operation rules 5 conclusion intelligent management of urban drainage systems is an efficient way to take full advantage on the capacity of a drainage system to reduce flood risks this study proposes an ai based design of urban stormwater detention facilities accounting for carryover storage to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the drainage infrastructure the proposed model transforms pump operation into three main objectives for increasing the efficiency of pump operation and reducing flood risks with a close assessment on the collaborative impacts of fsp water level and water head on pump operation the results of four test cases demonstrate the superiority of the optimal operation rules to current operation rules in the perspectives of all the three objectives with improvement rates reaching 43 obj1 3 obj2 and 71 obj3 respectively the optimal operation rules could diminish flood risk decrease the total number of duty pumps significantly and avoid switching on and off pumps frequently which largely reduce energy consumption as well as wear and tear of pumping facilities moreover the obtained optimal results favorably fulfill the expectation of experienced operators in other words the optimal operation rules are reliable and applicable and they can satisfactorily benefit and assist operators in practice furthermore the urban drainage system is a complex task and requires a number of mutually interdependent choices therefore the formulation of an optimization model is a crux choice from the beginning which would involve trade offs between the number of optimization variables and the degree of details lying in the internal systems lund et al 2018 the multi objective optimization approach proposed in this study demonstrates to well fit these key considerations within the wider urban drainage control literature we conclude that the optimal operation rules proposed by our methodology could mitigate the fluctuation of the fsp water level and minimize the total number of duty pumps during the whole operation period so as to reduce the flood risk in taipei city consequently the socio economic welfare of the society can be maximized future study can incorporate predictions of the future system state and climatic forecasts to enhance the multi objective pump operation several steps ahead while reducing the uncertainty of the drainage system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6403,the green ampt ga model which assumes a rectangular saturated piston flow and homogeneous isotropic soil with uniform initial water content is one of the most widely used models for describing infiltration processes however these assumptions severely limit the applications of the model thus a modified ga model has long been a topic of interest this study mainly investigates the effects of the broken line wetting profile and dynamic capillary pressure on the ga model of a horizontal soil column the aim is to provide a reasonable correction term for the hydraulic conductivity and suction head the correction term is considered to be 0 4 when the dynamic capillary pressure cga model is neglected when the dynamic capillary pressure is taken into account the correction term is a special function fga model moreover the results of the cga model fga model richards equation and mao model are compared with respect to the measured data for sandy loam silt loam and silty clay loam richards equation cannot accurately describe the infiltration of water into silt loam and part of the reason is the high infiltration velocity although the mao model can perfectly simulate the infiltration process in a short time approximately 50 min in this study its results gradually deviate from the actual situation after 50 min the cga model can predict the entire infiltration processes relatively accurately except in the dry sand with zero water content however as in the traditional ga model small errors can still occur during the early infiltration stage the fga model is considered to be the most suitable approach for describing infiltration processes in this paper the characteristics of these models are explained and the parameters of the fga model are discussed in detail keywords infiltration green ampt model richards equation correction term dynamic capillary pressure 1 introduction the green ampt ga model which is a simple physics based method to evaluate soil water infiltration processes is widely used in the runoff soil erosion irrigation drainage and watershed management brakensiek and onstad 1977 loáiciga and huang 2007 this model was originally applied to uniform initially dry and coarse textured soils green and ampt 1911 hillel and gardner 1970 mao et al 2016 later the model was extended to rainfall runoff simulations and layered soils with nonuniform initial water content bouwer 1969 chen and young 2006 chu 1978 chu and mariño 2005 corradini et al 2000 craig et al 2010 deng and zhu 2016 liu et al 2008 ma et al 2010 mein and larson 1973 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 rao et al 2006 in the recent study of hsu and hilpert 2011 the modified ga model hsu model was presented to include the dynamic capillary pressure which depends on the wetting front velocity although it can describe infiltration processes more accurately the expression of the ordinary differential equation ode makes its application difficult hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 therefore a simple and accurate model which considers the dynamic capillary pressure is still necessary the broken line wetting profile in a horizontal soil column and a modified ga model mao model were investigated and presented by mao et al 2016 the method includes an approximated dynamic capillary pressure however it is only proved to be accurate for a short infiltration time mao et al 2016 and its parameters have no clear physical significance the ga model contains two key parameters the suction head and hydraulic conductivity their selection influences the calculation results deng and zhu 2016 sorensen et al 2014 the suction head can be estimated with a variety of algorithms bouwer 1966 mein and larson 1973 neuman 1976 white and sully 1987 nevertheless its value is often underestimated hsu et al 2017 the hydraulic conductivity is usually considered to be a constant during the entire infiltration process the traditional ga model green and ampt 1911 adopts a saturated hydraulic conductivity to simulate infiltration processes bouwer 1966 suggested that the hydraulic conductivity should be half the saturated hydraulic conductivity moreover corradini et al 1997 reported that the hydraulic conductivity changes during the infiltration process and proposed that the average hydraulic conductivity should be adopted in the ga model regrettably the effects of the dynamic capillary pressure and broken line wetting profile on these two parameters are not covered in these algorithms therefore a correction term for these two parameters must be investigated for a horizontal soil column nutrients such as nitrate nitrogen from wetland lost to groundwater vertical infiltration are negligible reilly et al 1999 and therefore horizontal movement may be important for the migration of nutrients in wetland ecosystems bai et al 2012 at this time water horizontal movement must be accurately predicted strange et al 2008 besides water storage pit irrigation method is a new method used suitably in orchard irrigation in arid or semi arid area lateral horizontal infiltration of water storage pits needs to be focused solutions of the absorption equation horizontal infiltration equation have the theoretical importance that they yield the limiting small time behaviour of transient infiltration processes even when gravity cannot be neglected mohamed 2018 the study of horizontal infiltration also has other important implications and it is useful in the fields of hydrology soil erosion and water resources mao et al 2016 in this paper richards equation richards 1931 and the mao model mao et al 2016 are introduced and compared with the proposed modified ga model richards equation is regarded as an accurate algorithm and usually used as the reference model for the comparison of different models hsu et al 2002 moeck et al 2016 the mao model was presented in a recent study and the effects of the dynamic capillary pressure and broken line wetting profile are roughly considered in this study finally it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the proposed model the predictions of the ga model for infiltration processes become increasingly accurate with the continuous improvement of the model however its expression also becomes more complex nevertheless simple expressions are sometimes sufficient in engineering applications although a small error occurs in this case approximate explicit expressions are of great significance ali et al 2013 barry et al 2005 parlange et al 2002 salvucci and entekhabi 1994 stone et al 1994 swamee et al 2012 therefore in this study effects of various factors the dynamic capillary pressure and broken line wetting profile are considered in the first model with complex expression the second considered model has a simple and relatively accurate explicit expression the simple cga model correction term of 0 4 and complex fga model correction term is a special function are presented and discussed next the cga model fga model mao model and richards equation are compared in terms of infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration finally the characteristics of these models are explained and the parameters of the fga model are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental methods and materials the experimental data is from mao et al 2016 and thus experimental procedure is consistent with this study the experimental soils originate from three different sites ansai as and yangling yl in shannxi province and beijing bj province china table 1 the homogeneous soil column has a length of 40 cm and diameter of 5 cm the bj as and yl soils have dry densities of 1 33 g cm3 1 23 g cm3 and 1 26 g cm3 respectively and the ponding depth is controlled with a mariotte bottle according to mao et al 2016 the soil water distribution can be divided into two straight lines line 1 and line 2 fig 1 line 1 has a relatively flat profile compared with that of line 2 constant slope the intersection of the two lines is called the critical water content θc which is always a constant table 2 its corresponding horizontal coordinate is the critical infiltration distance xcf or the critical horizontal distance 2 2 introduction and modification of models first the ga model mao model and richards equation are briefly introduced then the modified ga model is presented finally expressions for the error estimation are given 2 2 1 the green ampt model the traditional ga model obtained via darcy s law can be expressed as green and ampt 1911 1 di dt i k s h s m z z where i is the cumulative infiltration t is the infiltration time i is the infiltration rate ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity h is the ponding depth sm is the suction head of the wetting front and z is the infiltration distance in a vertical soil column hsu and hilpert 2011 proposed a functional form for a velocity dependent capillary pressure and incorporated it into the ga model the resulting ga model hsu model has the following ode 2 di dt i k z h s m γ d ρ g ϕ ε θ 0 α η i γ δ θ β z where k is the hydraulic conductivity γ the interfacial tension d is the grain size ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration ϕ ε θ 0 is the non dimensional function of porosity ε and θ 0 α and β are model parameters specific to the porous medium that quantify the capillary nonequilibrium η is the dynamic viscosity of water and δθ is the change in the water content for a horizontal soil column when the ponding depth is zero eq 2 can be simplified as 3 di dt i k s m γ d ρ g ϕ ε θ 0 α η i γ δ θ β x 4 δ θ θ c θ s 2 θ 0 where x is the infiltration distance in a horizontal soil column eq 3 can be simplified as 5 di dt i k f x s m x 6 f x s m 1 e x s m s m γ d ρ g ϕ ε θ 0 α η i γ δ θ β where f x and e x are the correction terms of the suction head the hydraulic conductivity k is smaller than the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks owing to the entrapped air and broken line wetting profile thus a correction term for the hydraulic conductivity is also required eq 5 can be expressed as 7 di dt i g x k s f x s m x where g x is the correction term of the hydraulic conductivity eq 7 can be also expressed via 8 di dt i y x k s s m x 9 y x g x f x where y x is the correction term of the hydraulic conductivity and suction head the water balance approach based on the principle of mass conservation is applied to calculate the cumulative infiltration 10 i x cf θ c θ s 2 θ 0 θ c θ 0 x x cf 2 where θc θ0 constant and x xcf constant therefore the infiltration rate i can be expressed as 11 i θ c θ s 2 θ 0 dx dt the solution of eq 8 cannot be obtained owing to the unknown function y x this function is closely related to the infiltration velocity however the variations in the infiltration velocity are often small except in certain special cases and for a fairly short time during the early infiltration stage pellichero et al 2012 therefore y x is first simplified in the form of a constant y to describe the infiltration processes by substituting eq 11 into eq 8 the horizontal distance can be expressed as 12 x 2 y k s s m δ θ t substituting eq 12 into eq 11 leads to the following expression of the infiltration rate 13 i 1 2 2 y k s δ θ s m t 1 2 philip 1969 obtained the equation of the vertical infiltration via a mathematical derivation 14 i 1 2 s t 1 2 a where s is the sorptivity and a is associated with the gravity and often equals ks for a horizontal soil column the infiltration rate can be expressed as 15 i 1 2 s t 1 2 eqs 15 and 13 are essentially equal they exhibit the following relation 16 s 2 2 y k s δ θ s m by substituting eq 16 into eq 12 the horizontal distance can be expressed as 17 x s δ θ t 1 2 eq 17 is solvable as long as parameters sm and y are known first we discuss the parameter sm the entire profile of the horizontal soil column cannot be saturated because of the effect of gravity a suction head is required to balance the gravity which is the reason for the occurrence of the broken line wetting profile line 1 slight slope represents the wetting front profile for the gravity balance whereas wetting front profile of line 2 steep slope is similar to that of the vertical infiltration fig 1 an average suction head can be used for line 1 18 s m 1 0 x cf h 1 x d x x cf where xcf is the intersection of the two lines with respect to the x coordinate and h 1 x is the suction head of each point on line 1 the relation between the water content and suction head can be described via van genuchten 1980 19 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 ah n m θ θ s h 0 h 0 where θr is the residual water content m n and a are empirical parameters m 1 1 n and h is the suction head because the considered initial water content is very low the residual water content is assumed equal to the initial water content to obtain eq 20 the water content θ is replaced considering a linear decrease with a slope k1 as the distance x increases θ k1x θs fig 1 by substituting eq 19 into eq 18 the average suction head of line 1 can be expressed via 20 s m 1 0 x cf k 1 x θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 m 1 1 n a d x x cf to simplify eq 20 variable y can be defined as 21 y k 1 x where k 1 is the slope of line 1 in fig 1 by substituting eq 21 into eq 20 the average suction head can be simplified as 22 s m 1 0 θ c θ s y θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 m 1 1 n d y a θ c θ s when the soil is saturated the slope and average suction head are zero the suction head of line 2 can be obtained via a variety of algorithms bouwer 1966 mein and larson 1973 neuman 1976 white and sully 1987 in this study the method of neuman 1976 is used 23 s m 2 h c h 0 k r d h 24 k r k h k s where hc is the suction head and corresponds to the critical water content θc kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity and h0 is the suction head and corresponds to the initial water content θ 0 in this study the initial water content θ 0 is approximatively equal to the residual water content θr hence according to eq 19 h0 is infinite this phenomenon cannot occur in nature further the soil that is dried in a laboratory environment does not have such a large suction head eq 23 does not converge when the upper limit of the integral approaches infinity therefore a specific value must be provided for the upper limit of the integral according to repeated attempts variations in h0 from 103 to 107 cm have weak effects on the suction head of line 2 consequently inspired by the method of mein and larson 1973 h 0 can be set to 105 cm which is a conservative and reasonable value for the description of the actual situation lu and likos 2004 lu and godt 2008 pham et al 2018 the suction head hc corresponding to the critical water content θc can be obtained via eq 19 thus the relative hydraulic conductivity kr is only required to solve the suction head of line 2 van genuchten et al 1991 proposed that kr can be expressed as 25 k r 1 ah mn 1 ah n m 2 1 ah n ml where the parameters a m n and l can be obtained via the retc code table 3 therefore the suction heads of line 1 and line 2 can be estimated with eqs 22 and 23 respectively the results are listed in table 4 according to table 4 the suction head of line 2 s m 2 is much lower than that of line 1 s m 1 hence the latter is used in this study the reason for the occurrence of line 1 can be the static balance of forces therefore the adoption of an average suction head is appropriate however line 2 experiences a dynamic process and its suction head cannot be derived via rigorous theoretical derivations no physically based model neuman 1976 the semi empirical methods are widely used including the method of neuman 1976 adopted in this study the result of the interaction between the hydraulic conductivity and suction head is the effective suction head i e the suction head of line 2 although the suction head at each point on line 2 is high the corresponding unsaturated hydraulic conductivity approximates zero owing to the low water content hence the suction head of line 2 eqs 23 and 24 has a weak effect on the infiltration this is the most fundamental reason for s m 2 s m 1 the only unknown parameter y can be obtained via the measured data table 5 according to table 5 the y values of the three soil types are very close and their average 0 4 is the most appropriate correction term for a horizontal soil column the model y is 0 4 is called the cga model in this study it has a simple form and can be easily applied in engineering applications however when the infiltration time t is 0 the infiltration rate i is still infinite which is unphysical pellichero et al 2012 inspired by the mentioned papers in the introduction we present a function y x to express the initial infiltration rate 26 y x α 1 x x 1 1 e β 1 x 1 2 where α 1 is the correction coefficient of smks when the dynamic capillary pressure has no effect on the infiltration and β 1 reflects the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the early infiltration stage by substituting eqs 26 and 11 into eq 8 eq 8 can be expressed as 27 dx dt α 1 s m k s δ θ x 1 1 e β 1 x 1 2 therefore the relation between the infiltration distance and infiltration time can be expressed via 28 t δ θ 2 α 1 β 1 s m k s ln e β 1 x 1 2 1 e β 1 1 the ga model y x is a special function is called the fga model in this study the parameters α 1 and β 1 for as bj and yl can be obtained with the measured data table 6 according to table 6 α 1 is always slightly higher than 0 4 β 1 will be analysed below in the following the mao model and richards equation will be compared with the cga model and fga model and therefore they will be briefly introduced here 2 2 2 the mao model mao et al 2016 proposed a function to describe accurately the infiltration processes in horizontal soil columns regrettably the parameters of the function have no clear physical significance and can only be obtained via fitting the relation between the horizontal distance infiltration rate and infiltration time can be expressed as 29 x a t b 1 e c t 30 i δ θ a b c e c t where a b and c are fitting parameters their values for the three soil types are listed in table 7 the mao model lacks a theoretical basis we will extend and explain it by combining it with the research results of this study regarding equation 8 we assume that y x can be expressed as 31 y x t a 1 x b 1 x e c 1 t where parameters a 1 b 1 and c 1 are related to the hydraulic conductivity and suction head by substituting eqs 11 and 31 into eq 8 the horizontal distance can be expressed as 32 x a 1 k s s m δ θ t b 1 k s s m c 1 δ θ 1 e c 1 t the expressions of eqs 29 and 32 are essentially equal they have the following relation 33 a a 1 k s s m δ θ 34 b b 1 k s s m c 1 δ θ 35 c c 1 evidently the mao model is a modification of the traditional ga model and includes the hydraulic conductivity and suction head however the correction term is different in this study parameters a 1 b 1 and c 1 can be obtained via eqs 33 34 and 35 respectively table 8 according to table 8 c1 is stable at approximately 0 15 a 1 and b 1 have a relation about the infiltration velocity which will be discussed later 2 2 3 richards equation richards equation which provides the change in the water content in a porous medium over time is simply a combination of the conservation of mass darcy buckingham unsaturated flux equation and the soil characteristic pressure saturation curve dicarlo 2005 regarding horizontal infiltration the water movement can be expressed as 36 θ h t t x k h h x the water inlet boundary condition adopts a constant suction head 37 h 0 t 0 the water outlet boundary condition adopts free drainage 38 h x 0 the initial suction head at different locations of the soil column is the same 39 h x 0 h 0 2 3 error estimation the root mean square error rmse relative error re and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used to evaluate the errors between the cga model fga model mao model richards equation and measured results

value of the ith sample ō is the mean of the measured values and n is the number of samples the infiltration capacity is often discussed in terms of infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration in this study rmse re and nse coefficient are used to evaluate the infiltration distances simulated via the fga model cga model mao model and richards equation moreover the infiltration rates and cumulative infiltrations of these four models are compared 3 results fig 2 and table 9 present a comparison of the horizontal distances simulated via fga model cga model mao model and richards equation the calculated results of the cga model fga model and mao model approximate the measured results for the three soil types according to the comparison of rmses res and nse coefficients the horizontal distances simulated via the fga model agree well with the measured results whereas the results of richards equation deviate most from the measured results particularly for as the relations between the infiltration rate and infiltration time of the fga model cga model mao model and richards equation are shown in fig 3 the results of the four models exhibit a slight difference at 50 min after that the infiltration rate of the mao model stabilises quickly with increasing infiltration time those of the other three models continue to decrease therefore the results of the mao model will differ significantly from those of the other three models for late times when the infiltration time approaches infinity the infiltration rates of the cga model fga model and richards equation equal zero eqs 15 27 and 36 respectively however that of the mao model approximates aδθ eq 30 evidently gravity has a weak impact on the infiltration rate in a horizontal soil column hence an infiltration rate of zero is reasonable when the infiltration time is infinite therefore the results of the mao model deviate from the actual situation for late times when the infiltration time is zero the infiltration rate should not be infinite hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 the mao model and fga model can meet this requirement their initial infiltration rates are listed in table 10 in the mao model a 1 and b 1 decrease with increasing initial infiltration rate tables 8 and 10 in the fga model β 1 increases with increasing initial infiltration rate tables 6 and 10 the initial infiltration rates of these two models are different for as bj and yl the reason for this phenomenon will be explained in the discussion section finally the results of the four models are further analysed and verified considering a cumulative infiltration fig 4 the characteristic changes in the cumulative infiltration with increasing infiltration time are similar to those of the horizontal distance hence the above results are confirmed again 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of cga model fga model mao model and richards equation the correction term 0 4 is proposed in this paper cga model it implies that smk of the cga model is 0 4 times the uncorrected smks a similar experiment was carried out by hsu et al 2017 the results are listed in table 11 according to table 11 smk of the traditional ga model is approximately 0 4 times that of the hsu model except in the dry sand with zero water content therefore for those traditional ga models with a constant correction term the cga model in this study approximates the measured data best except in the dry sand with zero water content the 0 4 correction can be considered as average y x hence the rapid change in y x during the early stage of the infiltration cannot be described accurately when the change is large and has a major effect on the infiltration processes 0 4 should not be used such as for dry sand with zero water content table 11 however it is fortuitous that the correction term 0 4 is suitable for sand loam bj silt loam as silty clay loam yl and dry sand with non zero water content tables 5 and 11 although a small error can occur during the early stage of an infiltration the application of the model is still advantageous because of its simple form the fga model compensates the deficiency of the cga mode and considers the effect of the initial infiltration velocity dynamic capillary pressure via the parameter β 1 fig 2 demonstrates that this model appropriately describes the changes in the infiltration distance with increasing infiltration time the hsu model eq 2 is presented to incorporate the velocity dependent capillary pressure into the ga model however the ode expression and addition of several parameters which are not easily obtained greatly restrict the application of the model although the mao model can include the dynamic capillary pressure it only applies to short term infiltration because of the inappropriate y x richards equation can describe the infiltration distance relatively accurately for bj and yl but induces large errors for as part of the reason is that the richards equation neglects the effect of the velocity dependent capillary pressure chapwanya and stockie 2010 when the infiltration velocity is relatively high the infiltration distance becomes exaggerated note that the infiltration velocity can be expressed as 43 υ i δ θ where δθ is a constant thus the infiltration velocity is controlled via the infiltration rate the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on as is significantly greater than for bj and yl therefore the initial infiltration rate of as should be evidently greater that of bj according to table 10 the fga model provides more reasonable results than the mao model 4 2 analysis of model parameters the above analysis indicates that the mao model and fga model can describe the infiltration processes considering the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure however the cga model cannot consider the complete effect particularly during the early stage of the infiltration the three models provide similar results for the infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration during the early stage of the infiltration figs 2 4 therefore the models cannot be compared clearly by means of the infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration a more intuitive relation must be presented hsu et al 2017 and pellichero et al 2012 reported that the relation between ix and x for a vertical infiltration can be used to distinguish between the traditional ga model and hsu model during the early stage of the infiltration hence the three models are compared considering this relation this paper adopts as as an example the results are presented in fig 5 the horizontal infiltration is different from the vertical infiltration for the relation between ix and x regarding the vertical infiltration experiment ix changes dramatically during the early stage of the infiltration and finally increases linearly with increasing x hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 according to eqs 2 and 3 the horizontal infiltration rate lacks a constant term k the hydraulic conductivity for comparing the vertical infiltration rate thus ix should be a constant for the horizontal infiltration finally the fga model describes the law accurately in fig 5 by contrast the cga model fails in modelling the initial conditions of the infiltration and the fluctuation in the mao model indicates that it cannot describe the processes properly therefore the fga model is the most accurate model and its parameter is explained below fig 6 a shows that α 1 smks is a stable value of ix in the late stage of the infiltration the infiltration rate is very slow and the dynamic capillary pressure has no effect on the infiltration further α 1 is the correction coefficient of the traditional ga model smks it has the same purpose as the correction term y in the cga model therefore α 1 can be considered to be approximatively 0 4 in most experiments fig 6 b shows that ix varies faster with increasing x when β 1 increases this change can reflect the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration the greater the change the greater is the influence of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration according to above experimental results when β 1 is above 1 06 the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration is evident this indicator is not very accurate because the three experiments are only investigated in this study 5 conclusion the ga model is widely applied to describe infiltration processes however the model does not consider all effects of various factors in the infiltration process the broken line wetting profile was observed in a horizontal soil column by mao et al 2016 and the dynamic capillary pressure was incorporated into the ga model by hsu and hilpert 2011 based on the above views a correction term for the hydraulic conductivity and suction head can be obtained for three different soil types as bj and yl via fitting the results of the cga model correction term of 0 4 the fga model correction term is a special function richards equation and mao model were compared with the measured data the results indicate that richards equation neglects the dynamic capillary pressure thus it may induce a large error for rapid infiltrations although the mao model considers the dynamic capillary pressure its results are not accurate for late times the cga model can predict entire infiltration processes relatively accurately except in the dry sand with zero water content nevertheless a small error can occur during the early stage of an infiltration the model is still of great significance owing to its the simple expression the fga model is considered to be the most suitable approach for describing infiltration processes the mao cga and fga models are modifications of the traditional ga model their only difference is the correction term y x regarding the fga model α 1 is the correction

6403,the green ampt ga model which assumes a rectangular saturated piston flow and homogeneous isotropic soil with uniform initial water content is one of the most widely used models for describing infiltration processes however these assumptions severely limit the applications of the model thus a modified ga model has long been a topic of interest this study mainly investigates the effects of the broken line wetting profile and dynamic capillary pressure on the ga model of a horizontal soil column the aim is to provide a reasonable correction term for the hydraulic conductivity and suction head the correction term is considered to be 0 4 when the dynamic capillary pressure cga model is neglected when the dynamic capillary pressure is taken into account the correction term is a special function fga model moreover the results of the cga model fga model richards equation and mao model are compared with respect to the measured data for sandy loam silt loam and silty clay loam richards equation cannot accurately describe the infiltration of water into silt loam and part of the reason is the high infiltration velocity although the mao model can perfectly simulate the infiltration process in a short time approximately 50 min in this study its results gradually deviate from the actual situation after 50 min the cga model can predict the entire infiltration processes relatively accurately except in the dry sand with zero water content however as in the traditional ga model small errors can still occur during the early infiltration stage the fga model is considered to be the most suitable approach for describing infiltration processes in this paper the characteristics of these models are explained and the parameters of the fga model are discussed in detail keywords infiltration green ampt model richards equation correction term dynamic capillary pressure 1 introduction the green ampt ga model which is a simple physics based method to evaluate soil water infiltration processes is widely used in the runoff soil erosion irrigation drainage and watershed management brakensiek and onstad 1977 loáiciga and huang 2007 this model was originally applied to uniform initially dry and coarse textured soils green and ampt 1911 hillel and gardner 1970 mao et al 2016 later the model was extended to rainfall runoff simulations and layered soils with nonuniform initial water content bouwer 1969 chen and young 2006 chu 1978 chu and mariño 2005 corradini et al 2000 craig et al 2010 deng and zhu 2016 liu et al 2008 ma et al 2010 mein and larson 1973 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 rao et al 2006 in the recent study of hsu and hilpert 2011 the modified ga model hsu model was presented to include the dynamic capillary pressure which depends on the wetting front velocity although it can describe infiltration processes more accurately the expression of the ordinary differential equation ode makes its application difficult hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 therefore a simple and accurate model which considers the dynamic capillary pressure is still necessary the broken line wetting profile in a horizontal soil column and a modified ga model mao model were investigated and presented by mao et al 2016 the method includes an approximated dynamic capillary pressure however it is only proved to be accurate for a short infiltration time mao et al 2016 and its parameters have no clear physical significance the ga model contains two key parameters the suction head and hydraulic conductivity their selection influences the calculation results deng and zhu 2016 sorensen et al 2014 the suction head can be estimated with a variety of algorithms bouwer 1966 mein and larson 1973 neuman 1976 white and sully 1987 nevertheless its value is often underestimated hsu et al 2017 the hydraulic conductivity is usually considered to be a constant during the entire infiltration process the traditional ga model green and ampt 1911 adopts a saturated hydraulic conductivity to simulate infiltration processes bouwer 1966 suggested that the hydraulic conductivity should be half the saturated hydraulic conductivity moreover corradini et al 1997 reported that the hydraulic conductivity changes during the infiltration process and proposed that the average hydraulic conductivity should be adopted in the ga model regrettably the effects of the dynamic capillary pressure and broken line wetting profile on these two parameters are not covered in these algorithms therefore a correction term for these two parameters must be investigated for a horizontal soil column nutrients such as nitrate nitrogen from wetland lost to groundwater vertical infiltration are negligible reilly et al 1999 and therefore horizontal movement may be important for the migration of nutrients in wetland ecosystems bai et al 2012 at this time water horizontal movement must be accurately predicted strange et al 2008 besides water storage pit irrigation method is a new method used suitably in orchard irrigation in arid or semi arid area lateral horizontal infiltration of water storage pits needs to be focused solutions of the absorption equation horizontal infiltration equation have the theoretical importance that they yield the limiting small time behaviour of transient infiltration processes even when gravity cannot be neglected mohamed 2018 the study of horizontal infiltration also has other important implications and it is useful in the fields of hydrology soil erosion and water resources mao et al 2016 in this paper richards equation richards 1931 and the mao model mao et al 2016 are introduced and compared with the proposed modified ga model richards equation is regarded as an accurate algorithm and usually used as the reference model for the comparison of different models hsu et al 2002 moeck et al 2016 the mao model was presented in a recent study and the effects of the dynamic capillary pressure and broken line wetting profile are roughly considered in this study finally it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the proposed model the predictions of the ga model for infiltration processes become increasingly accurate with the continuous improvement of the model however its expression also becomes more complex nevertheless simple expressions are sometimes sufficient in engineering applications although a small error occurs in this case approximate explicit expressions are of great significance ali et al 2013 barry et al 2005 parlange et al 2002 salvucci and entekhabi 1994 stone et al 1994 swamee et al 2012 therefore in this study effects of various factors the dynamic capillary pressure and broken line wetting profile are considered in the first model with complex expression the second considered model has a simple and relatively accurate explicit expression the simple cga model correction term of 0 4 and complex fga model correction term is a special function are presented and discussed next the cga model fga model mao model and richards equation are compared in terms of infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration finally the characteristics of these models are explained and the parameters of the fga model are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental methods and materials the experimental data is from mao et al 2016 and thus experimental procedure is consistent with this study the experimental soils originate from three different sites ansai as and yangling yl in shannxi province and beijing bj province china table 1 the homogeneous soil column has a length of 40 cm and diameter of 5 cm the bj as and yl soils have dry densities of 1 33 g cm3 1 23 g cm3 and 1 26 g cm3 respectively and the ponding depth is controlled with a mariotte bottle according to mao et al 2016 the soil water distribution can be divided into two straight lines line 1 and line 2 fig 1 line 1 has a relatively flat profile compared with that of line 2 constant slope the intersection of the two lines is called the critical water content θc which is always a constant table 2 its corresponding horizontal coordinate is the critical infiltration distance xcf or the critical horizontal distance 2 2 introduction and modification of models first the ga model mao model and richards equation are briefly introduced then the modified ga model is presented finally expressions for the error estimation are given 2 2 1 the green ampt model the traditional ga model obtained via darcy s law can be expressed as green and ampt 1911 1 di dt i k s h s m z z where i is the cumulative infiltration t is the infiltration time i is the infiltration rate ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity h is the ponding depth sm is the suction head of the wetting front and z is the infiltration distance in a vertical soil column hsu and hilpert 2011 proposed a functional form for a velocity dependent capillary pressure and incorporated it into the ga model the resulting ga model hsu model has the following ode 2 di dt i k z h s m γ d ρ g ϕ ε θ 0 α η i γ δ θ β z where k is the hydraulic conductivity γ the interfacial tension d is the grain size ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration ϕ ε θ 0 is the non dimensional function of porosity ε and θ 0 α and β are model parameters specific to the porous medium that quantify the capillary nonequilibrium η is the dynamic viscosity of water and δθ is the change in the water content for a horizontal soil column when the ponding depth is zero eq 2 can be simplified as 3 di dt i k s m γ d ρ g ϕ ε θ 0 α η i γ δ θ β x 4 δ θ θ c θ s 2 θ 0 where x is the infiltration distance in a horizontal soil column eq 3 can be simplified as 5 di dt i k f x s m x 6 f x s m 1 e x s m s m γ d ρ g ϕ ε θ 0 α η i γ δ θ β where f x and e x are the correction terms of the suction head the hydraulic conductivity k is smaller than the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks owing to the entrapped air and broken line wetting profile thus a correction term for the hydraulic conductivity is also required eq 5 can be expressed as 7 di dt i g x k s f x s m x where g x is the correction term of the hydraulic conductivity eq 7 can be also expressed via 8 di dt i y x k s s m x 9 y x g x f x where y x is the correction term of the hydraulic conductivity and suction head the water balance approach based on the principle of mass conservation is applied to calculate the cumulative infiltration 10 i x cf θ c θ s 2 θ 0 θ c θ 0 x x cf 2 where θc θ0 constant and x xcf constant therefore the infiltration rate i can be expressed as 11 i θ c θ s 2 θ 0 dx dt the solution of eq 8 cannot be obtained owing to the unknown function y x this function is closely related to the infiltration velocity however the variations in the infiltration velocity are often small except in certain special cases and for a fairly short time during the early infiltration stage pellichero et al 2012 therefore y x is first simplified in the form of a constant y to describe the infiltration processes by substituting eq 11 into eq 8 the horizontal distance can be expressed as 12 x 2 y k s s m δ θ t substituting eq 12 into eq 11 leads to the following expression of the infiltration rate 13 i 1 2 2 y k s δ θ s m t 1 2 philip 1969 obtained the equation of the vertical infiltration via a mathematical derivation 14 i 1 2 s t 1 2 a where s is the sorptivity and a is associated with the gravity and often equals ks for a horizontal soil column the infiltration rate can be expressed as 15 i 1 2 s t 1 2 eqs 15 and 13 are essentially equal they exhibit the following relation 16 s 2 2 y k s δ θ s m by substituting eq 16 into eq 12 the horizontal distance can be expressed as 17 x s δ θ t 1 2 eq 17 is solvable as long as parameters sm and y are known first we discuss the parameter sm the entire profile of the horizontal soil column cannot be saturated because of the effect of gravity a suction head is required to balance the gravity which is the reason for the occurrence of the broken line wetting profile line 1 slight slope represents the wetting front profile for the gravity balance whereas wetting front profile of line 2 steep slope is similar to that of the vertical infiltration fig 1 an average suction head can be used for line 1 18 s m 1 0 x cf h 1 x d x x cf where xcf is the intersection of the two lines with respect to the x coordinate and h 1 x is the suction head of each point on line 1 the relation between the water content and suction head can be described via van genuchten 1980 19 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 ah n m θ θ s h 0 h 0 where θr is the residual water content m n and a are empirical parameters m 1 1 n and h is the suction head because the considered initial water content is very low the residual water content is assumed equal to the initial water content to obtain eq 20 the water content θ is replaced considering a linear decrease with a slope k1 as the distance x increases θ k1x θs fig 1 by substituting eq 19 into eq 18 the average suction head of line 1 can be expressed via 20 s m 1 0 x cf k 1 x θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 m 1 1 n a d x x cf to simplify eq 20 variable y can be defined as 21 y k 1 x where k 1 is the slope of line 1 in fig 1 by substituting eq 21 into eq 20 the average suction head can be simplified as 22 s m 1 0 θ c θ s y θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 m 1 1 n d y a θ c θ s when the soil is saturated the slope and average suction head are zero the suction head of line 2 can be obtained via a variety of algorithms bouwer 1966 mein and larson 1973 neuman 1976 white and sully 1987 in this study the method of neuman 1976 is used 23 s m 2 h c h 0 k r d h 24 k r k h k s where hc is the suction head and corresponds to the critical water content θc kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity and h0 is the suction head and corresponds to the initial water content θ 0 in this study the initial water content θ 0 is approximatively equal to the residual water content θr hence according to eq 19 h0 is infinite this phenomenon cannot occur in nature further the soil that is dried in a laboratory environment does not have such a large suction head eq 23 does not converge when the upper limit of the integral approaches infinity therefore a specific value must be provided for the upper limit of the integral according to repeated attempts variations in h0 from 103 to 107 cm have weak effects on the suction head of line 2 consequently inspired by the method of mein and larson 1973 h 0 can be set to 105 cm which is a conservative and reasonable value for the description of the actual situation lu and likos 2004 lu and godt 2008 pham et al 2018 the suction head hc corresponding to the critical water content θc can be obtained via eq 19 thus the relative hydraulic conductivity kr is only required to solve the suction head of line 2 van genuchten et al 1991 proposed that kr can be expressed as 25 k r 1 ah mn 1 ah n m 2 1 ah n ml where the parameters a m n and l can be obtained via the retc code table 3 therefore the suction heads of line 1 and line 2 can be estimated with eqs 22 and 23 respectively the results are listed in table 4 according to table 4 the suction head of line 2 s m 2 is much lower than that of line 1 s m 1 hence the latter is used in this study the reason for the occurrence of line 1 can be the static balance of forces therefore the adoption of an average suction head is appropriate however line 2 experiences a dynamic process and its suction head cannot be derived via rigorous theoretical derivations no physically based model neuman 1976 the semi empirical methods are widely used including the method of neuman 1976 adopted in this study the result of the interaction between the hydraulic conductivity and suction head is the effective suction head i e the suction head of line 2 although the suction head at each point on line 2 is high the corresponding unsaturated hydraulic conductivity approximates zero owing to the low water content hence the suction head of line 2 eqs 23 and 24 has a weak effect on the infiltration this is the most fundamental reason for s m 2 s m 1 the only unknown parameter y can be obtained via the measured data table 5 according to table 5 the y values of the three soil types are very close and their average 0 4 is the most appropriate correction term for a horizontal soil column the model y is 0 4 is called the cga model in this study it has a simple form and can be easily applied in engineering applications however when the infiltration time t is 0 the infiltration rate i is still infinite which is unphysical pellichero et al 2012 inspired by the mentioned papers in the introduction we present a function y x to express the initial infiltration rate 26 y x α 1 x x 1 1 e β 1 x 1 2 where α 1 is the correction coefficient of smks when the dynamic capillary pressure has no effect on the infiltration and β 1 reflects the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the early infiltration stage by substituting eqs 26 and 11 into eq 8 eq 8 can be expressed as 27 dx dt α 1 s m k s δ θ x 1 1 e β 1 x 1 2 therefore the relation between the infiltration distance and infiltration time can be expressed via 28 t δ θ 2 α 1 β 1 s m k s ln e β 1 x 1 2 1 e β 1 1 the ga model y x is a special function is called the fga model in this study the parameters α 1 and β 1 for as bj and yl can be obtained with the measured data table 6 according to table 6 α 1 is always slightly higher than 0 4 β 1 will be analysed below in the following the mao model and richards equation will be compared with the cga model and fga model and therefore they will be briefly introduced here 2 2 2 the mao model mao et al 2016 proposed a function to describe accurately the infiltration processes in horizontal soil columns regrettably the parameters of the function have no clear physical significance and can only be obtained via fitting the relation between the horizontal distance infiltration rate and infiltration time can be expressed as 29 x a t b 1 e c t 30 i δ θ a b c e c t where a b and c are fitting parameters their values for the three soil types are listed in table 7 the mao model lacks a theoretical basis we will extend and explain it by combining it with the research results of this study regarding equation 8 we assume that y x can be expressed as 31 y x t a 1 x b 1 x e c 1 t where parameters a 1 b 1 and c 1 are related to the hydraulic conductivity and suction head by substituting eqs 11 and 31 into eq 8 the horizontal distance can be expressed as 32 x a 1 k s s m δ θ t b 1 k s s m c 1 δ θ 1 e c 1 t the expressions of eqs 29 and 32 are essentially equal they have the following relation 33 a a 1 k s s m δ θ 34 b b 1 k s s m c 1 δ θ 35 c c 1 evidently the mao model is a modification of the traditional ga model and includes the hydraulic conductivity and suction head however the correction term is different in this study parameters a 1 b 1 and c 1 can be obtained via eqs 33 34 and 35 respectively table 8 according to table 8 c1 is stable at approximately 0 15 a 1 and b 1 have a relation about the infiltration velocity which will be discussed later 2 2 3 richards equation richards equation which provides the change in the water content in a porous medium over time is simply a combination of the conservation of mass darcy buckingham unsaturated flux equation and the soil characteristic pressure saturation curve dicarlo 2005 regarding horizontal infiltration the water movement can be expressed as 36 θ h t t x k h h x the water inlet boundary condition adopts a constant suction head 37 h 0 t 0 the water outlet boundary condition adopts free drainage 38 h x 0 the initial suction head at different locations of the soil column is the same 39 h x 0 h 0 2 3 error estimation the root mean square error rmse relative error re and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used to evaluate the errors between the cga model fga model mao model richards equation and measured results

value of the ith sample ō is the mean of the measured values and n is the number of samples the infiltration capacity is often discussed in terms of infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration in this study rmse re and nse coefficient are used to evaluate the infiltration distances simulated via the fga model cga model mao model and richards equation moreover the infiltration rates and cumulative infiltrations of these four models are compared 3 results fig 2 and table 9 present a comparison of the horizontal distances simulated via fga model cga model mao model and richards equation the calculated results of the cga model fga model and mao model approximate the measured results for the three soil types according to the comparison of rmses res and nse coefficients the horizontal distances simulated via the fga model agree well with the measured results whereas the results of richards equation deviate most from the measured results particularly for as the relations between the infiltration rate and infiltration time of the fga model cga model mao model and richards equation are shown in fig 3 the results of the four models exhibit a slight difference at 50 min after that the infiltration rate of the mao model stabilises quickly with increasing infiltration time those of the other three models continue to decrease therefore the results of the mao model will differ significantly from those of the other three models for late times when the infiltration time approaches infinity the infiltration rates of the cga model fga model and richards equation equal zero eqs 15 27 and 36 respectively however that of the mao model approximates aδθ eq 30 evidently gravity has a weak impact on the infiltration rate in a horizontal soil column hence an infiltration rate of zero is reasonable when the infiltration time is infinite therefore the results of the mao model deviate from the actual situation for late times when the infiltration time is zero the infiltration rate should not be infinite hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 the mao model and fga model can meet this requirement their initial infiltration rates are listed in table 10 in the mao model a 1 and b 1 decrease with increasing initial infiltration rate tables 8 and 10 in the fga model β 1 increases with increasing initial infiltration rate tables 6 and 10 the initial infiltration rates of these two models are different for as bj and yl the reason for this phenomenon will be explained in the discussion section finally the results of the four models are further analysed and verified considering a cumulative infiltration fig 4 the characteristic changes in the cumulative infiltration with increasing infiltration time are similar to those of the horizontal distance hence the above results are confirmed again 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of cga model fga model mao model and richards equation the correction term 0 4 is proposed in this paper cga model it implies that smk of the cga model is 0 4 times the uncorrected smks a similar experiment was carried out by hsu et al 2017 the results are listed in table 11 according to table 11 smk of the traditional ga model is approximately 0 4 times that of the hsu model except in the dry sand with zero water content therefore for those traditional ga models with a constant correction term the cga model in this study approximates the measured data best except in the dry sand with zero water content the 0 4 correction can be considered as average y x hence the rapid change in y x during the early stage of the infiltration cannot be described accurately when the change is large and has a major effect on the infiltration processes 0 4 should not be used such as for dry sand with zero water content table 11 however it is fortuitous that the correction term 0 4 is suitable for sand loam bj silt loam as silty clay loam yl and dry sand with non zero water content tables 5 and 11 although a small error can occur during the early stage of an infiltration the application of the model is still advantageous because of its simple form the fga model compensates the deficiency of the cga mode and considers the effect of the initial infiltration velocity dynamic capillary pressure via the parameter β 1 fig 2 demonstrates that this model appropriately describes the changes in the infiltration distance with increasing infiltration time the hsu model eq 2 is presented to incorporate the velocity dependent capillary pressure into the ga model however the ode expression and addition of several parameters which are not easily obtained greatly restrict the application of the model although the mao model can include the dynamic capillary pressure it only applies to short term infiltration because of the inappropriate y x richards equation can describe the infiltration distance relatively accurately for bj and yl but induces large errors for as part of the reason is that the richards equation neglects the effect of the velocity dependent capillary pressure chapwanya and stockie 2010 when the infiltration velocity is relatively high the infiltration distance becomes exaggerated note that the infiltration velocity can be expressed as 43 υ i δ θ where δθ is a constant thus the infiltration velocity is controlled via the infiltration rate the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on as is significantly greater than for bj and yl therefore the initial infiltration rate of as should be evidently greater that of bj according to table 10 the fga model provides more reasonable results than the mao model 4 2 analysis of model parameters the above analysis indicates that the mao model and fga model can describe the infiltration processes considering the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure however the cga model cannot consider the complete effect particularly during the early stage of the infiltration the three models provide similar results for the infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration during the early stage of the infiltration figs 2 4 therefore the models cannot be compared clearly by means of the infiltration distance infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration a more intuitive relation must be presented hsu et al 2017 and pellichero et al 2012 reported that the relation between ix and x for a vertical infiltration can be used to distinguish between the traditional ga model and hsu model during the early stage of the infiltration hence the three models are compared considering this relation this paper adopts as as an example the results are presented in fig 5 the horizontal infiltration is different from the vertical infiltration for the relation between ix and x regarding the vertical infiltration experiment ix changes dramatically during the early stage of the infiltration and finally increases linearly with increasing x hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 according to eqs 2 and 3 the horizontal infiltration rate lacks a constant term k the hydraulic conductivity for comparing the vertical infiltration rate thus ix should be a constant for the horizontal infiltration finally the fga model describes the law accurately in fig 5 by contrast the cga model fails in modelling the initial conditions of the infiltration and the fluctuation in the mao model indicates that it cannot describe the processes properly therefore the fga model is the most accurate model and its parameter is explained below fig 6 a shows that α 1 smks is a stable value of ix in the late stage of the infiltration the infiltration rate is very slow and the dynamic capillary pressure has no effect on the infiltration further α 1 is the correction coefficient of the traditional ga model smks it has the same purpose as the correction term y in the cga model therefore α 1 can be considered to be approximatively 0 4 in most experiments fig 6 b shows that ix varies faster with increasing x when β 1 increases this change can reflect the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration the greater the change the greater is the influence of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration according to above experimental results when β 1 is above 1 06 the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration is evident this indicator is not very accurate because the three experiments are only investigated in this study 5 conclusion the ga model is widely applied to describe infiltration processes however the model does not consider all effects of various factors in the infiltration process the broken line wetting profile was observed in a horizontal soil column by mao et al 2016 and the dynamic capillary pressure was incorporated into the ga model by hsu and hilpert 2011 based on the above views a correction term for the hydraulic conductivity and suction head can be obtained for three different soil types as bj and yl via fitting the results of the cga model correction term of 0 4 the fga model correction term is a special function richards equation and mao model were compared with the measured data the results indicate that richards equation neglects the dynamic capillary pressure thus it may induce a large error for rapid infiltrations although the mao model considers the dynamic capillary pressure its results are not accurate for late times the cga model can predict entire infiltration processes relatively accurately except in the dry sand with zero water content nevertheless a small error can occur during the early stage of an infiltration the model is still of great significance owing to its the simple expression the fga model is considered to be the most suitable approach for describing infiltration processes the mao cga and fga models are modifications of the traditional ga model their only difference is the correction term y x regarding the fga model α 1 is the correction coefficient of smks α 1 0 4 is recommended when the measured data are not obtained the parameter β 1 can reflect the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration during the early stage of the infiltration with increasing β 1 the effect of the dynamic capillary pressure on the infiltration increases this effect is evident when β 1 is above 1 06 in this study declaration of competing

6404,freshwater lenses present valuable water resources on barrier islands yet the biogeochemical processes that control the groundwater quality of these freshwater lenses and how they are affected by the prevailing groundwater dynamics is largely unexplored in this study we investigated the biogeochemistry of a barrier island freshwater lens with a focus on understanding and quantifying organic matter mineralization sulfur cycling and chemical fluxes to the land ocean interface we analyzed a comprehensive set of hydrogeochemical field data from spiekeroog island germany including stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfur species with a reactive transport modeling approach tritium helium groundwater ages were used to constrain the hydrogeochemistry as a function of residence time our results revealed that freshwater lenses can act as archives for anthropogenic pollution conserving the high sulfur loads associated with historic atmospheric deposition we observed two distinct hydro biogeochemical patterns which we attribute to a heterogeneous distribution of reactive organic matter those patterns were well replicated by two separate reactive transport models that considered the variations in organic matter reactivity simulation and field results demonstrated that net sulfur cycling is dominated by microbial sulfate reduction and subsequent iron sulfide precipitation in the absence of dissolved oxidants we attribute the observed high stable sulfur isotope fractionation between dissolved sulfate and sulfide of up to 67 to low 20 pmol ml 1 d 1 microbial sulfate reduction rates we show that older groundwater becomes progressively enriched in ammonium and phosphate due to the mineralization of organic matter and we speculate that lens derived nutrient fluxes may be important for the benthic zone at local groundwater discharge sites at least seasonally in spring and summer keywords atmospheric sulfur deposition microbial sulfate reduction

bahamas and spiekeroog island germany respectively msr results in the production of dissolved sulfide which might react further in conjunction with the chemical reduction of iron oxides thereby leading to the formation of sulfur intermediates and the precipitation of iron sulfides berner 1970 1984 schoonen 2004 rickard and morse 2005 moreover re oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds is important in near surface freshwater and marine sediments and also at the chemocline of euxinic systems e g jørgensen 1982 1990 thamdrup et al 1994 schippers and jørgensen 2002 zerkle et al 2010 with multiple geochemical processes and physical transport processes affecting sulfur cycling the provenance and concentrations of the various sulfur species can be ambiguous therefore tracking the partitioning of stable sulfur isotopes has shown to provide a valuable mechanistic tool to further constrain processes and rates involved in sulfur cycling e g kaplan and rittenberg 1964 rees 1973

et al 2012 druhan et al 2012 2014 hubbard et al 2014 seibert et al 2017 yet sulfur cycling and associated isotope dynamics within fwls and also more generally in coastal aquifers has remained largely unexplored to date compared to typical pure freshwater systems fwls show elevated dissolved sulfate concentrations e g seibert et al 2018 mostly due the inputs from seaspray and inundation events sulfur inputs from atmospheric deposition e g stumm et al 1987 however dramatically rose during the industrial revolution as a result of increasing coal and petroleum combustion cullis and hirschler

while to our knowledge so far no study has targeted the effect on the isotope hydrobiogeochemistry of a fwl an in depth understanding of biogeochemical processes in fwls is also essential because fresh groundwater from these lenses passes through the subterranean estuary ste moore 1999 with potential implications for associated element transformations and fluxes in the benthic zone moore 2010 some of the fresh groundwater derived solutes may ultimately end up in the ocean and sustain metal carbon and nutrient fluxes from land to sea e g hays and ullman 2007 weinstein et al 2011 tait et al

specific chemical fluxes originate from fresh submarine groundwater discharge fsgd or from saline re circulation robinson et al 2018 reactive transport models rtm are increasingly used as a tool to improve the mechanistic understanding of groundwater systems and to quantify chemical fluxes and rates of biogeochemical reactions that occur within these systems and at their interfaces however applications to better understand groundwater composition in coastal settings are still very limited e g spiteri et al 2006 2008 jung et al 2009 robinson et al 2009 roy et al 2011 colombani et al 2014 colombani et al 2015 and so far no rtm study has investigated the combined hydrogeochemical and isotopic dynamics in a barrier island fwl the overall aim of the present study was to perform an in depth analysis and quantification of biogeochemical processes in a barrier island fwl using spiekeroog island in northwestern germany as a representative example a reactive transport model approach was developed and applied to an existing comprehensive field data set hydrogeochemical data were complemented by groundwater age data and stable sulfur isotope analysis for dissolved sulfate and sulfide for selected groundwater samples the specific objectives of our study were i to understand and quantify the biogeochemical reactions and associated isotopic signatures governing the sedimentary sulfur cycle in the spiekeroog island fwl ii to elucidate the impact of historic variations in atmospheric sulfur deposition on the observed biogeochemical patterns and iii to evaluate the role of the fwl for biogeochemical fluxes to the marine environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the main fwl of the barrier island spiekeroog germany was selected for this study fig 1 the island is located in the southern north sea and stretches 9 8 km from west to east it has a maximum width of 2 3 km and the estimated surface area is 21 3 km2 streif 1990 the western part of spiekeroog island is inhabited while the remaining part called ostplate is uninhabited and protected by the wadden sea national park of lower saxony the mean high and low water levels are 1 39 m above sea level masl and 1 33 m below sea level mbsl respectively and the tidal range is 2 72 m annual means from 1995 to 2015 federal waterways and shipping administration wsv 2016 spiekeroog island was formed as a result of the aggregation of marine and aeolian sands the dune arc in the west encompasses primary and secondary dunes of up to 25 m in height röper et al 2012 pliocene pleistocene and holocene deposits comprise fine to coarse grained sands up to a depth of 60 to 40 mbsl they are underlain by a clay layer with a thickness ranging from 1 5 to 15 m oldenburg east frisian water association oowv 2009 deposits at greater depth consist of pliocene sands with local entrapments of peat the clay layer hydraulically separates an upper fresh and a lower saline aquifer calcite prevails in the form of calcareous shell debris in the aquifer seibert et al 2018 further information regarding the geology at spiekeroog island is presented in röper et al 2012 2013 the main fwl resides in the upper freshwater aquifer and started to evolve 350 years ago considering the age of the oldest dune sediments sindowski 1970 seibert et al 2018 a maximum vertical thickness of 45 to 50 m is reached in the center of the fwl apparent groundwater ages as determined by the tritium helium method termed 3h 3he age in the following ranged between 4 and 51 years generally increasing with depth seibert et al 2018 groundwater is abstracted for drinking water production by six pumping wells fig 1 average screen depth varies from 11 to 3 mbsl with total annual abstraction rates of 154 000 m3 a oowv 2009 the annual rainfall of 800 mm a oowv 2012 and estimated groundwater recharge rates of 300 400 mm a röper et al 2012 are similar to other frisian islands compare seibert et al 2018 based on these recharge rate estimates and taking into account a total recharge area of 4 31 km2 i e the total area with a surface elevation 3 masl the estimated annual fresh groundwater recharge for the main fwl is 1 300 000 1 700 000 m3 a 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis groundwater samples were collected from 14 monitoring wells in the west fig 1 a and b wells average screen depths from 43 to 6 mbsl in 2011 röper et al 2012 2014 reckhardt et al 2015 and 2016 seibert et al 2018 in addition seibert et al 2018 installed two shallow monitoring wells at a separate fwl at the ostplate in 2016 fig 1 well dn a and dn b screened in 1 5 mbsl and 1 5 masl respectively to obtain samples of oxic near surface groundwater from an aquifer of presumably similar characteristics a submersible pump eijkelkamp tauchpumpe gigant flow rate 2 l min was used for groundwater sampling and a hach hq 40d multi device equipped with sampling probes that were connected to a flow cell was employed to measure field parameters i e electric conductivity redox potential ph dissolved oxygen and temperature field tests were conducted to determine bicarbonate merck carbonate hardness test dissolved sulfide and ammonium concentrations visocolor eco tests and a pf 12 photometric device subsequently samples for major ions dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic matter dom analyses were collected only groundwater samples with a charge balance 5 were considered for further evaluation groundwater samples from the main fwl presented in this study have electric conductivities and chloride concentrations 600 µs cm and 2 5 mmol l respectively a more detailed overview of the sampling procedures and analytical methods is provided in seibert et al 2018 for the determination of stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfate δ34s so4 2 and sulfide δ34s h2s sample volumes of 5 l were collected once from all wells in september 2016 dissolved sulfide species were quantitatively fixed using a 20 znac solution and after filtering the zns precipitate 24 48 h after sampling the remaining sample was used to quantitatively precipitate baso4 the latter step was carried out by lowering the solution ph to 3 by the addition of hcl heating the samples to 60 c and adding an excess of a 5 bacl2 solution cf seibert et al 2019 precipitates were used for stable sulfur isotope analysis at the leibniz institute of baltic sea research iow by means of c irmms employing a thermo flash 2000 ea elemental analyzer coupled to a thermo finnigan mat 253 gas mass spectrometer via a thermo

2019 2 3 re construction of historic groundwater recharge compositions groundwater recharging the fwl originates from precipitation its composition is not only governed by interactions with soils in the vadose zone but also the atmosphere in this way anthropogenic sulfur emissions can have a strong impact on the ph and dissolved sulfate concentrations of precipitation to investigate the effect of such pollution on the regional atmospheric sulfur deposition sulfate concentrations in historic precipitation at the neighboring island norderney were evaluated results show a four fold sulfate concentration decrease between 1985 and 2016 nlwkn 2016 fig 2 a while chloride concentrations demonstrate no clear temporal trend fig si 3 1b therefore it was thought to be important to consider time varying sulfate concentrations in the groundwater recharge during reactive transport modeling to estimate historic groundwater recharge sulfate concentrations at spiekeroog island 1985 2016 sulfate concentrations in precipitation at norderney island were used and concentrated by a factor of 3 87 corresponding to the ratio of mean chloride concentrations in young groundwater at spiekeroog island 1 45 mmol l a wells seibert et al 2018 and precipitation at norderney island 0 38 mmol l nlwkn 2016 as no further historic data on sulfate concentrations in groundwater recharge were available for spiekeroog island the historic sulfate concentration trend in groundwater recharge that was re constructed for a research site in oostrum netherlands fig 2b after zhang et al 2013 was used by scaling the long term record from that site to the previously estimated groundwater recharge sulfate concentrations si 3 this allowed to determine a plausible sulfate recharge concentration for the entire simulation period i e from 1917 to 2016 fig 2c the concentration of the other important constituents of the groundwater recharge composition i e major ions ph temperature was assumed to be constant over time and obtained by using mean values of very young groundwater 4 a well 28 a and 30 a fig 1 si 3 mean nitrate and oxygen concentrations which were virtually absent at all a wells were retrieved from near surface groundwater at the ostplate well dn a fig 1 seibert et al 2018 since no further data on regional stable sulfur isotope signatures neither in rain nor in groundwater exist a δ34s signature of about 8 vs v cdt was used for all sulfate in groundwater recharge based on isotopic analysis of precipitation collected in oldenburg germany reckhardt et al 2017 oldenburg is 80 km distant to spiekeroog island the final re constructed historic groundwater recharge composition is listed in table si 3 1 2 4 reactive transport modeling 2 4 1 modeling approach while the groundwater flow dynamics of fwls near the freshwater marine interface are complex groundwater flow in the central parts of hydrogeologically relatively homogenous barrier island fwl s such as spiekeroog island largely follows a continuous downward movement driven by groundwater recharge assuming the absence of steep lateral geochemical gradients and of significant transverse mixing we approximated the biogeochemical transport processes through a relatively simple 1 d approach in order to account for the field observed geochemical heterogeneity two separate models were constructed one representing a less reactive model termed lrm and one presenting a more reactive model termed mrm flow path respectively the reactive multicomponent transport model code pht3d prommer et al 2003 was adopted to study the biogeochemical reactions and the evolution of the stable sulfur isotope patterns in the fwl pht3d couples the transport simulator mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and the geochemical model phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 groundwater flow was simulated with modflow harbaugh et al 2000 prior to the reactive transport simulations the longitudinal dispersivity was set to 2 m with a mean groundwater recharge rate of 350 mm a röper et al 2012 and a total porosity of 0 35 seibert et al 2018 the pore water velocity was 1 m a the length of the 1d model was therefore set to 51 m in line with the oldest measured 3h 3he age of 51 a seibert et al 2018 the total simulation time was set to 100 years starting in 1916 with the first 49 years serving as spin up period re constructed groundwater recharge compositions for the years 1917 to 2016 cf section 2 3 table si 3 1 were applied as time varying annually changing inflow solutions 2 4 2 biogeochemical reaction network the biogeochemical reaction network for the spiekeroog fwl simulations was defined by modifying the standard phreeqc database phreeqc dat importantly all nitrogen iron and sulfur species were decoupled from the thermodynamic redox equilibrium consequently all redox reactions relating to the oxidation of organic matter and involving nitrate iron oxide and sulfate reduction were simulated kinetically by coupling organic matter oxidation rates to the corresponding electron accepting processes and considering the appropriate reaction stoichiometries table 1 this was necessary in order to separately track the fate of the sulfur isotopes 32s and 34s and to determine the spatio temporal evolution of the stable sulfur isotope ratios the modified database was carefully validated by comparing simulation results of organic carbon oxidation via the consumption of single electron acceptors with corresponding results of models employing a thermodynamic database si 1 within the spiekeroog fwl mineralization of organic carbon oc via the microbial consumption of different electron acceptors is the main driver for the development of the observed redox zonation as in most aquifer systems the primary redox reactions associated with the oxidation of oc were implemented in the simulations using the following irreversible kinetic reaction roc 1 r oc r ox r nit r iro r sul where rox rnit riro and rsul correspond to the organic carbon degradation rates related to oxygen nitrate iron oxides and sulfate respectively table 1 rates computed for the oxidation step were coupled to the corresponding reduction reactions using the reaction stoichiometry shown in table 1 for degrading om the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 was applied consistent with earlier comparable modelling studies e g sharma et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 seibert et al 2016 the rates of the primary redox reactions involving sedimentary organic carbon soc were assumed not to explicitly depend on soc concentrations and it was assumed that soc would not deplete over the simulation period however variations in soc reactivity which could result from the variations in soc abundance were indirectly considered through the reaction rate constants associated with the primary redox reactions iron sulfide fes precipitation as well as ammonium re oxidation were implemented as kinetically controlled secondary reactions table 1 furthermore calcite and siderite were included as equilibrium phases methanogenesis was not considered as no methane was detected with the exception of three wells where very low methane concentrations 3 17 µmol l were found similarly no manganese oxides were included as the measured dissolved mn profiles suggested that mn was not playing a substantial role for redox cycling in the spiekeroog fwl seibert et al 2018 however it cannot be completely excluded that mn reduction is masked by the rapid precipitation of dissolved mn as mnco3 i e rhodochrosite seibert et al 2018 2 4 3 stable sulfur isotope signatures stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfate and sulfide were modeled by tracking light and heavy sulfur species i e 32s and 34s separately as described earlier by prommer et al 2009 druhan et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and seibert et al 2017 concentrations of the respective isotopes of the sulfur species were combined to calculate isotope ratios applying the common δ notation with respect to the international v cdt standard 2 δ 34 s v cdt 34 s 32 s sample 34 s 32 s v cdt 1 1000 where 34s 32s sample is the modelled ratio of isotopically light and heavy sulfur and 34s 32s v cdt corresponds to the stable sulfur isotope ratio of v cdt i e 0 0441626 ding et al 2001 stable sulfur isotope signatures of remaining sulfate and produced sulfide are affected by isotope fractionation during msr as lighter 32so4 2 molecules are preferentially consumed by dissimilatory sulfate reducers e g harrison and thode 1958 chambers and trudinger 1979 to account for this kinetic isotope effect on evolving stable sulfur isotope signatures during organic carbon oxidation via msr the reduction rate of light sulfate was modeled as e g jørgensen 1979 3 r 32 so 4 r so 4 c 32 so 4 c 32 so 4 c 34 so 4 where r so 4 is the overall msr rate table 1 and c 32 so 4 and c 34 so 4 correspond to the concentrations of light and heavy sulfate respectively the reduction rate of heavy sulfate was computed as 4 r 34 so 4 r so 4 c 34 so 4 c 32 so 4 c 34 so 4 ε 1000 1 where ε is the isotope enrichment factor e g hoefs 2018 which was adjusted during model calibration until a good match between modeled and observed δ34s so4 2 and δ34s h2s signatures was achieved r 32 so 4 and r 34 so 4 were coupled to the reaction stoichiometry for organic carbon oxidation via msr table 1 consuming 32so4 and 34so4 and producing h2 32s and h2 34s respectively furthermore the overall fes precipitation rate rfes was scaled to the relative concentrations of h2 32s and h2 34s as isotope fractionation between 32s and 34s is expected to be very small during iron sulfide precipitation price and shieh 1979 böttcher et al 1998b 5 r fe i s ppt r fes c h 2 i s c h 2 32 s c h 2 34 s where i corresponds to the light 32s or heavy 34s sulfur isotope respectively and c h 2 32 s and c h 2 34 s are the concentrations of light and heavy dissolved sulfide respectively 2 4 4 model calibration the hydrochemical data for two depth profiles as measured in 2011 2014 and 2016 were used to constrain the numerical model development and calibration during this process the simulated reaction network was successively revised and the various rate constants of the biogeochemical reactions were adjusted through a trial and error approach until a good agreement between simulation results and the corresponding field observations was achieved the comparison between simulation results and observations was undertaken with respect to corresponding groundwater age rather than travel distance e g the hydrochemical concentrations at a monitoring well that showed to have a 3h 3he age of 51 a were compared with the simulation results obtained for x 51 m where the simulated 3h 3he age was also 51a the parameters yielding best fits for the two models are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion the model development and calibration process allowed the identification of a plausible biogeochemical reaction network for which the final simulation results for both the lrm and mrm agree very well with the field observations fig 3 importantly this includes a good agreement between observed and modeled sulfate concentrations fig 3a for both simulated flow paths as well as the stable sulfur isotope patterns fig 3c and d overall the process of model development substantially improved the understanding of the prevailing biogeochemical reactions and specifically the cycling of sulfur species within a barrier island fwl the following discussion of results is focused on the new insights that were derived from our model based data interpretation 3 1 freshwater lenses as an archive for atmospheric sulfur pollution trends and the magnitude of observed sulfate concentrations vs depth and 3h 3he age varied among sampling locations both the trends and the differences can be convincingly explained through the occurrence of reactive processes under the assumption that reaction rates varied spatially as a result of variations in om reactivity i e through the conceptualization as lrm and mrm observed sulfate concentrations show a steadily increasing trend with increasing 3h 3he age along the less reactive flow path open blue squares fig 3a while data along the more reactive flow path show a decreasing trend of sulfate concentrations for samples with a 3h 3he age 10 years remarkably similar concentration trends were also noticed for fresh groundwater ec 600 µs cm collected at the neighboring island langeoog full symbols fig 3a data collected by houben et al 2014 in comparison most of the observed sulfate concentrations are below or clearly below simulated sulfate concentrations black line fig 3a that were obtained with a non reactive model variant that employed the re constructed sulfate signal fig 2c while all geochemical reactions were switched off the differences between the observed sulfate concentrations and those from the non reactive simulations were explained by the lrm and mrm variants which included msr albeit at different rates the increasing trend of the observed sulfate concentrations along the less reactive flow path is likely the result of the elevated sulfate loads in historic groundwater recharge associated with the higher atmospheric sulfur deposition that peaked in the 1960 s as such the fwl acts as an archive for historic atmospheric sulfur pollution on the other hand alternative conceptual models fail to explain the observations and can be excluded for example mixing with seawater as an explanation for the increasing sulfate concentrations at greater depth and with increasing 3h 3he age can be rejected because i all samples have electric conductivities and chloride concentrations 600 µs cm and 2 5 mmol l respectively and ii groundwater so4 2 cl ratios mmol l 1 mmol l 1 are higher 0 08 0 25 fig si 4 1 table si 4 1 than in seawater 0 06 seibert et al 2018 this indicates a non marine source of excess sulfate also gypsum and anhydrite can be excluded as potential sulfate sources in the quartz sand dominated aquifer 3 2 the role of organic matter reactivity for microbial sulfate reduction the differing trends in the observed groundwater sulfate concentrations compare red and blue symbols fig 3a are most plausibly explained by a heterogeneous distribution of om abundance and reactivity in the otherwise homogeneous aquifer and with om mineralization being the rate limiting step this appears to result in spatial variations of sulfate reduction rates srr and is consistent with an earlier study by jakobsen and postma 1994 for similar homogeneous sandy aquifers where they also found significant differences in om reactivity and srr over short distances simulated srr for the lrm and mrm reach maximum values of 5 10 3 nmol ml 1 d 1 and 15 10 3 nmol ml 1 d 1 respectively fig 3e the model derived srr are orders of magnitude lower than srr in most marine sediments where srr may range between 1 and up to 7000 nmol cm 3 d 1 table 3 e g jørgensen 1977 hines and lyons 1982 thode andersen and jørgensen 1989 thamdrup et al 1994 thamdrup and canfield 1996 habicht and canfield 1997 kristensen et al 2000 böttcher et al 2000 2004a wilms et al 2006 wortmann 2006 however much more similar srr 4 10 2 up to 1 nmol ml 1 d 1 were reported for other pleistocene aquifers by jakobsen and postma 1994 while they reported up to two orders of magnitude lower srr for tertiary and cretaceous aquifers table 3 our findings are thus in line with the general observations that om abundance and reactivity in aquifers exhibits a major control on srr and usually is much lower than in coastal marine environments e g rye et al 1981 middelburg 1989 jakobsen and postma 1994 observed sulfide concentrations were substantially lower than expected from a complete stoichiometric transformation of sulfate to dissolved sulfide during msr dashed lines fig 3b a good fit between simulated and observed dissolved sulfide concentrations was however achieved by considering fes precipitation in the reaction network solid lines fig 3b this agrees with earlier studies by jakobsen and postma 1999 who detected pyrite formation in the anoxic zone of a sandy freshwater aquifer and magaritz and luzier 1985 who observed pyrite formation beneath the freshwater saltwater interface in a coastal dunes aquifer reaction of sulfide with organic matter to form organic sulfur compounds may present a further potential sink for dissolved sulfide e g rudd et al 1986 marnette et al 1992 but depends on both the om content and reactivity versus dissolved sulfide and further sulfur intermediate species 3 3 isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction observed δ34s so4 2 signatures become progressively heavier along the flow path and thus with increasing 3h 3he age fig 3c this behavior is well matched by the model simulations and consistent with the occurrence of msr associated stable sulfur isotope fractionation which leaves the residual sulfate successively more enriched in 34s kaplan and rittenberg 1964 nakai and jensen 1964 this is especially pronounced in the case of the more reactive flow path where the remaining sulfate fraction is 10 of the initial sulfate concentration compare black and red lines fig 3a and simulated stable sulfur isotope signatures approach values of up to 79 vs v cdt in the oldest groundwater fig 3c equally pronounced increases of δ34s so4 2 signatures were previously found under closed system conditions in marine sediments e g böttcher et al 1999 claypool 2004 hartmann and nielsen 2012 and aquifers e g massmann et al 2003 both observed and simulated δ34s so4 2 signatures of residual sulfate on the less reactive flow path are significantly lower fig 3c because less sulfate has been reduced fig 3a modeled δ34s so4 2 signatures slightly overestimate the field observed signatures when applying a δ34s so4 2 signature of 8 vs v cdt for recharging sulfate blue solid line fig 3c while the employment of a lower enrichment factor to fit the δ34s so4 2 signatures would fail to match the observed δ34s h2s signatures fig si 2 3 this discrepancy points toward isotopically lighter sulfate that previously recharged the fwl pollution derived sulfate in atmospheric deposition typically has isotope signatures ranging between 3 to 9 vs v cdt krouse and mayer 2000 and to account for the impact of pollution derived sulfate on the developing δ34s so4 2 signatures in the fwl complementary simulations were carried out where the relative isotopic contributions of a background sulfate and a pollution sulfate endmember were considered for simplicity it was assumed that present day sulfate concentrations in groundwater recharge correspond to the background sulfate endmember with a δ34s so4 2 signature of 8 vs v cdt similar to δ34s so4 2 signatures determined for sulfate in young near surface groundwater at the main fwl 10 years 8 to 9 vs v cdt well 29 a and 30 a and a separate fwl at the ostplate 1 year 9 vs v cdt well dn a seibert et al 2019 concentrations of excess sulfate were consequently calculated and a δ34s so4 2 signature of 3 vs v cdt for the pollution derived sulfate endmember resulted in a reasonable model fit of the field observations blue dotted line fig 3c this adopted isotopic signature is at the lower end of the δ34s so4 2 range reported by krouse and mayer 2000 note that the transient isotopic signal for sulfate also affects the δ34s so4 2 signature of the mrm simulation as well as the δ34s h2s signatures on both flow paths which are slightly lower compared to the situation when sulfate with a constant isotopic signature of 8 vs v cdt recharges the fwl the outlier δ34s so4 2 signature of 8 3 vs v cdt in young groundwater fig 3c 4 years well 28 a is possibly explained by a local release of sulfate from pyrite oxidation and probably related to the temporary penetration of dissolved oxygen or nitrate into anoxic zones si 5 this demonstrates that pyrite oxidation locally may contribute isotopically depleted sulfate to the groundwater sulfate pool dissolved sulfide is noticeably depleted in 34s compared to the remaining sulfate fig 3c and d the observed isotope fractionation between dissolved sulfate and sulfide ranged between 31 and 67 table si 4 1 and enrichment factors of 65 and 28 were adopted for sulfur isotope fractionation during msr in the lrm and mrm respectively to fit the field observations table 2 instead employing a single enrichment factor in our simulations failed to deliver an acceptable model fit with the observed stable sulfur isotope patterns fig si 2 2 these maximum detected isotope fractionations rank among the highest values ever observed in natural environments table 4 while high isotope fractionation usually is characteristic for some euxinic basins e g werne et al 2003 johnston et al 2008 deep sea sediments e g rudnicki et al 2001 wortmann et al 2001 böttcher et al 2004b and stratified lakes e g zerkle et al 2010 canfield et al 2010 reports of similar isotope fractionations in aquifers are limited with the florida aquifer u s a rye et al 1981 and the lincolnshire limestone aquifer england bottrell et al 2000 being some of the rare examples although groundwater was sampled from the same aquifer the deviation between the two enrichment factors further underpins the distinctly different biogeochemical characteristics of the two conceptualized flow paths we attribute this high isotope fractionation mainly to msr which agrees with studies by rudnicki et al 2001 and wortmann et al 2001 who observed isotope fractionation up to 77 during msr in deep marine sediments in the absence of intense sulfur re cycling this was later confirmed by sim et al 2011a and canfield et al 2010 who could demonstrate that msr alone can produce isotope fractionation up to 70 besides msr sulfur re oxidation in combination with bacterial disproportionation of sulfur intermediates is associated with substantial stable sulfur isotope fractionation canfield and thamdrup 1994 cypionka et al 1998 habicht et al 1998 böttcher et al 2001 2005 as dissolved oxygen and nitrate were absent in the deeper anoxic zones disproportionation coupled to repeated sulfur re oxidation is unlikely to be the primary cause for the observed high isotope fractionation c f donahue et al 2008 wortmann et al 2001 however it may still have played a minor role given that sulfur intermediates like elemental sulfur are produced upon oxidation of sulfide by fe e g thamdrup et al 1994 the higher fractionation factor for the lrm compared to the mrm is in line with the previously observed inverse correlation between cellular srr and stable sulfur isotope fractionation e g harrison and thode 1958 kaplan and rittenberg 1964 sim et al 2011b wing and halevy 2014 however we recognize that the understanding of the complex and multiple processes impacting the magnitude of isotope fractionation during msr like srr sulfate concentrations or genera type and strain specific factors is still incomplete e g harrison and thode 1958 nakai and jensen 1964 brüchert et al 2001 habicht and canfield 2001 habicht et al 2002 wing and halevy 2014 bradley et al 2016 recent discoveries indicate moreover that the composition of the organic donors and intracellular concentrations of metabolites may impact both the cell specific srr and thereby the magnitude of sulfur isotope discrimination sim et al 2011a b wing and halevy 2014 covering most of the large range of isotope fractionation observed in natural environments table 4 3 4 chemical fluxes at the land ocean interface coupled to organic matter mineralization resulting from om mineralization groundwater in the spiekeroog fwl becomes progressively enriched in ammonium and phosphate with increasing residence time symbols fig 2g and h employing the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 to define the stoichiometric ratio of the elements released during om mineralization in the model simulations resulted in a reasonable agreement between simulated and observed ammonium and phosphate concentrations respectively however some deviations clearly exist which is not surprising given that both phosphate and ammonium concentrations may have been affected by sorption reactions e g sorption of ammonium to cation exchanger sites surface complexation of phosphate which were neglected in the model on the other hand the discrepancies could also indicate that the composition of the degrading om varies within the aquifer among the different geologic layers section 2 1 locally phosphate may also have been released in conjunction with the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and the associated loss of sorption capacity as illustrated in fig 2f bicarbonate concentrations show a decreasing concentration trend with increasing 3h 3he age despite the constant production of carbon dioxide from om mineralization the implementation of calcite and siderite precipitation in the models successfully lowered simulated inorganic carbon concentrations in close agreement with the field observations while not confirmed through mineralogical data siderite precipitation in the spiekeroog aquifer seems plausible it is also consistent with an earlier study of magaritz and luzier 1985 who reported the formation of siderite in a sandy coastal dunes aquifer at coos bay oregon it is worth noting that siderite precipitation in conjunction with iron sulfide precipitation also scavenged most dissolved iron in the simulations fig si 2 1 ongoing iron oxide reduction and its rates are therefore difficult to track on the basis of dissolved iron concentrations alone as already previously noticed by van breukelen et al 2004 mean ammonium and phosphate concentrations in discharging groundwater are 50 90 µmol l and 6 9 µmol l respectively assuming that fsgd is a mixture of groundwater with different 3h 3he ages those concentrations are similar to n and p concentrations in freshwater endmembers of other coastal aquifers moore 2010 and references cited herein adjacent seawater at a monitoring station in the back barrier area of spiekeroog island showed high dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorous dip concentrations during winter and autumn of 30 60 µmol l and 1 µmol l respectively while nutrients were depleted in the seawater column during spring dip and summer din grunwald et al 2010 thus fsgd may locally present a relevant and constant source of nutrients to the ste especially during spring and summer of course chemical fluxes from the fwl to the ste might be further modified by reactive processes prior to their discharge to the sea for example phosphate may be scavenged from solution via iron oxide precipitation and ammonium may undergo nitrification in the biogeochemically active freshwater seawater mixing zones of the ste charette and sholkovitz 2002 slomp and van cappellen 2004 charette et al 2005 mcallister et al 2015 model and field results further indicate that fsgd has no significant impact on the carbonate chemistry of the adjacent sea as bicarbonate concentrations 2 5 2 7 mmol l and ph 8 1 8 2 were comparable in both endmembers 4 conclusions in this study we conducted an in depth analysis of the biogeochemical processes that occur in a barrier island fwl with a particular focus on sulfur cycling we developed and used a reactive transport modeling approach to analyze a comprehensive set of field data from spiekeroog island germany which included tritium helium measurements and stable sulfur isotopes signatures for dissolved sulfide and sulfate we successively improved the rtm until it could plausibly explain the spatial variations in ion concentrations and isotopic patterns which allowed us to unravel the governing interacting processes that affect the water chemistry in the studied fwl our analysis illustrates that organic matter and its mineralization is the primary driver for biogeochemical changes in the spiekeroog island fwl and that overall the sedimentary sulfur cycle is largely governed by slow microbially mediated sulfate reduction 20 pmol ml 1 d 1 and iron sulfide precipitation the modeled sulfate reduction rates are low compared to coastal marine sediments but similar to rates reported for aquifers this underlines the important role of the electron donor i e om availability reactivity for the sediment biogeochemistry the reactive transport simulations reproduced the observed sulfur isotope patterns including the large isotope fractionation of up to 67 vs v cdt between dissolved sulfide and sulfate which is mainly attributed to microbially mediated sulfate reduction this is in line with recent studies demonstrating that microbes can generate sulfur isotope fractionation considerably exceeding a previously assumed maximum of 47 wortmann et al 2001 rudnicki et al 2001 brunner and bernasconi 2005 canfield et al 2010 sim et al 2011a wing and halevy 2014 moreover we demonstrated how atmospheric sulfur deposition has impacted the hydrogeochemistry of the spiekeroog island fwl by reconstructing the historic sulfur input into the fwl and by delineating reaction induced concentration changes and their spatio temporal variations from those induced by the transient input history this illustrated the role of barrier island fwls as an archive for anthropogenic sulfur emissions the here presented study enhances our understanding of the biogeochemistry in barrier island aquifers and demonstrates that it is important to quantitatively

6404,freshwater lenses present valuable water resources on barrier islands yet the biogeochemical processes that control the groundwater quality of these freshwater lenses and how they are affected by the prevailing groundwater dynamics is largely unexplored in this study we investigated the biogeochemistry of a barrier island freshwater lens with a focus on understanding and quantifying organic matter mineralization sulfur cycling and chemical fluxes to the land ocean interface we analyzed a comprehensive set of hydrogeochemical field data from spiekeroog island germany including stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfur species with a reactive transport modeling approach tritium helium groundwater ages were used to constrain the hydrogeochemistry as a function of residence time our results revealed that freshwater lenses can act as archives for anthropogenic pollution conserving the high sulfur loads associated with historic atmospheric deposition we observed two distinct hydro biogeochemical patterns which we attribute to a heterogeneous distribution of reactive organic matter those patterns were well replicated by two separate reactive transport models that considered the variations in organic matter reactivity simulation and field results demonstrated that net sulfur cycling is dominated by microbial sulfate reduction and subsequent iron sulfide precipitation in the absence of dissolved oxidants we attribute the observed high stable sulfur isotope fractionation between dissolved sulfate and sulfide of up to 67 to low 20 pmol ml 1 d 1 microbial sulfate reduction rates we show that older groundwater becomes progressively enriched in ammonium and phosphate due to the mineralization of organic matter and we speculate that lens derived nutrient fluxes may be important for the benthic zone at local groundwater discharge sites at least seasonally in spring and summer keywords atmospheric sulfur deposition microbial sulfate reduction reactive transport modeling subterranean estuary sulfur isotope fractionation 1 introduction coastal aquifers are an important global water resource as approximately one third of the world s population live close to coast lines unep 2014 barrier islands present a specific type of coastal aquifers with the associated freshwater lenses fwl usually being the sole natural freshwater reservoir

2004 who identified aerobic respiration and microbial iron reduction to be the two main respiratory pathways for organic matter om degradation at the boundaries of a fwl at sapelo island georgia furthermore bryan et al 2017 reported oxic to nitrate reducing conditions in a fwl at rottnest island western australia to govern om mineralization while whitaker and smart 2007 and more recently seibert et al 2018 reported studies where microbially mediated sulfate reduction msr was an important pathway for om mineralization in the deeper sections of their investigated fwls in the northern bahamas and spiekeroog island germany respectively msr results in the production of dissolved sulfide which might react further in conjunction with the chemical reduction of iron oxides thereby leading to the formation of sulfur intermediates and the precipitation of iron sulfides berner 1970 1984 schoonen 2004 rickard and morse 2005 moreover re oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds is

multiple geochemical processes and physical transport processes affecting sulfur cycling the provenance and concentrations of the various sulfur species can be ambiguous therefore tracking the partitioning of stable sulfur isotopes has shown to provide a valuable mechanistic tool to further constrain processes and rates involved in sulfur cycling e g kaplan and rittenberg 1964 rees 1973

et al 2012 druhan et al 2012 2014 hubbard et al 2014 seibert et al 2017 yet sulfur cycling and associated isotope dynamics within fwls and also more generally in coastal aquifers has remained largely

while to our knowledge so far no study has targeted the effect on the isotope hydrobiogeochemistry of a fwl an in depth understanding of biogeochemical processes in fwls is also essential because fresh groundwater from these lenses passes through the subterranean estuary ste moore 1999 with potential implications for associated element transformations and fluxes in the benthic zone moore 2010 some of the fresh groundwater derived solutes may ultimately end up in the ocean and sustain metal carbon and nutrient fluxes from land to sea e g hays and ullman 2007 weinstein et al 2011 tait et al

specific chemical fluxes originate from fresh submarine groundwater discharge fsgd or from saline re circulation robinson et al 2018 reactive transport models rtm are increasingly used as a tool to improve the mechanistic understanding of groundwater systems and to quantify chemical fluxes and rates of biogeochemical reactions that occur within these systems and at their interfaces however applications to better understand groundwater composition in coastal settings are still very limited e g spiteri et al 2006 2008 jung et al 2009 robinson et al 2009 roy et al 2011 colombani et al 2014 colombani et al 2015 and so far no rtm study has investigated the combined hydrogeochemical and isotopic dynamics in a barrier island fwl the overall aim of the present study was to perform an in depth analysis and quantification of biogeochemical processes in a barrier island fwl using spiekeroog island in northwestern germany as a representative example a reactive transport model approach was developed and applied to an existing comprehensive field data set hydrogeochemical data were complemented by groundwater age data and stable sulfur isotope analysis for dissolved sulfate and sulfide for selected groundwater samples the specific objectives of our study were i to understand and quantify the biogeochemical reactions and associated isotopic signatures governing the sedimentary sulfur cycle in the spiekeroog island fwl ii to elucidate the impact of historic variations in atmospheric sulfur deposition on the observed biogeochemical patterns and iii to evaluate the role of the fwl for biogeochemical fluxes to the marine environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the main fwl of the barrier island spiekeroog germany was selected for this study fig 1 the island is located in the southern north sea and stretches 9 8 km from west to east it has a maximum width of 2 3 km and the estimated surface area is 21 3 km2 streif 1990 the western part of spiekeroog island is inhabited while the remaining part called ostplate is uninhabited and protected by the wadden sea national park of lower saxony the mean high and low water levels are 1 39 m above sea level masl and 1 33 m below sea level mbsl respectively and the tidal range is 2 72 m annual means from 1995 to 2015 federal waterways and shipping administration wsv 2016 spiekeroog island was formed as a result of the aggregation of marine and aeolian sands the dune arc in the west encompasses primary and secondary dunes of up to 25 m in height röper et al 2012 pliocene pleistocene and holocene deposits comprise fine to coarse grained sands up to a depth of 60 to 40 mbsl they are underlain by a clay layer with a thickness ranging from 1 5 to 15 m oldenburg east frisian water association oowv 2009 deposits at greater depth consist of pliocene sands with local entrapments of peat the clay layer hydraulically separates an upper fresh and a lower saline aquifer calcite prevails in the form of calcareous shell debris in the aquifer seibert et al 2018 further information regarding the geology at spiekeroog island is presented in röper et al 2012 2013 the main fwl resides in the upper freshwater aquifer and started to evolve 350 years ago considering the age of the oldest dune sediments sindowski 1970 seibert et al 2018 a maximum vertical thickness of 45 to 50 m is reached in the center of the fwl apparent groundwater ages as determined by the tritium helium method termed 3h 3he age in the following ranged between 4 and 51 years generally increasing with depth seibert et al 2018 groundwater is abstracted for drinking water production by six pumping wells fig 1 average screen depth varies from 11 to 3 mbsl with total annual abstraction rates of 154 000 m3 a oowv 2009 the annual rainfall of 800 mm a oowv 2012 and estimated groundwater recharge rates of 300 400 mm a röper et al 2012 are similar to other frisian islands compare seibert et al 2018 based on these recharge rate estimates and taking into account a total recharge area of 4 31 km2 i e the total area with a surface elevation 3 masl the estimated annual fresh groundwater recharge for the main fwl is 1 300 000 1 700 000 m3 a 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis groundwater samples were collected from 14 monitoring wells in the west fig 1 a and b wells average screen depths from 43 to 6 mbsl in 2011 röper et al 2012 2014 reckhardt et al 2015 and 2016 seibert et al 2018 in addition seibert et al 2018 installed two shallow monitoring wells at a separate fwl at the ostplate in 2016 fig 1 well dn a and dn b screened in 1 5 mbsl and 1 5 masl respectively to obtain samples of oxic near surface groundwater from an aquifer of presumably similar characteristics a submersible pump eijkelkamp tauchpumpe gigant flow rate 2 l min was used for groundwater sampling and a hach hq 40d multi device equipped with sampling probes that were connected to a flow cell was employed to measure field parameters i e electric conductivity redox potential ph dissolved oxygen and temperature field tests were conducted to determine bicarbonate merck carbonate hardness test dissolved sulfide and ammonium concentrations visocolor eco tests and a pf 12 photometric device subsequently samples for major ions dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic matter dom analyses were collected only groundwater samples with a charge balance 5 were considered for further evaluation groundwater samples from the main fwl presented in this study have electric conductivities and chloride concentrations 600 µs cm and 2 5 mmol l respectively a more detailed overview of the sampling procedures and analytical methods is provided in seibert et al 2018 for the determination of stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfate δ34s so4 2 and sulfide δ34s h2s sample volumes of 5 l were collected once from all wells in september 2016 dissolved sulfide species were quantitatively fixed using a 20 znac solution and after filtering the zns precipitate 24 48 h after sampling the remaining sample was used to quantitatively precipitate baso4 the latter step was carried out by lowering the solution ph to 3 by the addition of hcl heating the samples to 60 c and adding an excess of a 5 bacl2 solution cf seibert et al 2019 precipitates were used for stable sulfur isotope analysis at the leibniz institute of baltic sea research iow by means of c irmms employing a thermo flash 2000 ea elemental analyzer coupled to a thermo finnigan mat 253 gas mass spectrometer via a thermo

2019 2 3 re construction of historic groundwater recharge compositions groundwater recharging the fwl originates from precipitation its composition is not only governed by interactions with soils in the vadose zone but also the atmosphere in this way anthropogenic sulfur emissions can have a strong impact on the ph and dissolved sulfate concentrations of precipitation to investigate the effect of such pollution on the regional atmospheric sulfur deposition sulfate concentrations in historic precipitation at the neighboring island norderney were evaluated results show a four fold sulfate concentration decrease between 1985 and 2016 nlwkn 2016 fig 2 a while chloride concentrations demonstrate no clear temporal trend fig si 3 1b therefore it was thought to be important to consider time varying sulfate concentrations in the groundwater recharge during reactive transport modeling to estimate historic groundwater recharge sulfate concentrations at spiekeroog island 1985 2016 sulfate concentrations in precipitation at norderney island were used and concentrated by a factor of 3 87 corresponding to the ratio of mean chloride concentrations in young groundwater at spiekeroog island 1 45 mmol l a wells seibert et al 2018 and precipitation at norderney island 0 38 mmol l nlwkn 2016 as no further historic data on sulfate concentrations in groundwater recharge were available for spiekeroog island the historic sulfate concentration trend in groundwater recharge that was re constructed for a research site in oostrum netherlands fig 2b after zhang et al 2013 was used by scaling the long term record from that site to the previously estimated groundwater recharge sulfate concentrations si 3 this allowed to determine a plausible sulfate recharge concentration for the entire simulation period i e from 1917 to 2016 fig 2c the concentration of the other important constituents of the groundwater recharge composition i e major ions ph temperature was assumed to be constant over time and obtained by using mean values of very young groundwater 4 a well 28 a and 30 a fig 1 si 3 mean nitrate and oxygen concentrations which were virtually absent at all a wells were retrieved from near surface groundwater at the ostplate well dn a fig 1 seibert et al 2018 since no further data on regional stable sulfur isotope signatures neither in rain nor in groundwater exist a δ34s signature of about 8 vs v cdt was used for all sulfate in groundwater recharge based on isotopic analysis of precipitation collected in oldenburg germany reckhardt et al 2017 oldenburg is 80 km distant to spiekeroog island the final re constructed historic groundwater recharge composition is listed in table si 3 1 2 4 reactive transport modeling 2 4 1 modeling approach while the groundwater flow dynamics of fwls near the freshwater marine interface are complex groundwater flow in the central parts of hydrogeologically relatively homogenous barrier island fwl s such as spiekeroog island largely follows a continuous downward movement driven by groundwater recharge assuming the absence of steep lateral geochemical gradients and of significant transverse mixing we approximated the biogeochemical transport processes through a relatively simple 1 d approach in order to account for the field observed geochemical heterogeneity two separate models were constructed one representing a less reactive model termed lrm and one presenting a more reactive model termed mrm flow path respectively the reactive multicomponent transport model code pht3d prommer et al 2003 was adopted to study the biogeochemical reactions and the evolution of the stable sulfur isotope patterns in the fwl pht3d couples the transport simulator mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and the geochemical model phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 groundwater flow was simulated with modflow harbaugh et al 2000 prior to the reactive transport simulations the longitudinal dispersivity was set to 2 m with a mean groundwater recharge rate of 350 mm a röper et al 2012 and a total porosity of 0 35 seibert et al 2018 the pore water velocity was 1 m a the length of the 1d model was therefore set to 51 m in line with the oldest measured 3h 3he age of 51 a seibert et al 2018 the total simulation time was set to 100 years starting in 1916 with the first 49 years serving as spin up period re constructed groundwater recharge compositions for the years 1917 to 2016 cf section 2 3 table si 3 1 were applied as time varying annually changing inflow solutions 2 4 2 biogeochemical reaction network the biogeochemical reaction network for the spiekeroog fwl simulations was defined by modifying the standard phreeqc database phreeqc dat importantly all nitrogen iron and sulfur species were decoupled from the thermodynamic redox equilibrium consequently all redox reactions relating to the oxidation of organic matter and involving nitrate iron oxide and sulfate reduction were simulated kinetically by coupling organic matter oxidation rates to the corresponding electron accepting processes and considering the appropriate reaction stoichiometries table 1 this was necessary in order to separately track the fate of the sulfur isotopes 32s and 34s and to determine the spatio temporal evolution of the stable sulfur isotope ratios the modified database was carefully validated by comparing simulation results of organic carbon oxidation via the consumption of single electron acceptors with corresponding results of models employing a thermodynamic database si 1 within the spiekeroog fwl mineralization of organic carbon oc via the microbial consumption of different electron acceptors is the main driver for the development of the observed redox zonation as in most aquifer systems the primary redox reactions associated with the oxidation of oc were implemented in the simulations using the following irreversible kinetic reaction roc 1 r oc r ox r nit r iro r sul where rox rnit riro and rsul correspond to the organic carbon degradation rates related to oxygen nitrate iron oxides and sulfate respectively table 1 rates computed for the oxidation step were coupled to the corresponding reduction reactions using the reaction stoichiometry shown in table 1 for degrading om the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 was applied consistent with earlier comparable modelling studies e g sharma et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 seibert et al 2016 the rates of the primary redox reactions involving sedimentary organic carbon soc were assumed not to explicitly depend on soc concentrations and it was assumed that soc would not deplete over the simulation period however variations in soc reactivity which could result from the variations in soc abundance were indirectly considered through the reaction rate constants associated with the primary redox reactions iron sulfide fes precipitation as well as ammonium re oxidation were implemented as kinetically controlled secondary reactions table 1 furthermore calcite and siderite were included as equilibrium phases methanogenesis was not considered as no methane was detected with the exception of three wells where very low methane concentrations 3 17 µmol l were found similarly no manganese oxides were included as the measured dissolved mn profiles suggested that mn was not playing a substantial role for redox cycling in the spiekeroog fwl seibert et al 2018 however it cannot be completely excluded that mn reduction is masked by the rapid precipitation of dissolved mn as mnco3 i e rhodochrosite seibert et al 2018 2 4 3 stable sulfur isotope signatures stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfate and sulfide were modeled by tracking light and heavy sulfur species i e 32s and 34s separately as described earlier by prommer et al 2009 druhan et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and seibert et al 2017 concentrations of the respective isotopes of the sulfur species were combined to calculate isotope ratios applying the common δ notation with respect to the international v cdt standard 2 δ 34 s v cdt 34 s 32 s sample 34 s 32 s v cdt 1 1000 where 34s 32s sample is the modelled ratio of isotopically light and heavy sulfur and 34s 32s v cdt corresponds to the stable sulfur isotope ratio of v cdt i e 0 0441626 ding et al 2001 stable sulfur isotope signatures of remaining sulfate and produced sulfide are affected by isotope fractionation during msr as lighter 32so4 2 molecules are preferentially consumed by dissimilatory sulfate reducers e g harrison and thode 1958 chambers and trudinger 1979 to account for this kinetic isotope effect on evolving stable sulfur isotope signatures during organic carbon oxidation via msr the reduction rate of light sulfate was modeled as e g jørgensen 1979 3 r 32 so 4 r so 4 c 32 so 4 c 32 so 4 c 34 so 4 where r so 4 is the overall msr rate table 1 and c 32 so 4 and c 34 so 4 correspond to the concentrations of light and heavy sulfate respectively the reduction rate of heavy sulfate was computed as 4 r 34 so 4 r so 4 c 34 so 4 c 32 so 4 c 34 so 4 ε 1000 1 where ε is the isotope enrichment factor e g hoefs 2018 which was adjusted during model calibration until a good match between modeled and observed δ34s so4 2 and δ34s h2s signatures was achieved r 32 so 4 and r 34 so 4 were coupled to the reaction stoichiometry for organic carbon oxidation via msr table 1 consuming 32so4 and 34so4 and producing h2 32s and h2 34s respectively furthermore the overall fes precipitation rate rfes was scaled to the relative concentrations of h2 32s and h2 34s as isotope fractionation between 32s and 34s is expected to be very small during iron sulfide precipitation price and shieh 1979 böttcher et al 1998b 5 r fe i s ppt r fes c h 2 i s c h 2 32 s c h 2 34 s where i corresponds to the light 32s or heavy 34s sulfur isotope respectively and c h 2 32 s and c h 2 34 s are the concentrations of light and heavy dissolved sulfide respectively 2 4 4 model calibration the hydrochemical data for two depth profiles as measured in 2011 2014 and 2016 were used to constrain the numerical model development and calibration during this process the simulated reaction network was successively revised and the various rate constants of the biogeochemical reactions were adjusted through a trial and error approach until a good agreement between simulation results and the corresponding field observations was achieved the comparison between simulation results and observations was undertaken with respect to corresponding groundwater age rather than travel distance e g the hydrochemical concentrations at a monitoring well that showed to have a 3h 3he age of 51 a were compared with the simulation results obtained for x 51 m where the simulated 3h 3he age was also 51a the parameters yielding best fits for the two models are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion the model development and calibration process allowed the identification of a plausible biogeochemical reaction network for which the final simulation results for both the lrm and mrm agree very well with the field observations fig 3 importantly this includes a good agreement between observed and modeled sulfate concentrations fig 3a for both simulated flow paths as well as the stable sulfur isotope patterns fig 3c and d overall the process of model development substantially improved the understanding of the prevailing biogeochemical reactions and specifically the cycling of sulfur species within a barrier island fwl the following discussion of results is focused on the new insights that were derived from our model based data interpretation 3 1 freshwater lenses as an archive for atmospheric sulfur pollution trends and the magnitude of observed sulfate concentrations vs depth and 3h 3he age varied among sampling locations both the trends and the differences can be convincingly explained through the occurrence of reactive processes under the assumption that reaction rates varied spatially as a result of variations in om reactivity i e through the conceptualization as lrm and mrm observed sulfate concentrations show a steadily increasing trend with increasing 3h 3he age along the less reactive flow path open blue squares fig 3a while data along the more reactive flow path show a decreasing trend of sulfate concentrations for samples with a 3h 3he age 10 years remarkably similar concentration trends were also noticed for fresh groundwater ec 600 µs cm collected at the neighboring island langeoog full symbols fig 3a data collected by houben et al 2014 in comparison most of the observed sulfate concentrations are below or clearly below simulated sulfate concentrations black line fig 3a that were obtained with a non reactive model variant that employed the re constructed sulfate signal fig 2c while all geochemical reactions were switched off the differences between the observed sulfate concentrations and those from the non reactive simulations were explained by the lrm and mrm variants which included msr albeit at different rates the increasing trend of the observed sulfate concentrations along the less reactive flow path is likely the result of the elevated sulfate loads in historic groundwater recharge associated with the higher atmospheric sulfur deposition that peaked in the 1960 s as such the fwl acts as an archive for historic atmospheric sulfur pollution on the other hand alternative conceptual models fail to explain the observations and can be excluded for example mixing with seawater as an explanation for the increasing sulfate concentrations at greater depth and with increasing 3h 3he age can be rejected because i all samples have electric conductivities and chloride concentrations 600 µs cm and 2 5 mmol l respectively and ii groundwater so4 2 cl ratios mmol l 1 mmol l 1 are higher 0 08 0 25 fig si 4 1 table si 4 1 than in seawater 0 06 seibert et al 2018 this indicates a non marine source of excess sulfate also gypsum and anhydrite can be excluded as potential sulfate sources in the quartz sand dominated aquifer 3 2 the role of organic matter reactivity for microbial sulfate reduction the differing trends in the observed groundwater sulfate concentrations compare red and blue symbols fig 3a are most plausibly explained by a heterogeneous distribution of om abundance and reactivity in the otherwise homogeneous aquifer and with om mineralization being the rate limiting step this appears to result in spatial variations of sulfate reduction rates srr and is consistent with an earlier study by jakobsen and postma 1994 for similar homogeneous sandy aquifers where they also found significant differences in om reactivity and srr over short distances simulated srr for the lrm and mrm reach maximum values of 5 10 3 nmol ml 1 d 1 and 15 10 3 nmol ml 1 d 1 respectively fig 3e the model derived srr are orders of magnitude lower than srr in most marine sediments where srr may range between 1 and up to 7000 nmol cm 3 d 1 table 3 e g jørgensen 1977 hines and lyons 1982 thode andersen and jørgensen 1989 thamdrup et al 1994 thamdrup and canfield 1996 habicht and canfield 1997 kristensen et al 2000 böttcher et al 2000 2004a wilms et al 2006 wortmann 2006 however much more similar srr 4 10 2 up to 1 nmol ml 1 d 1 were reported for other pleistocene aquifers by jakobsen and postma 1994 while they reported up to two orders of magnitude lower srr for tertiary and cretaceous aquifers table 3 our findings are thus in line with the general observations that om abundance and reactivity in aquifers exhibits a major control on srr and usually is much lower than in coastal marine environments e g rye et al 1981 middelburg 1989 jakobsen and postma 1994 observed sulfide concentrations were substantially lower than expected from a complete stoichiometric transformation of sulfate to dissolved sulfide during msr dashed lines fig 3b a good fit between simulated and observed dissolved sulfide concentrations was however achieved by considering fes precipitation in the reaction network solid lines fig 3b this agrees with earlier studies by jakobsen and postma 1999 who detected pyrite formation in the anoxic zone of a sandy freshwater aquifer and magaritz and luzier 1985 who observed pyrite formation beneath the freshwater saltwater interface in a coastal dunes aquifer reaction of sulfide with organic matter to form organic sulfur compounds may present a further potential sink for dissolved sulfide e g rudd et al 1986 marnette et al 1992 but depends on both the om content and reactivity versus dissolved sulfide and further sulfur intermediate species 3 3 isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction observed δ34s so4 2 signatures become progressively heavier along the flow path and thus with increasing 3h 3he age fig 3c this behavior is well matched by the model simulations and consistent with the occurrence of msr associated stable sulfur isotope fractionation which leaves the residual sulfate successively more enriched in 34s kaplan and rittenberg 1964 nakai and jensen 1964 this is especially pronounced in the case of the more reactive flow path where the remaining sulfate fraction is 10 of the initial sulfate concentration compare black and red lines fig 3a and simulated stable sulfur isotope signatures approach values of up to 79 vs v cdt in the oldest groundwater fig 3c equally pronounced increases of δ34s so4 2 signatures were previously found under closed system conditions in marine sediments e g böttcher et al 1999 claypool 2004 hartmann and nielsen 2012 and aquifers e g massmann et al 2003 both observed and simulated δ34s so4 2 signatures of residual sulfate on the less reactive flow path are significantly lower fig 3c because less sulfate has been reduced fig 3a modeled δ34s so4 2 signatures slightly overestimate the field observed signatures when applying a δ34s so4 2 signature of 8 vs v cdt for recharging sulfate blue solid line fig 3c while the employment of a lower enrichment factor to fit the δ34s so4 2 signatures would fail to match the observed δ34s h2s signatures fig si 2 3 this discrepancy points toward isotopically lighter sulfate that previously recharged the fwl pollution derived sulfate in atmospheric deposition typically has isotope signatures ranging between 3 to 9 vs v cdt krouse and mayer 2000 and to account for the impact of pollution derived sulfate on the developing δ34s so4 2 signatures in the fwl complementary simulations were carried out where the relative isotopic contributions of a background sulfate and a pollution sulfate endmember were considered for simplicity it was assumed that present day sulfate concentrations in groundwater recharge correspond to the background sulfate endmember with a δ34s so4 2 signature of 8 vs v cdt similar to δ34s so4 2 signatures determined for sulfate in young near surface groundwater at the main fwl 10 years 8 to 9 vs v cdt well 29 a and 30 a and a separate fwl at the ostplate 1 year 9 vs v cdt well dn a seibert et al 2019 concentrations of excess sulfate were consequently calculated and a δ34s so4 2 signature of 3 vs v cdt for the pollution derived sulfate endmember resulted in a reasonable model fit of the field observations blue dotted line fig 3c this adopted isotopic signature is at the lower end of the δ34s so4 2 range reported by krouse and mayer 2000 note that the transient isotopic signal for sulfate also affects the δ34s so4 2 signature of the mrm simulation as well as the δ34s h2s signatures on both flow paths which are slightly lower compared to the situation when sulfate with a constant isotopic signature of 8 vs v cdt recharges the fwl the outlier δ34s so4 2 signature of 8 3 vs v cdt in young groundwater fig 3c 4 years well 28 a is possibly explained by a local release of sulfate from pyrite oxidation and probably related to the temporary penetration of dissolved oxygen or nitrate into anoxic zones si 5 this demonstrates that pyrite oxidation locally may contribute isotopically depleted sulfate to the groundwater sulfate pool dissolved sulfide is noticeably depleted in 34s compared to the remaining sulfate fig 3c and d the observed isotope fractionation between dissolved sulfate and sulfide ranged between 31 and 67 table si 4 1 and enrichment factors of 65 and 28 were adopted for sulfur isotope fractionation during msr in the lrm and mrm respectively to fit the field observations table 2 instead employing a single enrichment factor in our simulations failed to deliver an acceptable model fit with the observed stable sulfur isotope patterns fig si 2 2 these maximum detected isotope fractionations rank among the highest values ever observed in natural environments table 4 while high isotope fractionation usually is characteristic for some euxinic basins e g werne et al 2003 johnston et al 2008 deep sea sediments e g rudnicki et al 2001 wortmann et al 2001 böttcher et al 2004b and stratified lakes e g zerkle et al 2010 canfield et al 2010 reports of similar isotope fractionations in aquifers are limited with the florida aquifer u s a rye et al 1981 and the lincolnshire limestone aquifer england bottrell et al 2000 being some of the rare examples although groundwater was sampled from the same aquifer the deviation between the two enrichment factors further underpins the distinctly different biogeochemical characteristics of the two conceptualized flow paths we attribute this high isotope fractionation mainly to msr which agrees with studies by rudnicki et al 2001 and wortmann et al 2001 who observed isotope fractionation up to 77 during msr in deep marine sediments in the absence of intense sulfur re cycling this was later confirmed by sim et al 2011a and canfield et al 2010 who could demonstrate that msr alone can produce isotope fractionation up to 70 besides msr sulfur re oxidation in combination with bacterial disproportionation of sulfur intermediates is associated with substantial stable sulfur isotope fractionation canfield and thamdrup 1994 cypionka et al 1998 habicht et al 1998 böttcher et al 2001 2005 as dissolved oxygen and nitrate were absent in the deeper anoxic zones disproportionation coupled to repeated sulfur re oxidation is unlikely to be the primary cause for the observed high isotope fractionation c f donahue et al 2008 wortmann et al 2001 however it may still have played a minor role given that sulfur intermediates like elemental sulfur are produced upon oxidation of sulfide by fe e g thamdrup et al 1994 the higher fractionation factor for the lrm compared to the mrm is in line with the previously observed inverse correlation between cellular srr and stable sulfur isotope fractionation e g harrison and thode 1958 kaplan and rittenberg 1964 sim et al 2011b wing and halevy 2014 however we recognize that the understanding of the complex and multiple processes impacting the magnitude of isotope fractionation during msr like srr sulfate concentrations or genera type and strain specific factors is still incomplete e g harrison and thode 1958 nakai and jensen 1964 brüchert et al 2001 habicht and canfield 2001 habicht et al 2002 wing and halevy 2014 bradley et al 2016 recent discoveries indicate moreover that the composition of the organic donors and intracellular concentrations of metabolites may impact both the cell specific srr and thereby the magnitude of sulfur isotope discrimination sim et al 2011a b wing and halevy 2014 covering most of the large range of isotope fractionation observed in natural environments table 4 3 4 chemical fluxes at the land ocean interface coupled to organic matter mineralization resulting from om mineralization groundwater in the spiekeroog fwl becomes progressively enriched in ammonium and phosphate with increasing residence time symbols fig 2g and h employing the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 to define the stoichiometric ratio of the elements released during om mineralization in the model simulations resulted in a reasonable agreement between simulated and observed ammonium and phosphate concentrations respectively however some deviations clearly exist which is not surprising given that both phosphate and ammonium concentrations may have been affected by sorption reactions e g sorption of ammonium to cation exchanger sites surface complexation of phosphate which were neglected in the model on the other hand the discrepancies could also indicate that the composition of the degrading om varies within the aquifer among the different geologic layers section 2 1 locally phosphate may also have been released in conjunction with the reductive dissolution of iron oxides and the associated loss of sorption capacity as illustrated in fig 2f bicarbonate concentrations show a decreasing concentration trend with increasing 3h 3he age despite the constant production of carbon dioxide from om mineralization the implementation of calcite and siderite precipitation in the models successfully lowered simulated inorganic carbon concentrations in close agreement with the field observations while not confirmed through mineralogical data siderite precipitation in the spiekeroog aquifer seems plausible it is also consistent with an earlier study of magaritz and luzier 1985 who reported the formation of siderite in a sandy coastal dunes aquifer at coos bay oregon it is worth noting that siderite precipitation in conjunction with iron sulfide precipitation also scavenged most dissolved iron in the simulations fig si 2 1 ongoing iron oxide reduction and its rates are therefore difficult to track on the basis of dissolved iron concentrations alone as already previously noticed by van breukelen et al 2004 mean ammonium and phosphate concentrations in discharging groundwater are 50 90 µmol l and 6 9 µmol l respectively assuming that fsgd is a mixture of groundwater with different 3h 3he ages those concentrations are similar to n and p concentrations in freshwater endmembers of other coastal aquifers moore 2010 and references cited herein adjacent seawater at a monitoring station in the back barrier area of spiekeroog island showed high dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorous dip concentrations during winter and autumn of 30 60 µmol l and 1 µmol l respectively while nutrients were depleted in the seawater column during spring dip and summer din grunwald et al 2010 thus fsgd may locally present a relevant and constant source of nutrients to the ste especially during spring and summer of course chemical fluxes from the fwl to the ste might be further modified by reactive processes prior to their discharge to the sea for example phosphate may be scavenged from solution via iron oxide precipitation and ammonium may undergo nitrification in the biogeochemically active freshwater seawater mixing zones of the ste charette and sholkovitz 2002 slomp and van cappellen 2004 charette et al 2005 mcallister et al 2015 model and field results further indicate that fsgd has no significant impact on the carbonate chemistry of the adjacent sea as bicarbonate concentrations 2 5 2 7 mmol l and ph 8 1 8 2 were comparable in both endmembers 4 conclusions in this study we conducted an in depth analysis of the biogeochemical processes that occur in a barrier island fwl with a particular focus on sulfur cycling we developed and used a reactive transport modeling approach to analyze a comprehensive set of field data from spiekeroog island germany which included tritium helium measurements and stable sulfur isotopes signatures for dissolved sulfide and sulfate we successively improved the rtm until it could plausibly explain the spatial variations in ion concentrations and isotopic patterns which allowed us to unravel the governing interacting processes that affect the water chemistry in the studied fwl our analysis illustrates that organic matter and its mineralization is the primary driver for biogeochemical changes in the spiekeroog island fwl and that overall the sedimentary sulfur cycle is largely governed by slow microbially mediated sulfate reduction 20 pmol ml 1 d 1 and iron sulfide precipitation the modeled sulfate reduction rates are low compared to coastal marine sediments but similar to rates reported for aquifers this underlines the important role of the electron donor i e om availability reactivity for the sediment biogeochemistry the reactive transport simulations reproduced the observed sulfur isotope patterns including the large isotope fractionation of up to 67 vs v cdt between dissolved sulfide and sulfate which is mainly attributed to microbially mediated sulfate reduction this is in line with recent studies demonstrating that microbes can generate sulfur isotope fractionation considerably exceeding a previously assumed maximum of 47 wortmann et al 2001 rudnicki et al 2001 brunner and bernasconi 2005 canfield et al 2010 sim et al 2011a wing and halevy 2014 moreover we demonstrated how atmospheric sulfur deposition has impacted the hydrogeochemistry of the spiekeroog island fwl by reconstructing the historic sulfur input into the fwl and by delineating reaction induced concentration changes and their spatio temporal variations from those induced by the transient input history this illustrated the role of barrier island fwls as an archive for anthropogenic sulfur emissions the here presented study enhances our understanding of the biogeochemistry in barrier island aquifers and demonstrates that it is important to quantitatively
