characterization of its types and uses it helps in determining the origin of chemical composition of groundwater and in establishing chemical relationship between water and rocks guo and wang 2004 aris et al 2007 zaporozec 1972 the geochemical composition of groundwater is mainly controlled by various processes such as weathering dissolution ion exchange and evaporation freeze and cherry 1979 appelo and postma 2005 hiscock and bense 2014 groundwater often consists of seven major chemical elements namely ca2 mg2 k na so4 hco3 and cl the concentrations of these ions in groundwater depend on the hydrochemical processes which take place within the aquifer systems prevailed in geomorphic surfaces units these geomorphic units control chemistry of groundwater as it flows from recharge zone to discharge zone groundwater at the discharge zone tends to have higher mineral composition as compared to that of the recharge zone due to longer residence time and prolong contact with the aquifer matrix freeze and cherry 1979 davis and dewiest 1966 advances in geochemical methods and approaches have aided our ability to interpret hydrochemical process leading to differentiation of geomorphic

hydrochemical parameters in each geomorphic unit can provide an excellent approach to identify the type evolution and sources of groundwater rosen and jones 1998 studies on a variety of graphical and multivariate statistical techniques have been carried out in order to facilitate the classification of waters zaporozec 1972 kshetrimayum 2015 kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 kshetrimayum and laxmi 2017 presentation of chemical analysis in graphical form makes understanding of complex groundwater system simpler and quicker collins et al 1932 piper 1953 zaporozec 1972 the commonly used graphical methods and multivariate statistical techniques in groundwater studies include stiff pattern diagram trilinear diagram durov diagram box and whisker plot scatter plots and pearson correlation pc hierarchical cluster analysis hca and factor analysis fa the current paper examines the use of these methods in characterizing the hydrochemical constituents in different geomorphic units in the dimapur valley located along the edge of the naga thrust in the indo myanmar range of northeast india 2 study area the dimapur valley which lies between 25 40 and 25 58 n latitudes and 93 49 and 93 41 e longitudes is a home to 0 379 million people as per 2011 census in nagaland state of ne india fig 1 geologically the valley is located in the northwestern side of the outermost belt of schuppen known as the naga thrust which has a strike direction of ne sw mathur and evans 1964 the valley is represented by a sub montane basin filled with quaternary sediments which was formed by coalescence of outwash fan deposits of different streams rock types and formations encountered in the region are of tertiary to quaternary period alluvium deposits consist of clay sands silts pebble and boulders and occupy large area of the valley cgwb 2013 geomorphologically the study area has been demarcated as different geomorphic units like denudational hills dh piedmont zone pz flood plain fp and alluvial plain ap newmai and jami 2010 hydrogeologically groundwater is occurred under water table condition in shallow aquifers while in deeper aquifers it occurs under semi confined to confined conditions chisi and newmai 2013 the regional groundwater flow direction is from south to north with water table elevation ranging from 123 m above mean sea level amsl to 179 m amsl the water table below ground level bgl varies from 1 52 mbgl to 10 75 mbgl kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 the thickness of alluvium deposit in the valley exceeds 122 m the yields of groundwater in tubewells vary from 10 m3 day to 45 m3 day in the valley good prospect of groundwater is found in open wells constructed at 5 m 20 m depth and tubewells constructed at 100 m 300 m depth nitovi and asingbow 2013 cgwb 2013 numerous seasonal rivers flow across the valley in which the dhansiri and the chathe or diphu rivers are the main rivers 3 methodology a total of 275 shallow groundwater samples were collected from 50 well locations during pre and post monsoon seasons fig 1 out of these sites 4 14 18 14 sites represent geomorphic units of dh pz fp and ap respectively for both seasons physico chemical parameters like ph tds ec and temperature were measured on site by using the portable field kit model no hi 9811 5 hanna instruments major cations ca2 mg2 k na fe and mn were analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes model arcos spectro germany anions like cl was determined by standard agno3 titration hco3 and co3 were determined by titration method using hcl in the field and so4 was determined by using digital nephelo turbidity meter model 132 systronics india samples were analyzed in different laboratories including indian institute of technology powai india and the analytical error using charge balance error cbe formula apha 1998 appelo and postma 2005 is calculated as less than 4 5 graphical presentations trilinear diagram expanded durov diagram gibbs diagram stiff and scatter plots were prepared using aquachem software 5 1 version multivariate statistical methods cluster analysis factor analysis and correlation matrix were carried out using ibm spss statistic 20 4 results 4 1 elementary geochemistry the physico chemical parameters and statistical summary of the groundwater samples are presented in tables 1 and 2 the ph values range from 4 1 to 7 5 and 4 9 to 6 7 in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively mean ph values 6 2 and 5 9 of both seasons suggest neutral water type todd 2005 tds values range from 20 mg l to 320 mg l and 30 mg l to 320 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively indicating fresh water as the values are below 1000 mg l carroll 1962 average temperatures of the samples are 24 c and 27 8 c in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively co3 is almost absent in all the samples concentrations of major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 cl and hco3 in pre and post seasons are below who limits however fe and mn are found elevated 6 84 mg l and 1 27 mg l and 7 73 mg l and 0 60 mg l in post and post monsoon respectively in most of the samples the values of hardness vary from 113 9 mg l to 571 6 mg l in pre monsoon and 34 3 mg l to 233 6 mg l in post monsoon indicating slightly hard water the degree of hardness decreases in post monsoon indicating dilution of ca2 and mg2 divalent metallic cations through infiltration of meteoric water the order of dominance of ions in pre monsoon is ca2 hco3 mg2 na cl so4 mn k fe and in post monsoon it is hco3 mg2 cl so4 na ca2 k fe mn 4 2 graphical interpretation method graphical interpretation is a basic tool in hydrochemical studies as they provide quick summarization of water quality data zaporozec 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 hem 1989 the principles of graphical interpretation methods are based on the relationships of ions or group of ions forming a chemical type of water zaporozec 1972 some of these methods are presented in figs 2 4 trilinear diagram hill 1940 piper 1944 is used to infer the type of hydrochemical facies and groundwater evolution hem 1989 pre monsoon is represented by two types of facies ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl while post monsoon is characterized by three types of facies ca2 mg2 hco3 ca2 mg2 na hco3 and na cl fig 2 dh is reflected by ca2 mg2 cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively in pre monsoon pz is represented by ca2 mg2 hco3 facies which alters to ca2 mg2 na hco3 facies in post monsoon fp is denoted by ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl facies in pre monsoon and ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 na hco3 in post monsoon respectively suggesting progressive mixing of ions in ap facies are dominated by ca2 mg2 cl type during pre monsoon which alters to ca2 mg2 na hco3 and na cl facies during post monsoon indicating ionization process along the flow path the evolution of groundwater can be studied following chebotarev 1955 sequence chebotarev proposed a geochemical classification of water based on anion occurrence and prevalence as they are regarded as independent ingredients the sequence correlates with the increasing distance along the flow path and an increasing age of water this anion sequence also corresponds to an increase in dissolved solids concentration as evident from this mapping fig 3a and b the study area is classified as class i hco3 ii hco3 cl iii cl hco3 v cl which covers 40 28 8 24 and 40 20 8 12 of the total area in pre and post monsoon respectively stiff patterns 1951 are useful in making a rapid visual comparison among waters from different sources as the area of the polygonal shape increases the concentrations of ions also increase fetter 2001 also the pattern tends to maintain its shape upon concentration or dilution thus usually allowing tracing the flow paths on maps stiff 1951 as suggested by this diagram fig 4 dh and pz are characterized by dominance of hco3 while fp and ap are represented by cl the diagram also indicates that presence of dissolved solids is more in pz and ap groundwater than other units in both the seasons expanded durov diagram burdon and mazloun 1958 lloyd 1965 is used to infer hydrochemical processes and has distinct advantage over trilinear diagram as it provides better display of various hydrochemical types and evolutionary stages llyod and heathcote 1985 durov diagram fig 5 a and b reveals that most of the samples in all the geomorphic units are signified by initial stage and simple ion mixing process however in ap the end member is characterized by reversed ion exchange process indicating old stage of groundwater evolution gibbs 1970 diagram is used to understand the natural mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry including dominances of rainfall rock weathering evaporation and precipitation gibbs diagrams fig 6 a and b reveal that the chemical composition of groundwater is primarily controlled by rock weathering process in both seasons box and whisker plot renders an excellent summary of five important statistical aspects of water quality parameters along with the identification of outliers usepa 1998 box and whisker plots are usually placed side by side to compare and contrast groups of hydrochemical data and are very useful for comparing individual water quality constituents among different settings alley 1993 fig 7 a and b represent box and whisker plots of pre and post monsoon seasons in dh pz fp and ap units respectively these plots indicate variation in statistical values in terms of ion concentrations before and after the monsoon as evident from fig 7a and b mg2 has the highest mean concentration value among ions in pre monsoon while ca2 and hco3 dominate the post monsoon season in dh pz has the highest mean concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in pre monsoon but hco3 dominantes the mean in post monsoon the similar trend is observed in fp and ap dominant reactions and the geochemical processes that control the groundwater chemistry can also be identified using molar ratios of ions the geochemical variation in ionic concentration in groundwater can easily be understood when they are plotted along an x y coordinate guler et al 2002 scatter plots of various ions suggest linear relations among them implying similar sources of occurrence and effects of monsoon in groundwater composition in all the units scatter plots of na cl in both the seasons fig 8 a and b show all the samples plots near 1 1 linear line indicating na and cl has common natural geogenic source as evaporite encrustations in the soil kshetrimayum and thokchom 2017 scatter plots of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 for pre and post monsoon seasons are presented in fig 9 a and b respectively majority of the water samples falls above the 1 1 equiline in both the seasons indicating reverse ion exchange as the dominant processes el sayed et al 2012 4 3 multivariate statistical analysis an approach to understand the chemistry of water samples is to investigate statistical relationships among their dissolved constituents and environmental parameters such as lithology by using multivariate statistics drever 1997 multivariate statistical techniques which include hca fa and pc are effective means of manipulating interpreting and representing data concerning groundwater pollutants and geochemistry ritzi et al 1993 demlie et al 2007 koh et al 2011 4 3 1 correlation matrix correlation coefficient is commonly used to measure and establish the relationship between two variables it is a simplified statistical tool to show the degree of dependency of one variable to the other the results of correlation matrices of 12 variables from 50 samples of shallow groundwater during pre and post monsoon seasons are presented in table 3 a and b during pre monsoon strong positive correlations in cl with ca2 r 0 927 na r 0 904 and na with ca2 r 0 830 are observed in pz while in post monsoon strong positive correlations exist in cl with na r 0 865 so4 r 0 954 fe with mn r 0 963 cl with mg r 0 901 and k with hco3 r 0 990 these relations indicate groundwater reaction with clay minerals leading to exchange of na for ca2 or mg2 hem 1989 the similar correlations of these variables are observed in fp however fp is characterized by strong negative correlation in na with fe r 0 537 and so4 r 0 264 k with so4 r 0 099 and fe with cl r 0 282 mg2 r 0 162 ca2 r 0 411 in post monsoon suggesting simple mixing of dissolved ions mg2 shows negative relation with ec r 0 683 tds r 0 72 ca2 r 0 294 in pz during pre monsoon similar negative moderate correlations among these variables are observed in fp and ap implying the possibility of either dissolution or precipitation of calcite and dolomite zhang et al 2016 in ap there are strong correlations in ec with cl r 0 923 k r 0 903 mn r 0 913 na2 r 0 842 in pre monsoon indicating progressive mixing of dissolved ions moderately strong positive correlation exists in cl with k r 0 880 and mn r 0 85 implying the occurrence of late stage of ionization process kura et al 2013 similar relations among these variables are observed in ap in post monsoon ap is also characterized by negative correlations in hco3 with mn r 0 62 cl r 0 266 k r 0 091 and mn with so4 r 0 91 in post monsoon revealing late stage of ionization process in this unit strong positive correlation between fe and mn in pz during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons indicate similar source of reduction under anoxic and redox oscillating conditions postma 1985 hem 1989 postma and appelo 2000 4 3 2 factor analysis factor analysis is a commonly used statistical method to classify and simplify the data and also to find the most important variables in a dataset the results of the factor analysis for both seasons are highlighted in table 4 for both seasons three factors of eigen values 1 were identified the three factors account for a cumulative of variance 31 51 in pre monsoon and 51 44 in post monsoon seasons respectively factor 1 which explains 31 51 and 51 44 of the total variance for pre and post monsoon seasons shows very high positive loadings of tds ec ca2 na cl in pre monsoon and ec tds ca2 na cl mg2 k in post monsoon implying the occurrence of highly dissolved salts in groundwater factor 2 which accounts 25 43 and 18 69 of the total variance for both seasons shows strong negative loading of ph hco3 and so4 in both the seasons this loading may be attributed to the reaction of feldspar minerals with carbonic acid in the presence of water elango et al 2003 factor 3 reflects 14 44 and 12 35 of the total variance in both the seasons and shows high positive loading of hardness and mg2 during pre monsoon and fe and mn during post monsoon loading representing pre monsoon suggests dissolution of carbonates leading to increase in hardness while post monsoon loading indicates similar geogenic source of contamination under similar condition 4 3 3 hierarchical cluster analysis the hierarchical cluster analysis hca is used to classify hydrochemical observations so that the members of the resulting groups or subgroups are similar to each other and distinct from other groups ayenew et al 2009 hca has been proven to provide a suitable basis for objective classification of water composition guler et al 2002 kebede et al 2005 hca classifies the data in a relatively simple and direct manner and the result is presented as a dendogram which is an easily understood and familiar diagram davis 1973 13 variables ph tds ec ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 fe mn hardness and 50 groundwater sampling sites were used for hca fig 10 a and b for both the seasons dendogram pattern shows three groups having similar hydrochemical characteristics mean concentrations of hydochemical parameters of group and subgroup derived from hca is presented in table 5 in pre monsoon group 1 has 2 subgroups where subgroup 1 has 7 samples and subgroup 2 has 3 samples group 1 represents low concentration and low degree of mineralization indicating short contact time with the rock and soil glover et al 2012 group 2 samples are divided into subgroups 3 and 4 where each subgroup has 2 samples each group 2 characterizes elevated mn and hardness indicating carbonate dissolution under low ph condition group 3 samples are divided into subgroups 5 6 7 and 8 where subgroup 5 has 3 samples and rest of the subgroups has 2 samples each representing elevated tds ec ca2 and hardness similarly in post monsoon samples dendrogram shows 3 groups where group 1 has 4 subgroups group 2 has 1 subgroup and group 3 has 3 subgroups group 1 represents lower concentration of ions indicating fresh meteoric water group 2 indicates elevations of fe and mn while group 3 indicates high degree of dissolution of ions resulting in increase in hardness by and large dendogram shows increase in dissolved solids from group 1 to 3 in both the seasons and also each group comprises multiple geomorphic units 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater characterization in geomorphic units the mean ph values for dh during pre and post monsoons are 5 9 and 5 95 respectively for pz ph values are 6 8 and 6 in fp it is 6 2 and 6 while in ap it is 5 9 and 5 6 respectively overall the ph value ranges from 5 6 to 6 8 in all the geomorphic units indicating neutral and fresh water todd 2005 however in ap ph is slightly acidic 5 6 during post monsoon owing to either association of small amounts of mineral acids from sulfide sources or organic acids from decay of vegetation davis and deweist 1966 mean tds values for both seasons in pz are 135 mg l and 157 mg l respectively in fp the values are 137 mg l and 133 mg l while in ap they are 190 mg l and 164 mg l respectively tds is lowest in dh 40 mg l and higher in ap 190 mg l implying of the fact that tds value increases from recharge zone to discharge zones hem 1989 in dh and pz tds values increase from pre to post season indicating intensive mixing of ions after dilution through recharge process in fp and ap however tds reduces from pre to post season indicating reductive ionization process in the aquifers the classification of hardness of groundwater samples after sawyer and mccarty 1967 is presented in table 6 dh belongs to hard 181 mg l category in pre monsoon and becomes soft 65 mg l in post monsoon in pz groundwater is very hard 373 mg l in pre monsoon and hard 180 mg l in post monsoon in fp and ap groundwater belongs to very hard 336 mg l and 365 mg l in pre monsoon and becomes moderately hard in post monsoon 86 mg l and 81 mg l the orders of dominance of ions in dh groundwater in pre and post monsoon are ca2 hco3 cl mg2 na k mn fe so4 and hco3 na cl mg2 ca2 so4 k mn fe respectively in pz groundwater the orders are hco3 ca2 mg2 na cl fe mn so4 k and hco3 na cl so4 mg2 ca2 k fe mn in fp they are ca2 hco3 mg2 na cl so4 k fe mn and hco3 so4 mg2 cl na ca2 k fe mn in ap groundwater they are ca2 hco3 na mg2 cl so4 mn k fe and hco3 mg2 cl so4 na ca2 k mn fe these sequences indicate that groundwater in geomorphic units are characterized by recently derived meteoric water as the source of recharge generally both fe and mn are found highly elevated before monsoon and depleted after monsoon fe average concentrations in dh pz fp and ap are 0 95 mg l 11 03 mg l 6 54 mg l 4 69 mg l respectively during pre monsoon and 0 08 3 04 1 05 0 12 mg l respectively during post monsoon suggesting elevation above isi 1983 limit 0 3 mg l similarly mn elevations in dh pz fp and ap are 1 54 mg l 10 8 mg l 3 66 mg l 11 62 mg l and 0 23 mg l 0 72 mg l 0 42 mg l 0 83 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively exceeding isi 1983 base flow from discharge areas into low lying areas and recharge from rivers causes accretion of fe and mn in shallow aquifers of the region kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 hco3 concentration increases after monsoon in all the geomorphic units indicating significant groundwater recharging process through precipitation generally na and cl concentrations increase towards ap suggesting significant mineralization process away from the recharging source concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in all the units decrease from pre monsoon to post monsoon season resulting reduce in hardness 342 mg l to 80 mg l the abundance of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater indicates the prevalence of carbonate weathering such as calcite and dolomite das et al 2018 5 2 groundwater evolution hydrochemical facies back 1961 1966 provide distinct zones of dominant dissolved ions which help in understanding complex hydrochemical process the pz groundwater which indicates hco3 ca2 mg2 facies in pre monsoon alters to mixed ion facies in post monsoon suggesting process of ion mixing during pre monsoon ap groundwater reflects ca2 mg2 cl facies which evolves into mixed ion and na cl facies in post monsoon however in fp there is no significant change in terms of ion concentrations during both the seasons this could be owing to flat hydraulic gradient around the fp the evolution of end members in groundwater in both the seasons can be interpreted from trilinear diagram fig 2 where cl end members are normally observed in ap suggesting that groundwater becomes matured towards ap the chebotarev model fig 3 indicates that groundwater evolution originates from pz and process through ion mixing in fp and attains late or old stage in ap the result of durov diagram also supports the concept of groundwater evolution based on cheboratev model expanded durov diagram fig 5 suggests that dh groundwater in both the seasons is represented by recharge water from sandstone and limestone rocks exposed around the naga thrust belt the pz and ap groundwater in both the seasons are denoted by process of partial ion exchange indicating initial stage of groundwater evolution the ap groundwater in both the seasons however signifies reversed ion exchange process suggesting matured stage of groundwater evolution gibbs plots 1970 fig 6 reveal the weathering of rock forming minerals is the dominating process controlling the groundwater chemistry in all the geomorphic units the molar ratio of na cl fig 8 for both seasons suggests excess of na2 due the weathering of silicate minerals the samples plot above the 1 1 equiline and very few samples fall below the equiline suggesting addition of cl due to dissolution of salt from soils stallard and edmond 1983 scatter plot of ca2 mg2 vs so4 hco3 fig 9 further suggests silicate and carbonate weathering as the dominating source of dissolved ions datta et al 1996 rajmohan and elango 2004 2006 elango and ramesh 2006 rao 2006 kumar et al 2006 and ion exchange process cerling et al 1989 fisher and mulican 1997 in all the geomorphic units 5 3 groundwater quality groundwater quality of the study area is determined based on the concentrations of physical parameters major and minor ion concentrations table 1 the ph values of the groundwater samples were within the permissible limits 6 5 8 5 for drinking purpose who 2008 bis 1991 isi 2012 the concentration of tds in the water samples of both pre and post monsoon periods were within the permissible limits as per the tds classification indicating fresh water type calcium concentration in few samples 3 samples from pz 1 sample from fp and 3 samples from ap in pre monsoon were above the permissible limits isi 1983 similarly mg in few samples 5 each sample from pz fp and ap in pre monsoon and 2 from pz 3 each from fp and ap in post monsoon were above the permissible limit for drinking purpose isi 2012 the major anions cl so4 2 and hco3 concentrations in both seasons were within the permissible limit fe and mn concentrations exceed the permissible limits which are 0 3 mg l for fe and 0 1 mg l for mn isi 1983 in all the groundwater samples the water classification based on hardness sawyer and mccarty 1967 table 6 shows that the groundwater during pre monsoon falls in moderately hard to very hard category in which 4 belongs to moderately hard 48 shares hard and 48 contributes very hard however during post monsoon groundwater belongs to soft to hard water types in which 60 belongs to soft 32 shares moderately hard and 8 contributes hard water type water hardness is caused primarily by the presence of cations such as ca and mg and anions such as co3 hco3 cl and so4 in water hard water is unsuitable for domestic use seasonal variation in the geochemistry of groundwater is given in table 1 the concentrations of ph tds na k ca2 mg2 fe mn and total hardness are found to be higher in pre monsoon groundwater samples than in post monsoon the concentrations of so₄ hco₃ cl and ec temperature appear to be slightly higher in post monsoon than in pre monsoon period the concentrations of na ca2 and mg2 are higher in all the geomorphic units during pre monsoon than in post monsoon period which is depicted in box and whisker fig 7 plots this phenomenon implies that dilution of dissolved ions by precipitation through infiltration is prominent during post monsoon leading to rejuvenation of fresh water in the shallow aquifers 6 conclusions the study reveals that graphical representations and multivariate statistical methods can be adopted as efficient tools in characterization of hydrochemical parameters in different geomorphic units the study area comprises of different geomorphic units as dh pz fp and ap based on trilinear 1944 diagram the dominance of ca2 mg2 cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 facies in pre and post monsoon respectively in dh unit indicates that dh is the recharge belt in the study area through meteoric water in pz unit the dominating ca2 mg2 hco3 facies during pre monsoon is evolved into ca2 mg2 na hco3 facies during post monsoon this suggests that dissolution of ions derived from limestone sandstone dolomite rocks and silicate soils through precipitation as the source of groundwater in the pz fp is characterized by ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl facies in pre monsoon and ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 na hco3 in post monsoon indicating progressive ion mixing in the aquifer after recharge ap groundwater signifies ca2 mg2 cl facies during pre monsoon and later evolved to ca2 mg2 na hco3 and na cl facies during post monsoon suggesting ionization process along the flow path based on chebotarev anions mapping hco3 and so4 dominates in dh pz and fp while ap is signified by cl in both the seasons this implies that the groundwater evolution originates from dh and pz and progress through ion mixing process in fp and reaches old stage in ap stiff diagram reveals that characterization of dh and pz by dominance of hco3 while fp and ap by cl expanded durov diagram suggests that the stages of groundwater evolution in all the units belong to initial and intermediate stages of ion mixing along with characterization of end members in ap gibbs diagrams reveal that the chemical composition of groundwater is primarily controlled by rock weathering of rock forming minerals the box and whisker plots indicate variation in the concentration of ions in the groundwater between pre and post monsoon seasons the scatter plots suggest that the groundwater is characterized by simple mixing of ions in all the geomorphic units concentrations of fe and mn are elevated in most of the units and hence not suitable for drinking purpose the observations made on graphical methods are further compared with multivariate statistical results based on the correlation matrices strong positive correlations among cl with na so4 cl with mg2 and k with hco3 in pz during pre monsoon indicates process of groundwater interaction with clay minerals leading to exchange of na for ca2 or mg2 the negative relation in mg2 with ec tds and ca2 observed in pre monsoon in pz fp and ap suggest the possibility of either dissolution or precipitation of calcite and dolomite the strong positive correlations among ec with cl k mn na2 and cl with k mn and negative correlations among hco3 with mn cl k and mn with so4 in post monsoon implies progressive mixing of dissolved ions factor analysis suggests three factors for both the seasons factor 1 represents positive loadings of tds ec ca2 na and cl in both the seasons denoting highly dissolved salts in groundwater factor 2 reflects strong negative loading of ph hco3 and so4 in both seasons attributed to the reaction of feldspar minerals with carbonic acid in the presence of water factor 3 exhibits positive loading of hardness and mg during pre monsoon and fe and mn during post monsoon reflecting dissolution of carbonates leading to increase in hardness and similar geogenic source hierarchical cluster analysis shows 3 groups comprising all the units in both the seasons group 1 represents low concentration and low degree of mineralization indicating short contact time with the rocks and soil group 2 reflects elevated mg and hardness indicating carbonate dissolution under low ph condition group 3 represents elevated tds ec ca2 and hardness indicating high degree of dissolution of ions resulting in increase in hardness thus the present study shows that the hydrochemical parameters in different geomorphic units can be characterized using graphical and multivariate statistical methods which in turn help in planning and managing the groundwater resource of the region

the hydrochemical processes which take place within the aquifer systems prevailed in geomorphic surfaces units these geomorphic units control chemistry of groundwater as it flows from recharge zone to discharge zone groundwater at the discharge zone tends to have higher mineral composition as compared to that of the recharge zone due to longer residence time and prolong contact with the aquifer matrix freeze and cherry 1979 davis and dewiest 1966 advances in geochemical methods and approaches have aided our ability to interpret hydrochemical process leading to differentiation of geomorphic

hydrochemical parameters in each geomorphic unit can provide an excellent approach to identify the type evolution and sources of groundwater rosen and jones 1998 studies on a variety of graphical and multivariate statistical techniques have been carried out in order to facilitate the classification of waters zaporozec 1972 kshetrimayum 2015 kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 kshetrimayum and laxmi 2017 presentation of chemical analysis in graphical form makes understanding of complex groundwater system simpler and quicker collins et al 1932 piper 1953 zaporozec 1972 the commonly used graphical methods and multivariate statistical techniques in groundwater studies include stiff pattern diagram trilinear diagram durov diagram box and whisker plot scatter plots and pearson correlation pc hierarchical cluster analysis hca and factor analysis fa the current paper examines the use of these methods in characterizing the hydrochemical constituents in different geomorphic units in the dimapur valley located along the edge of the naga thrust in the indo myanmar range of northeast india 2 study area the dimapur valley which lies between 25 40 and 25 58 n latitudes and 93 49 and 93 41 e longitudes is a home to 0 379 million people as per 2011 census in nagaland state of ne india fig 1 geologically the valley is located in the northwestern side of the outermost belt of schuppen known as the naga thrust which has a strike direction of ne sw mathur and evans 1964 the valley is represented by a sub montane basin filled with quaternary sediments which was formed by coalescence of outwash fan deposits of different streams rock types and formations encountered in the region are of tertiary to quaternary period alluvium deposits consist of clay sands silts pebble and boulders and occupy large area of the valley cgwb 2013 geomorphologically the study area has been demarcated as different geomorphic units like denudational hills dh piedmont zone pz flood plain fp and alluvial plain ap newmai and jami 2010 hydrogeologically groundwater is occurred under water table condition in shallow aquifers while in deeper aquifers it occurs under semi confined to confined conditions chisi and newmai 2013 the regional groundwater flow direction is from south to north with water table elevation ranging from 123 m above mean sea level amsl to 179 m amsl the water table below ground level bgl varies from 1 52 mbgl to 10 75 mbgl kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 the thickness of alluvium deposit in the valley exceeds 122 m the yields of groundwater in tubewells vary from 10 m3 day to 45 m3 day in the valley good prospect of groundwater is found in open wells constructed at 5 m 20 m depth and tubewells constructed at 100 m 300 m depth nitovi and asingbow 2013 cgwb 2013 numerous seasonal rivers flow across the valley in which the dhansiri and the chathe or diphu rivers are the main rivers 3 methodology a total of 275 shallow groundwater samples were collected from 50 well locations during pre and post monsoon seasons fig 1 out of these sites 4 14 18 14 sites represent geomorphic units of dh pz fp and ap respectively for both seasons physico chemical parameters like ph tds ec and temperature were measured on site by using the portable field kit model no hi 9811 5 hanna instruments major cations ca2 mg2 k na fe and mn were analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes model arcos spectro germany anions like cl was determined by standard agno3 titration hco3 and co3 were determined by titration method using hcl in the field and so4 was determined by using digital nephelo turbidity meter model 132 systronics india samples were analyzed in different laboratories including indian institute of technology powai india and the analytical error using charge balance error cbe formula apha 1998 appelo and postma 2005 is calculated as less than 4 5 graphical presentations trilinear diagram expanded durov diagram gibbs diagram stiff and scatter plots were prepared using aquachem software 5 1 version multivariate statistical methods cluster analysis factor analysis and correlation matrix were carried out using ibm spss statistic 20 4 results 4 1 elementary geochemistry the physico chemical parameters and statistical summary of the groundwater samples are presented in tables 1 and 2 the ph values range from 4 1 to 7 5 and 4 9 to 6 7 in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively mean ph values 6 2 and 5 9 of both seasons suggest neutral water type todd 2005 tds values range from 20 mg l to 320 mg l and 30 mg l to 320 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively indicating fresh water as the values are below 1000 mg l carroll 1962 average temperatures of the samples are 24 c and 27 8 c in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively co3 is almost absent in all the samples concentrations of major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 cl and hco3 in pre and post seasons are below who limits however fe and mn are found elevated 6 84 mg l and 1 27 mg l and 7 73 mg l and 0 60 mg l in post and post monsoon respectively in most of the samples the values of hardness vary from 113 9 mg l to 571 6 mg l in pre monsoon and 34 3 mg l to 233 6 mg l in post monsoon indicating slightly hard water the degree of hardness decreases in post monsoon indicating dilution of ca2 and mg2 divalent metallic cations through infiltration of meteoric water the order of dominance of ions in pre monsoon is ca2 hco3 mg2 na cl so4 mn k fe and in post monsoon it is hco3 mg2 cl so4 na ca2 k fe mn 4 2 graphical interpretation method graphical interpretation is a basic tool in hydrochemical studies as they provide quick summarization of water quality data zaporozec 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 hem 1989 the principles of graphical interpretation methods are based on the relationships of ions or group of ions forming a chemical type of water zaporozec 1972 some of these methods are presented in figs 2 4 trilinear diagram hill 1940 piper 1944 is used to infer the type of hydrochemical facies and groundwater evolution hem 1989 pre monsoon is represented by two types of facies ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl while post monsoon is characterized by three types of facies ca2 mg2 hco3 ca2 mg2 na hco3 and na cl fig 2 dh is reflected by ca2 mg2 cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively in pre monsoon pz is represented by ca2 mg2 hco3 facies which alters to ca2 mg2 na hco3 facies in post monsoon fp is denoted by ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl facies in pre monsoon and ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 na hco3 in post monsoon respectively suggesting progressive mixing of ions in ap facies are dominated by ca2 mg2 cl type during pre monsoon which alters to ca2 mg2 na hco3 and na cl facies during post monsoon indicating ionization process along the flow path the evolution of groundwater can be studied following chebotarev 1955 sequence chebotarev proposed a geochemical classification of water based on anion occurrence and prevalence as they are regarded as independent ingredients the sequence correlates with the increasing distance along the flow path and an increasing age of water this anion sequence also corresponds to an increase in dissolved solids concentration as evident from this mapping fig 3a and b the study area is classified as class i hco3 ii hco3 cl iii cl hco3 v cl which covers 40 28 8 24 and 40 20 8 12 of the total area in pre and post monsoon respectively stiff patterns 1951 are useful in making a rapid visual comparison among waters from different sources as the area of the polygonal shape increases the concentrations of ions also increase fetter 2001 also the pattern tends to maintain its shape upon concentration or dilution thus usually allowing tracing the flow paths on maps stiff 1951 as suggested by this diagram fig 4 dh and pz are characterized by dominance of hco3 while fp and ap are represented by cl the diagram also indicates that presence of dissolved solids is more in pz and ap groundwater than other units in both the seasons expanded durov diagram burdon and mazloun 1958 lloyd 1965 is used to infer hydrochemical processes and has distinct advantage over trilinear diagram as it provides better display of various hydrochemical types and evolutionary stages llyod and heathcote 1985 durov diagram fig 5 a and b reveals that most of the samples in all the geomorphic units are signified by initial stage and simple ion mixing process however in ap the end member is characterized by reversed ion exchange process indicating old stage of groundwater evolution gibbs 1970 diagram is used to understand the natural mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry including dominances of rainfall rock weathering evaporation and precipitation gibbs diagrams fig 6 a and b reveal that the chemical composition of groundwater is primarily controlled by rock weathering process in both seasons box and whisker plot renders an excellent summary of five important statistical aspects of water quality parameters along with the identification of outliers usepa 1998 box and whisker plots are usually placed side by side to compare and contrast groups of hydrochemical data and are very useful for comparing individual water quality constituents among different settings alley 1993 fig 7 a and b represent box and whisker plots of pre and post monsoon seasons in dh pz fp and ap units respectively these plots indicate variation in statistical values in terms of ion concentrations before and after the monsoon as evident from fig 7a and b mg2 has the highest mean concentration value among ions in pre monsoon while ca2 and hco3 dominate the post monsoon season in dh pz has the highest mean concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in pre monsoon but hco3 dominantes the mean in post monsoon the similar trend is observed in fp and ap dominant reactions and the geochemical processes that control the groundwater chemistry can also be identified using molar ratios of ions the geochemical variation in ionic concentration in groundwater can easily be understood when they are plotted along an x y coordinate guler et al 2002 scatter plots of various ions suggest linear relations among them implying similar sources of occurrence and effects of monsoon in groundwater composition in all the units scatter plots of na cl in both the seasons fig 8 a and b show all the samples plots near 1 1 linear line indicating na and cl has common natural geogenic source as evaporite encrustations in the soil kshetrimayum and thokchom 2017 scatter plots of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 for pre and post monsoon seasons are presented in fig 9 a and b respectively majority of the water samples falls above the 1 1 equiline in both the seasons indicating reverse ion exchange as the dominant processes el sayed et al 2012 4 3 multivariate statistical analysis an approach to understand the chemistry of water samples is to investigate statistical relationships among their dissolved constituents and environmental parameters such as lithology by using multivariate statistics drever 1997 multivariate statistical techniques which include hca fa and pc are effective means of manipulating interpreting and representing data concerning groundwater pollutants and geochemistry ritzi et al 1993 demlie et al 2007 koh et al 2011 4 3 1 correlation matrix correlation coefficient is commonly used to measure and establish the relationship between two variables it is a simplified statistical tool to show the degree of dependency of one variable to the other the results of correlation matrices of 12 variables from 50 samples of shallow groundwater during pre and post monsoon seasons are presented in table 3 a and b during pre monsoon strong positive correlations in cl with ca2 r 0 927 na r 0 904 and na with ca2 r 0 830 are observed in pz while in post monsoon strong positive correlations exist in cl with na r 0 865 so4 r 0 954 fe with mn r 0 963 cl with mg r 0 901 and k with hco3 r 0 990 these relations indicate groundwater reaction with clay minerals leading to exchange of na for ca2 or mg2 hem 1989 the similar correlations of these variables are observed in fp however fp is characterized by strong negative correlation in na with fe r 0 537 and so4 r 0 264 k with so4 r 0 099 and fe with cl r 0 282 mg2 r 0 162 ca2 r 0 411 in post monsoon suggesting simple mixing of dissolved ions mg2 shows negative relation with ec r 0 683 tds r 0 72 ca2 r 0 294 in pz during pre monsoon similar negative moderate correlations among these variables are observed in fp and ap implying the possibility of either dissolution or precipitation of calcite and dolomite zhang et al 2016 in ap there are strong correlations in ec with cl r 0 923 k r 0 903 mn r 0 913 na2 r 0 842 in pre monsoon indicating progressive mixing of dissolved ions moderately strong positive correlation exists in cl with k r 0 880 and mn r 0 85 implying the occurrence of late stage of ionization process kura et al 2013 similar relations among these variables are observed in ap in post monsoon ap is also characterized by negative correlations in hco3 with mn r 0 62 cl r 0 266 k r 0 091 and mn with so4 r 0 91 in post monsoon revealing late stage of ionization process in this unit strong positive correlation between fe and mn in pz during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons indicate similar source of reduction under anoxic and redox oscillating conditions postma 1985 hem 1989 postma and appelo 2000 4 3 2 factor analysis factor analysis is a commonly used statistical method to classify and simplify the data and also to find the most important variables in a dataset the results of the factor analysis for both seasons are highlighted in table 4 for both seasons three factors of eigen values 1 were identified the three factors account for a cumulative of variance 31 51 in pre monsoon and 51 44 in post monsoon seasons respectively factor 1 which explains 31 51 and 51 44 of the total variance for pre and post monsoon seasons shows very high positive loadings of tds ec ca2 na cl in pre monsoon and ec tds ca2 na cl mg2 k in post monsoon implying the occurrence of highly dissolved salts in groundwater factor 2 which accounts 25 43 and 18 69 of the total variance for both seasons shows strong negative loading of ph hco3 and so4 in both the seasons this loading may be attributed to the reaction of feldspar minerals with carbonic acid in the presence of water elango et al 2003 factor 3 reflects 14 44 and 12 35 of the total variance in both the seasons and shows high positive loading of hardness and mg2 during pre monsoon and fe and mn during post monsoon loading representing pre monsoon suggests dissolution of carbonates leading to increase in hardness while post monsoon loading indicates similar geogenic source of contamination under similar condition 4 3 3 hierarchical cluster analysis the hierarchical cluster analysis hca is used to classify hydrochemical observations so that the members of the resulting groups or subgroups are similar to each other and distinct from other groups ayenew et al 2009 hca has been proven to provide a suitable basis for objective classification of water composition guler et al 2002 kebede et al 2005 hca classifies the data in a relatively simple and direct manner and the result is presented as a dendogram which is an easily understood and familiar diagram davis 1973 13 variables ph tds ec ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 fe mn hardness and 50 groundwater sampling sites were used for hca fig 10 a and b for both the seasons dendogram pattern shows three groups having similar hydrochemical characteristics mean concentrations of hydochemical parameters of group and subgroup derived from hca is presented in table 5 in pre monsoon group 1 has 2 subgroups where subgroup 1 has 7 samples and subgroup 2 has 3 samples group 1 represents low concentration and low degree of mineralization indicating short contact time with the rock and soil glover et al 2012 group 2 samples are divided into subgroups 3 and 4 where each subgroup has 2 samples each group 2 characterizes elevated mn and hardness indicating carbonate dissolution under low ph condition group 3 samples are divided into subgroups 5 6 7 and 8 where subgroup 5 has 3 samples and rest of the subgroups has 2 samples each representing elevated tds ec ca2 and hardness similarly in post monsoon samples dendrogram shows 3 groups where group 1 has 4 subgroups group 2 has 1 subgroup and group 3 has 3 subgroups group 1 represents lower concentration of ions indicating fresh meteoric water group 2 indicates elevations of fe and mn while group 3 indicates high degree of dissolution of ions resulting in increase in hardness by and large dendogram shows increase in dissolved solids from group 1 to 3 in both the seasons and also each group comprises multiple geomorphic units 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater characterization in geomorphic units the mean ph values for dh during pre and post monsoons are 5 9 and 5 95 respectively for pz ph values are 6 8 and 6 in fp it is 6 2 and 6 while in ap it is 5 9 and 5 6 respectively overall the ph value ranges from 5 6 to 6 8 in all the geomorphic units indicating neutral and fresh water todd 2005 however in ap ph is slightly acidic 5 6 during post monsoon owing to either association of small amounts of mineral acids from sulfide sources or organic acids from decay of vegetation davis and deweist 1966 mean tds values for both seasons in pz are 135 mg l and 157 mg l respectively in fp the values are 137 mg l and 133 mg l while in ap they are 190 mg l and 164 mg l respectively tds is lowest in dh 40 mg l and higher in ap 190 mg l implying of the fact that tds value increases from recharge zone to discharge zones hem 1989 in dh and pz tds values increase from pre to post season indicating intensive mixing of ions after dilution through recharge process in fp and ap however tds reduces from pre to post season indicating reductive ionization process in the aquifers the classification of hardness of groundwater samples after sawyer and mccarty 1967 is presented in table 6 dh belongs to hard 181 mg l category in pre monsoon and becomes soft 65 mg l in post monsoon in pz groundwater is very hard 373 mg l in pre monsoon and hard 180 mg l in post monsoon in fp and ap groundwater belongs to very hard 336 mg l and 365 mg l in pre monsoon and becomes moderately hard in post monsoon 86 mg l and 81 mg l the orders of dominance of ions in dh groundwater in pre and post monsoon are ca2 hco3 cl mg2 na k mn fe so4 and hco3 na cl mg2 ca2 so4 k mn fe respectively in pz groundwater the orders are hco3 ca2 mg2 na cl fe mn so4 k and hco3 na cl so4 mg2 ca2 k fe mn in fp they are ca2 hco3 mg2 na cl so4 k fe mn and hco3 so4 mg2 cl na ca2 k fe mn in ap groundwater they are ca2 hco3 na mg2 cl so4 mn k fe and hco3 mg2 cl so4 na ca2 k mn fe these sequences indicate that groundwater in geomorphic units are characterized by recently derived meteoric water as the source of recharge generally both fe and mn are found highly elevated before monsoon and depleted after monsoon fe average concentrations in dh pz fp and ap are 0 95 mg l 11 03 mg l 6 54 mg l 4 69 mg l respectively during pre monsoon and 0 08 3 04 1 05 0 12 mg l respectively during post monsoon suggesting elevation above isi 1983 limit 0 3 mg l similarly mn elevations in dh pz fp and ap are 1 54 mg l 10 8 mg l 3 66 mg l 11 62 mg l and 0 23 mg l 0 72 mg l 0 42 mg l 0 83 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively exceeding isi 1983 base flow from discharge areas into low lying areas and recharge from rivers causes accretion of fe and mn in shallow aquifers of the region kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 hco3 concentration increases after monsoon in all the geomorphic units indicating significant groundwater recharging process through precipitation generally na and cl concentrations increase towards ap suggesting significant mineralization process away from the recharging source concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in all the units decrease from pre monsoon to post monsoon season resulting reduce in hardness 342 mg l to 80 mg l the abundance of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater indicates the prevalence of carbonate weathering such as calcite and dolomite das et al 2018 5 2 groundwater evolution hydrochemical facies back 1961 1966 provide distinct zones of dominant dissolved ions which help in understanding complex hydrochemical process the pz groundwater which indicates hco3 ca2 mg2 facies in pre monsoon alters to mixed ion facies in post monsoon suggesting process of ion mixing during pre monsoon ap groundwater reflects ca2 mg2 cl facies which evolves into mixed ion and na cl facies in post monsoon however in fp there is no significant change in terms of ion concentrations during both the seasons this could be owing to flat hydraulic gradient around the fp the evolution of end members in groundwater in both the seasons can be interpreted from trilinear diagram fig 2 where cl end members are normally observed in ap suggesting that groundwater becomes matured towards ap the chebotarev model fig 3 indicates that groundwater evolution originates from pz and process through ion mixing in fp and attains late or old stage in ap the result of durov diagram also supports the concept of groundwater evolution based on cheboratev model expanded durov diagram fig 5 suggests that dh groundwater in both the seasons is represented by recharge water from sandstone and limestone rocks exposed around the naga thrust belt the pz and ap groundwater in both the seasons are denoted by process of partial ion exchange indicating initial stage of groundwater evolution the ap groundwater in both the seasons however signifies reversed ion exchange process suggesting matured stage of groundwater evolution gibbs plots 1970 fig 6 reveal the weathering of rock forming minerals is the dominating process controlling the groundwater chemistry in all the geomorphic units the molar ratio of na cl fig 8 for both seasons suggests excess of na2 due the weathering of silicate minerals the samples plot above the 1 1 equiline and very few samples fall below the equiline suggesting addition of cl due to dissolution of salt from soils stallard and edmond 1983 scatter plot of ca2 mg2 vs so4 hco3 fig 9 further suggests silicate and carbonate weathering as the dominating source of dissolved ions datta et al 1996 rajmohan and elango 2004 2006 elango and ramesh 2006 rao 2006 kumar et al 2006 and ion exchange process cerling et al 1989 fisher and mulican 1997 in all the geomorphic units 5 3 groundwater quality groundwater quality of the study area is determined based on the concentrations of physical parameters major and minor ion concentrations table 1 the ph values of the groundwater samples were within the permissible limits 6 5 8 5 for drinking purpose who 2008 bis 1991 isi 2012 the concentration of tds in the water samples of both pre and post monsoon periods were within the permissible limits as per the tds classification indicating fresh water type calcium concentration in few samples 3 samples from pz 1 sample from fp and 3 samples from ap in pre monsoon were above the permissible limits isi 1983 similarly mg in few samples 5 each sample from pz fp and ap in pre monsoon and 2 from pz 3 each from fp and ap in post monsoon were above the permissible limit for drinking purpose isi 2012 the major anions cl so4 2 and hco3 concentrations in both seasons were within the permissible limit fe and mn concentrations exceed the permissible limits which are 0 3 mg l for fe and 0 1 mg l for mn isi 1983 in all the groundwater samples the water classification based on hardness sawyer and mccarty 1967 table 6 shows that the groundwater during pre monsoon falls in moderately hard to very hard category in which 4 belongs to moderately hard 48 shares hard and 48 contributes very hard however during post monsoon groundwater belongs to soft to hard water types in which 60 belongs to soft 32 shares moderately hard and 8 contributes hard water type water hardness is caused primarily by the presence of cations such as ca and mg and anions such as co3 hco3 cl and so4 in water hard water is unsuitable for domestic use seasonal variation in the geochemistry of groundwater is given in table 1 the concentrations of ph tds na k ca2 mg2 fe mn and total hardness are found to be higher in pre monsoon groundwater samples than in post monsoon the concentrations of so₄ hco₃ cl and ec temperature appear to be slightly higher in post monsoon than in pre monsoon period the concentrations of na ca2 and mg2 are higher in all the geomorphic units during pre monsoon than in post monsoon period which is depicted in box and whisker fig 7 plots this phenomenon implies that dilution of dissolved ions by precipitation through infiltration is prominent during post monsoon leading to rejuvenation of fresh water in the shallow aquifers 6 conclusions the study reveals that graphical representations and multivariate statistical methods can be adopted as efficient tools in characterization of hydrochemical parameters in different geomorphic units the study area comprises of different geomorphic units as dh pz fp and ap based on trilinear 1944 diagram the dominance of ca2 mg2 cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 facies in pre and post monsoon respectively in dh unit indicates that dh is the recharge belt in the study area through meteoric water in pz unit the dominating ca2 mg2 hco3 facies during pre monsoon is evolved into ca2 mg2 na hco3 facies during post monsoon this suggests that dissolution of ions derived from limestone sandstone dolomite rocks and silicate soils through precipitation as the source of groundwater in the pz fp is characterized by ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl facies in pre monsoon and ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 na hco3 in post monsoon indicating progressive ion mixing in the aquifer after recharge ap groundwater signifies ca2 mg2 cl facies during pre monsoon and later evolved to ca2 mg2 na hco3 and na cl facies during post monsoon suggesting ionization process along the flow path based on chebotarev anions mapping hco3 and so4 dominates in dh pz and fp while ap is signified by cl in both the seasons this implies that the groundwater evolution originates from dh and pz and progress through ion mixing process in fp and reaches old stage in ap stiff diagram reveals that characterization of dh and pz by dominance of hco3 while fp and ap by cl expanded durov diagram suggests that the stages of groundwater evolution in all the units belong to initial and intermediate stages of ion mixing along with characterization of end members in ap gibbs diagrams reveal that the chemical composition of groundwater is primarily controlled by rock weathering of rock forming minerals the box and whisker plots indicate variation in the concentration of ions in the groundwater between pre and post monsoon seasons the scatter plots suggest that the groundwater is characterized by simple mixing of ions in all the geomorphic units concentrations of fe and mn are elevated in most of the units and hence not suitable for drinking purpose the observations made on graphical methods are further compared with multivariate statistical results based on the correlation matrices strong positive correlations among cl with na so4 cl with mg2 and k with hco3 in pz during pre monsoon indicates process of groundwater interaction with clay minerals leading to exchange of na for ca2 or mg2 the negative relation in mg2 with ec tds and ca2 observed in pre monsoon in pz fp and ap suggest the possibility of either dissolution or precipitation of calcite and dolomite the strong positive correlations among ec with cl k mn na2 and cl with k mn and negative correlations among hco3 with mn cl k and mn with so4 in post monsoon implies progressive mixing of dissolved ions factor analysis suggests three factors for both the seasons factor 1 represents positive loadings of tds ec ca2 na and cl in both the seasons denoting highly dissolved salts in groundwater factor 2 reflects strong negative loading of ph hco3 and so4 in both seasons attributed to the reaction of feldspar minerals with carbonic acid in the presence of water factor 3 exhibits positive loading of hardness and mg during pre monsoon and fe and mn during post monsoon reflecting dissolution of carbonates leading to increase in hardness and similar geogenic source hierarchical cluster analysis shows 3 groups comprising all the units in both the seasons group 1 represents low concentration and low degree of mineralization indicating short contact time with the rocks and soil group 2 reflects elevated mg and hardness indicating carbonate dissolution under low ph condition group 3 represents elevated tds ec ca2 and hardness indicating high degree of dissolution of ions resulting in increase in hardness thus the present study shows that the hydrochemical parameters in different geomorphic units can be characterized using graphical and multivariate statistical methods which in turn help in planning and managing the groundwater resource of the region

12306,this study was conducted to appraise the quality of groundwater for irrigation and domestic water supply in the ga west municipality ghana a total of 29 borehole water samples were collected for hydrogeochemical analysis and interpreted using hydrogeochemical plots and multivariate statistical analysis the relative abundance of the major ions in the analyzed water samples were in the order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 trilinear piper plot shows that nahco3 cl and nacahco3 cl are the dominant water types in the area the ca2 and hco3 in these type of waters are primarily from dissolution of carbonate minerals whilst the na and cl may have been input from water rock interaction with granitic rocks seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities in the watershed all the analyzed physico chemical parameters are within the acceptable limits of the world health organization who for drinking except tds total hardness na and cl which could be as a result of solid waste leachate and marine water intrusion the samples have low to medium sodium hazard values with high to very high salinity hazard values when plotted on the wilcox diagram this suggests that the water is suitable for irrigation purposes with regard to sodium hazard but a mixing of the high salinity water with low salinity water is highly recommended prior to irrigation to reduce the salinity hazard in the area however if the crops are salt tolerant then mixing is not necessary three factors explain 99 8 of the total variance and suggest that water rock interaction is the most important factor that controls the groundwater chemistry besides some contribution from agricultural activities and seawater mixing are the other factors influencing the groundwater chemistry these factors are indicated by the positive correlation among the individual hydrochemical parameters graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater hydrogeochemistry water rock interaction seawater intrusion anthropogenic sources ghana 1 introduction groundwater has been widely recommended notwithstanding its scarce accessibility availability and cost for usage in domestic and irrigational purposes due to its less susceptibility to anthropogenic activities and climate variability mahlknecht et al 2004 sunkari et al 2018 groundwater according to yidana et al 2010 does not require rigorous treatment processes to make it suitable for usage however the quality of groundwater for both domestic and irrigational purposes requires periodic assessment li et al 2016 berhe et al 2017 since irrigation schemes play a fundamental role in developing economies that rely heavily on agriculture for food and cash crop production boateng et al 2012 in ghana irrigation farming has a stake in eradicating poverty and to a larger extent unemployment however the unpredictable nature of the rainfall pattern in ghana has had a great deal of negative impact on crop yields which for some time now has resulted in reduction in foreign exchange earnings from crop production although the role of irrigation schemes in safeguarding global food security cannot be overemphasized it is worthwhile to decipher the rippling effects of using irrigation waters that are of very poor quality in view of their contribution to human sustainability through crop production the quality of irrigation soils can be affected by using water that is highly saline and highly sodic this has affected crop production even in larger economies like china and india which practice irrigation farming on a larger scale adomako et al 2011 continuous use of such water renders the soil unsuitable for productive irrigation with the attendant failure of crop production overtime on this basis assessment of the quality of groundwater for utilization in irrigation schemes and even for domestic purposes should be done regularly across the globe such an assessment must be conducted against the type of soils to be used in the irrigation schemes in order not to waste resources moreover the type of crops to be produced should be held in view when doing such an assessment because most crops cannot withstand concentrations of some ions in the soil and have different tolerable limits of salinity for instance it is well established that apart from the tolerable limits of specific ions in soils and water for irrigation the sodium ion concentration against alkali earth metals such as calcium and magnesium is a key determinant of the suitability of water for irrigation purposes the sodium adsorption ratio sar is a guide for measuring the concentrations of sodium as well as the combined concentration of calcium and magnesium li et al 2016 it is a perfect match with electrical conductivity ec when assessing the salinity levels of irrigation waters another scheme is the wilcox 1955 diagram which is a plot of the percentage sodium against the ec the uniqueness of the current study is to decipher the source of groundwater and its implication on the suitability of the underlying aquifers for irrigation schemes in ghana this kind of assessment has been conducted in several areas similar to ghana e g wanda et al 2013 and the quality of the groundwater for irrigation has been found to be affected by diverse factors depending on the location of the resource paramount among these factors are the hydrogeochemical parameters which vary overtime the source of the chemical constituents of the ga west municipality in ghana is however unclear notwithstanding the significance of this knowledge for safe and effective groundwater usage and management practices there are several solid waste disposal sites along the western part of the study area such as the oblogo and mallam landfills in the erstwhile ga district where the ga west municipality was carved from these landfills serve as a threat to the underlying groundwater resources the presence of active sand mines in most of the communities including akramaman yawoman and amasaman is also causing a great deal of worry in view of the groundwater in these areas seawater intrusion is also likely to be a principal control on the groundwater chemistry considering the location of the area within the coastal part of ghana despite all these anthropogenic and natural threats little is known about the groundwater quality in the ga west municipality geological and hydrogeological properties of the ga west municipality and its vicinity are only studied by water resources research institutewrri 2003 ganyaglo et al 2010 and saka et al 2013 this current study intends to appraise the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in the study area and ascertain its implication for domestic and irrigation purposes in addition the study also aims to decipher the possible source s of groundwater pollution using multivariate statistical techniques 2 study area ghana is divided into three main drainage features namely the volta river southern river system and coastal river system the ga west municipality lies within the coastal river system and is located in the greater accra region of ghana fig 1 it lies within latitude 50 48 10 n and 50 35 20 n and longitude 00 23 30 w and 00 4 50 w and shares boundaries with ga east and the accra metropolitan assembly to the east akwapim south to the north and ga south and ga central to the south the ga west municipality occupies a land area of approximately 284 08 sq km with about 412 communities it has a relatively low relief with a few high elevations the climate varies throughout the year in all parts of the municipality as a result of the vast nature of the coastal basins but usually feature cooler temperature 29 4 c in august with the hottest temperature 34 8 c occurring in march and an annual average temperature of 28 5 c precipitation in the form of rainfall is the principal climatic factor that affects peri urban agriculture and socioeconomic life in the municipality the greater part of the area receives copious rainfall from april to june with a peak in june representing the major rainy season whereas the minor rainy season starts from september to mid october with a peak in october ofori sarpong and annor 2001 the municipality has well drained sandy clay loam to clay soils in some areas with abundant rough stone concretions and quartz gravels ga west municipality is largely underlain by rocks of the dahomeyan formation and the togo series fig 1 the dahomeyan is variably composed of gneisses ranging from medium grained foliated biotite quartz diorite gneiss to hornblende quartz diorite gneiss saka et al 2013 the togo series unconformably overly the dahomeyan gneisses fig 2 they are mainly composed of quartzites phyllites schists and marbles there are pockets of carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite which have all been metamorphosed into marble marmorised in some localities fig 2 the togo series is intruded by a unique granite complex known as the cape coast granite complex ccgc figs 1 and 2 the ccgc is characterized by a series of granitic to quartz diorite gneisses the aquifers in this complex are within the weathered fractured zones according to water resources research institutewrri 2003 the borehole depths here vary from 9 0 to 103 0 m with static water levels in the range of 1 5 8 2 m the yields of these boreholes range from 0 72 to 9 m3 h 1 ganyaglo et al 2010 the dahomeyan and togo series have undergone multiple deformational episodes which are manifested by high degrees of metamorphism faulting jointing and intense folding adomako et al 2011 the structures in the rocks serve as good conduits for groundwater flow locally the contact between quartzites and argillaceous rocks around the valleys in the area is associated with the development of springs such as those in the akwapim togo range saka et al 2013 stated that the borehole depths in the dahomeyan and the togo series vary from 28 0 to 97 0 m comparable to those in the ccgc the weathered zones where the groundwater occurs are generally characterized by varying thicknesses 3 0 36 0 m available borehole data in the area suggests that the static water level changes from 1 1 to 17 9 m with yields in the range of 0 6 6 0 m3 h 1 averaging about 2 8 m3 h 1 saka et al 2013 3 materials and methods a total of 29 groundwater samples were collected from active boreholes used for domestic and irrigational purposes across the study area during the sample collection care was taken to avoid contamination from any source therefore known standard procedures for well purging were employed the location and coordinates of all the sample points were recorded by means of a gps prior to sample collection the boreholes were pumped up to 5 min to purge the aquifers and avoid contamination from the water to be sampled the samples were collected using preconditioned 250 ml polyethylene bottles physical parameters such as temperature ph alkalinity total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec were measured directly in the field using a multi parameter handheld meter the samples were later vacuum filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane for major ion analysis in the laboratory aliquots of the samples were acidified with 1 v v hno3 for major cation analysis whereas the remaining samples were sent for major anion analysis at the ghana atomic energy commission gaec accra the accuracy of the analysis was achieved by the charge balance error equation of hounslow 1995 which resulted in 5 concentration of the major cations and anions the saturation indices of the identified mineral phases in the groundwater were calculated using phreeqc software package parkhurst and appelo 1999 in order to identify the spatial groundwater associations in the study area the data were run through r mode factor analysis and q mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca using the procedures detailed in imbrie 1963 squared euclidean distance and ward s linkage were respectively used in determining the similarity or dissimilarity of the data and linking the clusters produced this has been proven in the literature to always give the best results for multivariate classification schemes e g yidana et al 2008 during the r mode factor analysis the extraction method used was principal component analysis whilst the rotation algorithm used was varimax rotation in order to minimize the number of factors to model kaiser criterion was used which enabled iteration on only three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 stanton and diggle 2013 the quality of the investigated water samples for irrigation purposes was assessed using the sar equation details in li et al 2016 the wilcox diagram was therefore generated based on this equation to characterize the irrigation quality of the groundwater from the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry statistical summary of the major hydrochemical parameters analyzed in this study are presented in table 1 they are compared with the guideline values of the world health organization world health organization 2006 the ph values recorded in the analyzed water samples range from 4 35 to 7 87 with a mean of 6 79 this suggests that the groundwater in the area is near neutral ph and largely acidic the temperatures of the water at the time of the sample collection changed from 26 8 to 30 1 c with an average of 28 30 c implying that the waters were not influenced by any form of geothermal water the concentration of tds also range from 884 to 17800 mg l with an average of 4467 14 mg l the higher concentration of tds in the analyzed water samples strongly suggests that they are not entirely freshwater samples the electrical conductivity values are very high in all the analyzed samples and range from 1768 to 35600 μs cm with an average value of 10192 17 μs cm total hardness changed from a lower limit of 200 mg l to an upper limit of 6000 mg l averaging at 775 34 mg l only sample 1 recorded a lower limit 200 mg l whereas the other samples showed elevated values when correlated with the who value of 200 mg l this trend is expected since ca2 and mg2 appear to be dominant in the water samples from this area the na concentrations are somewhat high in most of the samples since their concentrations exceed the 200 mg l acceptable limit proposed by the who for instance the highest na concentration 683 mg l is observed in sample 22 around the municipal capital amasaman the k concentrations are however relatively low in the groundwater samples except sample 6 which recorded the highest k concentration 214 mg l the rest of the samples are all within the who acceptable limit for safe drinking water of 200 mg l the cation concentrations are in the order na ca2 mg2 k fig 3 the dominant anions observed in the analyzed water samples are hco3 and cl the hco3 concentrations varied from 350 to 2000 mg l with an average of 674 mg l whereas the cl concentrations varied from 29 9 to 3798 mg l with an average of 390 mg l generally the concentrations of the major anions are in the order hco3 cl so4 2 fig 3 the fluoride f concentrations are relatively low with a minimum value of 0 21 mg l and a maximum value of 1 88 mg l slightly higher than the who acceptable limit of 1 5 mg l perhaps due to dissolution of micas which contain fluoride sunkari et al 2018 it is well established in literature that nitrate no3 is a major pollutant in groundwater emanating from agricultural and industrial effluents e g vikas et al 2015 from the hydrochemical analysis conducted on the water samples from the study area the no3 concentrations are low 0 11 1 9 mg l trilinear piper diagram has been widely used in showing the results of several hydrochemical analysis on one graph which is capable of grouping analyzed samples and identifying different hydrochemical facies piper 1953 in this study a trilinear piper plot was used to determine the hydrochemical facies and types of groundwater samples in the study area fig 4 the plot reveals the following groups of groundwater nahco3 cl 31 namghco3 cl 13 5 nacahco3 cl 13 5 naclhco3 10 nacamghco3 cl 5 5 nacamghco3 5 5 namgkhco3 3 5 nacahco3 3 5 nacaclhco3 3 5 mgnacl 3 5 mgcahco3 3 5 mgnahco3 cl 3 5 suggesting that the dominant type of water in the ga west municipality is nahco3 cl followed by nacahco3 cl the ca2 and hco3 in these type of waters are primarily from the dissolution of carbonate minerals geogenic input derived from the togo series which contains some dolomitic marble and limestone fig 2 whilst the na and cl may have been derived from salinization by halite dissolution in the unsaturated zones in the coastal area and or seawater intrusion keesari et al 2016 this is consistent with the location of the municipality along the coastal basins the high na and hco3 concentrations of the groundwater may also come from weathering and dissolution of magmatic and metamorphic rocks such as granite from the ccgc and gneisses phyllites and schists from the togo and dahomeyan series which show fractured aquifer characteristics in the study area it is thus suggested that saline waters from the coastal basins might have mixed with the groundwater and carbonate minerals in the underlying carbonate rocks of the togo series might have also dissolved into the groundwater resulting in the two major water types ion exchange processes within these water types are also present in all the ga west municipal groundwater shows characteristics associated with recharge water from a regional groundwater system dominated by na and hco3 enriched in tds and having acidic to slightly alkaline ph schoeller semi logarithmic plot fig 5 schoeller 1962 was used in discriminating the samples that show similar ionic distribution patterns it is observed that sample 15 has the highest ca2 and na concentrations sample 7 shows the highest mg2 cl and so4 2 concentrations whilst sample 9 has the highest hco3 concentration apart from these samples the trends of all the other samples overlap one another implying that they may have evolved from a common source albeit some form of mixing perhaps from seawater fig 5 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis three factors were obtained from the factor analysis which accounted for more than 99 8 of the total variance of the hydrochemical parameters with eigenvalues greater than 1 table 2 factor 1 loads strongly with most of the major ions fig 6 a representing 27 4 of the total variance in the three factors which exhausted the dissolved oxygen do present in the water do content of groundwater usually decreases as a result of circulation in the sub surface thus lower do contents point to longer residence time and so adequate water rock interaction in the aquifer the strong positive loadings of factor 1 with ca mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 table 2 fig 6a is an approximation for the dissolution of carbonate bearing rocks belonging to the togo series as the principal control on groundwater chemistry moreover borehole depths up to 40 m intersect the togo series which rests on the dahomeyan formation all the studied boreholes were drilled within the togo series with depths ranging from 28 to 51 m fig 2 therefore the groundwater chemistry reflects the geochemical composition of rocks in the togo series which accounts for the loadings in factor 1 factor 2 loads strongly with all the parameters except k hco3 and po4 3 ions fig 6a table 2 this factor highlights the effect of seawater intrusion and dissolution of halite in the soils these contributions are further manifested by the strong positive correlation between na and cl in the analyzed water samples fig 8a previously yidana et al 2010 proposed that the influence of rainfall and chemical disintegration of geologic materials were the causes for variation in groundwater chemistry in the area owing to the fact that factor 2 also loads strongly on ca and mg2 the weathering of dolomite and calcite from carbonate rocks of the togo series is the most likely source of contribution of these ions to the groundwater and supports the proposition of yidana et al 2010 other anthropogenic processes including agricultural activities are also possible factors contributing to the groundwater this is because factor 2 loads positively with no3 and so4 2 the extensive use of fertilizers rich in no3 and so4 2 within the farming communities of the ga west municipal could be the source of these ions in the water nevertheless the concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in the water samples and the results of the factor analysis suggest that input from agrochemicals used in the area might have insignificant effect on the water chemistry but cannot be totally ruled out as seen in table 1 the no3 concentrations are below 1 00 mg l with the highest value as 1 9 mg l far lower than the permissible limit 200 mg l world health organization 2006 however the so4 2 concentrations 10 2 312 mg l appear to be slightly higher than the who guideline value 200 mg l in some of the water samples suggesting that the influence of agrochemicals such as sulphate and ammonia cannot be ruled out completely this is supported by a cross plot of the no3 and so4 2 concentrations of the groundwater samples which shows some dependence relationship fig 7 a factor 3 has strong positive loadings with temperature tds ec salinity mg2 hco3 so4 2 po4 3 f dissolved oxygen and total hardness this factor is described as the turbidity factor which highlights the contribution of sand mining activities on the general quality of the water yidana et al 2010 the widespread abundance of sand mining activities in amasaman akramaman and yawoman in the study area has had a debilitating effect on the terrestrial ecosystem for some time now therefore sand mining is one of the primary factors affecting the groundwater quality in the study area four spatial groundwater associations were observed from the r mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca fig 6b in this figure samples with similar values of the analyzed parameters were agglomerated by means of a truncated parallel two groups and four clusters were distinguished by their distinct tds values and water type these clusters have different degrees of water rock interaction residence time and recharge points cluster 1 reflects khco3 water type with low tds the relatively low tds values recorded by cluster 1 with khco3 water type point to low residence time hence shorter water rock interaction period the concentration of the individual ions and the tds values in cluster 1 suggest that these water types were generally within the world health organization 2006 recommended maximum limit and are suitable for domestic use in the study area cluster 2 also comprises of samples with lower tds values but having nahco3 water composition in contrast cluster 3 denotes a transitional water type with higher tds which seems to be an intermediary between cluster 1 and cluster 2 as well as cluster 1 and cluster 4 comparatively the samples in cluster 4 have higher tds values as in cluster 3 samples and are composed of nahco3 nacl water types especially at amasaman this suggests that groundwater hydrochemistry of the system could be influenced by water rock interaction 4 3 factors controlling groundwater chemistry gibbs plots gibbs 1970 are widely used to determine the possible factors controlling groundwater chemistry the amount of dissolved ions in groundwater is mostly controlled by the surrounding rock type in the watershed prevailing chemical reactions and water rock interaction e g elhatip et al 2003 choi et al 2005 chae et al 2006 fianko et al 2010 saka et al 2013 redwan et al 2016 rao et al 2017 avci et al 2018 the gibbs plot from the study area proposes chemical weathering of rocks as the dominant process governing groundwater chemistry fig 7b this implies that the groundwater hydrochemistry in the study area is controlled by water rock interaction moreover the higher tds values when correlated with the corresponding na na ca in the gibbs plot fig 7b imply that cation exchange reactions involving na and ca2 may also account for the variability in groundwater chemistry li et al 2013 2016 4 3 1 dissolution of minerals through rock weathering the minerals prevalent in the study area are associated with the underlying carbonate granitic rocks and halite nacl these minerals are mainly composed of calcite dolomite quartz muscovite orthoclase and plagioclase feldspars they could possibly serve as primary sources of major ions in the groundwater and thus influence the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study area the scatter plots presented in fig 8 provide more insight on sources of major ions such as weathering processes of the underlying rocks that may have influenced the groundwater chemistry na displays positive correlation with cl with some of the samples plotted along the 1 1 line fig 8a indicating the dissolution of halite equation 1 and seawater intrusion as the primary source of na and cl in those groundwater samples zarei et al 2014 this corroborates well with the findings of brammer 1967 and kortatsi 2006 that most of the soils and rocks in the accra plains along the ga west municipality with peripheral extensions in the densu basin contain elevated contents of halite a comparison of the samples with seawater anthoni 2006 further suggests some degree of influence from seawater intrusion into the aquifers consistent with the strong positive correlation fig 8a of the samples with seawater the effect of seawater intrusion on groundwater chemistry is observed in the rna cl against cl and ca hco3 so4 against na cl diagrams fig 8b and c the samples with na cl ratios 0 86 imply that the groundwater has been contaminated by seawater whereas those with na cl ratios 1 may have been contaminated by anthropogenic sources fig 8b naily 2018 on the ca hco3 so4 against na cl diagram 14 samples plot on the cl excess zone region of higher salinity while 15 samples plot on the base exchange area showing the influence of seawater on about 50 of the samples fig 8c abdalla 2016 however majority of the samples which inexpertly plots below the 1 1 line in fig 8a are likely to have originated from a sodium rich source other than halite perhaps albite naalsi3o8 or some form of ion exchange reaction that happens in the sub surface jankowski et al 1998 if it is albite dissolution then the reaction involved is presented in equation 2 reverse ion exchange involving na and cl can be invoked for the other samples that plot above the 1 1 line which explains the high cl concentrations in those samples fig 8a 1 nacl na cl 2 2naalsio3o8 2co2 11h2o3 al2sio5 oh5 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 according to adithya et al 2016 if silicate weathering produced excess na then this groundwater source will be dominated by hco3 perhaps the silicate minerals may have reacted with carbonic acid amidst water producing the hco3 sharif et al 2008 this confirms the dominance of hco3 in the groundwater to be the effect of weathering reaction of rocks in the study area the chemical dissolution of gypsum equation 3 can be invoked for supporting the presence of ca2 and so4 2 in the groundwater of the ga west municipality as observed in fig 8d almost all the samples plot away from the 2 1 line possibly suggesting that ca2 in those samples may have come from other sources especially the weathering of carbonate minerals li et al 2016 3 caso4 2h2o ca2 so4 2 2h2o it is suggested that the dissolution of dolomite and calcite may have also played a critical role in the ca2 and hco3 enrichment in groundwater when dolomite dissociates it increases the ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations in solution equation 4 whereas dissolution of calcite discharges ca2 and hco3 into water equation 5 the effect of dissolution of these minerals in groundwater under this study is observed in fig 8e and f where some of the samples plot along and below the 1 1 line the other samples that plot further below the 1 1 lines imply that there are other sources which influence the concentration of ca2 in the groundwater 4 camg co3 2 2h ca2 mg2 2hco3 5 caco3 h ca2 hco3 sunkari et al 2018 recently mentioned that fluoride f concentrations in groundwater are associated with alkaline environments which are enriched in na and hco3 by this premise plots of the f concentrations in the investigated water samples against their na hco3 concentrations and ph show increasing trends of f with these parameters fig 8g h i that are consistent with the hypothesis of sunkari et al 2018 gypsum dolomite calcite anhydrite and fluorite have ca2 as common ion in their chemical structures li et al 2016 stated that the dissolution of anhydrite gypsum and fluorite may cause the dissolution of dolomite and calcite to assess the dissolution precipitation of these minerals their saturation indices were calculated by means of phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 and plotted on a graph in fig 9 it is observed that gypsum and fluorite are dominated by negative saturation indices ranging from 3 01 to 1 16 and 2 52 to 0 49 respectively fig 9 implying that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to these minerals fig 9 the saturation indices of dolomite 4 74 3 31 calcite 2 79 1 71 and anhydrite 2 93 1 57 appear to be in transition from under saturation to saturation state fig 9 the positive saturation indices for dolomite calcite and anhydrite displayed by some of the samples fig 9 suggest that those samples are saturated with respect to dolomite calcite and anhydrite under present conditions and thus reflect longer residence times ako et al 2012 the other samples with negative saturation indices for dolomite calcite and anhydrite imply that these minerals had shorter residence time in the groundwater and may have been suddenly precipitated into the water it is therefore clear that ca2 dominance in the groundwater may have been the result of dissolution of gypsum and fluorite which later catalyzed the precipitation of dolomite calcite and anhydrite in groundwater all the groundwater samples are under saturated with respect to albite and halite fig 9 thus the na and cl loadings may be largely due to reverse ion exchange jankowski et al 1998 4 3 2 anthropogenic activities several studies available in literature have proposed that the variations in hydrogeochemical properties of groundwater such as tds major ions and nitrates may be contributions from anthropogenic activities like application of different fertilizers in farms industrial effluents and poor sanitation e g marghade et al 2012 keesari et al 2016 sunkari and danladi 2016 berhe et al 2017 in this study the dependence relationship between no3 and so4 2 fig 7a gives a clue that anthropogenic input partly controls the groundwater chemistry additionally the plot of the na cl ratios of the samples against their cl concentrations shows that 18 samples representing 52 of the total samples are affected by anthropogenic contamination fig 8b this is likely from agricultural activities in the municipality since it is well known for its agricultural potential and many farmers use diverse fertilizers ranging from ammonium sulphate to npk based nutrients for good crop yield continuous application of these fertilizers enriches the soil nutrients irrigation farming which is dominant in the municipality may lead to the draining of soil nutrients from the fertilizers and percolation into the shallow aquifers which influences groundwater chemistry 4 4 suitability for domestic purposes for drinking water ph values ranging from 6 5 to 8 0 are acceptable and fall within the world health organization 2006 recommended limit for safe water in this study ph of groundwater samples from the municipality range from 4 35 to 7 87 with a mean and standard deviation of 6 83 and 0 53 respectively barcelona et al 1985 mentioned that acidic waters occur when the ph is lower than 4 5 ph units thus groundwater in the ga west municipality corresponds to slightly acidic and alkaline conditions with regard to the groundwater ionic composition in the study area sodium na is the most abundant cation table 1 generally the permissible limit of na ion in groundwater for domestic use stipulated by world health organization 2006 is 200 mg l however na concentration of groundwater in the study area is above the world health organization 2006 maximum permissible limit and thus poses health hazard for drinking purposes microorganisms are unable to remove cl from water and have the potential of making drinking water salty due to chemical reactions with some cations high levels of cl with an average value of 488 mg l renders drinking water in fifteen 15 communities in the study area unsafe due to its salty nature and have the possibility of corroding pipes and plumbing fixtures sunkari and danladi 2016 so4 2 of high concentration can cause gastro intestinal disorders the so4 2 levels are generally within accepted limits except samples from the odumase area with values exceeding conventional levels of world health organization 2006 ca2 is required in drinking water to prevent protein deficiencies and also to prevent cardiac disorders the level of ca2 in drinking water is below accepted levels with twenty communities sample locations exposed to potential cardiac issues who 2006 with time generally almost all the groundwater samples have ca2 values below the world health organization 2006 recommended guideline value 200 mg l for calcium this implies that water from the boreholes in the ga west municipality is potable the high levels of tds in all the groundwater samples however render the water unsafe for drinking this could be due to marine water intrusion which has the ability of giving the drinking water in the area an unpleasant taste yidana et al 2010 all the borehole samples have elevated total hardness average of 775 mg l except sample 1 when compared with the who guideline value of 200 mg l hence making them unsuitable for direct consumption without pretreatment it is interpreted to be as a result of the high concentrations of ca2 and mg2 nitrate contamination is not a problem in the study area the relatively small variation in the nitrate distribution 0 11 1 9 mg l may imply that groundwater contamination from agricultural and anthropogenic activities is small 4 5 suitability for irrigation the salinity levels and sodium concentrations relative to the abundance of other major cations were used in determining the suitability of the water in the study area for irrigation purposes elevated levels of salinity in irrigation waters are detrimental to the viability of the irrigation soil and the irrigable crops yidana et al 2008 if the irrigation waters are very saline they can reduce the osmotic ability of the crops and therefore impede the absorption of water from the soils to all parts of the plants adomako et al 2011 this is capable of causing physiological dearth of plants despite the availability of water in the soil yidana et al 2008 sodium adsorption ratio sar helped in determining the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation fig 10 is a wilcox diagram illustrating the variation of the sar values in different locations the sar values generally range from low to medium values 0 25 14 it is interpreted that the low sar values may be the result of abundant alkaline earth metals as compared to the alkali metals about 50 of the samples plot within the c4s2 group 20 in the c4s1 group 20 in the c3s1 group and the remaining 10 samples plot within the c3s2 region fig 10 the samples have low to medium sodium hazard values with high to very high salinity hazard values on the wilcox diagram fig 10 this suggests that the water is suitable for irrigational purposes considering the sodium hazard values but a mixing of the different saline waters is required prior to irrigation to reduce the salinity effects in the area however if the crops are salt tolerant then mixing is not necessary the use of the water for irrigation purposes despite the high salinity also depends on the soil conditions because low permeability can cause the soil to withhold more salts thereby resulting in the accumulation of excess salt in the soil comparison of the ec values of the analyzed water samples with table 3 below after li et al 2016 suggests that groundwater samples have acceptable to unacceptable quality for irrigation purposes since their ec values range from 1768 35600 μs cm 5 conclusions groundwater chemistry and its suitability for domestic and irrigational purposes were investigated in twenty nine 29 locations in the ga west municipality ghana the predominant cations and anions in the groundwater are na ca2 and hco3 cl respectively the major ion concentrations in the water samples are in the order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 which accounted for the dominance of nahco3 cl and nacahco3 cl types of water in the area all the analyzed physicochemical parameters are generally within the drinking water permissible limits of the who except tds total hardness na and cl in more than half of the communities in the municipality which is interpreted to be the result of domestic solid waste leachate and saltwater intrusion the resultant effect is salty and misty drinking water which causes some damage to water supply systems within the study area as a result of the low sar values the ga west municipal waters are suitable for irrigation without the proclivity of posing sodium hazards in irrigation waters however mixing of waters of different salinities is highly recommended to counteract the effects of salinity on the water earmarked for irrigation in the area the groundwater chemistry in the ga west municipality is primarily controlled by seawater intrusion the influx of chemicals from solid waste chemistry of precipitation sand mining activities rock weathering and agrochemicals all these occur due to the fact that the groundwater has long residence time to enhance significant water rock interaction this is evident in the identified water types which are enriched in na and hco3 relative to the other ions acknowledgement the authors thank the faculty of geosciences of the university for development studies ghana for field logistics support the first author also acknowledges the

12306,this study was conducted to appraise the quality of groundwater for irrigation and domestic water supply in the ga west municipality ghana a total of 29 borehole water samples were collected for hydrogeochemical analysis and interpreted using hydrogeochemical plots and multivariate statistical analysis the relative abundance of the major ions in the analyzed water samples were in the order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 trilinear piper plot shows that nahco3 cl and nacahco3 cl are the dominant water types in the area the ca2 and hco3 in these type of waters are primarily from dissolution of carbonate minerals whilst the na and cl may have been input from water rock interaction with granitic rocks seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities in the watershed all the analyzed physico chemical parameters are within the acceptable limits of the world health organization who for drinking except tds total hardness na and cl which could be as a result of solid waste leachate and marine water intrusion the samples have low to medium sodium hazard values with high to very high salinity hazard values when plotted on the wilcox diagram this suggests that the water is suitable for irrigation purposes with regard to sodium hazard but a mixing of the high salinity water with low salinity water is highly recommended prior to irrigation to reduce the salinity hazard in the area however if the crops are salt tolerant then mixing is not necessary three factors explain 99 8 of the total variance and suggest that water rock interaction is the most important factor that controls the groundwater chemistry besides some contribution from agricultural activities and seawater mixing are the other factors influencing the groundwater chemistry these factors are indicated by the positive correlation among the individual hydrochemical parameters graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater hydrogeochemistry water rock interaction seawater intrusion anthropogenic sources ghana 1 introduction groundwater has been widely recommended notwithstanding its scarce accessibility availability and cost for usage in domestic and irrigational purposes due to its less susceptibility to anthropogenic activities and climate variability mahlknecht et al 2004 sunkari et al 2018 groundwater according to yidana et al 2010 does not require rigorous treatment processes to make it suitable for usage however the quality of groundwater for both domestic and irrigational purposes requires periodic assessment li et al 2016 berhe et al 2017 since irrigation schemes play a fundamental role in developing economies that rely heavily on agriculture for food and cash crop production boateng et al 2012 in ghana irrigation farming has a stake in eradicating poverty and to a larger extent unemployment however the unpredictable nature of the rainfall pattern in ghana has had a great deal of negative impact on crop yields which for some time now has resulted in reduction in foreign exchange earnings from crop production although the role of irrigation schemes in safeguarding global food security cannot be overemphasized it is worthwhile to decipher the rippling effects of using irrigation waters that are of very poor quality in view of their contribution to human sustainability through crop production the quality of irrigation soils can be affected by using water that is highly saline and highly sodic this has affected crop production even in larger economies like china and india which practice irrigation farming on a larger scale adomako et al 2011 continuous use of such water renders the soil unsuitable for productive irrigation with the attendant failure of crop production overtime on this basis assessment of the quality of groundwater for utilization in irrigation schemes and even for domestic purposes should be done regularly across the globe such an assessment must be conducted against the type of soils to be used in the irrigation schemes in order not to waste resources moreover the type of crops to be produced should be held in view when doing such an assessment because most crops cannot withstand concentrations of some ions in the soil and have different tolerable limits of salinity for instance it is well established that apart from the tolerable limits of specific ions in soils and water for irrigation the sodium ion concentration against alkali earth metals such as calcium and magnesium is a key determinant of the suitability of water for irrigation purposes the sodium adsorption ratio sar is a guide for measuring the concentrations of sodium as well as the combined concentration of calcium and magnesium li et al 2016 it is a perfect match with electrical conductivity ec when assessing the salinity levels of irrigation waters another scheme is the wilcox 1955 diagram which is a plot of the percentage sodium against the ec the uniqueness of the current study is to decipher the source of groundwater and its implication on the suitability of the underlying aquifers for irrigation schemes in ghana this kind of assessment has been conducted in several areas similar to ghana e g wanda et al 2013 and the quality of the groundwater for irrigation has been found to be affected by diverse factors depending on the location of the resource paramount among these factors are the hydrogeochemical parameters which vary overtime the source of the chemical constituents of the ga west municipality in ghana is however unclear notwithstanding the significance of this knowledge for safe and effective groundwater usage and management practices there are several solid waste disposal sites along the western part of the study area such as the oblogo and mallam landfills in the erstwhile ga district where the ga west municipality was carved from these landfills serve as a threat to the underlying groundwater resources the presence of active sand mines in most of the communities including akramaman yawoman and amasaman is also causing a great deal of worry in view of the groundwater in these areas seawater intrusion is also likely to be a principal control on the groundwater chemistry considering the location of the area within the coastal part of ghana despite all these anthropogenic and natural threats little is known about the groundwater quality in the ga west municipality geological and hydrogeological properties of the ga west municipality and its vicinity are only studied by water resources research institutewrri 2003 ganyaglo et al 2010 and saka et al 2013 this current study intends to appraise the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in the study area and ascertain its implication for domestic and irrigation purposes in addition the study also aims to decipher the possible source s of groundwater pollution using multivariate statistical techniques 2 study area ghana is divided into three main drainage features namely the volta river southern river system and coastal river system the ga west municipality lies within the coastal river system and is located in the greater accra region of ghana fig 1 it lies within latitude 50 48 10 n and 50 35 20 n and longitude 00 23 30 w and 00 4 50 w and shares boundaries with ga east and the accra metropolitan assembly to the east akwapim south to the north and ga south and ga central to the south the ga west municipality occupies a land area of approximately 284 08 sq km with about 412 communities it has a relatively low relief with a few high elevations the climate varies throughout the year in all parts of the municipality as a result of the vast nature of the coastal basins but usually feature cooler temperature 29 4 c in august with the hottest temperature 34 8 c occurring in march and an annual average temperature of 28 5 c precipitation in the form of rainfall is the principal climatic factor that affects peri urban agriculture and socioeconomic life in the municipality the greater part of the area receives copious rainfall from april to june with a peak in june representing the major rainy season whereas the minor rainy season starts from september to mid october with a peak in october ofori sarpong and annor 2001 the municipality has well drained sandy clay loam to clay soils in some areas with abundant rough stone concretions and quartz gravels ga west municipality is largely underlain by rocks of the dahomeyan formation and the togo series fig 1 the dahomeyan is variably composed of gneisses ranging from medium grained foliated biotite quartz diorite gneiss to hornblende quartz diorite gneiss saka et al 2013 the togo series unconformably overly the dahomeyan gneisses fig 2 they are mainly composed of quartzites phyllites schists and marbles there are pockets of carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite which have all been metamorphosed into marble marmorised in some localities fig 2 the togo series is intruded by a unique granite complex known as the cape coast granite complex ccgc figs 1 and 2 the ccgc is characterized by a series of granitic to quartz diorite gneisses the aquifers in this complex are within the weathered fractured zones according to water resources research institutewrri 2003 the borehole depths here vary from 9 0 to 103 0 m with static water levels in the range of 1 5 8 2 m the yields of these boreholes range from 0 72 to 9 m3 h 1 ganyaglo et al 2010 the dahomeyan and togo series have undergone multiple deformational episodes which are manifested by high degrees of metamorphism faulting jointing and intense folding adomako et al 2011 the structures in the rocks serve as good conduits for groundwater flow locally the contact between quartzites and argillaceous rocks around the valleys in the area is associated with the development of springs such as those in the akwapim togo range saka et al 2013 stated that the borehole depths in the dahomeyan and the togo series vary from 28 0 to 97 0 m comparable to those in the ccgc the weathered zones where the groundwater occurs are generally characterized by varying thicknesses 3 0 36 0 m available borehole data in the area suggests that the static water level changes from 1 1 to 17 9 m with yields in the range of 0 6 6 0 m3 h 1 averaging about 2 8 m3 h 1 saka et al 2013 3 materials and methods a total of 29 groundwater samples were collected from active boreholes used for domestic and irrigational purposes across the study area during the sample collection care was taken to avoid contamination from any source therefore known standard procedures for well purging were employed the location and coordinates of all the sample points were recorded by means of a gps prior to sample collection the boreholes were pumped up to 5 min to purge the aquifers and avoid contamination from the water to be sampled the samples were collected using preconditioned 250 ml polyethylene bottles physical parameters such as temperature ph alkalinity total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec were measured directly in the field using a multi parameter handheld meter the samples were later vacuum filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane for major ion analysis in the laboratory aliquots of the samples were acidified with 1 v v hno3 for major cation analysis whereas the remaining samples were sent for major anion analysis at the ghana atomic energy commission gaec accra the accuracy of the analysis was achieved by the charge balance error equation of hounslow 1995 which resulted in 5 concentration of the major cations and anions the saturation indices of the identified mineral phases in the groundwater were calculated using phreeqc software package parkhurst and appelo 1999 in order to identify the spatial groundwater associations in the study area the data were run through r mode factor analysis and q mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca using the procedures detailed in imbrie 1963 squared euclidean distance and ward s linkage were respectively used in determining the similarity or dissimilarity of the data and linking the clusters produced this has been proven in the literature to always give the best results for multivariate classification schemes e g yidana et al 2008 during the r mode factor analysis the extraction method used was principal component analysis whilst the rotation algorithm used was varimax rotation in order to minimize the number of factors to model kaiser criterion was used which enabled iteration on only three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 stanton and diggle 2013 the quality of the investigated water samples for irrigation purposes was assessed using the sar equation details in li et al 2016 the wilcox diagram was therefore generated based on this equation to characterize the irrigation quality of the groundwater from the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry statistical summary of the major hydrochemical parameters analyzed in this study are presented in table 1 they are compared with the guideline values of the world health organization world health organization 2006 the ph values recorded in the analyzed water samples range from 4 35 to 7 87 with a mean of 6 79 this suggests that the groundwater in the area is near neutral ph and largely acidic the temperatures of the water at the time of the sample collection changed from 26 8 to 30 1 c with an average of 28 30 c implying that the waters were not influenced by any form of geothermal water the concentration of tds also range from 884 to 17800 mg l with an average of 4467 14 mg l the higher concentration of tds in the analyzed water samples strongly suggests that they are not entirely freshwater samples the electrical conductivity values are very high in all the analyzed samples and range from 1768 to 35600 μs cm with an average value of 10192 17 μs cm total hardness changed from a lower limit of 200 mg l to an upper limit of 6000 mg l averaging at 775 34 mg l only sample 1 recorded a lower limit 200 mg l whereas the other samples showed elevated values when correlated with the who value of 200 mg l this trend is expected since ca2 and mg2 appear to be dominant in the water samples from this area the na concentrations are somewhat high in most of the samples since their concentrations exceed the 200 mg l acceptable limit proposed by the who for instance the highest na concentration 683 mg l is observed in sample 22 around the municipal capital amasaman the k concentrations are however relatively low in the groundwater samples except sample 6 which recorded the highest k concentration 214 mg l the rest of the samples are all within the who acceptable limit for safe drinking water of 200 mg l the cation concentrations are in the order na ca2 mg2 k fig 3 the dominant anions observed in the analyzed water samples are hco3 and cl the hco3 concentrations varied from 350 to 2000 mg l with an average of 674 mg l whereas the cl concentrations varied from 29 9 to 3798 mg l with an average of 390 mg l generally the concentrations of the major anions are in the order hco3 cl so4 2 fig 3 the fluoride f concentrations are relatively low with a minimum value of 0 21 mg l and a maximum value of 1 88 mg l slightly higher than the who acceptable limit of 1 5 mg l perhaps due to dissolution of micas which contain fluoride sunkari et al 2018 it is well established in literature that nitrate no3 is a major pollutant in groundwater emanating from agricultural and industrial effluents e g vikas et al 2015 from the hydrochemical analysis conducted on the water samples from the study area the no3 concentrations are low 0 11 1 9 mg l trilinear piper diagram has been widely used in showing the results of several hydrochemical analysis on one graph which is capable of grouping analyzed samples and identifying different hydrochemical facies piper 1953 in this study a trilinear piper plot was used to determine the hydrochemical facies and types of groundwater samples in the study area fig 4 the plot reveals the following groups of groundwater nahco3 cl 31 namghco3 cl 13 5 nacahco3 cl 13 5 naclhco3 10 nacamghco3 cl 5 5 nacamghco3 5 5 namgkhco3 3 5 nacahco3 3 5 nacaclhco3 3 5 mgnacl 3 5 mgcahco3 3 5 mgnahco3 cl 3 5 suggesting that the dominant type of water in the ga west municipality is nahco3 cl followed by nacahco3 cl the ca2 and hco3 in these type of waters are primarily from the dissolution of carbonate minerals geogenic input derived from the togo series which contains some dolomitic marble and limestone fig 2 whilst the na and cl may have been derived from salinization by halite dissolution in the unsaturated zones in the coastal area and or seawater intrusion keesari et al 2016 this is consistent with the location of the municipality along the coastal basins the high na and hco3 concentrations of the groundwater may also come from weathering and dissolution of magmatic and metamorphic rocks such as granite from the ccgc and gneisses phyllites and schists from the togo and dahomeyan series which show fractured aquifer characteristics in the study area it is thus suggested that saline waters from the coastal basins might have mixed with the groundwater and carbonate minerals in the underlying carbonate rocks of the togo series might have also dissolved into the groundwater resulting in the two major water types ion exchange processes within these water types are also present in all the ga west municipal groundwater shows characteristics associated with recharge water from a regional groundwater system dominated by na and hco3 enriched in tds and having acidic to slightly alkaline ph schoeller semi logarithmic plot fig 5 schoeller 1962 was used in discriminating the samples that show similar ionic distribution patterns it is observed that sample 15 has the highest ca2 and na concentrations sample 7 shows the highest mg2 cl and so4 2 concentrations whilst sample 9 has the highest hco3 concentration apart from these samples the trends of all the other samples overlap one another implying that they may have evolved from a common source albeit some form of mixing perhaps from seawater fig 5 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis three factors were obtained from the factor analysis which accounted for more than 99 8 of the total variance of the hydrochemical parameters with eigenvalues greater than 1 table 2 factor 1 loads strongly with most of the major ions fig 6 a representing 27 4 of the total variance in the three factors which exhausted the dissolved oxygen do present in the water do content of groundwater usually decreases as a result of circulation in the sub surface thus lower do contents point to longer residence time and so adequate water rock interaction in the aquifer the strong positive loadings of factor 1 with ca mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 table 2 fig 6a is an approximation for the dissolution of carbonate bearing rocks belonging to the togo series as the principal control on groundwater chemistry moreover borehole depths up to 40 m intersect the togo series which rests on the dahomeyan formation all the studied boreholes were drilled within the togo series with depths ranging from 28 to 51 m fig 2 therefore the groundwater chemistry reflects the geochemical composition of rocks in the togo series which accounts for the loadings in factor 1 factor 2 loads strongly with all the parameters except k hco3 and po4 3 ions fig 6a table 2 this factor highlights the effect of seawater intrusion and dissolution of halite in the soils these contributions are further manifested by the strong positive correlation between na and cl in the analyzed water samples fig 8a previously yidana et al 2010 proposed that the influence of rainfall and chemical disintegration of geologic materials were the causes for variation in groundwater chemistry in the area owing to the fact that factor 2 also loads strongly on ca and mg2 the weathering of dolomite and calcite from carbonate rocks of the togo series is the most likely source of contribution of these ions to the groundwater and supports the proposition of yidana et al 2010 other anthropogenic processes including agricultural activities are also possible factors contributing to the groundwater this is because factor 2 loads positively with no3 and so4 2 the extensive use of fertilizers rich in no3 and so4 2 within the farming communities of the ga west municipal could be the source of these ions in the water nevertheless the concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in the water samples and the results of the factor analysis suggest that input from agrochemicals used in the area might have insignificant effect on the water chemistry but cannot be totally ruled out as seen in table 1 the no3 concentrations are below 1 00 mg l with the highest value as 1 9 mg l far lower than the permissible limit 200 mg l world health organization 2006 however the so4 2 concentrations 10 2 312 mg l appear to be slightly higher than the who guideline value 200 mg l in some of the water samples suggesting that the influence of agrochemicals such as sulphate and ammonia cannot be ruled out completely this is supported by a cross plot of the no3 and so4 2 concentrations of the groundwater samples which shows some dependence relationship fig 7 a factor 3 has strong positive loadings with temperature tds ec salinity mg2 hco3 so4 2 po4 3 f dissolved oxygen and total hardness this factor is described as the turbidity factor which highlights the contribution of sand mining activities on the general quality of the water yidana et al 2010 the widespread abundance of sand mining activities in amasaman akramaman and yawoman in the study area has had a debilitating effect on the terrestrial ecosystem for some time now therefore sand mining is one of the primary factors affecting the groundwater quality in the study area four spatial groundwater associations were observed from the r mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca fig 6b in this figure samples with similar values of the analyzed parameters were agglomerated by means of a truncated parallel two groups and four clusters were distinguished by their distinct tds values and water type these clusters have different degrees of water rock interaction residence time and recharge points cluster 1 reflects khco3 water type with low tds the relatively low tds values recorded by cluster 1 with khco3 water type point to low residence time hence shorter water rock interaction period the concentration of the individual ions and the tds values in cluster 1 suggest that these water types were generally within the world health organization 2006 recommended maximum limit and are suitable for domestic use in the study area cluster 2 also comprises of samples with lower tds values but having nahco3 water composition in contrast cluster 3 denotes a transitional water type with higher tds which seems to be an intermediary between cluster 1 and cluster 2 as well as cluster 1 and cluster 4 comparatively the samples in cluster 4 have higher tds values as in cluster 3 samples and are composed of nahco3 nacl water types especially at amasaman this suggests that groundwater hydrochemistry of the system could be influenced by water rock interaction 4 3 factors controlling groundwater chemistry gibbs plots gibbs 1970 are widely used to determine the possible factors controlling groundwater chemistry the amount of dissolved ions in groundwater is mostly controlled by the surrounding rock type in the watershed prevailing chemical reactions and water rock interaction e g elhatip et al 2003 choi et al 2005 chae et al 2006 fianko et al 2010 saka et al 2013 redwan et al 2016 rao et al 2017 avci et al 2018 the gibbs plot from the study area proposes chemical weathering of rocks as the dominant process governing groundwater chemistry fig 7b this implies that the groundwater hydrochemistry in the study area is controlled by water rock interaction moreover the higher tds values when correlated with the corresponding na na ca in the gibbs plot fig 7b imply that cation exchange reactions involving na and ca2 may also account for the variability in groundwater chemistry li et al 2013 2016 4 3 1 dissolution of minerals through rock weathering the minerals prevalent in the study area are associated with the underlying carbonate granitic rocks and halite nacl these minerals are mainly composed of calcite dolomite quartz muscovite orthoclase and plagioclase feldspars they could possibly serve as primary sources of major ions in the groundwater and thus influence the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study area the scatter plots presented in fig 8 provide more insight on sources of major ions such as weathering processes of the underlying rocks that may have influenced the groundwater chemistry na displays positive correlation with cl with some of the samples plotted along the 1 1 line fig 8a indicating the dissolution of halite equation 1 and seawater intrusion as the primary source of na and cl in those groundwater samples zarei et al 2014 this corroborates well with the findings of brammer 1967 and kortatsi 2006 that most of the soils and rocks in the accra plains along the ga west municipality with peripheral extensions in the densu basin contain elevated contents of halite a comparison of the samples with seawater anthoni 2006 further suggests some degree of influence from seawater intrusion into the aquifers consistent with the strong positive correlation fig 8a of the samples with seawater the effect of seawater intrusion on groundwater chemistry is observed in the rna cl against cl and ca hco3 so4 against na cl diagrams fig 8b and c the samples with na cl ratios 0 86 imply that the groundwater has been contaminated by seawater whereas those with na cl ratios 1 may have been contaminated by anthropogenic sources fig 8b naily 2018 on the ca hco3 so4 against na cl diagram 14 samples plot on the cl excess zone region of higher salinity while 15 samples plot on the base exchange area showing the influence of seawater on about 50 of the samples fig 8c abdalla 2016 however majority of the samples which inexpertly plots below the 1 1 line in fig 8a are likely to have originated from a sodium rich source other than halite perhaps albite naalsi3o8 or some form of ion exchange reaction that happens in the sub surface jankowski et al 1998 if it is albite dissolution then the reaction involved is presented in equation 2 reverse ion exchange involving na and cl can be invoked for the other samples that plot above the 1 1 line which explains the high cl concentrations in those samples fig 8a 1 nacl na cl 2 2naalsio3o8 2co2 11h2o3 al2sio5 oh5 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 according to adithya et al 2016 if silicate weathering produced excess na then this groundwater source will be dominated by hco3 perhaps the silicate minerals may have reacted with carbonic acid amidst water producing the hco3 sharif et al 2008 this confirms the dominance of hco3 in the groundwater to be the effect of weathering reaction of rocks in the study area the chemical dissolution of gypsum equation 3 can be invoked for supporting the presence of ca2 and so4 2 in the groundwater of the ga west municipality as observed in fig 8d almost all the samples plot away from the 2 1 line possibly suggesting that ca2 in those samples may have come from other sources especially the weathering of carbonate minerals li et al 2016 3 caso4 2h2o ca2 so4 2 2h2o it is suggested that the dissolution of dolomite and calcite may have also played a critical role in the ca2 and hco3 enrichment in groundwater when dolomite dissociates it increases the ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations in solution equation 4 whereas dissolution of calcite discharges ca2 and hco3 into water equation 5 the effect of dissolution of these minerals in groundwater under this study is observed in fig 8e and f where some of the samples plot along and below the 1 1 line the other samples that plot further below the 1 1 lines imply that there are other sources which influence the concentration of ca2 in the groundwater 4 camg co3 2 2h ca2 mg2 2hco3 5 caco3 h ca2 hco3 sunkari et al 2018 recently mentioned that fluoride f concentrations in groundwater are associated with alkaline environments which are enriched in na and hco3 by this premise plots of the f concentrations in the investigated water samples against their na hco3 concentrations and ph show increasing trends of f with these parameters fig 8g h i that are consistent with the hypothesis of sunkari et al 2018 gypsum dolomite calcite anhydrite and fluorite have ca2 as common ion in their chemical structures li et al 2016 stated that the dissolution of anhydrite gypsum and fluorite may cause the dissolution of dolomite and calcite to assess the dissolution precipitation of these minerals their saturation indices were calculated by means of phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 and plotted on a graph in fig 9 it is observed that gypsum and fluorite are dominated by negative saturation indices ranging from 3 01 to 1 16 and 2 52 to 0 49 respectively fig 9 implying that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to these minerals fig 9 the saturation indices of dolomite 4 74 3 31 calcite 2 79 1 71 and anhydrite 2 93 1 57 appear to be in transition from under saturation to saturation state fig 9 the positive saturation indices for dolomite calcite and anhydrite displayed by some of the samples fig 9 suggest that those samples are saturated with respect to dolomite calcite and anhydrite under present conditions and thus reflect longer residence times ako et al 2012 the other samples with negative saturation indices for dolomite calcite and anhydrite imply that these minerals had shorter residence time in the groundwater and may have been suddenly precipitated into the water it is therefore clear that ca2 dominance in the groundwater may have been the result of dissolution of gypsum and fluorite which later catalyzed the precipitation of dolomite calcite and anhydrite in groundwater all the groundwater samples are under saturated with respect to albite and halite fig 9 thus the na and cl loadings may be largely due to reverse ion exchange jankowski et al 1998 4 3 2 anthropogenic activities several studies available in literature have proposed that the variations in hydrogeochemical properties of groundwater such as tds major ions and nitrates may be contributions from anthropogenic activities like application of different fertilizers in farms industrial effluents and poor sanitation e g marghade et al 2012 keesari et al 2016 sunkari and danladi 2016 berhe et al 2017 in this study the dependence relationship between no3 and so4 2 fig 7a gives a clue that anthropogenic input partly controls the groundwater chemistry additionally the plot of the na cl ratios of the samples against their cl concentrations shows that 18 samples representing 52 of the total samples are affected by anthropogenic contamination fig 8b this is likely from agricultural activities in the municipality since it is well known for its agricultural potential and many farmers use diverse fertilizers ranging from ammonium sulphate to npk based nutrients for good crop yield continuous application of these fertilizers enriches the soil nutrients irrigation farming which is dominant in the municipality may lead to the draining of soil nutrients from the fertilizers and percolation into the shallow aquifers which influences groundwater chemistry 4 4 suitability for domestic purposes for drinking water ph values ranging from 6 5 to 8 0 are acceptable and fall within the world health organization 2006 recommended limit for safe water in this study ph of groundwater samples from the municipality range from 4 35 to 7 87 with a mean and standard deviation of 6 83 and 0 53 respectively barcelona et al 1985 mentioned that acidic waters occur when the ph is lower than 4 5 ph units thus groundwater in the ga west municipality corresponds to slightly acidic and alkaline conditions with regard to the groundwater ionic composition in the study area sodium na is the most abundant cation table 1 generally the permissible limit of na ion in groundwater for domestic use stipulated by world health organization 2006 is 200 mg l however na concentration of groundwater in the study area is above the world health organization 2006 maximum permissible limit and thus poses health hazard for drinking purposes microorganisms are unable to remove cl from water and have the potential of making drinking water salty due to chemical reactions with some cations high levels of cl with an average value of 488 mg l renders drinking water in fifteen 15 communities in the study area unsafe due to its salty nature and have the possibility of corroding pipes and plumbing fixtures sunkari and danladi 2016 so4 2 of high concentration can cause gastro intestinal disorders the so4 2 levels are generally within accepted limits except samples from the odumase area with values exceeding conventional levels of world health organization 2006 ca2 is required in drinking water to prevent protein deficiencies and also to prevent cardiac disorders the level of ca2 in drinking water is below accepted levels with twenty communities sample locations exposed to potential cardiac issues who 2006 with time generally almost all the groundwater samples have ca2 values below the world health organization 2006 recommended guideline value 200 mg l for calcium this implies that water from the boreholes in the ga west municipality is potable the high levels of tds in all the groundwater samples however render the water unsafe for drinking this could be due to marine water intrusion which has the ability of giving the drinking water in the area an unpleasant taste yidana et al 2010 all the borehole samples have elevated total hardness average of 775 mg l except sample 1 when compared with the who guideline value of 200 mg l hence making them unsuitable for direct consumption without pretreatment it is interpreted to be as a result of the high concentrations of ca2 and mg2 nitrate contamination is not a problem in the study area the relatively small variation in the nitrate distribution 0 11 1 9 mg l may imply that groundwater contamination from agricultural and anthropogenic activities is small 4 5 suitability for irrigation the salinity levels and sodium concentrations relative to the abundance of other major cations were used in determining the suitability of the water in the study area for irrigation purposes elevated levels of salinity in irrigation waters are detrimental to the viability of the irrigation soil and the irrigable crops yidana et al 2008 if the irrigation waters are very saline they can reduce the osmotic ability of the crops and therefore impede the absorption of water from the soils to all parts of the plants adomako et al 2011 this is capable of causing physiological dearth of plants despite the availability of water in the soil yidana et al 2008 sodium adsorption ratio sar helped in determining the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation fig 10 is a wilcox diagram illustrating the variation of the sar values in different locations the sar values generally range from low to medium values 0 25 14 it is interpreted that the low sar values may be the result of abundant alkaline earth metals as compared to the alkali metals about 50 of the samples plot within the c4s2 group 20 in the c4s1 group 20 in the c3s1 group and the remaining 10 samples plot within the c3s2 region fig 10 the samples have low to medium sodium hazard values with high to very high salinity hazard values on the wilcox diagram fig 10 this suggests that the water is suitable for irrigational purposes considering the sodium hazard values but a mixing of the different saline waters is required prior to irrigation to reduce the salinity effects in the area however if the crops are salt tolerant then mixing is not necessary the use of the water for irrigation purposes despite the high salinity also depends on the soil conditions because low permeability can cause the soil to withhold more salts thereby resulting in the accumulation of excess salt in the soil comparison of the ec values of the analyzed water samples with table 3 below after li et al 2016 suggests that groundwater samples have acceptable to unacceptable quality for irrigation purposes since their ec values range from 1768 35600 μs cm 5 conclusions groundwater chemistry and its suitability for domestic and irrigational purposes were investigated in twenty nine 29 locations in the ga west municipality ghana the predominant cations and anions in the groundwater are na ca2 and hco3 cl respectively the major ion concentrations in the water samples are in the order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 which accounted for the dominance of nahco3 cl and nacahco3 cl types of water in the area all the analyzed physicochemical parameters are generally within the drinking water permissible limits of the who except tds total hardness na and cl in more than half of the communities in the municipality which is interpreted to be the result of domestic solid waste leachate and saltwater intrusion the resultant effect is salty and misty drinking water which causes some damage to water supply systems within the study area as a result of the low sar values the ga west municipal waters are suitable for irrigation without the proclivity of posing sodium hazards in irrigation waters however mixing of waters of different salinities is highly recommended to counteract the effects of salinity on the water earmarked for irrigation in the area the groundwater chemistry in the ga west municipality is primarily controlled by seawater intrusion the influx of chemicals from solid waste chemistry of precipitation sand mining activities rock weathering and agrochemicals all these occur due to the fact that the groundwater has long residence time to enhance significant water rock interaction this is evident in the identified water types which are enriched in na and hco3 relative to the other ions acknowledgement the authors thank the faculty of geosciences of the university for development studies ghana for field logistics support the first author also acknowledges the

acceptable the adsorbents must be efficient and eco friendly but also abundantly available clays comply with most of these features and have been applied in various fields of adsorption phenomena bentonite is a swelling clay mineral which is widely used as adsorbent for pharmaceutical micro pollutants because of their abundance low cost and their high textural properties especially exchangeable cations in the interlayer spaces property these cations counterbalance the permanent negative charge on the bentonite surfaces caused by isomorphic substitution in the crystal lattice however the raw bentonite rb is less effective for the adsorption of hydrophobic or non polar organic pollutants tabak1 et al 2007 thus modified bentonite is being developed by substitution of the interlayer exchangeable cations with some organic cations such as alkylammonium cations via ion exchange reactions the expansion of the interlayer spacing results from the irreversible substitution of inorganic exchangeable cations by organic ones in the interlayer space of the clay boudiaf and boutahala 2011 zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 djebri et al 2017 fu et al 2016 these modifications render the surface of bentonite hydrophobic consequently the adsorption capability of various drugs by modified bentonite can be highly improved after its surface modification oliveira et al 2017 salihi and mahramanlıoğlu 2014 boukhalfa et al 2017 the present study focuses on the application of organobentonites for adsorptive removal of nsaid represented by dic and ibu from aqueous solutions it investigates the adsorption behaviours of these drugs in terms of isotherms by studying the adsorption removal of dic ibu in binary system and compares it to the single system using the best adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the starting material was a bentonite taken from the roussel site in maghnia supplied by enof company algeria the chemical composition of the bentonite is 53 2

ctab which belongs to quaternary ammonium salts was used as a modifying agent in organobentonite preparation cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ch3 ch2 15n br ch3 3 copper dichloride cucl2 ethylene diamine c₂h₄ nh₂ ₂ chlorhydric acid hcl and potassium iodide ki were purchased from sigma aldrich france the physicochemical characteristics of dic and ibu from sigma aldrich are presented in table sm1 2 2 preparation of the adsorbents 20 g of rb were washed with distilled water several times and purified by sedimentation dried at 105 c and sieved to 200 μm 5 g of rb for each organobentonite sample were initially dispersed in 100 ml distilled water and stirred for 24 h at room temperature simultaneously the required amounts of ctab in the concentration range of 0 5 2 0 cec for each of three samples were dissolved in 200 ml distilled water and then stirred for 1 h at 70 c the ctab solutions were slowly added dropwise into the suspensions of the rb and the mixtures were stirred at 80 c for about 15 h the suspensions were centrifuged at 10000 rpm and the resulting solids were washed with distilled water four times repeatedly the most organobentonite solids were dried at 60 c and the products were finally sieved to 200 μm the obtained cationic surfactant exchanged bentonites were labelled as 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb according to the ctab cec mass ratio 2 3 characterization methods batch equilibrium experiments were used to estimate the point of zero charge phpzc of the prepared samples the initial ph values phi of 50 ml of aqueous solutions were adjusted to a range of 2

determined boudiaf and boutahala 2011 zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 the cationic exchange capacity cec of the rb and organobentonites were calculated using bis ethylenediamine copper ii cu eda 2 2 complex method the detail procedure of cec determination can be found elsewhere sahnoun et al 2016 to study of the change in the structural properties of the rb and the prepared organobentonites were determined by x ray diffraction xrd analysis using a bruker d8 advance diffractometer operating at 40 kv and 30 ma with cukα radiation λ 0 15406 nm radial scans were recorded in the reflection scanning mode from 2θ 2 80 bragg s law nλ 2d sinθ was used to compute the d001 interlayer distance of the examined samples thermogravimetric analysis tga was carried out using a mettler toledo gmbh mod tga dsc1 with frs5 sensor and a microbalance precision 0 1 μg the samples were heated under nitrogen atmosphere in the interval 30 1000 c at 10 c min fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses of the adsorbents were carried out in kbr pellets in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 using ftir 8400s shimadzu with a standard mid ir dtgs detector nitrogen gas adsorption desorption isotherms were measured using a micromeritics tristar 3000 instrument at 77 k the measurements were made after degassing the samples under vacuum at 200 c for 3 h the specific surface areas are determined according to the bet method at a relative pressure p p0 in the range of 0 05 0 35 brunauer et al 1938 the total pore volumes of micro and mesopores were directly determined from nitrogen adsorption at a relative pressure value of p po 0 98 barrett et al 1951 2 4 batch adsorption experiments 2 4 1 single adsorption studies adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch equilibrium mode an amount of the prepared samples 20 mg was dispersed in 20 ml of dic or ibu solution 100 mg l and stirred with an agitation speed of 200 rpm until the equilibrium time was reached the amount of adsorbed drugs was derived from the initial and final concentrations of dic or ibu in the liquid phases measured using shimadzu uv vis 1700 spectrophotometer at 276 and 222 nm for dic and ibu respectively the initial concentration contact time ph and adsorbent dose effects on the adsorption capacity are studied the adsorption capacity qe and the removal rate r of drugs are calculated from the following equations 1 q e c o c e v m 2 r c o c e c o 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations mg l of the adsorbate solution respectively v l is the volume of solution and m g is the mass of adsorbent 2 4 2 binary adsorption studies the first step was to examine the adsorption of dic at equilibrium concentration of dic ranging from 10 to 1000 mg l in the presence of ibu 100 mg l for the next step the concentration of dic was fixed at 100 mg l and the concentration of ibu was varied from 10 to 1000 mg l these binary solutions were also agitated at 200 rpm for 2 h at 25 1 c a correction was applied for the spectrophotometric determination of residual concentrations in mixture systems by using the equations eq 3 and eq 4 djebri et al 2017 3 c d i c k i b u 2 d λ 1 k i b u 1

respectively the values of the adsorptivity constants k of two drugs used are represented in table sm2 2 5 regeneration studies the regeneration of the adsorbents was carried out after the equilibrium condition was reached for the adsorption cycle the initial concentration of dic ibu was 100 mg l after the equilibrium the 2cec rb samples saturated with dic ibu were collected and washed mildly with distilled water to remove residual drug particles for desorption cycle the dried 2cec rb samples were poured into 200 ml of ethanol solution and stirred for 2 h after that the 2cec rb samples were washed several times with distilled water and dried at 50 c to be used for the next cycle time these experiments were repeated four times the removal percentage was determined using eq 2 2 6 error analysis the values of the kinetic and isotherm parameters were determined by the regression analysis using origin program version 8 5 the correlation coefficients r2 were adopted to analyze the data set and to confirm the best fit kinetics and isotherm model for the adsorption if the data from the model are similar to those obtained in experiments r2 will be close to 1 the r2 was evaluated using eq 5 5 r 2 1 n 1 n q e t exp n q e t c a l n 2 n 1 n q e t exp n q e t exp n 2 where q e t exp and q e t c a l are the experimental adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe exp or at any time qt exp and the calculated adsorption capacity at equilibrium q e c a l or at any time q t c a l from the models respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bentonite before and after organic modifications cation exchange capacity cec is an important parameter that determines the reactivity of clay minerals as shown in table 1 the value of the cec for rb is about 103 4 meq 100 g the cec of the materials decreases with the organo modification of the adsorbents the 2cecrb had the lowest cec value which is 2 5 meq 100 g the other factor that plays an important role in adsorption is the functionalization capacity which represents the percentage of the number of ctab molecules intercalated in the modified bentonite the functionalization capacity fc has been calculated according the following equation 6 f c 100 c e c r b c e c o r g a n o b e n t o n i t e c e c r b where c e c r b and c e c o r g a n o b e n t o n i t e are the cation exchange capacities of rb and organobentonites respectively as indicated in table 1 2cecrb sample presents the highest functionalization rate 98 so it can be deduced that all the negative sites of the bentonite interlayer space are occupied by the ctab surfactant molecules consequently the adsorption capacity increases because there are more of ctab molecules that play the predominant role in adsorption with formation of attractive bonds in addition the obtained phpzc values for rb 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb were 7 3 6 1 6 6 and 6 5 respectively fig sm1 the xrd patterns of the rb and organobentonites are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that d001 value of rb is 13 4 å giving a 3 8 å 13 4 å 9 6 å 3 8 å 9 6 å is the thickness of the 2 1 layer wall of bentonite interlayer space for hydrated na and water liu et al 2016 after organophilisation modified bentonite showed that the d spacing d001 has increased with increasing the surfactant loading for 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb a significant expansion was obtained in the clay layers from 13 4 to 18 4 å 20 5 å and 20 7 å respectively with values of interlayer space 8 8 å 10 9 å and 11 1 å compared with the rb reflecting that ctab has been loaded onto rb the increase of basal spacing is due to the intercalation of ctab molecules onto the interlayer space of bentonite which expanded its interlayer spacing and later will promote dic ibu removal also the amounts of ctab have a significant effect on the arrangement of the intercalary surfactant this indicates that the mineral surfaces become more hydrophobic as the surfactant loading increases the increased hydrophobicity of bentonite would result in an enhanced uptake of dic and ibu on the surfaces of the material the d 001 values 19 0 22 0 å indicate that pseudo trimolecular structural arrangement of the ctab surfactant molecules occurs in the interlayer space farmer 1974 the surfactant molecules could also graft on the surface of the clay through the binding between the positively charged head group of surfactant molecules and the negative surface of clay liu et al 2016 farmer 1974 in order to obtain complementary evidence for the intercalation of quaternary alkylammonium cations into the silicate lattice the materials were characterized by ftir analytical method ftir spectra for rb and the 0 5 2 0 cec samples are shown in fig 2 the oh stretching vibrations in the 3700 3000 cm 1 range are characterized by two main bands a sharp intense peak at 3630 cm 1was assigned to oh stretching vibrations of the structural hydroxyl group whereas the broad band at 3422 cm 1 was attributed to hydrogen bonded water molecules adsorbed within the interlayer of the clay the band at 1640 cm 1 was related to h o h bending vibrations of water molecules adsorbed on rb farmer 1974 the infrared spectrum of rb shows a band at1042 cm 1 attributed to the si o si bending vibration farmer 1974 the bands of quartz were observed near 795 cm 1 the bands at 520 and 469 cm 1 were typical osio bending vibrations farmer 1974 the ftir spectra of the modified bentonites reveal the presence of the characteristic absorption bands of the ctab molecules the bands of the rb remaining unaffected other strong bands at 2920 and 2851 cm 1 were detected in organobentonites they were attributed to ch2 asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations respectively for the ctab alkylammonium zawrah et al 2014 ma et al 2016 other bands appear on the spectra of the organobentonites at 1472 and at 722 cm 1 these two bands correspond to the scissoring and rocking vibration of the methylene group ch2 respectively confirming the intercalation of surfactant molecules between the silica layers farmer 1974 the thermogravimetric tg curves of rb 0 5rb 1cecrb and 2cecrb are presented in fig 3 for rb in the first stage of the tg curve the weight loss is observed at a temperature value of less than 200 c which is ascribed to the desorption of water associated with interparticle and interlayer surfaces the thermal degradation over 550 c corresponds to the dehydroxylation of the structural oh units of rb he et al 2005 from fig 3 it can be seen that all organobentonites have lower weight loss than rb below 200 c indicating small amount of free water in organobentonites this suggests that the intercalary or adsorbed cationic surfactants reduced the surface energy of the bentonite and converted the hydrophilic silicate surface to a hydrophobic one these results are in accordance with those obtained from the ftir analysis for organobentonites the weight loss between 200 and 550 c is assigned to the decomposition of intercalated surfactants zhu et al 2012 with the increasing of the amount of surfactant the weight loss is increased from 17 9 to 28 2 revealing a higher surfactant concentration on the 2cecrb these findings successfully confirm that cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant strongly interacted with silicate surface liu et al 2016 the surfactant amount loaded onto organobentonites can be determined according to eq 8 sun et al 2013 yu et al 2014 7 m r m m o l g w 10 3 m n 100 w where m r mmol g denotes the real amount of ctab surfactant loaded on the organobentonites w is the weight loss percentage of the surfactant molecules in the organobentonites and m represents the molecular weight of ctab n is 0 if all the br ions remain or 160 no br ions the molar mass of br is 80 especially n 0 or 160 is not possible to reach but it can help to estimate the range of m r by calculating theoretical maximum and minimum values table 1 shows differences between the amount of surfactant added and the amount of surfactant loaded on the resulting organobentonites it is obvious for all samples that there is less surfactant loaded on the bentonites than that predicted by the theoretical values the low value of surfactant loading calculated for 2cecrb sample would be originated from micelle formation due to the high surfactant concentration used and further elimination by washing yu et al 2014 nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k for rb 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb samples are shown in fig 4 from this figure it can be seen that these isotherms are of type ii of the brunauer deming deming and teller bddt classification brunauer et al 1938 barrett et al 1951 the textural properties summarized in table 1 show that rb exhibited a specific surface area sbet 84 m2 g close to that reported for similar types of clay minerals after exchange with surfactant solutions nitrogen adsorption capacity of the organobentonites decreases the results show also that sbet and pore volume vp of rb decreased from 84 m2 g and 0 105 cm3 g to 3 0 m2 g and 0 007 cm3 g for 2cecrb indicating that surfactant with large molecular size occupied a part of the interlayer space resulting in inaccessibility of the internal surface to nitrogen molecules and the blocking of the pores in the organobentonite zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 djebri et al 2017 from these results it is assumed that the surface area and pore volume are not important factors in terms of controlling the affinity between organobentonite and organic pollutants hence the loaded surfactant is highly important for determining the adsorption mechanism onto organobentonites zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of initial ph the ph is the most important factor that influences the adsorption process because it can affect at the same time the surface charge of the adsorbent the ionization degree of functional groups of the adsorbate and the mechanism of the adsorption thus to investigate the influence of ph solution on adsorption the ph range of 4 10 was used it was observed that the uptake of drugs on all organobentonites remains constant practically independent of the ph of the aqueous drugs solutions fig 5 thus using a surfactant template realizes electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged dic or ibu anionic groups of drugs and quaternary ammonium groups in bentonite layers similar trends were reported for the removal of direct red 2 using bentonite modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide zohra et al 2008 and removal of acid blue 80 from aqueous solutions by adsorption using chemical modified bentonites gomri et al 2016 3 2 2 dosage effect of the adsorbent the dependence of the removal efficiency of dic and ibu on all adsorbents dosage was investigated fig sm2 the adsorbent masses were varied from 10 to 100 mg keeping the dic ibu concentration constant at 100 mg l and t 25 1 c it was observed that the adsorbed amount qe mg g increases with an increase in adsorbents dose the decrease in the elimination percentage can be explained by an increase in the mass of adsorbent which leads to an increase in adsorption sites and consequently the removal of the drugs will be high mouni et al 2018 ghemit et al 2017 3 2 3 effect of contact time the rate of adsorption is highly important in the design and evaluation of adsorbents in removing drugs from aqueous solutions the kinetics for adsorption of dic ibu onto organobentonite samples was examined at the initial concentration of 100 mg l and the results are presented in fig 6 for all adsorbents the concentration of ibu and dic in the solution decreased rapidly for the first 15 min and then decreased at slow rate until reaching equilibrium within 1 h rapid adsorption of the two drugs indicates high affinity between the drugs molecules and the organophilic surface of modified bentonites the highest adsorption capacity for the same concentration was attributed to the 2cecrb in the dic ibu adsorption process due to the existence of a large number of ctab molecules which create more adsorption sites that can bind with dic ibu molecules liu et al 2016 gomri et al 2016 3 2 4 kinetic study to evaluate the efficiency of adsorption process pseudo first order lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 rate expressions were applied to test the experimental data table 2 shows the model parameters for the adsorption of dic and ibu onto the adsorbents from the results it could be deduced fig sm3 that pseudo second order model could represent better the adsorption processes of the adsorbents than pseudo first order because of the higher r2 values so it is assumed that the rate limiting step may be chemisorption which involves valence forces by sharing or electron exchange between the adsorbent and the adsorbate ghemit et al 2017 2cecrb sample showed the highest initial adsorption amount as 2cecrb 1cecrb 0 5cecrb several authors showed the successful application of pseudo second order model for the representation of experimental kinetics data of drugs adsorption on different adsorbents fallou et al 2016 antunes et al 2012 oliveira et al 2017 salihi and mahramanlıoğlu 2014 boukhalfa et al 2017 3 2 5 adsorption mechanism according to intraparticle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 several mechanisms are involved and the adsorption process can be characterized into three steps external surface adsorption intraparticle diffusion which is the rate limiting step and the final equilibrium which is very fast the plots of the morris weber relationship for the sorption of drugs at initial concentration equal to 100 mg l by the organobentonites are shown in fig sm4 based on these figures we notice that the intraparticle diffusion of drugs within the organobentonites occurred in three stages the first linear portion including the adsorption period from 0 to 5 min t ½ 1 represents the external mass transfer or film diffusion boundary layer and the rapid distribution of drugs molecules onto the outer surface of organobentonites the second linear portion corresponds to the adsorption period from 5 to 20 min 1 t ½ 3 which represents the intraparticle diffusion and binding of drugs molecules into the internal active sites of the organobentonites the third linear portion from 20 min t ½ 3 indicates a saturation of the adsorption process the results obtained by intraparticle diffusion model are presented in table sm3 3 2 6 adsorption isotherm to explore the interaction mechanism between adsorbents and adsorbates adsorption isotherms were measured at a fixed temperature by varying the dic and ibu initial concentrations the experimental curves shown on fig 7 indicate that the dic and ibu adsorption amounts increase with the increasing of the initial concentrations until reaching constant values the obtained adsorption data were analyzed with nonlinear regression analysis using microcal origin 8 software the estimated constants of langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 isotherm equations and related correlation coefficients are given in table 3 the value of the constant 1 n is calculated to be less than 1 for all adsorbents for the two drugs it indicates favourable adsorption freundlich 1906 both freundlich and langmuir model fit the experimental data well as the comparison reveals the 2cec rb sample has the highest adsorption capacity for both dic ibu the maximum adsorption capacities were 600 6 mg g for dic and 194 9 mg g for ibu according to table 4 the adsorbent 2cecrb used in this study showed superior adsorption capacity when compared to other adsorbents reported in literature 3 2 7 competitive adsorption in binary solution systems the presence of several micropollutants in the solution can simultaneously affect the adsorption capacity and the affinity of the adsorbents the adsorption isotherms of diclofenac and ibuprofen by the 2cecrb sample in the binary system were evaluated to elucidate the competitive effect of the two drugs on their adsorption to facilitate direct comparison between binary and single sorbate system all the experimental conditions including adsorbent dosage initial concentrations equilibration time ph solution and temperature were identical in both systems the effect of competitive adsorption of dic and ibu onto 2cecrb at different initial concentrations is given in figs 8 and 9 according to these figures the monolayer adsorption of dic and ibu from single solution system is 600 6 and 194 9 mg g and from binary solution system is 188 6 and 83 4 mg g 1 respectively see table 5 this means that the adsorption of dic onto 2cecrb was affected by ibu and ibu by dic this finding suggested a significant competition for the adsorption between dic and ibu which may be due to the same adsorption sites for dic and ibu both dic and ibu were partitioned into the organic phase of the interlayer space which was modified by the surfactant similar phenomena have been observed by djebri et al 2017 3 2 8 suggested adsorption mechanism the final adsorption properties of organobentonite materials depend mainly on the chemical nature of the adsorbed surfactant the intercalation of cationic surfactants through ion exchange with the inorganic cations switches the chemical nature of the bentonite from hydrophilic to hydrophobic this favours the adsorption of organic compounds thus surfactants showing a long alkyl chains such as ctab create an appropriate organic environment within the inorganic frame for the adsorption of pharmaceutical compounds as diclofenac and ibuprofen consist of aromatic rings and display a negative charge in aqueous solution for ph above its pka it is thus expected that the nature of the intercalated surfactant will play on the magnitude of the adsorption it was found that when the surfactant concentration was increased the amount of adsorbed dic and ibu also gradually increased the larger interlayer space within organobentonites provides a higher potential for the uptake of drug pollutants in particular 2cecbb removes 99 4 of dic and 94 of ibu respectively at a concentration of 100 mg l the adsorption mechanism can be determined according to the ftir analysis fig s m 5 the spectra of the 2cecrb after diclofenac and ibuprofen adsorption show that the band at 1474 cm 1 was shifted to 1452 and 1461 cm 1 respectively in addition we observed that the peak at 1639 cm 1 disappeared after adsorption new peaks appeared at 1379 1370 and 1582 cm 1 and can be ascribed to carboxylate group coo of diclofenac and ibuprofen boukhalfa et al 2017 ghemit et al 2017 indicating that diclofenac and ibuprofen anions were effectively adsorbed 3 2 9 reusability of 2cecrb for dic and ibu removal reusability is a parameter that suggests the regeneration and reuse of any adsorbent and its application as a co friendly material the reusability of 2cecrb for dic and ibu removal could be confirmed by repeated tests after simple solvent washing the adsorbed dic ibu was desorbed by ethanol washing and used to check the efficiency in the next run before reuse the recycled 2cecrb was dried at 50 c for 12 h in each cycle the reusability tests were conducted up to 4 cycles for dic ibu and the obtained results are shown in fig 10 it is observed that at the first adsorption step the adsorption capacities for the ibu and dic reached 99 4 and 94 respectively it is worthy to note that the total adsorption capacities of both dic and ibu slightly decreased after three time regeneration compared with the initial adsorption capacities this could be ascribed to the fact that the regeneration process might result in the decrease of binding sites zhou et al 2012 therefore 2cecrb is proposed as a recyclable competitive and easy adsorbent to prepare for the removal of drugs from wastewater 4 conclusion based on the adsorption of dic and ibu from wastewater using 2cecrb 1cecrb and 0 5cecrb the following conclusions can be suggested first the physicochemical properties of the obtained samples confirmed that ctab was introduced into rb successfully second 2cecrb is the most efficient adsorbent among the tested adsorbents considering its high and fast adsorption capacity third the main interaction mechanism for the significant dic and ibu removal by all adsorbent might be explained by the fact that the intercalated surfactant molecules within the interlayer space contribute to the partition phases between the intercalated surfactant and the organic pollutant finally 2cecrb can be suggested as a potential adsorbent for the removal of drugs from wastewater due to its high adsorption capacity rapid uptake and easy recycling acknowledgement the authors thank university ferhat abbas of setif for financial supports appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article supplementary

interlayer exchangeable cations with some organic cations such as alkylammonium cations via ion exchange reactions the expansion of the interlayer spacing results from the irreversible substitution of inorganic exchangeable cations by organic ones in the interlayer space of the clay boudiaf and boutahala 2011 zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 djebri et al 2017 fu et al 2016 these modifications render the surface of bentonite hydrophobic consequently the adsorption capability of various drugs by modified bentonite can be highly improved after its surface modification oliveira et al 2017 salihi and mahramanlıoğlu 2014 boukhalfa et al 2017 the present study focuses on the application of organobentonites for adsorptive removal of nsaid represented by dic and ibu from aqueous solutions it investigates the adsorption behaviours of these drugs in terms of isotherms by studying the adsorption removal of dic ibu in binary system and compares it to the single system using the best adsorbent

diamine c₂h₄ nh₂ ₂ chlorhydric acid hcl and potassium iodide ki were purchased from sigma aldrich france the physicochemical characteristics of dic and ibu from sigma aldrich are presented in table sm1 2 2 preparation of the adsorbents 20 g of rb were washed with distilled water several times and purified by sedimentation dried at 105 c and sieved to 200 μm 5 g of rb for each organobentonite sample were initially dispersed in 100 ml distilled water and stirred for 24 h at room temperature simultaneously the required amounts of ctab in the concentration range of 0 5 2 0 cec for each of three samples were dissolved in 200 ml distilled water and then stirred for 1 h at 70 c the ctab solutions were slowly added dropwise into the suspensions of the rb and the mixtures were stirred at 80 c for about 15 h the suspensions were centrifuged at 10000 rpm and the resulting solids were washed with distilled water four times repeatedly the most organobentonite solids were dried at 60 c and the products were finally sieved to 200 μm the obtained cationic surfactant exchanged bentonites were labelled as 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb according to the ctab cec mass ratio 2 3 characterization methods batch equilibrium experiments were used to estimate the point of zero charge phpzc of the prepared samples the initial ph values phi of 50 ml of aqueous solutions were adjusted to a range of 2

determined boudiaf and boutahala 2011 zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 the cationic exchange capacity cec of the rb and organobentonites were calculated using bis ethylenediamine copper ii cu eda 2 2 complex method the detail procedure of cec determination can be found elsewhere sahnoun et al 2016 to study of the change in the structural properties of the rb and the prepared organobentonites were determined by x ray diffraction xrd analysis using a bruker d8 advance diffractometer operating at 40 kv and 30 ma with cukα radiation λ 0 15406 nm radial scans were recorded in the reflection scanning mode from 2θ 2 80 bragg s law nλ 2d sinθ was used to compute the d001 interlayer distance of the examined samples thermogravimetric analysis tga was carried out using a mettler toledo gmbh mod tga dsc1 with frs5 sensor and a microbalance precision 0 1 μg the samples were heated under nitrogen atmosphere in the interval 30 1000 c at 10 c min fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses of the adsorbents were carried out in kbr pellets in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 using ftir 8400s shimadzu with a standard mid ir dtgs detector nitrogen gas adsorption desorption isotherms were measured using a micromeritics tristar 3000 instrument at 77 k the measurements were made after degassing the samples under vacuum at 200 c for 3 h the specific surface areas are determined according to the bet method at a relative pressure p p0 in the range of 0 05 0 35 brunauer et al 1938 the total pore volumes of micro and mesopores were directly determined from nitrogen adsorption at a relative pressure value of p po 0 98 barrett et al 1951 2 4 batch adsorption experiments 2 4 1 single adsorption studies adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch equilibrium mode an amount of the prepared samples 20 mg was dispersed in 20 ml of dic or ibu solution 100 mg l and stirred with an agitation speed of 200 rpm until the equilibrium time was reached the amount of adsorbed drugs was derived from the initial and final concentrations of dic or ibu in the liquid phases measured using shimadzu uv vis 1700 spectrophotometer at 276 and 222 nm for dic and ibu respectively the initial concentration contact time ph and adsorbent dose effects on the adsorption capacity are studied the adsorption capacity qe and the removal rate r of drugs are calculated from the following equations 1 q e c o c e v m 2 r c o c e c o 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations mg l of the adsorbate solution respectively v l is the volume of solution and m g is the mass of adsorbent 2 4 2 binary adsorption studies the first step was to examine the adsorption of dic at equilibrium concentration of dic ranging from 10 to 1000 mg l in the presence of ibu 100 mg l for the next step the concentration of dic was fixed at 100 mg l and the concentration of ibu was varied from 10 to 1000 mg l these binary solutions were also agitated at 200 rpm for 2 h at 25 1 c a correction was applied for the spectrophotometric determination of residual concentrations in mixture systems by using the equations eq 3 and eq 4 djebri et al 2017 3 c d i c k i b u 2 d λ 1 k i b u 1

respectively the values of the adsorptivity constants k of two drugs used are represented in table sm2 2 5 regeneration studies the regeneration of the adsorbents was carried out after the equilibrium condition was reached for the adsorption cycle the initial concentration of dic ibu was 100 mg l after the equilibrium the 2cec rb samples saturated with dic ibu were collected and washed mildly with distilled water to remove residual drug particles for desorption cycle the dried 2cec rb samples were poured into 200 ml of ethanol solution and stirred for 2 h after that the 2cec rb samples were washed several times with distilled water and dried at 50 c to be used for the next cycle time these experiments were repeated four times the removal percentage was determined using eq 2 2 6 error analysis the values of the kinetic and isotherm parameters were determined by the regression analysis using origin program version 8 5 the correlation coefficients r2 were adopted to analyze the data set and to confirm the best fit kinetics and isotherm model for the adsorption if the data from the model are similar to those obtained in experiments r2 will be close to 1 the r2 was evaluated using eq 5 5 r 2 1 n 1 n q e t exp n q e t c a l n 2 n 1 n q e t exp n q e t exp n 2 where q e t exp and q e t c a l are the experimental adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe exp or at any time qt exp and the calculated adsorption capacity at equilibrium q e c a l or at any time q t c a l from the models respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bentonite before and after organic modifications cation exchange capacity cec is an important parameter that determines the reactivity of clay minerals as shown in table 1 the value of the cec for rb is about 103 4 meq 100 g the cec of the materials decreases with the organo modification of the adsorbents the 2cecrb had the lowest cec value which is 2 5 meq 100 g the other factor that plays an important role in adsorption is the functionalization capacity which represents the percentage of the number of ctab molecules intercalated in the modified bentonite the functionalization capacity fc has been calculated according the following equation 6 f c 100 c e c r b c e c o r g a n o b e n t o n i t e c e c r b where c e c r b and c e c o r g a n o b e n t o n i t e are the cation exchange capacities of rb and organobentonites respectively as indicated in table 1 2cecrb sample presents the highest functionalization rate 98 so it can be deduced that all the negative sites of the bentonite interlayer space are occupied by the ctab surfactant molecules consequently the adsorption capacity increases because there are more of ctab molecules that play the predominant role in adsorption with formation of attractive bonds in addition the obtained phpzc values for rb 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb were 7 3 6 1 6 6 and 6 5 respectively fig sm1 the xrd patterns of the rb and organobentonites are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that d001 value of rb is 13 4 å giving a 3 8 å 13 4 å 9 6 å 3 8 å 9 6 å is the thickness of the 2 1 layer wall of bentonite interlayer space for hydrated na and water liu et al 2016 after organophilisation modified bentonite showed that the d spacing d001 has increased with increasing the surfactant loading for 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb a significant expansion was obtained in the clay layers from 13 4 to 18 4 å 20 5 å and 20 7 å respectively with values of interlayer space 8 8 å 10 9 å and 11 1 å compared with the rb reflecting that ctab has been loaded onto rb the increase of basal spacing is due to the intercalation of ctab molecules onto the interlayer space of bentonite which expanded its interlayer spacing and later will promote dic ibu removal also the amounts of ctab have a significant effect on the arrangement of the intercalary surfactant this indicates that the mineral surfaces become more hydrophobic as the surfactant loading increases the increased hydrophobicity of bentonite would result in an enhanced uptake of dic and ibu on the surfaces of the material the d 001 values 19 0 22 0 å indicate that pseudo trimolecular structural arrangement of the ctab surfactant molecules occurs in the interlayer space farmer 1974 the surfactant molecules could also graft on the surface of the clay through the binding between the positively charged head group of surfactant molecules and the negative surface of clay liu et al 2016 farmer 1974 in order to obtain complementary evidence for the intercalation of quaternary alkylammonium cations into the silicate lattice the materials were characterized by ftir analytical method ftir spectra for rb and the 0 5 2 0 cec samples are shown in fig 2 the oh stretching vibrations in the 3700 3000 cm 1 range are characterized by two main bands a sharp intense peak at 3630 cm 1was assigned to oh stretching vibrations of the structural hydroxyl group whereas the broad band at 3422 cm 1 was attributed to hydrogen bonded water molecules adsorbed within the interlayer of the clay the band at 1640 cm 1 was related to h o h bending vibrations of water molecules adsorbed on rb farmer 1974 the infrared spectrum of rb shows a band at1042 cm 1 attributed to the si o si bending vibration farmer 1974 the bands of quartz were observed near 795 cm 1 the bands at 520 and 469 cm 1 were typical osio bending vibrations farmer 1974 the ftir spectra of the modified bentonites reveal the presence of the characteristic absorption bands of the ctab molecules the bands of the rb remaining unaffected other strong bands at 2920 and 2851 cm 1 were detected in organobentonites they were attributed to ch2 asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations respectively for the ctab alkylammonium zawrah et al 2014 ma et al 2016 other bands appear on the spectra of the organobentonites at 1472 and at 722 cm 1 these two bands correspond to the scissoring and rocking vibration of the methylene group ch2 respectively confirming the intercalation of surfactant molecules between the silica layers farmer 1974 the thermogravimetric tg curves of rb 0 5rb 1cecrb and 2cecrb are presented in fig 3 for rb in the first stage of the tg curve the weight loss is observed at a temperature value of less than 200 c which is ascribed to the desorption of water associated with interparticle and interlayer surfaces the thermal degradation over 550 c corresponds to the dehydroxylation of the structural oh units of rb he et al 2005 from fig 3 it can be seen that all organobentonites have lower weight loss than rb below 200 c indicating small amount of free water in organobentonites this suggests that the intercalary or adsorbed cationic surfactants reduced the surface energy of the bentonite and converted the hydrophilic silicate surface to a hydrophobic one these results are in accordance with those obtained from the ftir analysis for organobentonites the weight loss between 200 and 550 c is assigned to the decomposition of intercalated surfactants zhu et al 2012 with the increasing of the amount of surfactant the weight loss is increased from 17 9 to 28 2 revealing a higher surfactant concentration on the 2cecrb these findings successfully confirm that cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant strongly interacted with silicate surface liu et al 2016 the surfactant amount loaded onto organobentonites can be determined according to eq 8 sun et al 2013 yu et al 2014 7 m r m m o l g w 10 3 m n 100 w where m r mmol g denotes the real amount of ctab surfactant loaded on the organobentonites w is the weight loss percentage of the surfactant molecules in the organobentonites and m represents the molecular weight of ctab n is 0 if all the br ions remain or 160 no br ions the molar mass of br is 80 especially n 0 or 160 is not possible to reach but it can help to estimate the range of m r by calculating theoretical maximum and minimum values table 1 shows differences between the amount of surfactant added and the amount of surfactant loaded on the resulting organobentonites it is obvious for all samples that there is less surfactant loaded on the bentonites than that predicted by the theoretical values the low value of surfactant loading calculated for 2cecrb sample would be originated from micelle formation due to the high surfactant concentration used and further elimination by washing yu et al 2014 nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k for rb 0 5cecrb 1cecrb and 2cecrb samples are shown in fig 4 from this figure it can be seen that these isotherms are of type ii of the brunauer deming deming and teller bddt classification brunauer et al 1938 barrett et al 1951 the textural properties summarized in table 1 show that rb exhibited a specific surface area sbet 84 m2 g close to that reported for similar types of clay minerals after exchange with surfactant solutions nitrogen adsorption capacity of the organobentonites decreases the results show also that sbet and pore volume vp of rb decreased from 84 m2 g and 0 105 cm3 g to 3 0 m2 g and 0 007 cm3 g for 2cecrb indicating that surfactant with large molecular size occupied a part of the interlayer space resulting in inaccessibility of the internal surface to nitrogen molecules and the blocking of the pores in the organobentonite zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 djebri et al 2017 from these results it is assumed that the surface area and pore volume are not important factors in terms of controlling the affinity between organobentonite and organic pollutants hence the loaded surfactant is highly important for determining the adsorption mechanism onto organobentonites zaghouane boudiaf et al 2014 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of initial ph the ph is the most important factor that influences the adsorption process because it can affect at the same time the surface charge of the adsorbent the ionization degree of functional groups of the adsorbate and the mechanism of the adsorption thus to investigate the influence of ph solution on adsorption the ph range of 4 10 was used it was observed that the uptake of drugs on all organobentonites remains constant practically independent of the ph of the aqueous drugs solutions fig 5 thus using a surfactant template realizes electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged dic or ibu anionic groups of drugs and quaternary ammonium groups in bentonite layers similar trends were reported for the removal of direct red 2 using bentonite modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide zohra et al 2008 and removal of acid blue 80 from aqueous solutions by adsorption using chemical modified bentonites gomri et al 2016 3 2 2 dosage effect of the adsorbent the dependence of the removal efficiency of dic and ibu on all adsorbents dosage was investigated fig sm2 the adsorbent masses were varied from 10 to 100 mg keeping the dic ibu concentration constant at 100 mg l and t 25 1 c it was observed that the adsorbed amount qe mg g increases with an increase in adsorbents dose the decrease in the elimination percentage can be explained by an increase in the mass of adsorbent which leads to an increase in adsorption sites and consequently the removal of the drugs will be high mouni et al 2018 ghemit et al 2017 3 2 3 effect of contact time the rate of adsorption is highly important in the design and evaluation of adsorbents in removing drugs from aqueous solutions the kinetics for adsorption of dic ibu onto organobentonite samples was examined at the initial concentration of 100 mg l and the results are presented in fig 6 for all adsorbents the concentration of ibu and dic in the solution decreased rapidly for the first 15 min and then decreased at slow rate until reaching equilibrium within 1 h rapid adsorption of the two drugs indicates high affinity between the drugs molecules and the organophilic surface of modified bentonites the highest adsorption capacity for the same concentration was attributed to the 2cecrb in the dic ibu adsorption process due to the existence of a large number of ctab molecules which create more adsorption sites that can bind with dic ibu molecules liu et al 2016 gomri et al 2016 3 2 4 kinetic study to evaluate the efficiency of adsorption process pseudo first order lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 rate expressions were applied to test the experimental data table 2 shows the model parameters for the adsorption of dic and ibu onto the adsorbents from the results it could be deduced fig sm3 that pseudo second order model could represent better the adsorption processes of the adsorbents than pseudo first order because of the higher r2 values so it is assumed that the rate limiting step may be chemisorption which involves valence forces by sharing or electron exchange between the adsorbent and the adsorbate ghemit et al 2017 2cecrb sample showed the highest initial adsorption amount as 2cecrb 1cecrb 0 5cecrb several authors showed the successful application of pseudo second order model for the representation of experimental kinetics data of drugs adsorption on different adsorbents fallou et al 2016 antunes et al 2012 oliveira et al 2017 salihi and mahramanlıoğlu 2014 boukhalfa et al 2017 3 2 5 adsorption mechanism according to intraparticle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 several mechanisms are involved and the adsorption process can be characterized into three steps external surface adsorption intraparticle diffusion which is the rate limiting step and the final equilibrium which is very fast the plots of the morris weber relationship for the sorption of drugs at initial concentration equal to 100 mg l by the organobentonites are shown in fig sm4 based on these figures we notice that the intraparticle diffusion of drugs within the organobentonites occurred in three stages the first linear portion including the adsorption period from 0 to 5 min t ½ 1 represents the external mass transfer or film diffusion boundary layer and the rapid distribution of drugs molecules onto the outer surface of organobentonites the second linear portion corresponds to the adsorption period from 5 to 20 min 1 t ½ 3 which represents the intraparticle diffusion and binding of drugs molecules into the internal active sites of the organobentonites the third linear portion from 20 min t ½ 3 indicates a saturation of the adsorption process the results obtained by intraparticle diffusion model are presented in table sm3 3 2 6 adsorption isotherm to explore the interaction mechanism between adsorbents and adsorbates adsorption isotherms were measured at a fixed temperature by varying the dic and ibu initial concentrations the experimental curves shown on fig 7 indicate that the dic and ibu adsorption amounts increase with the increasing of the initial concentrations until reaching constant values the obtained adsorption data were analyzed with nonlinear regression analysis using microcal origin 8 software the estimated constants of langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 isotherm equations and related correlation coefficients are given in table 3 the value of the constant 1 n is calculated to be less than 1 for all adsorbents for the two drugs it indicates favourable adsorption freundlich 1906 both freundlich and langmuir model fit the experimental data well as the comparison reveals the 2cec rb sample has the highest adsorption capacity for both dic ibu the maximum adsorption capacities were 600 6 mg g for dic and 194 9 mg g for ibu according to table 4 the adsorbent 2cecrb used in this study showed superior adsorption capacity when compared to other adsorbents reported in literature 3 2 7 competitive adsorption in binary solution systems the presence of several micropollutants in the solution can simultaneously affect the adsorption capacity and the affinity of the adsorbents the adsorption isotherms of diclofenac and ibuprofen by the 2cecrb sample in the binary system were evaluated to elucidate the competitive effect of the two drugs on their adsorption to facilitate direct comparison between binary and single sorbate system all the experimental conditions including adsorbent dosage initial concentrations equilibration time ph solution and temperature were identical in both systems the effect of competitive adsorption of dic and ibu onto 2cecrb at different initial concentrations is given in figs 8 and 9 according to these figures the monolayer adsorption of dic and ibu from single solution system is 600 6 and 194 9 mg g and from binary solution system is 188 6 and 83 4 mg g 1 respectively see table 5 this means that the adsorption of dic onto 2cecrb was affected by ibu and ibu by dic this finding suggested a significant competition for the adsorption between dic and ibu which may be due to the same adsorption sites for dic and ibu both dic and ibu were partitioned into the organic phase of the interlayer space which was modified by the surfactant similar phenomena have been observed by djebri et al 2017 3 2 8 suggested adsorption mechanism the final adsorption properties of organobentonite materials depend mainly on the chemical nature of the adsorbed surfactant the intercalation of cationic surfactants through ion exchange with the inorganic cations switches the chemical nature of the bentonite from hydrophilic to hydrophobic this favours the adsorption of organic compounds thus surfactants showing a long alkyl chains such as ctab create an appropriate organic environment within the inorganic frame for the adsorption of pharmaceutical compounds as diclofenac and ibuprofen consist of aromatic rings and display a negative charge in aqueous solution for ph above its pka it is thus expected that the nature of the intercalated surfactant will play on the magnitude of the adsorption it was found that when the surfactant concentration was increased the amount of adsorbed dic and ibu also gradually increased the larger interlayer space within organobentonites provides a higher potential for the uptake of drug pollutants in particular 2cecbb removes 99 4 of dic and 94 of ibu respectively at a concentration of 100 mg l the adsorption mechanism can be determined according to the ftir analysis fig s m 5 the spectra of the 2cecrb after diclofenac and ibuprofen adsorption show that the band at 1474 cm 1 was shifted to 1452 and 1461 cm 1 respectively in addition we observed that the peak at 1639 cm 1 disappeared after adsorption new peaks appeared at 1379 1370 and 1582 cm 1 and can be ascribed to carboxylate group coo of diclofenac and ibuprofen boukhalfa et al 2017 ghemit et al 2017 indicating that diclofenac and ibuprofen anions were effectively adsorbed 3 2 9 reusability of 2cecrb for dic and ibu removal reusability is a parameter that suggests the regeneration and reuse of any adsorbent and its application as a co friendly material the reusability of 2cecrb for dic and ibu removal could be confirmed by repeated tests after simple solvent washing the adsorbed dic ibu was desorbed by ethanol washing and used to check the efficiency in the next run before reuse the recycled 2cecrb was dried at 50 c for 12 h in each cycle the reusability tests were conducted up to 4 cycles for dic ibu and the obtained results are shown in fig 10 it is observed that at the first adsorption step the adsorption capacities for the ibu and dic reached 99 4 and 94 respectively it is worthy to note that the total adsorption capacities of both dic and ibu slightly decreased after three time regeneration compared with the initial adsorption capacities this could be ascribed to the fact that the regeneration process might result in the decrease of binding sites zhou et al 2012 therefore 2cecrb is proposed as a recyclable competitive and easy adsorbent to prepare for the removal of drugs from wastewater 4 conclusion based on the adsorption of dic and ibu from wastewater using 2cecrb 1cecrb and 0 5cecrb the following conclusions can be suggested first the physicochemical properties of the obtained samples confirmed that ctab was introduced into rb successfully second 2cecrb is the most efficient adsorbent among the tested adsorbents considering its high and fast adsorption capacity third the main interaction mechanism for the significant dic and ibu removal by all adsorbent might be explained by the fact that the intercalated surfactant molecules within the interlayer space contribute to the partition phases between the intercalated surfactant and the organic pollutant finally 2cecrb can be suggested as a potential adsorbent for the removal of drugs from wastewater due to its high adsorption capacity rapid uptake and easy recycling acknowledgement the authors thank university ferhat abbas of setif for financial supports appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article supplementary

12308,simulation optimization models have been widely developed and used for many decades in groundwater resource management however simulation optimization models in most applications encompass data that are subject to uncertainty groundwater aquifer hydrogeology condition is highly uncertain hence it is important that this uncertainty is taken into account when managing groundwater resource pumping rates various methodologies have been developed and used by researchers to tackle uncertainty simulation optimization models are often used for groundwater resource management however direct application of such an approach in which all realizations are considered at each iteration of the optimization process leads to a very expensive optimization particularly when the number of realizations is large this therefore highlights the need for an efficient simulation optimization tool that can be used to sustainably manage the limited water resource under uncertainty conditions in recent times retrospective optimization approximation roa approach has emerged to be useful simulation optimization tool that can efficiently incorporate uncertainty this paper introduces a procedure which is new within the context of regional groundwater resource management retrospective optimization approximation approach roa procedure solves and evaluates a sequence of optimization sub problems in an increasing number of realizations sample sizes response matrix technique was used to combine simulation model with optimization procedure model we adopted k means clustering sampling technique for realizations mapping by using k means clustering sampling the roa active set procedure was able to find a nearly converged solution within a relatively few number of iterations within 6 7 iterations the methodology is demonstrated through an application to a real world aquifer system found in the great letaba river catchment located at mopani district in south africa the results demonstrate that roa sampling based approach is capable of reproducing indicative optimal sustainable groundwater pumping rates which can be useful for managing regional aquifers groundwater resource under geological uncertainty conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater regional aquifers retrospective optimization approach south africa uncertainty 1 introduction many countries exhibit a high level of dependence on groundwater for water supply foster and hirata 2011 gyamfi et al 2017 groundwater management has already taken some shape in several countries through the implementation of legislative and other regulatory measures with respect to groundwater withdrawal and protection cramer 1987 however tsur and zemel 2004 pointed out that over exploitation of groundwater resources when pumping exceeds recharge is pervasive worldwide groundwater recharge is a key component in groundwater flow or transport models siva prasad and venkateswara rao 2017 as a result of low rain recharge and low porosity and low connectivity the depth to water table fluctuates considerably during the year and significant water scarcity is often experienced during drier years varua et al 2018 it is important to note that if groundwater is used intensively the yield of wells is provided primarily by the so called elastic storage petrov 1990 this leads to an intensive drawdown of piezometric head lowering of the pressure of the layers subsidence of ground surface and such negative effects as worsening of the quality of fresh groundwater landscape conditions petrov 1990 and increased costs of groundwater pumping mirzoyan et al 2017 the detrimental effects of groundwater over exploitation are widely reported in many parts of the world for example in the japanese cities of tokyo osaka and nagoja subsidence of ground surface of more than 2 5 m has been observed petrov 1990 similarly in south africa within the dolomitic rock regions such as krugersdorp and laudium in gauteng province large sinkholes have been observed due to intensive groundwater exploitation dwa 2009 from the foregone discussions it stands to reason that groundwater resources are poorly managed and the resource base misunderstood kalantari 2010 in view of these challenges groundwater needs proper management systems to safeguard its sustainability and use carrillo rivera and cardona 2012 underscores the need to understand utilize and govern the use of water resources in the most efficient way possible in order to minimize anthropogenic effects whiles ensuring enough quantity for environmental flows ndambuki 2001 also emphasized that if groundwater is to be exploited efficiently and economically with high yield boreholes then a management scheme that thrives on sustainability modules should be adopted notwithstanding the heterogeneous nature of aquifers and the complexity of hydrogeological processes presents a number of uncertainties in predicting groundwater flow behavior and incorporate management strategies ndambuki et al 2000 as a result of the complex nature of the earth that forms the aquifers and the inherent uncertainties the application of deterministic management approaches in the design of groundwater management schemes are deemed not to be effective ndambuki et al 2005 in view of this limitation there is a need for water management tools to incorporate uncertainty for reliable planning and efficient management of groundwater resources our major contribution in this paper is to present a combined simulation optimization methodology stochastic optimization approach the retrospective optimization approximation roa approach which considers the geological uncertainty brought about by lack of adequate data to fully characterise the regional aquifer systems using response matrix technique response matrix or embedding techniques are normally used to combine simulation model with management optimization model gorelick 1983 detailed discussion on these techniques can be found in literature aguado and remson 1974 peralta et al 1991 ndambuki 2001 response matrix approach uses superposition and linear systems theory to simulate groundwater flow peralta et al 1991 in the response matrix approach also known as technological function response matrix coefficients approach influence of a unit change in an independent decision variable such as pumping rate at a pre selected well location upon a variety of dependent variables like drawdown at specified potential control observation points is determined then superposition process is performed to calculate their total response at specified potential control points resulting from all decision variables ndambuki 2001 in other words a response matrix consists of linear influence coefficients that describe the response of the potentiometric surface to a unit volume of extraction or injection of groundwater peralta et al 1991 the main drawback of this technique is the number of simulations required to be performed to generate the response matrix as well as the size of the response matrix which is a function of stress locations and observation points considered however the final optimization problem to be solved is smaller than that which can be obtained from the embedding method ndambuki 2001 solving simulation optimization problems under uncertainty is computationally expensive because many flow simulations are required to provide reliable results wang et al 2012 indicated that efficient treatment of uncertainty particularly geological uncertainty presents a key challenge in application of optimization procedures and further asserted that the reason behind this is that in order to present the high degree of uncertainty in the reservoir geology many geological realizations must be considered various researchers have used mathematical programming for water resource management cheng et al 2009 coe 1990 karamouz et al 2007 zarghami et al 2008 some of these have used fuzzy models guo et al 2010 katambara 2011 lu et al 2010 genetic algorithms kumar et al 2006 kuo et al 2000 second order cone programming ndambuki 2001 ndambuki et al 2000 2003 2005 post optimality analysis gorelick 1982 stochastic optimization with recourse based methods guo et al 2010 lu et al 2009 maqsood et al 2005 mulvey et al 1995 ndambuki 2001 ndambuki et al 2000 wagner et al 1992 however it should be noted that direct application of such an approach in which all realizations are considered at every iteration of the optimization leads to a very costly optimizations particularly when the number of realizations is large wang et al 2012 our work in stochastic optimization problems is based on a recent refinement of sample average approximation saa sampling based methods a retrospective optimization approximation roa method where optimization sub problems are designed through expected functions solved and evaluated in a sequence of increasing number of realizations sample size the basic idea of roa is that it does not consider all realizations at all iterations of the optimization solver roa procedure designs and solves a sequence of approximate sample path optimization sub problems which sequentially account for increasing number of realizations sample size with decreasing error of tolerance roa approach uses warm start technique in which initial guess solution is updated by considering the initial solution for the current sub problem being the return solution from the previous sub problem solved this technique is new in areas of regional groundwater resource management but the authors are aware that in recent years the method has been used in areas such as petroleum engineering for instance in reservoir management problem wang et al 2012 well placement optimization problem guyaguler and home 2004 onwunalu and durlofsky 2010 yeten et al 2003 well control problem chen et al 2009 wang et al 2009 in operation research chen and schmeiser 2001 wang and schmeiser 2008 and the most recent application for solving quantity groundwater resource management problem of a hypothetical aquifer system kifanyi et al 2017 however their applications were over fixed and a relatively few decision variables in addition to using few number of realizations this paper therefore aims to apply an efficient method roa approach for optimizing regional scale groundwater pumping rates over multiple decision variables and hydrogeological model realizations the roa technique applied here differs from the previous works in the sense that it is applied to solve a sequence of optimization sub problems particularly designed for regional scale groundwater aquifer management problems under geological uncertainty in an increasing number of realizations of hydrogeological realizations through response matrix simulation optimization framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 roa simulation optimization problem formulation in this work the overall modelling objective is to optimize the pumping rates of a number of spatially distributed pumping wells under geological uncertainty environment particularly uncertainty due to aquifer hydraulic conductivity in this case uncertainty is expressed in terms of assemblage of aquifer system responses drawdowns which are determined under hydraulic conductivity field uncertainty conditions due to unit groundwater pumping rate at every potential candidate pumping well location in the model domain the assemblage set of aquifer system response values also known as technological function response matrix coefficients is usually developed to represent simulation results in a simulation optimization framework now let hydraulic conductivity field uncertainty realization be denoted by ϖ such that ϖ ψ where ψ is the total possible number of realizations thus each realization ϖ will have a different random response matrix denoted by a ϖ with associated random response matrix components denoted by a i j ϖ hence the random response matrices generated may result in different optimal solutions and therefore different optimal values of the optimization problem in general the optimization problem under uncertainty can be formulated as follows for a given solution set x such that x x find a solution x of an optimization problem 1 m a x i m i z e f x j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 2 e ψ z x j a ϖ b i i 1 2 3 n c ϖ ψ where e ψ represents the expectation function over the set of all realizations ψ and z is a numerical stochastic process that computes the sample observation of constraint function z x j a ϖ for a given x and the realization ϖ in this case x is the vector defining the groundwater pumping rates spatially distributed over the model domain f x is objective function evaluated through estimates of z x j a ϖ function by performing a numerical flow simulation with the hydrogeological model defined by realization ϖ x j is the groundwater pumping rate decision variable of pumping well at location j b i is constraining value at control point i n p w and n c are the number of pumping wells and control points respectively it should be noted that the pumping well locations which were considered for developing response matrices are the same in all realizations consider random response matrix defined by a ϖ with random response matrix components denoted by a i j ϖ simply denoted by ϖ that is the random hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns we assume that randomness in hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns is only due to uncertainty arising in hydraulic conductivity of aquifer system and that a ij ϖ a ϖ such that a ϖ ψ moreover p is assumed to be well defined with unknown distribution function but what is known is expected mean values standard deviation and or covariance of the random responses ϖ consider a stochastic constraint function process as z x j ϖ ψ to be defined as z x j ϖ i a ϖ i x j thus the expected value of the function z x j ϖ is defined as 3 e z x j ϖ e a ϖ x j hence the constraint inequality 2 can be written as e z x j ϖ b i such that the expectation z x j ϖ ψ z x j ϖ dp ϖ is the corresponding expected value function therefore inequality 2 can be estimated using monte carlo sampling based approximation methods in this case roa method by considering a sequence of finite sets of generated independent identically distributed i i d samples of random response matrices of n realizations of ϖ i a ϖ n 1 a ϖ n k we estimated the expected constraint function e z x j ϖ i as 4 e z x j ϖ i 1 n k i n k z x j ϖ i thereafter progressively we evaluated resulting sample path optimization sub problems using roa method framework for k 1 2 3 n sp where n sp is the number of sample path optimization sub problems generated hence the estimates retrospective groundwater sample path optimization problem ergsop can be formulated as 5 m a x i m i z e f n k x j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 6 1 n k i n k z x j ϖ i b i the estimates inequality function 6 is deterministic and hence the optimization sub problems developed becomes deterministic which can be solved by any appropriate core deterministic search optimizer algorithms this is one of the main advantages of roa approach it should be noted that roa procedure can be used in deterministic and stochastic search algorithms wang et al 2012 the optimization problems formulations 1 through 2 and formulations 5 through 6 are herein referred to as the true optimization problem and estimates optimization problem respectively in inequality 6 the term 1 n k defines the weight factor or probability associated with realizations ϖ i in this work different sample sizes n k number of realizations were considered for each sample path optimization sub problem generated the performance objective function considered is the expected total optimal groundwater pumping rate decision variables considered are groundwater pumping rates i e positive real values x such that x ℝ n p w which are spatially distributed within the model domain in this case we assume that the solution set x is closed and bounded and hence the problem has finite number of feasible solutions 2 2 roa procedure the basic feature of the roa technique is that the sample sizes i e the number of realizations is increased from sample path optimization sub problem to sub problem and that the initial guess solution for the current sample path optimization sub problem is simply the returned solution from the previous sample path optimization sub problem solved this guarantees that in early iterations the roa procedure does not require excessive computational effort because the number of realizations sample sizes is small similarly in the later iterations it is computationally inexpensive because the initial solutions are closer to the optimum solution of the true optimization problem hence the overall iterations required by the core optimizer is relatively fewer and therefore computational savings can be achieved compared to a direct optimization which considers all realizations at each iteration to solve the stochastic optimization problem using retrospective optimization approximation roa approach the following elucidated steps are followed kifanyi et al 2017 1 for a given available data in this case hydraulic conductivity field mean and standard deviation generate set of realizations of aquifer hydraulic conductivity fields ϖ 2 for each given realization ϖ run modflow simulation model to generate responses a i j ϖ i e ϖ random responses of hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns due to a unit groundwater pumping rate we consider existing maximum groundwater pumping rate to represent a unit pumping rate 3 generate a sequence of finite sets of independent identically distributed i i d samples of random aquifer response matrices a ϖ i of n realizations of ϖ i a ϖ n k a ϖ n k for k 1 2 3 n s p 4 for a given sequence of finite set of the generated samples of aquifer response matrices realised generate a sequence of retrospective sample path sub problems f n k f o r k 1 2 3 n s p 5 for each k t h sample path sub problem apply core optimizer solver to provide an optimal solution or a nearly closer approximation of optimal solution x k of f n k 6 repeat step 5 for k 1 2 3 n s p until sample path optimization sub problem optimal solution x k converges to true optimization problem optimal solution x note that for each sub problem we consider distinct probable weight factor of p r ϖ i 1 n k hence as k increases the sample path sub problem f n k optimal solution x k converges to the true optimization problem optimal solution x of objective function f 2 3 sampling technique roa procedure can be used with any sampling technique depending on availability of data in this study we applied k means clustering sampling algorithm implemented under matlab 2014a environment through k means clustering sampling we were able to establish realizations mapping from every realization to a finite number n of attributes in groundwater pumping water production perspective attributes that can be useful is some measure of hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity in this case firstly the quantity is normalized to 0 1 and then a vector of values is identified with each realization using this process each realization of hydraulic conductivity field ϖ i was assigned to a vector of attributes α i α i ℝ n the vectors of attributes were then used in the k means algorithm the k means algorithm provides k vectors in ℝ n i e cluster centres that minimize mean average distance δ for a given n number of realizations and can be defined in the form 7 δ i 1 n m i n α i ϕ j 2 j 1 2 k where α i denotes a vector of attributes such that α i ℝ n and ϕ j denotes the coordinates of the centre of cluster j in k means approach once the cluster centres are established a particular realization ϖ i is assigned to one of the centres by simply computing the minimum distance as a r g m i n j 1 2 k α i ϕ j 3 application of the roa methodology to the great letaba regional aquifer system 3 1 study area the roa methodology was applied to a real world aquifer system found in mopani district in the great letaba also known as the groot letaba river basin aquifer system located in the primary drainage region b of the olifants river basin the great letaba catchment is located in the limpopo province in the north eastern part of south africa fig 1 the great letaba river is one of the major tributaries of the olifants river the great letaba river catchment is characterized by high elevation differences between 301 and 2121 m amsl it should clearly be noted that in many decades most of studies dwaf 1990 1994 1998 2003 2004 2006a 2006b 2006c and others consider the great letaba river catchment as part of limpopo river basin this is because previously the great groot letaba river catchment area was known to be within the then luvuvhu letaba water management area wma which was falling in the limpopo river basin until recently on 20th august 2012 when it was officially declared by the government of south africa via her department the then department of water affairs dwa that it is part of the olifants river basin thomas 2015 the great letaba river catchment covers a surface area of approximately 4952 km2 dwaf 2006c it is found within mopani district municipality in the greater letaba local municipality the main urban areas in the catchment are tzaneen and nkawakowa the kruger national park knp is located at the eastern lower end of the catchment to the mozambique border in south africa water management areas wmas have been formed whereby throughout the country the primary drainage regions are divided into secondary tertiary and quaternary catchments the basic unit of area used in this work is the quaternary catchment fig 2 shows the quaternary catchments of the great letaba river catchment 3 1 1 hydrogeology the great letaba river catchment aquifers are predominantly secondary with exception of alluvial deposits along the main river system intergranular aquifers ranging from unconsolidated to semi consolidated materials with primary porosity occur in the great letaba river mainly inside the kruger national park dwaf 2006c in general the great letaba river catchment hydrogeological regions can be divided mainly into the drakensberg escarpment also known as the great escarpment drakensberg foothills and valleys bandolierskop giyani gravelotte the plains and alluvium dwaf 2006c katambara and ndiritu 2009 a total of 515 of potential groundwater pumping boreholes are located in the hydrogeological aquifer region unit fig 3 in the river catchment a total of eight 8 groundwater monitoring control points wells have been installed by the government for groundwater level measurements fig 3 blue dots aquifer heads at these potential groundwater control observation wells ows were restricted by not allowing them to fall below 50 percent of the specified saturated aquifer thicknesses the existence of hot springs within the regional aquifer suggests that the aquifer is confined except along the major rivers where localized alluvium aquifers occur including in the eastern end of the catchment within the knp where unconfined aquifers occur the aquifer system is characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivity transmissivity values fig 4 presents the transmissivity values for the aquifer system adopted after holland 2011 classified into three 3 zones 3 1 2 simulation model of the study area the aquifer system has areal extent of 100 0 km by 50 0 km which was uniformly discretized into 150000 grid cells in 100 rows and 150 columns with an equal grid spacing of 1 50 km in the x direction and 0 50 km in the y direction finite difference method was used to discretize the area it was realised that in the modelled area no flow boundary appears at the north and south parts of the catchment constant flux boundary conditions exist in the boundaries located at the north west and south west parts of the catchment these are areas bounded by the great escarpment i e the drakensburg escarpment mountainous regions moreover specific head boundary conditions also referred to as dirichlet conditions for which boundaries provide a controlled general head flow boundary ghb was specified for the surface water bodies such as dams and eastern boundary of the modelled domain recharge in the catchment area is mainly realised within the high elevation areas of the great escarpment the drakensburg escarpment mountains where rainfall is high above 1000mm annual and in the alluvium aquifers along major rivers fig 5 shows finite difference discretized great letaba groundwater flow numerical simulation model in this work steady state simulations were considered and hence initial condition is not a major concern this is because in any groundwater steady state numerical simulations the focus is to determine aquifer drawdown in response to external imposed excitations stresses such as groundwater pumping whereby relative heads as measured with respects to drawdown responses are of great importance rather than absolute head values 3 2 model data input the irrigated area receives water from surface water sources and groundwater pumping wells it was assumed that losses for the irrigated fields area was in total 20 percent of applied water 10 percent percolates as recharge to the aquifer and 10 percent returns to the river as return flow total net recharge was estimated at a rate of 126 mm year dwaf 2003 the minimum pumping rate limits i e lower bounds pumping rates required to satisfy the minimum water requirements of the competing water users was assumed to be the existing groundwater pumping rates table 1 shows river and aquifer input data which were used for the simulation optimization problem analysis data on 515 boreholes obtained from grip database grip limpopo 2013 indicate that the overall maximum average daily abstraction capacity ranges from 62 to 70 m3 day table 2 presents the quaternary catchments names named variables combined pumping wells cpw with their corresponding number of wells mean aquifer thickness un optimized mean pumping rates and quaternary catchment areas which were used in the optimization problem analysis 3 3 groundwater management the overall modelling effort was to manage the water resources of the aquifer system in such a manner so as to maximize groundwater pumping production rates without substantially impacting undesirable consequences on the ecosystem to achieve this goal the following objective and constraints were considered 3 3 1 objective the objective was formulated as follows 8 m a x i m i s e f j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w where f is the objective function that represents the total groundwater pumping rate x j are the spatially distributed pumping rates decision variables and n p w is the total number of potential pumping wells 3 3 2 constraints the objective function was constrained with the following constraints drawdown constraints drawdown constraints are usually meant to protect the ecosystem by avoiding excessive drawdowns in this work the drawdown constraints were formulated to avoid mining as follows 9 j 1 n p w a i j x j b i i 1 2 3 n c where a i j is the drawdown at control point i caused by a unit pumping from potential pumping well located at j b i is the allowable drawdown at control point i and n c is the total number of control points control points are location points at which the drawdowns are controlled as noted the aquifer hydraulic conductivity transmissivity values are considered as uncertain hence the drawdowns a i j becomes dependent on the hydraulic conductivity transmissivity field ϖ realised as previously discussed the assemblage of the random response coefficients a i j ϖ forms finite set of independent identically distributed i i d samples of random aquifer response matrices a ϖ of n realizations as a ϖ n k a ϖ n 1 a ϖ n k for k 1 2 3 n s p therefore inequality 9 changes to the following form 10 a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c k 1 2 3 n s p ϖ ψ in this case the stochastic inequality constraint 10 can be estimated as 11 1 n k k 1 n k a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c where a ϖ n k is the k t h sample path optimization sub problem constraints response matrix and all other parameters are as previously defined total recharge constraint the total amount of water extracted from the aquifer was constrained so as not to exceed the total natural recharge entering the aquifer model domain this constraint was considered hard constraint and was formulated as 12 j 1 n p w x j t g r in which t g r is the total groundwater recharge in the well field water demand constraint in this work the aquifer was considered as the sole source of water supply hence it means that the designed optimal pumping strategy must satisfy at least the minimum total water demand without impacting negatively on the other water sources the constraint was formulated as follows 13 j 1 n p w x j t w d where t w d is the total water demand within the model domain pumping constraint pumping rates at each potential pumping well was constrained to values between some minimum and maximum rates this constraint was formulated as follows 14 x j m i n x j x j m a x j 1 2 3 n p w where x j m i n and x j m a x are the minimum and maximum allowable pumping rates respectively 3 3 3 statement of the management problem the stochastic optimization problem solved therefore was as follows 15 m a x i m i s e f j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 16 a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c k 1 2 3 n s p ϖ ψ 17 j 1 n p w x j t g r 18 j 1 n p w x j t w d 19 x j m i n x j x j m a x j 1 2 3 n p w the optimization problem formulation 15 through 19 is a stochastic optimization problem because it depends on realization of hydraulic conductivity field ϖ this optimization problem is referred to as the true groundwater optimization problem the estimates sample path optimization sub problems solved therefore was formulated as follows 20 m a x i m i z e f n k j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 21 1 n k k 1 n k a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c k 1 2 3 n s p 22 j 1 n p w x j t g r 23 j 1 n p w x j t w d 24 x j m i n x j x j m a x j 1 2 3 n p w all parameters are as previously defined the sample path optimization sub problems were solved and analysed through the roa framework 3 3 4 formulation of sample path optimization sub problems a total of 500 realizations of uncertain hydraulic conductivity fields which leads to different aquifer system responses i e hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns were generated from the heterogeneous aquifer system a correlation length of 100000 m by 50000 m in a 2 dimensional x y direction was considered sufficient enough to handle significant representation of input parameter uncertainties of the aquifer geology in the model domain eight 8 groundwater control points were identified active the water heads at these monitoring observation wells control points were restricted not to fall below certain prescribed maximum allowable limiting values the attributes used account for variations in aquifer properties it should be realised that the same control points and pumping wells locations are used to measure responses of the aquifer system aquifer heads water table level drawdowns when subjected to external stresses in this case unit pumping rate for every realization of hydraulic conductivity field assemblage of aquifer system responses due to the 500 realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields resulted in a total of 4020 response matrix rows observation rows hence in total a constraining response matrix of 4020 by 515 was generated this response matrix was used to generate ten 10 sample path optimization sub problems of different sample sizes observation rows for the management models in this work sample sizes were determined heuristically table 3 presents the sample path optimization sub problems generated for the roa approach performance evaluation from table 3 the last sample path optimization sub problem i e sosp10 is considered to be the true groundwater optimization problem the simulation optimization sub problems were solved in a sequence of increasing number of realizations using simulator modflow harbaugh et al 2000 a groundwater numerical simulation model in this case a steady state simulation was performed and a core optimizer active set a sequential quadratic programming sqp algorithm implemented under matlab 2014a environment codes the k means clustering sampling technique was used for the realizations mapping 4 results and discussion the overall objective of the optimization was to determine the optimal pumping rates that maximize the expected total groundwater pumping rates table 4 presents the simulation optimization pumping rate solutions in m3 day of the generated sample path optimization sub problems from table 4 the optimal solution strategies corresponding to the sequence of sample path optimization sub problems generated yields optimal solutions ranging from a minimum of 77 01 m3 day quaternary catchment b81c at combined pumping well cpw4 to a maximum of 1465 30 m3 day quaternary catchment b81h at combined pumping well cpw2 with total optimal objective function mean values ranging from a minimum of 2374 56 m3 day to a maximum of 6955 00 m3 day it can also be seen from table 4 that the error of tolerance decreases as number of realizations sample sizes increases while the sample path optimization sub problems optimal solutions converge towards the true optimization problem i e sosp10 as the number of realizations increases in this work the error of tolerance ranges from 65 85 i e at sosp20 when realization equal to 20 to 0 i e at sosp10 the true optimization problem when realizations equal to 500 fig 6 shows the groundwater simulation optimization pumping solutions strategies of the sample path optimization sub problems as it can be seen in fig 6 the sample path optimization sub problems optimal solutions converge towards the true groundwater optimization problem optimum solution as the sample size increases it should be noted that the first sample path optimization sub problem sosp1 is inexpensive because computing every optimal solution or objective function value requires only few function evaluations the ninth optimal solution sosp9 is very close to the true optimization problem sosp10 optimal solution the tenth sample path optimization problem sosp10 whereby all the 500 realizations generated were considered converged with relatively few number of iterations because its initial solution guess i e sosp9 solution is nearly equal to the true optimization problem sosp10 optimal solution to evaluate the overall performance of the roa approach for groundwater resource management the sample path optimization sub problems were solved with different initial solution guesses for three runs which consequently resulted in different optimal solutions and therefore different expected objective function values the results for the expected total groundwater pumping rate evaluated over 500 realizations for three runs were thereafter averaged fig 7 shows a graph presenting an overall performance of the roa method with cluster sampling for the regional aquifer system evaluated over 500 realizations fig 7 shows that the roa expected total pumping rate average of three runs converged to its maximum pumping value of about 6 9550 103 m3 day within 6 7 iterations evaluated over the 500 realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields out of the expected total optimal pumping rate value quaternary catchment b81h with combined pumping well cpw2 contributed the highest percentage of about 21 while the lowest percentage contribution of about 3 contributed by quaternary catchment b81c with combined pumping well cpw4 fig 8 it should be noted that the high difference of percentage of contribution between the quaternary catchments is due to high variation in saturated aquifer thickness as well as hydraulic conductivity values the quaternary catchment b81h has higher magnitude of hydraulic conductivity transmissivity value i e falls within transmissivity zone of 31 0 m2 day compared to quaternary catchment b81c which falls within transmissivity zone of relatively low magnitude value i e falls within transmissivity zone of 7 0 m2 day the overall contributions of each quaternary catchment combined pumping well to the expected total optimal pumping rate are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 combined pumping wells cpw1 cpw2 cpw7 and cpw8 i e pumping wells located within quaternary catchments b81g b81h b81j and b81d respectively contributed higher percentage to the expected total optimal pumping rate ranging from 15 to 21 compared to combined pumping wells cpw3 cpw4 cpw5 and cpw6 i e pumping wells located within quaternary catchments b81b b81c b81e and b81f respectively which contributed less than 15 ranging from 3 to 12 high differences in pumping rates are due to variation in saturated aquifer thickness recharge opportunity as well as variations in aquifer hydraulic conductivity transmissivity properties note that pumping wells with higher contributions are located within relatively higher magnitude of hydraulic conductivity value zones while pumping wells with lower contributions are located within relatively lower magnitude of hydraulic conductivity value zones 5 conclusions the objective of

12308,simulation optimization models have been widely developed and used for many decades in groundwater resource management however simulation optimization models in most applications encompass data that are subject to uncertainty groundwater aquifer hydrogeology condition is highly uncertain hence it is important that this uncertainty is taken into account when managing groundwater resource pumping rates various methodologies have been developed and used by researchers to tackle uncertainty simulation optimization models are often used for groundwater resource management however direct application of such an approach in which all realizations are considered at each iteration of the optimization process leads to a very expensive optimization particularly when the number of realizations is large this therefore highlights the need for an efficient simulation optimization tool that can be used to sustainably manage the limited water resource under uncertainty conditions in recent times retrospective optimization approximation roa approach has emerged to be useful simulation optimization tool that can efficiently incorporate uncertainty this paper introduces a procedure which is new within the context of regional groundwater resource management retrospective optimization approximation approach roa procedure solves and evaluates a sequence of optimization sub problems in an increasing number of realizations sample sizes response matrix technique was used to combine simulation model with optimization procedure model we adopted k means clustering sampling technique for realizations mapping by using k means clustering sampling the roa active set procedure was able to find a nearly converged solution within a relatively few number of iterations within 6 7 iterations the methodology is demonstrated through an application to a real world aquifer system found in the great letaba river catchment located at mopani district in south africa the results demonstrate that roa sampling based approach is capable of reproducing indicative optimal sustainable groundwater pumping rates which can be useful for managing regional aquifers groundwater resource under geological uncertainty conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater regional aquifers retrospective optimization approach south africa uncertainty 1 introduction many countries exhibit a high level of dependence on groundwater for water supply foster and hirata 2011 gyamfi et al 2017 groundwater management has already taken some shape in several countries through the implementation of legislative and other regulatory measures with respect to groundwater withdrawal and protection cramer 1987 however tsur and zemel 2004 pointed out that over exploitation of groundwater resources when pumping exceeds recharge is pervasive worldwide groundwater recharge is a key component in groundwater flow or transport models siva prasad and venkateswara rao 2017 as a result of low rain recharge and low porosity and low connectivity the depth to water table fluctuates considerably during the year and significant water scarcity is often experienced during drier years varua et al 2018 it is important to note that if groundwater is used intensively the yield of wells is provided primarily by the so called elastic storage petrov 1990 this leads to an intensive drawdown of piezometric head lowering of the pressure of the layers subsidence of ground surface and such negative effects as worsening of the quality of fresh groundwater landscape conditions petrov 1990 and increased costs of groundwater pumping mirzoyan et al 2017 the detrimental effects of groundwater over exploitation are widely reported in many parts of the world for example in the japanese cities of tokyo osaka and nagoja subsidence of ground surface of more than 2 5 m has been observed petrov 1990 similarly in south africa within the dolomitic rock regions such as krugersdorp and laudium in gauteng province large sinkholes have been observed due to intensive groundwater exploitation dwa 2009 from the foregone discussions it stands to reason that groundwater resources are poorly managed and the resource base misunderstood kalantari 2010 in view of these challenges groundwater needs proper management systems to safeguard its sustainability and use carrillo rivera and cardona 2012 underscores the need to understand utilize and govern the use of water resources in the most efficient way possible in order to minimize anthropogenic effects whiles ensuring enough quantity for environmental flows ndambuki 2001 also emphasized that if groundwater is to be exploited efficiently and economically with high yield boreholes then a management scheme that thrives on sustainability modules should be adopted notwithstanding the heterogeneous nature of aquifers and the complexity of hydrogeological processes presents a number of uncertainties in predicting groundwater flow behavior and incorporate management strategies ndambuki et al 2000 as a result of the complex nature of the earth that forms the aquifers and the inherent uncertainties the application of deterministic management approaches in the design of groundwater management schemes are deemed not to be effective ndambuki et al 2005 in view of this limitation there is a need for water management tools to incorporate uncertainty for reliable planning and efficient management of groundwater resources our major contribution in this paper is to present a combined simulation optimization methodology stochastic optimization approach the retrospective optimization approximation roa approach which considers the geological uncertainty brought about by lack of adequate data to fully characterise the regional aquifer systems using response matrix technique response matrix or embedding techniques are normally used to combine simulation model with management optimization model gorelick 1983 detailed discussion on these techniques can be found in literature aguado and remson 1974 peralta et al 1991 ndambuki 2001 response matrix approach uses superposition and linear systems theory to simulate groundwater flow peralta et al 1991 in the response matrix approach also known as technological function response matrix coefficients approach influence of a unit change in an independent decision variable such as pumping rate at a pre selected well location upon a variety of dependent variables like drawdown at specified potential control observation points is determined then superposition process is performed to calculate their total response at specified potential control points resulting from all decision variables ndambuki 2001 in other words a response matrix consists of linear influence coefficients that describe the response of the potentiometric surface to a unit volume of extraction or injection of groundwater peralta et al 1991 the main drawback of this technique is the number of simulations required to be performed to generate the response matrix as well as the size of the response matrix which is a function of stress locations and observation points considered however the final optimization problem to be solved is smaller than that which can be obtained from the embedding method ndambuki 2001 solving simulation optimization problems under uncertainty is computationally expensive because many flow simulations are required to provide reliable results wang et al 2012 indicated that efficient treatment of uncertainty particularly geological uncertainty presents a key challenge in application of optimization procedures and further asserted that the reason behind this is that in order to present the high degree of uncertainty in the reservoir geology many geological realizations must be considered various researchers have used mathematical programming for water resource management cheng et al 2009 coe 1990 karamouz et al 2007 zarghami et al 2008 some of these have used fuzzy models guo et al 2010 katambara 2011 lu et al 2010 genetic algorithms kumar et al 2006 kuo et al 2000 second order cone programming ndambuki 2001 ndambuki et al 2000 2003 2005 post optimality analysis gorelick 1982 stochastic optimization with recourse based methods guo et al 2010 lu et al 2009 maqsood et al 2005 mulvey et al 1995 ndambuki 2001 ndambuki et al 2000 wagner et al 1992 however it should be noted that direct application of such an approach in which all realizations are considered at every iteration of the optimization leads to a very costly optimizations particularly when the number of realizations is large wang et al 2012 our work in stochastic optimization problems is based on a recent refinement of sample average approximation saa sampling based methods a retrospective optimization approximation roa method where optimization sub problems are designed through expected functions solved and evaluated in a sequence of increasing number of realizations sample size the basic idea of roa is that it does not consider all realizations at all iterations of the optimization solver roa procedure designs and solves a sequence of approximate sample path optimization sub problems which sequentially account for increasing number of realizations sample size with decreasing error of tolerance roa approach uses warm start technique in which initial guess solution is updated by considering the initial solution for the current sub problem being the return solution from the previous sub problem solved this technique is new in areas of regional groundwater resource management but the authors are aware that in recent years the method has been used in areas such as petroleum engineering for instance in reservoir management problem wang et al 2012 well placement optimization problem guyaguler and home 2004 onwunalu and durlofsky 2010 yeten et al 2003 well control problem chen et al 2009 wang et al 2009 in operation research chen and schmeiser 2001 wang and schmeiser 2008 and the most recent application for solving quantity groundwater resource management problem of a hypothetical aquifer system kifanyi et al 2017 however their applications were over fixed and a relatively few decision variables in addition to using few number of realizations this paper therefore aims to apply an efficient method roa approach for optimizing regional scale groundwater pumping rates over multiple decision variables and hydrogeological model realizations the roa technique applied here differs from the previous works in the sense that it is applied to solve a sequence of optimization sub problems particularly designed for regional scale groundwater aquifer management problems under geological uncertainty in an increasing number of realizations of hydrogeological realizations through response matrix simulation optimization framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 roa simulation optimization problem formulation in this work the overall modelling objective is to optimize the pumping rates of a number of spatially distributed pumping wells under geological uncertainty environment particularly uncertainty due to aquifer hydraulic conductivity in this case uncertainty is expressed in terms of assemblage of aquifer system responses drawdowns which are determined under hydraulic conductivity field uncertainty conditions due to unit groundwater pumping rate at every potential candidate pumping well location in the model domain the assemblage set of aquifer system response values also known as technological function response matrix coefficients is usually developed to represent simulation results in a simulation optimization framework now let hydraulic conductivity field uncertainty realization be denoted by ϖ such that ϖ ψ where ψ is the total possible number of realizations thus each realization ϖ will have a different random response matrix denoted by a ϖ with associated random response matrix components denoted by a i j ϖ hence the random response matrices generated may result in different optimal solutions and therefore different optimal values of the optimization problem in general the optimization problem under uncertainty can be formulated as follows for a given solution set x such that x x find a solution x of an optimization problem 1 m a x i m i z e f x j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 2 e ψ z x j a ϖ b i i 1 2 3 n c ϖ ψ where e ψ represents the expectation function over the set of all realizations ψ and z is a numerical stochastic process that computes the sample observation of constraint function z x j a ϖ for a given x and the realization ϖ in this case x is the vector defining the groundwater pumping rates spatially distributed over the model domain f x is objective function evaluated through estimates of z x j a ϖ function by performing a numerical flow simulation with the hydrogeological model defined by realization ϖ x j is the groundwater pumping rate decision variable of pumping well at location j b i is constraining value at control point i n p w and n c are the number of pumping wells and control points respectively it should be noted that the pumping well locations which were considered for developing response matrices are the same in all realizations consider random response matrix defined by a ϖ with random response matrix components denoted by a i j ϖ simply denoted by ϖ that is the random hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns we assume that randomness in hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns is only due to uncertainty arising in hydraulic conductivity of aquifer system and that a ij ϖ a ϖ such that a ϖ ψ moreover p is assumed to be well defined with unknown distribution function but what is known is expected mean values standard deviation and or covariance of the random responses ϖ consider a stochastic constraint function process as z x j ϖ ψ to be defined as z x j ϖ i a ϖ i x j thus the expected value of the function z x j ϖ is defined as 3 e z x j ϖ e a ϖ x j hence the constraint inequality 2 can be written as e z x j ϖ b i such that the expectation z x j ϖ ψ z x j ϖ dp ϖ is the corresponding expected value function therefore inequality 2 can be estimated using monte carlo sampling based approximation methods in this case roa method by considering a sequence of finite sets of generated independent identically distributed i i d samples of random response matrices of n realizations of ϖ i a ϖ n 1 a ϖ n k we estimated the expected constraint function e z x j ϖ i as 4 e z x j ϖ i 1 n k i n k z x j ϖ i thereafter progressively we evaluated resulting sample path optimization sub problems using roa method framework for k 1 2 3 n sp where n sp is the number of sample path optimization sub problems generated hence the estimates retrospective groundwater sample path optimization problem ergsop can be formulated as 5 m a x i m i z e f n k x j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 6 1 n k i n k z x j ϖ i b i the estimates inequality function 6 is deterministic and hence the optimization sub problems developed becomes deterministic which can be solved by any appropriate core deterministic search optimizer algorithms this is one of the main advantages of roa approach it should be noted that roa procedure can be used in deterministic and stochastic search algorithms wang et al 2012 the optimization problems formulations 1 through 2 and formulations 5 through 6 are herein referred to as the true optimization problem and estimates optimization problem respectively in inequality 6 the term 1 n k defines the weight factor or probability associated with realizations ϖ i in this work different sample sizes n k number of realizations were considered for each sample path optimization sub problem generated the performance objective function considered is the expected total optimal groundwater pumping rate decision variables considered are groundwater pumping rates i e positive real values x such that x ℝ n p w which are spatially distributed within the model domain in this case we assume that the solution set x is closed and bounded and hence the problem has finite number of feasible solutions 2 2 roa procedure the basic feature of the roa technique is that the sample sizes i e the number of realizations is increased from sample path optimization sub problem to sub problem and that the initial guess solution for the current sample path optimization sub problem is simply the returned solution from the previous sample path optimization sub problem solved this guarantees that in early iterations the roa procedure does not require excessive computational effort because the number of realizations sample sizes is small similarly in the later iterations it is computationally inexpensive because the initial solutions are closer to the optimum solution of the true optimization problem hence the overall iterations required by the core optimizer is relatively fewer and therefore computational savings can be achieved compared to a direct optimization which considers all realizations at each iteration to solve the stochastic optimization problem using retrospective optimization approximation roa approach the following elucidated steps are followed kifanyi et al 2017 1 for a given available data in this case hydraulic conductivity field mean and standard deviation generate set of realizations of aquifer hydraulic conductivity fields ϖ 2 for each given realization ϖ run modflow simulation model to generate responses a i j ϖ i e ϖ random responses of hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns due to a unit groundwater pumping rate we consider existing maximum groundwater pumping rate to represent a unit pumping rate 3 generate a sequence of finite sets of independent identically distributed i i d samples of random aquifer response matrices a ϖ i of n realizations of ϖ i a ϖ n k a ϖ n k for k 1 2 3 n s p 4 for a given sequence of finite set of the generated samples of aquifer response matrices realised generate a sequence of retrospective sample path sub problems f n k f o r k 1 2 3 n s p 5 for each k t h sample path sub problem apply core optimizer solver to provide an optimal solution or a nearly closer approximation of optimal solution x k of f n k 6 repeat step 5 for k 1 2 3 n s p until sample path optimization sub problem optimal solution x k converges to true optimization problem optimal solution x note that for each sub problem we consider distinct probable weight factor of p r ϖ i 1 n k hence as k increases the sample path sub problem f n k optimal solution x k converges to the true optimization problem optimal solution x of objective function f 2 3 sampling technique roa procedure can be used with any sampling technique depending on availability of data in this study we applied k means clustering sampling algorithm implemented under matlab 2014a environment through k means clustering sampling we were able to establish realizations mapping from every realization to a finite number n of attributes in groundwater pumping water production perspective attributes that can be useful is some measure of hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity in this case firstly the quantity is normalized to 0 1 and then a vector of values is identified with each realization using this process each realization of hydraulic conductivity field ϖ i was assigned to a vector of attributes α i α i ℝ n the vectors of attributes were then used in the k means algorithm the k means algorithm provides k vectors in ℝ n i e cluster centres that minimize mean average distance δ for a given n number of realizations and can be defined in the form 7 δ i 1 n m i n α i ϕ j 2 j 1 2 k where α i denotes a vector of attributes such that α i ℝ n and ϕ j denotes the coordinates of the centre of cluster j in k means approach once the cluster centres are established a particular realization ϖ i is assigned to one of the centres by simply computing the minimum distance as a r g m i n j 1 2 k α i ϕ j 3 application of the roa methodology to the great letaba regional aquifer system 3 1 study area the roa methodology was applied to a real world aquifer system found in mopani district in the great letaba also known as the groot letaba river basin aquifer system located in the primary drainage region b of the olifants river basin the great letaba catchment is located in the limpopo province in the north eastern part of south africa fig 1 the great letaba river is one of the major tributaries of the olifants river the great letaba river catchment is characterized by high elevation differences between 301 and 2121 m amsl it should clearly be noted that in many decades most of studies dwaf 1990 1994 1998 2003 2004 2006a 2006b 2006c and others consider the great letaba river catchment as part of limpopo river basin this is because previously the great groot letaba river catchment area was known to be within the then luvuvhu letaba water management area wma which was falling in the limpopo river basin until recently on 20th august 2012 when it was officially declared by the government of south africa via her department the then department of water affairs dwa that it is part of the olifants river basin thomas 2015 the great letaba river catchment covers a surface area of approximately 4952 km2 dwaf 2006c it is found within mopani district municipality in the greater letaba local municipality the main urban areas in the catchment are tzaneen and nkawakowa the kruger national park knp is located at the eastern lower end of the catchment to the mozambique border in south africa water management areas wmas have been formed whereby throughout the country the primary drainage regions are divided into secondary tertiary and quaternary catchments the basic unit of area used in this work is the quaternary catchment fig 2 shows the quaternary catchments of the great letaba river catchment 3 1 1 hydrogeology the great letaba river catchment aquifers are predominantly secondary with exception of alluvial deposits along the main river system intergranular aquifers ranging from unconsolidated to semi consolidated materials with primary porosity occur in the great letaba river mainly inside the kruger national park dwaf 2006c in general the great letaba river catchment hydrogeological regions can be divided mainly into the drakensberg escarpment also known as the great escarpment drakensberg foothills and valleys bandolierskop giyani gravelotte the plains and alluvium dwaf 2006c katambara and ndiritu 2009 a total of 515 of potential groundwater pumping boreholes are located in the hydrogeological aquifer region unit fig 3 in the river catchment a total of eight 8 groundwater monitoring control points wells have been installed by the government for groundwater level measurements fig 3 blue dots aquifer heads at these potential groundwater control observation wells ows were restricted by not allowing them to fall below 50 percent of the specified saturated aquifer thicknesses the existence of hot springs within the regional aquifer suggests that the aquifer is confined except along the major rivers where localized alluvium aquifers occur including in the eastern end of the catchment within the knp where unconfined aquifers occur the aquifer system is characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivity transmissivity values fig 4 presents the transmissivity values for the aquifer system adopted after holland 2011 classified into three 3 zones 3 1 2 simulation model of the study area the aquifer system has areal extent of 100 0 km by 50 0 km which was uniformly discretized into 150000 grid cells in 100 rows and 150 columns with an equal grid spacing of 1 50 km in the x direction and 0 50 km in the y direction finite difference method was used to discretize the area it was realised that in the modelled area no flow boundary appears at the north and south parts of the catchment constant flux boundary conditions exist in the boundaries located at the north west and south west parts of the catchment these are areas bounded by the great escarpment i e the drakensburg escarpment mountainous regions moreover specific head boundary conditions also referred to as dirichlet conditions for which boundaries provide a controlled general head flow boundary ghb was specified for the surface water bodies such as dams and eastern boundary of the modelled domain recharge in the catchment area is mainly realised within the high elevation areas of the great escarpment the drakensburg escarpment mountains where rainfall is high above 1000mm annual and in the alluvium aquifers along major rivers fig 5 shows finite difference discretized great letaba groundwater flow numerical simulation model in this work steady state simulations were considered and hence initial condition is not a major concern this is because in any groundwater steady state numerical simulations the focus is to determine aquifer drawdown in response to external imposed excitations stresses such as groundwater pumping whereby relative heads as measured with respects to drawdown responses are of great importance rather than absolute head values 3 2 model data input the irrigated area receives water from surface water sources and groundwater pumping wells it was assumed that losses for the irrigated fields area was in total 20 percent of applied water 10 percent percolates as recharge to the aquifer and 10 percent returns to the river as return flow total net recharge was estimated at a rate of 126 mm year dwaf 2003 the minimum pumping rate limits i e lower bounds pumping rates required to satisfy the minimum water requirements of the competing water users was assumed to be the existing groundwater pumping rates table 1 shows river and aquifer input data which were used for the simulation optimization problem analysis data on 515 boreholes obtained from grip database grip limpopo 2013 indicate that the overall maximum average daily abstraction capacity ranges from 62 to 70 m3 day table 2 presents the quaternary catchments names named variables combined pumping wells cpw with their corresponding number of wells mean aquifer thickness un optimized mean pumping rates and quaternary catchment areas which were used in the optimization problem analysis 3 3 groundwater management the overall modelling effort was to manage the water resources of the aquifer system in such a manner so as to maximize groundwater pumping production rates without substantially impacting undesirable consequences on the ecosystem to achieve this goal the following objective and constraints were considered 3 3 1 objective the objective was formulated as follows 8 m a x i m i s e f j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w where f is the objective function that represents the total groundwater pumping rate x j are the spatially distributed pumping rates decision variables and n p w is the total number of potential pumping wells 3 3 2 constraints the objective function was constrained with the following constraints drawdown constraints drawdown constraints are usually meant to protect the ecosystem by avoiding excessive drawdowns in this work the drawdown constraints were formulated to avoid mining as follows 9 j 1 n p w a i j x j b i i 1 2 3 n c where a i j is the drawdown at control point i caused by a unit pumping from potential pumping well located at j b i is the allowable drawdown at control point i and n c is the total number of control points control points are location points at which the drawdowns are controlled as noted the aquifer hydraulic conductivity transmissivity values are considered as uncertain hence the drawdowns a i j becomes dependent on the hydraulic conductivity transmissivity field ϖ realised as previously discussed the assemblage of the random response coefficients a i j ϖ forms finite set of independent identically distributed i i d samples of random aquifer response matrices a ϖ of n realizations as a ϖ n k a ϖ n 1 a ϖ n k for k 1 2 3 n s p therefore inequality 9 changes to the following form 10 a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c k 1 2 3 n s p ϖ ψ in this case the stochastic inequality constraint 10 can be estimated as 11 1 n k k 1 n k a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c where a ϖ n k is the k t h sample path optimization sub problem constraints response matrix and all other parameters are as previously defined total recharge constraint the total amount of water extracted from the aquifer was constrained so as not to exceed the total natural recharge entering the aquifer model domain this constraint was considered hard constraint and was formulated as 12 j 1 n p w x j t g r in which t g r is the total groundwater recharge in the well field water demand constraint in this work the aquifer was considered as the sole source of water supply hence it means that the designed optimal pumping strategy must satisfy at least the minimum total water demand without impacting negatively on the other water sources the constraint was formulated as follows 13 j 1 n p w x j t w d where t w d is the total water demand within the model domain pumping constraint pumping rates at each potential pumping well was constrained to values between some minimum and maximum rates this constraint was formulated as follows 14 x j m i n x j x j m a x j 1 2 3 n p w where x j m i n and x j m a x are the minimum and maximum allowable pumping rates respectively 3 3 3 statement of the management problem the stochastic optimization problem solved therefore was as follows 15 m a x i m i s e f j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 16 a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c k 1 2 3 n s p ϖ ψ 17 j 1 n p w x j t g r 18 j 1 n p w x j t w d 19 x j m i n x j x j m a x j 1 2 3 n p w the optimization problem formulation 15 through 19 is a stochastic optimization problem because it depends on realization of hydraulic conductivity field ϖ this optimization problem is referred to as the true groundwater optimization problem the estimates sample path optimization sub problems solved therefore was formulated as follows 20 m a x i m i z e f n k j 1 n p w x j j 1 2 3 n p w subject to 21 1 n k k 1 n k a ϖ n k x j b i i 1 2 3 n c k 1 2 3 n s p 22 j 1 n p w x j t g r 23 j 1 n p w x j t w d 24 x j m i n x j x j m a x j 1 2 3 n p w all parameters are as previously defined the sample path optimization sub problems were solved and analysed through the roa framework 3 3 4 formulation of sample path optimization sub problems a total of 500 realizations of uncertain hydraulic conductivity fields which leads to different aquifer system responses i e hydraulic heads water table level drawdowns were generated from the heterogeneous aquifer system a correlation length of 100000 m by 50000 m in a 2 dimensional x y direction was considered sufficient enough to handle significant representation of input parameter uncertainties of the aquifer geology in the model domain eight 8 groundwater control points were identified active the water heads at these monitoring observation wells control points were restricted not to fall below certain prescribed maximum allowable limiting values the attributes used account for variations in aquifer properties it should be realised that the same control points and pumping wells locations are used to measure responses of the aquifer system aquifer heads water table level drawdowns when subjected to external stresses in this case unit pumping rate for every realization of hydraulic conductivity field assemblage of aquifer system responses due to the 500 realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields resulted in a total of 4020 response matrix rows observation rows hence in total a constraining response matrix of 4020 by 515 was generated this response matrix was used to generate ten 10 sample path optimization sub problems of different sample sizes observation rows for the management models in this work sample sizes were determined heuristically table 3 presents the sample path optimization sub problems generated for the roa approach performance evaluation from table 3 the last sample path optimization sub problem i e sosp10 is considered to be the true groundwater optimization problem the simulation optimization sub problems were solved in a sequence of increasing number of realizations using simulator modflow harbaugh et al 2000 a groundwater numerical simulation model in this case a steady state simulation was performed and a core optimizer active set a sequential quadratic programming sqp algorithm implemented under matlab 2014a environment codes the k means clustering sampling technique was used for the realizations mapping 4 results and discussion the overall objective of the optimization was to determine the optimal pumping rates that maximize the expected total groundwater pumping rates table 4 presents the simulation optimization pumping rate solutions in m3 day of the generated sample path optimization sub problems from table 4 the optimal solution strategies corresponding to the sequence of sample path optimization sub problems generated yields optimal solutions ranging from a minimum of 77 01 m3 day quaternary catchment b81c at combined pumping well cpw4 to a maximum of 1465 30 m3 day quaternary catchment b81h at combined pumping well cpw2 with total optimal objective function mean values ranging from a minimum of 2374 56 m3 day to a maximum of 6955 00 m3 day it can also be seen from table 4 that the error of tolerance decreases as number of realizations sample sizes increases while the sample path optimization sub problems optimal solutions converge towards the true optimization problem i e sosp10 as the number of realizations increases in this work the error of tolerance ranges from 65 85 i e at sosp20 when realization equal to 20 to 0 i e at sosp10 the true optimization problem when realizations equal to 500 fig 6 shows the groundwater simulation optimization pumping solutions strategies of the sample path optimization sub problems as it can be seen in fig 6 the sample path optimization sub problems optimal solutions converge towards the true groundwater optimization problem optimum solution as the sample size increases it should be noted that the first sample path optimization sub problem sosp1 is inexpensive because computing every optimal solution or objective function value requires only few function evaluations the ninth optimal solution sosp9 is very close to the true optimization problem sosp10 optimal solution the tenth sample path optimization problem sosp10 whereby all the 500 realizations generated were considered converged with relatively few number of iterations because its initial solution guess i e sosp9 solution is nearly equal to the true optimization problem sosp10 optimal solution to evaluate the overall performance of the roa approach for groundwater resource management the sample path optimization sub problems were solved with different initial solution guesses for three runs which consequently resulted in different optimal solutions and therefore different expected objective function values the results for the expected total groundwater pumping rate evaluated over 500 realizations for three runs were thereafter averaged fig 7 shows a graph presenting an overall performance of the roa method with cluster sampling for the regional aquifer system evaluated over 500 realizations fig 7 shows that the roa expected total pumping rate average of three runs converged to its maximum pumping value of about 6 9550 103 m3 day within 6 7 iterations evaluated over the 500 realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields out of the expected total optimal pumping rate value quaternary catchment b81h with combined pumping well cpw2 contributed the highest percentage of about 21 while the lowest percentage contribution of about 3 contributed by quaternary catchment b81c with combined pumping well cpw4 fig 8 it should be noted that the high difference of percentage of contribution between the quaternary catchments is due to high variation in saturated aquifer thickness as well as hydraulic conductivity values the quaternary catchment b81h has higher magnitude of hydraulic conductivity transmissivity value i e falls within transmissivity zone of 31 0 m2 day compared to quaternary catchment b81c which falls within transmissivity zone of relatively low magnitude value i e falls within transmissivity zone of 7 0 m2 day the overall contributions of each quaternary catchment combined pumping well to the expected total optimal pumping rate are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 combined pumping wells cpw1 cpw2 cpw7 and cpw8 i e pumping wells located within quaternary catchments b81g b81h b81j and b81d respectively contributed higher percentage to the expected total optimal pumping rate ranging from 15 to 21 compared to combined pumping wells cpw3 cpw4 cpw5 and cpw6 i e pumping wells located within quaternary catchments b81b b81c b81e and b81f respectively which contributed less than 15 ranging from 3 to 12 high differences in pumping rates are due to variation in saturated aquifer thickness recharge opportunity as well as variations in aquifer hydraulic conductivity transmissivity properties note that pumping wells with higher contributions are located within relatively higher magnitude of hydraulic conductivity value zones while pumping wells with lower contributions are located within relatively lower magnitude of hydraulic conductivity value zones 5 conclusions the objective of this paper was to introduce roa approach within the context of regional aquifers groundwater resource management in this work roa approach was applied to the real world regional aquifer water system

algorithm in either stochastic or deterministic core optimizers we used deterministic active set algorithm sqp based gradient search algorithm core optimizer roa optimizes by considering a sequence of increasing number of realizations sample size we adopted k means clustering sampling technique for realizations mapping through k means clustering sampling the roa active set procedure was able to find a nearly converged optimal solution within a relatively few number of iterations within 6 7 iterations in conclusion the results demonstrate that roa sampling based approach is capable of reproducing indicative optimal sustainable groundwater pumping rates which can be useful for managing regional aquifers groundwater resource under geological uncertainty conditions declarations of

amsl excessive surplus of water from the barak river precipitation and other surface water bodies during the wet seasons cause water logging landslide soil erosion and groundwater contamination at many places on the other hand owing to evaporation and runoff along the slopes the region experiences shortage of water during the dry seasons leading to overall fluctuation of water resources

shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively the mean ph values of sw and gw lie in the range between 6 and 8 indicating fresh and neutral type of these waters the contributions of major cations and anions in tds in water samples are shown in table 3 tds values in sw and gw samples range from 20 mg l to 450 mg l indicating its fresh quality davis and dewiest 1966 the waters of bv are characterized by enriched hco3 na and ca and depleted so4 levels higher ca and hco3 are generally characteristic of lower tds in gw as evident in table 3 hco3 contributes 70 of tds in sw while 47 79 72 of tds are contributed by co3 in pz ap and fp groundwaters respectively the major cations in tds are na and cl which share 75 81 75 70 of tds in sw pz ap and fp groundwaters respectively the concentrations of major solutes in sw and gw samples decrease in the order hco3 na cl co3 ca no3 mg po4 k al fe so4 and hco3 cl no3 na po4 co3 ca mg k respectively the variation in major ion concentrations in sw and gw samples is depicted by the schoeller diagram fig 2 a the diagram shows the concentrations of major ions in sw are less compared to gw indicating less ion dissociation in sw among the geomorphic units

r2 0 46 however in gw significant strong negative correlation is confined to orp and ph r2 0 62 only the moderately strong positive correlation can be seen between tds and na r2 0 775 hco3 r2 0 88 na and hco3 r2 0 72 in cl and na r2 0 62 indicating similar source of dissolution 5 discussion 5 1 trace element chemistry trace elements are generally considered as those elements which concentrations are less than 1 mg l they may be derived from the weathering of rocks or human activities harrison and adams 1966 stumm and baccini 1978 galloway and likens 1979 kronberg 1979 nriagu 1979 in bengal basin groundwater high hco3 is ubiquitous and play an important role in hydrochemical evolution and trace metal mobilization mukherjee et al 2008 the order of relative abundance of trace elements in sw and gw are al fe mg zn as ba cr bi cd and fe mg as sr al zn ba bi cd respectively their spatial variation is shown by schoeller diagram fig 2b the diagram indicates that sw samples show relatively lower concentration than gw among the geomorphic units trace metals dissociate more in fp than the rest of the units the correlation between trace elements in sw and gw are shown in table 5 in sw strong positive correlation can be seen in fe with al r2 0 99 and cr r2 0 99 in bi with ba r2 0 99 and al r2 0 97 while negative strong correlation can be identified between sr and fe r2 0 78 the positive relation suggest that the source of these elements through geogenic weathering of oxides hydroxides carbonates or sulphides in gw strong positive correlation is seen between bi and zn r2 0 78 and cr r2 0 64 and weak negative correlation are occurred between mn and al r2 0 34 and sr and fe r2 0 38 5 2 hydrogeochemical processes the hydrogeochemical processes in a region are mainly controlled by precipitation evaporation ion exchange silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and rock water interaction gibbs 1970 lee and strickland 1988 lakshmanan et al 2003 rajmohan and elango 2004 sajilkumar and james 2016 gibbs 1970 diagram is commonly used to classify the types of water from which the influence of the controlling processes can be identified as evident from the gibbs diagram fig 2c and d most of the samples are influenced by rock water interaction and few of them are by precipitation this clearly indicates that the water chemistry is mainly controlled by weathering of rocks particular in gw and precipitation in case of sw as the study area falls under humid and wet conditions the role of evaporation in water chemistry in the valley is insignificant the bivariate relation between na cl vs ec shown in fig 3 a shows an inverse relationship implying that evaporation is not a prominent process affecting the hydrochemistry in gw shajilkumar and james 2016 the high concentration of hco3 in the eastern megna surma basin cannot be totally derived from carbonate dissolution and may also be influenced by oxidation of natural organic matter ahmed et al 2004 the water is also characterized by very low so4 content 0 5 of tds indicating the significance of sulphate reduction under reducing condition sulphate reduction is a bacterial reaction in which bacteria oxidizes organic matter to co2 producing sulphide species as a by product drever 1997 these water types represent recently infiltrated surface water where their chemical signature is not very different from rain water 5 3 silicate dissolution process common minerals such as quartz gypsum pyroxenes amphiboles chlorite calcic and potash feldspars are prone to weathering these minerals can be a rich source of sodium and potassium jacks 1973 bartarya 1993 the origin of salinity in gw can be explained based on the na cl relationship sami 1992 cartwright and weaver 2005 carol et al 2009 generally if this ratio equals to 1 it signifies dissolution of halite and if the ratio is 1 it implies silicate weathering meybeck 1987 jankowski and acworth 1997 the na cl ratio ranges from 0 49 to 21 in sw and from 0 80 to 37 9 in gw table 1 the scatter plot of na vs cl fig 3b shows that most of the sw and gw samples deviate and plot above the 1 1 equiline in the na field this signifies high na ion concentration and silicate weathering contribute to na concentration in water shajilkumar and james 2016 zhang et al 2017 the study area is located in a sedimentary terrain consisting of sandstone shale and conglomerate belonging to the surma group miocene the tipam group miocene and the dupitila group mio pliocene the silicate weathering of these rocks could be the source of plagioclase feldspars leading to enrichment of na ions in gw the plot of ca mg vs na cl can be used to infer the contribution of silicate weathering if the value of ca mg ratio is equal to 1 dissolution of dolomite is assumed to have occurred whereas higher ratios indicate a greater contribution from calcite mayo and loucks 1995 hence values close to the line ca mg 1 indicate dissolution of calcite and dolomite whereas those with values greater than 2 indicate the effects of silicate weathering the plot in the bv fig 3c shows that most of the gw samples lie along the ca mg 2 line suggesting extensive silicate weathering as the dominant geochemical process in these waters silicate weathering is further confirmed by the correlation plot between ca mg vs total cations tz fig 3d where most of the plots are inclined towards tz revealing the dominance of silicate weathering however some sw samples show a slightly different trend which could be due to the ion exchange processes 5 4 ion exchange process ion exchange is another important hydrogeochemical process which influences the water chemistry in the study area favorable conditions for the occurrence of ionic exchange are a recharged source of groundwater with elevated ca concentrations and presence of minerals with both high cation exchange capacities and na on the exchange sites cloutier et al 2010 these processes can be classified as normal ion exchange and reverse ion exchange the identification of these reactions can be studied using the bivariate relationship between ca mg vs hco3 so4 with a 1 1 mixing line if normal ion exchange is prominent the plotted points must shift towards the hco3 so4 region however if reverse ion exchange dominates the shift occurs towards the ca mg region fisher and mulican 1997 rajmohan and elango 2004 carol et al 2009 huang et al 2013 and is characterized by 1 a negative slope 1 for the trend line most of the samples fall towards the hco3 so4 field indicating normal ion exchange process fig 4 a generally the simple dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum based host rocks can be reflected in the relation between ca mg and hco3 so4 if this ratio lies close to the 1 1 line in the study area the relation shows that all water samples plot away from the equiline and also in the hco3 so4 field this implies that the sources of these ions are not from dissolution of calcite dolomite halite and gypsum but derived from silicate weathering the normal ion exchange process is further confirmed by the slope of the positive trend line y 3 83x r2 0 27 in bivariate plot of na cl vs ca mg hco3 so4 fig 4b the ion exchange process is also indicated by the negative correlation between na cl and ca mg fig 4c 5 5 chemical evolution of water the trilinear and ternary diagrams hill 1940 piper 1944 and chebotarev 1955 have been using to study the evolution of hydrochemical facies petals and diamantis 1999 kshetrimayum and bajpai 2012 tillman et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 kshetrimayum 2015 kshetrimayum and laxmi 2017 zhang et al 2017 trilinear diagram shown in fig 5 a reveals that the sw is characterized by ca mg hco3 type water representing carbonate hardness exceeding 50 in the bv however gw samples represent different types of samples i e alkaline and weak acids type na hco3 mixed type ca mg hco3 cl alkaline and strong acid type na cl in addition to carbonate rich types ca mg hco3 indicating more ionic interaction than sw samples ternary diagram fig 5b shows that hco3 is the dominant anion while ca and mg are the dominant cations in both sw and gw as per the chebotarev model 1955 chemical evolution of both sw and gw can be characterized by ion exchange process leading to enhanced dissolution of major ions 6 water quality index the water quality index wqi is used to assess the suitability of sw and gw for human consumption bordalo et al 2006 sahu and sikdar 2008 banoeng yakubo et al 2009 tyagi et al 2013 wu et al 2017 in this study 24 parameters were chosen and the w i and wi were calculated as 78 and 3 60 respectively the calculated relative weight w i values of each parameter with reference to the indian standard is provided in table 6 wqi values for sw and gw samples in the bv range from 1702 to 84 7 and 1568 to 1 1 respectively table 1 based on wqi except one sample each from sw and gw all the samples in general belong to poor to unsuitable categories sw has 24 of samples listed as poor category whereas in gw it is 9 21 of gw samples and one sample in sw fall under very poor category 33 of gw and one sample in sw belong to unsuitable category due to the presence of elevated trace elements like as fe and mn arsenic concentration in sw ranges from 10 μg l to 180 μg l with a mean of 80 μg l all the gw samples exceed the is limit the concentration ranges from 10 μg l to 740 μg l which almost exceeds 15 times of the is limit with an average of 189 μg l in gw ap has the highest mean as elevation 210 μg l and kalain area g24 has the highest as level in the bv table 2 sodium absorption ratio sar richards 1954 and na wilcox 1955 plots were used to determine the suitability of water for agricultural use table 7 excess sodium in water produces undesirable effects of changing soil properties and reduces soil permeability kelly 1951 todd 1980 the sar diagram shows that all the samples have low salinity hazard c1 and low na alkalinity hazard s1 suggesting that they are suitable for irrigation purpose fig 6 a na plot also indicates that most of the samples fall under excellent to permissible category except few samples which falls under doubtful category fig 6b for the same purpose 7 conclusions the present work describes the hydrogeochemical processes involved in determining the quality of sw and gw in the barak valley of ne india 33 well sites representing different units like river paleochannel lake pond swamp piedmont zone alluvial plain flood pain were chosen for the study basic hydrochemical parameters t tds ec ph orp major ions ca mg k na hco3 co3 so4 cl no3 po4 al and trace metals pb cd cr zn ba bi li ni sr were determined using field and lab based methods the basic hydrochemical constituents show that both sw and gw are neutral and fresh in nature tds is dominated by hco3 70 in sw and 66 in gw na and ca and depleted in so4 0 5 of tds the concentrations of major solutes decrease in the order of hco3 na cl co3 ca no3 mg po4 k al fe so4 in sw and hco3 cl no3 na po4 co3 ca mg k in gw schoeller diagram indicates the gw has variable ion dissolution rate than sw in gw flood plain has higher ion concentrations than piedmont and alluvial plains major cations exhibit significant moderate positive correlations between ca and mg r2 0 67 k and cl r2 0 68 and mg and hco3 r2 0 63 indicating similar source of ionisation the strong negative correlation between orp and ph r2 0 98 implies that the ion reduction process occurs under low ph condition the hydrogeochemical processes are dominated by silicate dissolution and ion exchange processes the detail analysis using gibb s diagram scatter plots trilinear and ternary diagrams are carried out gibb diagram indicates that most of the samples undergoes rock water interaction and precipitation reaction bivariate relations of na cl ca mg vs na cl and ca mg vs total cations tz suggest that silicate weathering is the dominant chemical process weathering of rocks in the study area leads to enrichment of na ions in gw the scatter plots depict relationship of ca mg vs hco3 so4 ca mg vs na cl ca mg hco3 so4 and na cl vs ca mg hco3 so4 indicating normal ion exchange as a significant hydrogeochemical process that prevails in gw chemically the sw evolved representing a ca mg hco3 type while gw is characterized by an intermediate stage water quality index ranges from 1702 to 84 7 in sw and 1568 to 1 1 in gw almost all the samples fall under poor to unsuitable categories for drinking as per wqi this is due to the presence of elevated as fe and mn levels in samples arsenic is found to exceed the is limit in almost all samples average elevation of as is gw is 189 μg l which is almost 4 times higher than the is limit the highest is found at kalain area in alluvial plain 740 μg l based on sar na plots most of the samples were recommended for agricultural use only the present work thus will help in making

agricultural uses graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemical process surface water groundwater silicate weathering ion exchange water quality index barak valley 1 introduction a large part of the barak valley bv is characterized by presence of several surface water bodies like rivers ponds lakes beels swamp paleochannels which has low lying topography elevation ranges from 22 m to 35 m amsl excessive surplus of water from the barak river precipitation and other surface water bodies during the wet seasons cause water logging landslide soil erosion and groundwater contamination at many places on the other hand owing to evaporation and runoff along the slopes the region experiences shortage of water during the dry seasons leading to overall fluctuation of water resources available in the valley this seasonal fluctuation of water resource has an impact on hydrochemical parameters leading to deterioration of quality meintjes et al 1994 quesada et al 1995 krebs et al

lower concentration than gw among the geomorphic units trace metals dissociate more in fp than the rest of the units the correlation between trace elements in sw and gw are shown in table 5 in sw strong positive correlation can be seen in fe with al r2 0 99 and cr r2 0 99 in bi with ba r2 0 99 and al r2 0 97 while negative strong correlation can be identified between sr and fe r2 0 78 the positive relation suggest that the source of these elements through geogenic weathering of oxides hydroxides carbonates or sulphides in gw strong positive correlation is seen between bi and zn r2 0 78 and cr r2 0 64 and weak negative correlation are occurred between mn and al r2 0 34 and sr and fe r2 0 38 5 2 hydrogeochemical processes the hydrogeochemical processes in a region are mainly controlled by precipitation evaporation ion exchange silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and rock water interaction gibbs 1970 lee and strickland 1988 lakshmanan et al 2003 rajmohan and elango 2004 sajilkumar and james 2016 gibbs 1970 diagram is commonly used to classify the types of water from which the influence of the controlling processes can be identified as evident from the gibbs diagram fig 2c and d most of the samples are influenced by rock water interaction and few of them are by precipitation this clearly indicates that the water chemistry is mainly controlled by weathering of rocks particular in gw and precipitation in case of sw as the study area falls under humid and wet conditions the role of evaporation in water chemistry in the valley is insignificant the bivariate relation between na cl vs ec shown in fig 3 a shows an inverse relationship implying that evaporation is not a prominent process affecting the hydrochemistry in gw shajilkumar and james 2016 the high concentration of hco3 in the eastern megna surma basin cannot be totally derived from carbonate dissolution and may also be influenced by oxidation of natural organic matter ahmed et al 2004 the water is also characterized by very low so4 content 0 5 of tds indicating the significance of sulphate reduction under reducing condition sulphate reduction is a bacterial reaction in which bacteria oxidizes organic matter to co2 producing sulphide species as a by product drever 1997 these water types represent recently infiltrated surface water where their chemical signature is not very different from rain water 5 3 silicate dissolution process common minerals such as quartz gypsum pyroxenes amphiboles chlorite calcic and potash feldspars are prone to weathering these minerals can be a rich source of sodium and potassium jacks 1973 bartarya 1993 the origin of salinity in gw can be explained based on the na cl relationship sami 1992 cartwright and weaver 2005 carol et al 2009 generally if this ratio equals to 1 it signifies dissolution of halite and if the ratio is 1 it implies silicate weathering meybeck 1987 jankowski and acworth 1997 the na cl ratio ranges from 0 49 to 21 in sw and from 0 80 to 37 9 in gw table 1 the scatter plot of na vs cl fig 3b shows that most of the sw and gw samples deviate and plot above the 1 1 equiline in the na field this signifies high na ion concentration and silicate weathering contribute to na concentration in water shajilkumar and james 2016 zhang et al 2017 the study area is located in a sedimentary terrain consisting of sandstone shale and conglomerate belonging to the surma group miocene the tipam group miocene and the dupitila group mio pliocene the silicate weathering of these rocks could be the source of plagioclase feldspars leading to enrichment of na ions in gw the plot of ca mg vs na cl can be used to infer the contribution of silicate weathering if the value of ca mg ratio is equal to 1 dissolution of dolomite is assumed to have occurred whereas higher ratios indicate a greater contribution from calcite mayo and loucks 1995 hence values close to the line ca mg 1 indicate dissolution of calcite and dolomite whereas those with values greater than 2 indicate the effects of silicate weathering the plot in the bv fig 3c shows that most of the gw samples lie along the ca mg 2 line suggesting extensive silicate weathering as the dominant geochemical process in these waters silicate weathering is further confirmed by the correlation plot between ca mg vs total cations tz fig 3d where most of the plots are inclined towards tz revealing the dominance of silicate weathering however some sw samples show a slightly different trend which could be due to the ion exchange processes 5 4 ion exchange process ion exchange is another important hydrogeochemical process which influences the water chemistry in the study area favorable conditions for the occurrence of ionic exchange are a recharged source of groundwater with elevated ca concentrations and presence of minerals with both high cation exchange capacities and na on the exchange sites cloutier et al 2010 these processes can be classified as normal ion exchange and reverse ion exchange the identification of these reactions can be studied using the bivariate relationship between ca mg vs hco3 so4 with a 1 1 mixing line if normal ion exchange is prominent the plotted points must shift towards the hco3 so4 region however if reverse ion exchange dominates the shift occurs towards the ca mg region fisher and mulican 1997 rajmohan and elango 2004 carol et al 2009 huang et al 2013 and is characterized by 1 a negative slope 1 for the trend line most of the samples fall towards the hco3 so4 field indicating normal ion exchange process fig 4 a generally the simple dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum based host rocks can be reflected in the relation between ca mg and hco3 so4 if this ratio lies close to the 1 1 line in the study area the relation shows that all water samples plot away from the equiline and also in the hco3 so4 field this implies that the sources of these ions are not from dissolution of calcite dolomite halite and gypsum but derived from silicate weathering the normal ion exchange process is further confirmed by the slope of the positive trend line y 3 83x r2 0 27 in bivariate plot of na cl vs ca mg hco3 so4 fig 4b the ion exchange process is also indicated by the negative correlation between na cl and ca mg fig 4c 5 5 chemical evolution of water the trilinear and ternary diagrams hill 1940 piper 1944 and chebotarev 1955 have been using to study the evolution of hydrochemical facies petals and diamantis 1999 kshetrimayum and bajpai 2012 tillman et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 kshetrimayum 2015 kshetrimayum and laxmi 2017 zhang et al 2017 trilinear diagram shown in fig 5 a reveals that the sw is characterized by ca mg hco3 type water representing carbonate hardness exceeding 50 in the bv however gw samples represent different types of samples i e alkaline and weak acids type na hco3 mixed type ca mg hco3 cl alkaline and strong acid type na cl in addition to carbonate rich types ca mg hco3 indicating more ionic interaction than sw samples ternary diagram fig 5b shows that hco3 is the dominant anion while ca and mg are the dominant cations in both sw and gw as per the chebotarev model 1955 chemical evolution of both sw and gw can be characterized by ion exchange process leading to enhanced dissolution of major ions 6 water quality index the water quality index wqi is used to assess the suitability of sw and gw for human consumption bordalo et al 2006 sahu and sikdar 2008 banoeng yakubo et al 2009 tyagi et al 2013 wu et al 2017 in this study 24 parameters were chosen and the w i and wi were calculated as 78 and 3 60 respectively the calculated relative weight w i values of each parameter with reference to the indian standard is provided in table 6 wqi values for sw and gw samples in the bv range from 1702 to 84 7 and 1568 to 1 1 respectively table 1 based on wqi except one sample each from sw and gw all the samples in general belong to poor to unsuitable categories sw has 24 of samples listed as poor category whereas in gw it is 9 21 of gw samples and one sample in sw fall under very poor category 33 of gw and one sample in sw belong to unsuitable category due to the presence of elevated trace elements like as fe and mn arsenic concentration in sw ranges from 10 μg l to 180 μg l with a mean of 80 μg l all the gw samples exceed the is limit the concentration ranges from 10 μg l to 740 μg l which almost exceeds 15 times of the is limit with an average of 189 μg l in gw ap has the highest mean as elevation 210 μg l and kalain area g24 has the highest as level in the bv table 2 sodium absorption ratio sar richards 1954 and na wilcox 1955 plots were used to determine the suitability of water for agricultural use table 7 excess sodium in water produces undesirable effects of changing soil properties and reduces soil permeability kelly 1951 todd 1980 the sar diagram shows that all the samples have low salinity hazard c1 and low na alkalinity hazard s1 suggesting that they are suitable for irrigation purpose fig 6 a na plot also indicates that most of the samples fall under excellent to permissible category except few samples which falls under doubtful category fig 6b for the same purpose 7 conclusions the present work describes the hydrogeochemical processes involved in determining the quality of sw and gw in the barak valley of ne india 33 well sites representing different units like river paleochannel lake pond swamp piedmont zone alluvial plain flood pain were chosen for the study basic hydrochemical parameters t tds ec ph orp major ions ca mg k na hco3 co3 so4 cl no3 po4 al and trace metals pb cd cr zn ba bi li ni sr were determined using field and lab based methods the basic hydrochemical constituents show that both sw and gw are neutral and fresh in nature tds is dominated by hco3 70 in sw and 66 in gw na and ca and depleted in so4 0 5 of tds the concentrations of major solutes decrease in the order of hco3 na cl co3 ca no3 mg po4 k al fe so4 in sw and hco3 cl no3 na po4 co3 ca mg k in gw schoeller diagram indicates the gw has variable ion dissolution rate than sw in gw flood plain has higher ion concentrations than piedmont and alluvial plains major cations exhibit significant moderate positive correlations between ca and mg r2 0 67 k and cl r2 0 68 and mg and hco3 r2 0 63 indicating similar source of ionisation the strong negative correlation between orp and ph r2 0 98 implies that the ion reduction process occurs under low ph condition the hydrogeochemical processes are dominated by silicate dissolution and ion exchange processes the detail analysis using gibb s diagram scatter plots trilinear and ternary diagrams are carried out gibb diagram indicates that most of the samples undergoes rock water interaction and precipitation reaction bivariate relations of na cl ca mg vs na cl and ca mg vs total cations tz suggest that silicate weathering is the dominant chemical process weathering of rocks in the study area leads to enrichment of na ions in gw the scatter plots depict relationship of ca mg vs hco3 so4 ca mg vs na cl ca mg hco3 so4 and na cl vs ca mg hco3 so4 indicating normal ion exchange as a significant hydrogeochemical process that prevails in gw chemically the sw evolved representing a ca mg hco3 type while gw is characterized by an intermediate stage water quality index ranges from 1702 to 84 7 in sw and 1568 to 1 1 in gw almost all the samples fall under poor to unsuitable categories for drinking as per wqi this is due to the presence of elevated as fe and mn levels in samples arsenic is found to exceed the is limit in almost all samples average elevation of as is gw is 189 μg l which is almost 4 times higher than the is limit the highest is found at kalain area in alluvial plain 740 μg l based on sar na plots most of the samples were recommended for agricultural use only the present work thus will help in making
