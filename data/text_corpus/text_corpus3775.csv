18875,fishy odor has become one of the most often encountered aesthetic water quality problems in drinking water while fresh water algae living in colder water can produce offensive fishy odors their environmental behaviors remain poorly understood in this study two chrysophyte species synura uvella and ochromonas sp which are often associated with fishy odor events were selected to investigate the effect of temperature 8 16 and 24 c and light intensity 10 41 and 185 μmol photons m 2 s 1 on algal growth and odorant production five polyunsaturated aldehyde derivatives including 2 4 heptadienal 2 octenal 2 4 octadienal 2 4 decadienal and 2 4 7 dectridienal were identified as fishy cod liver oil fatty rancid descriptors in the cultures of the two algae based on gas chromatography olfactometry mass spectrometry and comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry while biomass yield increased with the increase in temperature for both species significantly higher odorant yields production of odorants per cell were obtained at 8 c the total odorant production and cell yield of the odorants decreased with the increase in light intensity from 10 to 185 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the biodegradation half lives for the released odorants were 6 10 h at 8 c and 2 4 h at 24 c whereas the volatilization half lives were 36 97 d at 8 c and 6 17 d at 24 c suggesting that temperature dependent biodegradation was an important factor controlling the fate of fishy compounds in aquatic environments the results of this study will help clarify why most fishy odor events occur in cooler seasons and provide knowledge related to cold water persistence for the management of fishy odor problems associated with algae graphical abstract image 1 keywords fishy

sorial 2011 sun et al 2014 su et al 2015 watson et al 2016 the niches for mib and geosmin producing cyanobacterial growth nakashima and yagi 1992 zhang et al 2009 li et al 2010 su et al 2018 and the production and loss of earthy musty odorants have been well documented saadoun et al 2001 li et al 2012 olsen et al 2016 harris et al 2016 fishy odor is another problem for humans using aquatic resources the offensive odors often occur in winter and early spring and last for several months leading to the difficulty in supplying acceptable water for people persson 1983 watson et al 2001 li et al 2016 compared with the earthy musty odors associated with cyanobacteria the occurrence of the fishy odors is mainly associated with chrysophyte diatom cryptophyte and dinoflagellate watson et al 2001 zhao et al 2013 li et al 2016 these algae are characterized by the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas which can be transformed into derivatives of polyunsaturated aldehydes puas wendel and jüttner 1996 watson et al 2001 though the role of each compound needs to be further identified some puas including 2 4 heptadienal 2 4 decadienal and 2 4 7 dectridienal have been reported to be associated with fishy odor events watson et al 2001 zhao et al 2013 the production of these fishy odorants is associated with algal dynamics under winter conditions such as low temperature and light irradiance watson et al 2001 wojciechowska and lenard 2014 kalinowska and grabowska 2016 however it is not well understood how these environmental factors affect the growth of algae and the production of the fishy odorants odor compounds produced by algae are released into water during algal growth and cell rupture rashash et al 1995 pohnert 2002 vidoudez and pohnert 2008 after released from the algal cells the fates of fishy odorants in water would be affected by some environmental processes such as volatilization biodegradation photolysis etc merlon et al 1991 biodegradation is the main process associated with geosmin loss in water chen et al 2010 hsieh et al 2010 li et al 2012 among the different environmental factors temperature is one of the most important in determining the behaviors of odorants as it not only affects the production but also the biodegradation and volatilization processes of the odor compounds in water merlon et al 1991 bartual and ortega 2013 understanding the fates of fishy odorants under different environmental conditions could provide insights into the occurrence of fishy odor problems in source waters however few studies have focused on this topic until now in this study two typical fishy odor producing chrysophyte species i e synura uvella and ochromonas sp were selected to investigate the effects of temperature and light intensity on algal growth and associated odorant production the loss of extracellular odorants caused by volatilization and biodegradation was further investigated under different temperatures this study will hopefully provide useful scientific understanding for the management of fishy odor problems in source waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the synura uvella fachb 2363 and ochromonas sp fachb 2364 strains were obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china stock cultures were maintained at 18 c and 35 μmol photons m 2 s 1 16 h 8 h

purchased from sigma aldrich usa and prepared with stock solutions of 100 mg l in methanol hplc grade 2 2 identification of fishy odorants algal cells at the late exponential phase were harvested for the identification of fishy odorants using gas chromatography olfactometry mass spectrometry gc o ms combined with comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tofms according to guo et al 2015 olfactometric peaks detected by gc o ms were coupled with the chromatographic peaks detected by gc gc tofms based on retention indices ris determined using the retention times of alkanes c7 c30 detailed procedures are provided in the supporting information 2 3 effects of temperature and light on algal growth and fishy odorant production all experiments were conducted in replicate in 250 ml sterile tissue culture flasks using dyiv medium for temperature experiments algal cultures were incubated at 8 16 and 24 c respectively under a light intensity of 41 μmol photons m 2 s 1 16 h 8 h light dark cycle for light experiments algal cultures were incubated under 10 41 and 185 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively at a temperature of 24 c algal cells were harvested every 4 5 d to count cell number and measure odorant concentrations algal growth was determined by counting cells using a sedgewick rafter chamber after fixing 1 ml of culture with 1 lugol s iodine solution for colonial species s uvella ultrasonic method was used to disperse algal cells before counting zhou et al 2012 lee et al 2012 preliminary tests were conducted to get the ultrasonic intensity and time conditions as follows sonicating the samples at 300 w for 10 s using branson sonifier 250 america with tapered microtip 1 800 total and dissolved odorant concentrations were determined during the experiments the total concentration of each odorant was obtained by analyzing the unfiltered samples and the dissolved one was obtained by analyzing the filtrated samples gf c whatman the four fishy odorants were quantified using a gc ms system connected to a headspace solid phase microextraction hs spme unit zhao et al 2013 the gc ms system consisted of an agilent 6980 gc with a db5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm and an agilent 5973 mass spectrometric detector agilent usa the spme fibers no 57334 u supelco usa were inserted into the vial headspace containing 12 5 ml of water sample for 30 min in a 65 c water bath with constant stirring of the vials by a teflon bar the fibers were then retracted and inserted instantly into the gc injector to desorb the odorants at 250 c for 2 min the gc temperature program was as follows 40 c initially for 2 min then programmed at 8 c min to 240 c and held for 2 min the detection limits of the odorants were determined as 10 2 24 3 ng l and the recoveries were 80 1 105 5 with relative standard deviations of 2 02 24 35 2 4 volatilization and biodegradation of released odorants for the volatilization experiments mixed solutions of the four odorants were prepared in methanol according to the concentrations detected in the algal culture which were added into tissue culture flasks with a final concentration of 2 0 8 0 μg l the flasks contained 200 ml dyiv medium and was capped with 0 22 μm filters square iwaki 3123 075 the final concentration for each odorant was set at 1 5 μg l to inhibit biodegradation activities 1 mg l of hgcl2 was added the flasks were incubated in a contherm digital series 1800cp incubator in the dark at 8 and 24 c during the experiment the flasks were manually shaken once a day forty ml samples were collected in duplicate at given time intervals and transferred to 40 ml brown glass bottles the bottles were capped tightly and stored at 4 c in darkness immediately samples were analyzed within 2 h chen et al 2010 for biodegradation assessment algal culture solutions were filtered through 1 2 μm gf c membranes to remove all algae but retain bacteria mixed odorant solution was added to the filtered medium to a final concentration at 1 5 μg l for each odorant spiked filtrate 15 ml was transferred to 40 ml amber glass tubes which were then capped and placed in the incubator at 8 and 24 c respectively without shaking control test conditions were set using sterile milli q pure water instead of the filtered culture duplicate tubes were collected randomly with hgcl2 final concentration 1 mg l added and then stored at 4 c in darkness before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of fishy odorants produced by synura uvella and ochromonas sp stock cultures of s uvella and ochromonas sp showed strong fishy odor 8 and 6 intensity level respectively using flavor profile analysis see supporting information at the late exponential phase and were collected to identify the fishy odorants both s uvella and ochromonas sp showed similar olfactometry profiles with 20 and 21 odor peaks identified respectively tables s2 and s3 among them five odor peaks were characterized as fishy cod liver oil fatty rancid descriptors cotsaris et al 1995 hartvigsen et al 2000 frank et al 2009 watson 2010 the odor peaks from gc o analysis were then matched to the chromatographic peaks from gc tofms analysis using ris four odor peaks were assigned to 2 4 heptadienal 2 octenal 2 4 octadienal and 2 4 decadienal ris of 1010 1019 1048 1053 1115 1118 and 1323 1331 respectively these compounds were characterized with similarity values above 700 and fishy odor descriptors they were then further confirmed with authentic standards tables s2 and s3 fig s1 at the same time the odor peak with a ri range of 1278 1283 was assigned to 2 4 7 dectridienal according to its ms spectra and odor characteristics though the authentic standard was not available previously these puas have been mostly detected in marine water dominated by diatoms wichard et al 2005 and a few freshwater samples dominated by chrysophytes rashash et al 1995 watson and satchwill 2003 they were therefore speculated as being the algal metabolites responsible for fishy odor events the current study is the first to confirm the production of these puas as fishy odorants by both s uvella and ochromonas sp identification of the odorants in drinking water is important for water industry to develop treatment strategies 3 2 effects of temperature and light intensity on algal growth the effects of temperature and light intensity on algal growth are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively both s uvella and ochromonas sp exhibited the highest growth rates at 24 c whereas cell densities at 8 c were extremely low previous study has also indicated higher growth rate of synura petersenii at 20 c than at 10 c rashash et al 1995 result of this study showed that s uvella and ochromonas sp could grow better at a relatively high temperature however it has been reported that some chrysophytes including s uvella and ochromonas sp tend to dominate in cold weather phillips and fawley 2002 kalinowska and grabowska 2016 in such cases temperature might exert an indirect effect on algae population growth siver 1995 it has been reported that low temperature can limit nutrient uptake and photosynthesis by autotrophic groups agbeti and smol 1995 while chrysophytes which exhibit mixotrophy and survive well at low temperature were able to outcompete these autotrophic groups agbeti and smol 1995 siver 1995 as shown in fig 2 relatively high cell densities were achieved for s uvella and ochromonas sp at light intensity as low as 10 μmol photons m 2 s 1 indicating that light intensity was not a limiting condition for these two species investigation showed that some chrysophytes including s uvella and ochromonas sp could dominate in the ice covered water heinze 2009 yu et al 2012 kalinowska and grabowska 2016 other chrysophyte species synura petersenii dinobryon sp and uroglena sp also exhibited similar biomass production under different light intensities rashash et al 1995 watson and satchwill 2003 prior studies have demonstrated that light limitation does not significantly affect the growth of mixotrophic chrysophytes as they can obtain energy through phagocytosis of bacteria to compensate for low light intensity conditions sanders et al 2001 kalinowska and grabowska 2016 in the current study however the growth of the two algal species was inhibited to some extent at 185 μmol photons m 2 s 1 3 3 effects of temperature and light intensity on odorant production in this investigation four compounds were quantified i e 2 4 heptadienal 2 octenal 2 4 octadienal and 2 4 decadienal the concentrations of the odorants increased with the increase in cell density reaching the highest values in the late exponential phase and then declining in the stationary phase figs s2 and s3 under the same temperature and light conditions the cell yields of 2 4 heptadienal and 2 4 decadienal were approximately 10 to 60 fold higher than those of 2 octenal and 2 4 octadienal figs s2 and s3 at the same time s uvella exhibited 2 to 4 fold higher odorant yields than ochromonas sp suggesting that s uvella exhibited greater odor producing potential fig 3 shows the total production and cell yields of the four odorants by the two strains at different temperatures similar to cell growth the total production of the four odorants sum total of all increased by 2 fold for s uvella and 1 6 fold for ochromonas sp with an increase in temperature from 8 to 24 c however the cell yields increased 4 9 fold for s uvella and 2 9 fold for ochromonas sp while the temperature decreased from 24 to 8 c fig 3 this result indicated that lower temperature could promote the cell yield of fishy odorants it may be that low temperature causes an up regulation in the expression of desaturase coding genes which stimulate membrane lipid desaturation leading to an increase in pufas watson et al 2001 morales sánchez et al 2017 ecologically membrane lipid desaturation was reported to enhance the resistance of algal cells to cold temperature stress as an adaptive response guschina and harwood 2006 high level of pufas could increase the fluidity and stability of cellular membrane subhash et al 2014 it is also possible that the exponential phase was prolonged at lower temperature due to overall lower physiological activity the extended growth stage contributes to a longer period of odor production as shown in fig 4 the total production and cell yield of the four odorants decreased by 6 fold and 3 7 fold for s uvella and by 3 1 and 2 1 fold for ochromonas sp respectively when the light intensity increased from 10 to 185 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this suggests that lower irradiance favored the production of fishy odorants by both strains this could explain why fishy odor episodes frequently occur during this period when light penetration into the water column is substantially reduced by ice and snow cover safi et al 2012 yu et al 2012 under low light conditions some mixotrophic chrysophytes depend more upon consuming bacteria than on photosynthesis for energy bird and kalff 1989 keller et al 1994 this bactivorous behavior may increase the lipid including pufas content in algal cells watson et al 2001 cutignano et al 2011 puas production was also related to chlorophyll a chl a which could act as a photosensitizer and accelerate the oxidation of pufas to puas saadoun et al 2001 lee and min 2010 under a low light condition the chl a cell yield of ochromonas sp was substantially increased resulting in higher puas production keller et al 1994 the results obtained from the temperature and light studies will be useful for the better understanding and prediction of fishy odor outbreaks 3 4 volatilization and biodegradation of released fishy odorants as shown in table 1 and table 2 the volatilization and biodegradation of the four odorants were fit with a pseudo first order model the volatilization half lives of these puas were 36 97 d at 8 c and 6 17 d at 24 c respectively table 1 for biodegradation the half lives were only 6 10 h at 8 c and 2 4 h at 24 c table 2 this suggests that biodegradation was an important process for the loss of odorants in the aquatic environment similar results have also been reported for the musty odorant geosmin which exhibits a much shorter biodegradation half life than volatilization half life li et al 2012 fishy odor events have been reported in winter even in ice covered water zhao et al 2013 li et al 2016 because low temperature would stimulate the production of puas as an adaptive response and decrease their biodegradation and volatilization rates leading to the accumulation of the dissolved odorants in water however it should also be noted that results in this study were obtained under laboratory conditions environmental conditions in natural waters are more complicated and include the influence of water flow wind speed ice cover and mixing it is important therefore to undertake further field investigations to better understand the fate of odor producing algae and fishy odorants 4 conclusions we investigated the effects of temperature and light on the growth of two chrysophyte algae in culture as well as the production of fishy odorants and their potential fate through volatilization and biodegradation the following conclusions were obtained 1 2 4 heptadienal 2 octenal 2 4 octadienal 2 4 decadienal and 2 4 7 dectridienal were identified as fishy odorants 2 while warm temperature favors the growth of fishy odor producing algae lower temperature and light intensity increased total production and cell yield of the odorants 3 biodegradation is an important process for odorants loss these results

indicating that light intensity was not a limiting condition for these two species investigation showed that some chrysophytes including s uvella and ochromonas sp could dominate in the ice covered water heinze 2009 yu et al 2012 kalinowska and grabowska 2016 other chrysophyte species synura petersenii dinobryon sp and uroglena sp also exhibited similar biomass production under different light intensities rashash et al 1995 watson and satchwill 2003 prior studies have demonstrated that light limitation does not significantly affect the growth of mixotrophic chrysophytes as they can obtain energy through phagocytosis of bacteria to compensate for low light intensity conditions sanders et al 2001 kalinowska and grabowska 2016 in the current study however the growth of the two algal species was inhibited to some extent at 185 μmol photons m 2 s 1 3 3 effects of temperature and light intensity on odorant production in this investigation four compounds were quantified i e 2 4 heptadienal 2 octenal 2 4 octadienal and 2 4 decadienal the concentrations of the odorants increased with the increase in cell density reaching the highest values in the late exponential phase and then declining in the stationary phase figs s2 and s3 under the same temperature and light conditions the cell yields of 2 4 heptadienal and 2 4 decadienal were approximately 10 to 60 fold higher than those of 2 octenal and 2 4 octadienal figs s2 and s3 at the same time s uvella exhibited 2 to 4 fold higher odorant yields than ochromonas sp suggesting that s uvella exhibited greater odor producing potential fig 3 shows the total production and cell yields of the four odorants by the two strains at different temperatures similar to cell growth the total production of the four odorants sum total of all increased by 2 fold for s uvella and 1 6 fold for ochromonas sp with an increase in temperature from 8 to 24 c however the cell yields increased 4 9 fold for s uvella and 2 9 fold for ochromonas sp while the temperature decreased from 24 to 8 c fig 3 this result indicated that lower temperature could promote the cell yield of fishy odorants it may be that low temperature causes an up regulation in the expression of desaturase coding genes which stimulate membrane lipid desaturation leading to an increase in pufas watson et al 2001 morales sánchez et al 2017 ecologically membrane lipid desaturation was reported to enhance the resistance of algal cells to cold temperature stress as an adaptive response guschina and harwood 2006 high level of pufas could increase the fluidity and stability of cellular membrane subhash et al 2014 it is also possible that the exponential phase was prolonged at lower temperature due to overall lower physiological activity the extended growth stage contributes to a longer period of odor production as shown in fig 4 the total production and cell yield of the four odorants decreased by 6 fold and 3 7 fold for s uvella and by 3 1 and 2 1 fold for ochromonas sp respectively when the light intensity increased from 10 to 185 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this suggests that lower irradiance favored the production of fishy odorants by both strains this could explain why fishy odor episodes frequently occur during this period when light penetration into the water column is substantially reduced by ice and snow cover safi et al 2012 yu et al 2012 under low light conditions some mixotrophic chrysophytes depend more upon consuming bacteria than on photosynthesis for energy bird and kalff 1989 keller et al 1994 this bactivorous behavior may increase the lipid including pufas content in algal cells watson et al 2001 cutignano et al 2011 puas production was also related to chlorophyll a chl a which could act as a photosensitizer and accelerate the oxidation of pufas to puas saadoun et al 2001 lee and min 2010 under a low light condition the chl a cell yield of ochromonas sp was substantially increased resulting in higher puas production keller et al 1994 the results obtained from the temperature and light studies will be useful for the better understanding and prediction of fishy odor outbreaks 3 4 volatilization and biodegradation of released fishy odorants as shown in table 1 and table 2 the volatilization and biodegradation of the four odorants were fit with a pseudo first order model the volatilization half lives of these puas were 36 97 d at 8 c and 6 17 d at 24 c respectively table 1 for biodegradation the half lives were only 6 10 h at 8 c and 2 4 h at 24 c table 2 this suggests that biodegradation was an important process for the loss of odorants in the aquatic environment similar results have also been reported for the musty odorant geosmin which exhibits a much shorter biodegradation half life than volatilization half life li et al 2012 fishy odor events have been reported in winter even in ice covered water zhao et al 2013 li et al 2016 because low temperature would stimulate the production of puas as an adaptive response and decrease their biodegradation and volatilization rates leading to the accumulation of the dissolved odorants in water however it should also be noted that results in this study were obtained under laboratory conditions environmental conditions in natural waters are more complicated and include the influence of water flow wind speed ice cover and mixing it is important therefore to undertake further field investigations to better understand the fate of odor producing algae and fishy odorants 4 conclusions we investigated the effects of temperature and light on the growth of two chrysophyte algae in culture as well as the production of fishy odorants and their potential fate through volatilization and biodegradation the following conclusions were obtained 1 2 4 heptadienal 2 octenal 2 4 octadienal 2 4 decadienal and 2 4 7 dectridienal were identified as fishy odorants 2 while warm temperature favors the growth of fishy odor producing algae lower temperature and light intensity increased total production and cell yield of the odorants 3 biodegradation is an important process for odorants loss these results

18876,much about assembly processes dictating bio cake microbiota remains uncertain leading to poor understanding of membrane biofouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs this work aimed to reveal the underlying mechanisms driving bio cake community during the biofouling process under different flux conditions on the basis of 16s rrna sequences the results showed that bacterial diversity decreased with increasing fouling additionally low flux bio cake 8 lmh communities harbored much lower diversity than high flux 16 lmh bio cake microbiomes ecological null model analyses and phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens revealed that environmental filtering deterministically governed low flux bio cake communities in contrast high flux bio cake communities were mainly shaped in a stochastic manner this is likely due to the higher stochastic deposition of bacterial taxa from bulk sludge because of the presence of a stronger drag force moreover by lowering the flux the interactions between bacterial lineages were enhanced this is evidenced by the greater number of links the higher average degree and the higher average clustering coefficients within the pmens in low flux bio cakes than those in high flux bio cakes most keystone fouling related taxa in low flux bio cakes were motile and involved in nitrate reduction and polysaccharide protein metabolism this corroborated the important role of environmental filtering in the assembly process dictating low flux bio cake formation some low abundance taxa were observed to be key fouling related bacteria under both flux conditions indicating that a few populations play paramount ecological roles in triggering biofouling in summary our findings clearly indicate distinct bio cake community assembly patterns under different operational conditions and highlight the importance of developing specialized strategies for fouling control in individual mbr systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor membrane fouling bio cake assembly keystone fouling associated taxa wastewater treatment 1 introduction owing to the formation of bio cakes membrane fouling is one of the biggest factors preventing the widespread application of membrane bioreactors mbrs in wastewater treatment huang et al 2010 judd and judd 2010 le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2017 in practice bio cakes can be considered unique biofilms differing from conventional microbial aggregates used in wastewater treatment facilities ishizaki et al 2016 jo et al 2016 due to limited access to necessary substrates within bio cakes some bacteria species have to either compete aggressively on substrates accessible to them or cooperate tightly through cross feedings this leads to complex biofilm communities beyond our current understanding thus thorough understanding of the dynamics of biofilm communities in mbr systems under different operational conditions is critical for research and industrial applications bio cake formation normally varies based on operating conditions substrate type and availability for biofilm growth and bacterial interaction bio cake communities are highly impacted by operation mode aeration transmembrane pressure tmp and flux chomiak et al 2015 huang et al 2008a kimura et al 2008 lu et al 2016a meng et al 2008 metzger et al 2007 ng and ng 2010 a study by jeong et al 2016 for instance showed increased abundance of fluviicola and flavobacterium along with tmp development the role of local substrates including type and concentration delille et al 2007 marsolek and rittmann 2016 in bio cake community formation have not been paid sufficient attention unlike operating parameters moreover the dynamic changes in bacterial interactions make biofouling far more complex than has been able to be understood lu et al 2016a therefore this merits further investigation despite considerable efforts having been dedicated to the study of bio cake communities huang et al 2008b jo et al 2016 lu et al 2016a matar et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 many open questions and knowledge gaps regarding ecological network and keystone fouling related taxa remain because of the heterogeneity of bulk sludge variability of wastewater compositions and instability of operating parameters in mbr plants it is difficult to determine how random disposal stochastic process and species sorting deterministic process contribute to biofilm formation matar et al 2017 identification of the roles of these two processes in bio cake community formation can greatly aid in developing a targeted strategy for fouling control during mbr operation statistical analyses such as the null model test can be applied to characterize niche based deterministic and stochastic processes dictating the assembly patterns of sludge related microbial communities ju et al 2014 ju and zhang 2015 ofiţeru et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 in addition ecological network analysis can characterize the interplay between co occurring species in microbial communities barberan et al 2012 deng et al 2012 2016 zhou et al 2011 enabling identification of the keystone populations crucial for maintaining microbiota structure deng et al 2012 using these methods we believe that bio cake community assembly patterns and the roles of keystone populations in biofouling development can be largely illuminated this work aimed to reveal necessity laws from the contingency phenomena in bio cake community the impacts of flux fouling status and environmental filters on keystone microbial populations were identified and explored in depth specifically based on an examination of three well controlled membrane modules we attempted to unravel the roles of determinism versus stochasticity in shaping bio cake communities moreover phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmen analyses were conducted to decipher the interaction patterns and ecological roles of co occurring taxa we were able to further explore the formation mechanisms of bio cakes in mbr systems and identify the determinants of bacterial assembly in bio cakes under different operational conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr operation the lab scale mbr reactor used in this work had an effective total volume of 24 l of which 50 was used for an anoxic tank and 50 was used for an aerobic tank fig s1 in the supplementary information the seed sludge used for the system startup was obtained from a local full scale wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china before the startup of this mbr the seed sludge was acclimated to a wastewater feed for 60 days synthetic wastewater table s1 was used as feed wastewater for the mbr three pristine flat sheet membrane modules 0 1 m2 0 1 μm pvdf sinap 10 sinap membrane s t co shanghai china were submerged in the aerobic tank these modules are hereinafter referred to as module 1 module 2 and module 3 continuous suction of the membrane modules without any relaxation was achieved by three peristaltic pumps to obtain a permeate the transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded at intervals of 10 min using the labview program national instruments austin tx usa when the tmp increased to ca 25 kpa a combination of physical washing and chemical cleaning immersion in 0 3 naocl solution for 12 h was applied to for permeability recovery details of the operating parameters are presented in table s2 the critical flux of the membrane was determined to be ca 16 l m2 h lmh to investigate the effects of the membrane flux on the evolution of bio cake compositions and bio cake microbiota assembly mechanisms modules 1 2 and 3 were operated at fluxes of 8 and 16 lmh the entire operation was divided into two periods based on the operating flux of the three modules in period i 1 91 d the membrane fluxes of modules 1 and 2 were 8 and 16 lmh respectively whereas module 3 was operated at 16 1 77 d and 8 lmh 78 91 d during this period the permeate of module 3 was recycled back to the reactor to maintain a constant hrt of 10 h in period ii 92 153 d the operating fluxes of all the three modules were maintained at 8 lmh and no permeate was recycled back to the reactor according to the turning point of fouling development tmp ca 10 kpa bio cake samples were collected at tmps of 5 10 and 25 kpa which represented initial moderate and severe fouling states respectively for low flux operation 8 lmh bio cake samples were only collected at low tmps 5 and 10 kpa because no tmp jump occurred during the experimental period ca 80 days 2 2 sample collection the sampling points of bio cake and bulk sludge are shown in fig 1 three biological replicates of bio cake and one bulk sludge sample were collected at each sampling point briefly when the tmp reached target values i e 5 10 and 25 kpa the fouled module was taken out and flushed with high pressure pure water to collect bio cake samples the sampling scheme used for the entire operation has been presented in table s2 six bulk sludge subsamples and triplicate subsamples of each bio cake sample were collected for dna extraction and molecular biological analysis 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing microbial dna was extracted from the 27 samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to manufacturer s protocols the final dna concentration and purity were determined using a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene were amplified

program 3 min of denaturation at 95 c 27 cycles of 30 s at 95 c annealing for 30 s at 55 c elongation for 45 s at 72 c and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the resulting pcr products were extracted using 2 agarose gel further purified using the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa and quantified using quantifluor st promega usa according to the manufacturer s protocols purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired end sequenced 2 300 on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa following the instructions by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession number srp150044 2 4 processing of sequencing data raw fastq files were demultiplexed quality filtered by trimmomatic and merged by flash with the following guidelines i the reads were truncated at any site receiving an average quality score 20 over a 50 bp sliding window ii reads containing more than 2 nucleotide mismatches or ambiguous bases were removed iii sequences with overlaps longer than 10 bp were merged according to their overlap sequence operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with 97 similarity cutoff using uparse version 7 1 http drive5 com uparse and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime additionally the number of sequences in the biomass samples was normalized to equal that in the sample with the lowest number of sequences i e 29172 the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed by the rdp classifier algorithm http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu123 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 2 5 network construction using the rmt based approach for comparison with the low flux bio cake bacterial network only samples at 5 and 10 kpa were used for high flux bio cake network construction in addition to reduce the network complexity only those otus present in all bio cake samples at each flux were selected for the network construction pair wise otu associations were calculated using the pearson correlation strong pearson s r 0 6 and significant p value 0 01 correlations were shown in the ecological networks the pmens of the bio cake community were constructed by using the random matrix theory rmt based approach according to previous studies deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 the pmens were constructed on a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena in brief the relative abundance of sequence numbers was used to obtain the correlation matrices which were then converted into similarity matrices subsequently an appropriate threshold value for defining the network structure st was determined using the rmt based network approach according to the st value an adjacency matrix encoding the connection strength between each pair of otus was obtained each network was separated into modules by fast greedy modularity optimization in addition for network comparison corresponding random networks of both pmens were generated using the maslov sneppen method maslov and sneppen 2002 and keeping the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewiring all of the edge positions in the pmens then a standard z test was applied to determine the significance between the pmens and their corresponding random networks the small world coefficient σ was calculated to investigate the small world property of the networks i e the degree of clustering and shortness of paths between nodes telesford et al 2011 gephi webatlas paris france was used for network visualization and modular analysis bastian et al 2009 2 6 statistical analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analyses nmds were conducted using vegan of r 3 3 1 based on the bray curtis distance to determine the differences in the bacterial community structure two nonparametric multivariate statistical tests i e a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices adonis and an analysis of similarity anosim were performed using the vegan package in the r statistical computing environment the null model test was conducted on the basis of the method proposed by chase et al 2011 which holds species richness at each time point alpha diversity and across all time points gamma diversity constant in this work the regional species pool gamma diversity was represented by the total number of otus detected in all samples the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp was adopted to examine the significance of the differences in microbial communities from null model expectations standard effect size ses derived from this null model analysis could describe the influence of deterministic processes on community dynamics and assemblages in addition according to the algorithm developed by zhou et al 2014 selection strength ss was used to quantify the role of deterministic i e niche based selection processes in structuring community composition briefly ss can be calculated as follows ss j obs j exp j obs j obs and j exp denote the observed jaccard s similarity and average null expected jaccard s similarity respectively 2 7 physico chemical analyses the concentrations of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrate total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 the ph and dissolved oxygen do of the bulk liquid in the reactor were monitored by a ph meter phs 3d precision scientific instrument corp shanghai china and a do meter oxi 3310 wtw germany respectively the bulk solutions of the bio cake were mixed well using magnetic stirrers and then filtered through 0 45 μm membranes the filtrate was used to analyze polysaccharides and proteins in the bio cake according to the dubois et al 1956 and lowry et al 1951 methods respectively furthermore the polysaccharides and proteins in the supernatant of the mbr were monitored regularly the differences in the effluent qualities from the three membranes operated under different fluxes were analyzed by a one way anova based on a tukey s test spss 19 0 chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 performance and fouling evolution of the membranes over the entire operation the average cod tn and tp removals were approximately 91 38 78 50 and 57 36 respectively as expected concentrations of nitrate in the permeate were found to be 13 00 lower than those in the supernatant table s3 this was attributed to the positive roles of the bio cakes in nutrient elimination hai et al 2011 lu et al 2016b further details on the mbr performance are presented in table s3 in addition effluent qualities from membranes at two different fluxes were not significantly different it was found that the applied flux governs the patterns of tmp development and good reproducibility was achieved i e model 2 and 3 in period i and model 1 2 and 3 in period ii during operation under high flux two stages of tmp development was found during the first 20 days the tmp increased gradually at the rate of 0 50 kpa day when membrane fouling occurred the rate of tmp increase rose dramatically to 2 16 kpa day which was 332 higher than that observed in stage i in contrast under low flux the tmp increased gradually at the rate of 0 11 kpa day as expected a more rapid rise in tmp was achieved in the high flux operation mode 16 lmh than that in the low flux operation 8 lmh fig 1 the amounts of polysaccharides and proteins embedded in the bio cake varied substantially as a function of the applied fluxes and tmp levels table s4 the polysaccharide contents of low flux bio cake were significantly higher than those of high flux bio cake at the same tmp level p 0 01 table s4 additionally the ratio of polysaccharides to proteins increased progressively with fouling development for both fluxes 3 2 phylogenetic dynamics of bio cake microbiota a total of 1 450 526 high quality filtered sequences for 27 grab biomass samples were achieved by illumina high throughput sequencing for comparison at the same sequencing depth normalization of the sequence number was performed by randomly extracting 29 172 sequences from each sample the top 30 genera detected in all biomass samples were screened and classified fig 2 a the genera detected in these samples were affiliated with proteobacteria average 36 32 fig s2 chloroflexi average 31 88 planctomycetes average 9 83 bacteroidetes average 9 77 actinobacteria average 2 83 nitrospirae average 2 55 and verrucomicrobia average 1 76 respectively in addition the dominant phyla and genera average abundance 1 0 in high flux bio cake microbiota were found to be similar in composition but vary in abundance as compared to those in low flux bio cake microbiomes tables s5 and s6 the good s coverages for all the tested samples were higher than 99 suggesting that the majority of bacterial diversity in each sample had been captured based on the assessment of diversity indices introduced by shannon and chao bio diversity indices were relatively higher in the high flux scenario as compared to the those in the low flux conditions regardless of the tmp on the membrane table s7 as the fouling developed i e as the tmp increased a consistent decrease in biodiversity was observed for both flux conditions fig 2b it should be noted that the biodiversity of the bulk sludge did not show significant trends but fluctuated within ca 20 during the entire study despite of reactor performance this observation indicated that the biodiversity of the bio cake on the membrane did not impact the biodiversity development in the bulk suspension but was more closely related to operational status of the mbr system to further describe the bacterial community dynamics of bulk sludge and the bio cake microbiome nmds based analysis on the bray curtis dissimilarity non phylogenetic index was conducted fig 2c bulk sludge microbiomes were distributed along the nmds axis1 values ranged from 0 15 to 0 15 while the nmds axis2 values were all below zero in contrast the non phylogenetic index of bio cake microbiome was scattered across all quadrants indicating distinct distribution patterns of bacterial diversity in these two types of microbial aggregates moreover the high flux bio cake microbiotas were clustered in the second and third quadrants whereas the ones under lower flux were mainly in the first and fourth quadrants showing a clear separation of bio cake communities under different fluxes this observation was consistent with the results reported by huang et al 2008a the tmp development i e fouling stages had significant impacts on biodiversity in the bio cake during the initial stage of fouling 5 kpa biodiversity on the membrane was significantly different to the that of the bulk sludge as the fouling developed a greater similarity was observed between the bio cake and the bulk sludge after tmp increased to 10 kpa gaps in biodiversity between bio cake and sludge microbiomes decreased indicating that bulk sludge played an increased role in determining high flux bio cake communities along with fouling development the phylogenetic relationship among the bio cake microbiota measured by the weighted unifrac distance fig s3 showed that the bio cake samples could be grouped into three distinct categories initial fouling layer under high flux operation bio cake at the moderate fouling stage 10 kpa and bio cake at the severe fouling stage 25 kpa under both high and low flux conditions there were distinct patterns in the beta diversity dynamics of the bio cake on membranes under different fluxes and fouling stages two complementary nonparametric analyses adonis and analysis of similarity also supported the above findings table s8 3 3 deterministic vs stochastic processes in guiding bio cake community assembly to explore the mechanisms of bio cake assembly patterns null model analysis of the beta diversity tests introduced by chase and myers 2011 were conducted as shown in table 1 the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp test suggested that the observed beta diversities centroid of actual communities were indistinguishable from the null expectations for the bulk sludge and bio cake microbiota at high flux operation p 0 05 these results indicated that these bacterial communities were mainly formed in a stochastic random manner in contrast the observed beta diversity was statistically different p 0 05 from null random expectations for the bio cake residing on low flux membranes which indicates that the bio community under low flux conditions assembled developed in a deterministic manner furthermore the observed jaccard s similarities of the low flux bio cake communities were significantly greater than the expected similarities for stochastically assembled communities table s7 according to principles of microbial ecology chase 2007 zhang et al 2016 we further found that abiotic environmental filtering where local abiotic environmental conditions select against certain species to form local communities rather than biotic interactions was the dominant process influencing the structuring of low flux bio cake microbiomes ses which has been employed to describe the deterministic effect was higher for the low flux biofilm relative to the bulk sludge and high flux biofilm table s9 except the bio cake at 10 kpa according to the calculated ss fig 3 table s9 which is an indicator of the niche based selection process the stochastic processes i e 1 ss could contribute an average of 71 00 of the community dynamics in the bulk sludge in comparison the roles of the deterministic process dictated the succession of the bio cake microbiomes at low flux ranging from 51 59 to 53 43 leading to stochastic processes ranging from 46 57 to 48 40 conversely the stochastic processes were dominant in shaping the structure of the bio cake on high flux membranes ranging from 70 81 to 79 45 it was also found that the relative importance of determinism in mediating the succession of bio cake communities increased with the increment of tmp for both flux conditions 3 4 network topology features of bio cake communities two rmt based network graphs were constructed to reveal the ecological interplays of co occurring species in bio cake microbiomes under the two fluxes fig 4 a and b in the two networks we obtained 352 nodes and 918 edges 61 22 positive and 38 78 negative for the bio cake at high flux and 221 nodes and 2068 edges 56 04 positive and 43 96 negative for the bio cake at low flux the topological parameters such as the clustering coefficients harmonic geodesic distance and modularity were significantly higher than the corresponding random networks moreover the small world coefficients σ of both networks were higher than 1 strongly suggesting that the pmens in bio cake microbiomes possessed small world and modular structures wu et al 2016 zhou et al 2010 in comparison with that in high flux bio cakes the pmen in low flux bio cakes harbored significantly higher connectivity higher clustering coefficient and shorter geodesic distances table 2 indicating that the bacterial structure was more complex and network interactions were much more intense with a low flux operation in addition the low flux bio cake network possessed a substantially lower modularity and a higher average degree in comparison to the high flux bio cake table 2 the mantel test showed that both negative and positive correlations within the first and last bins were not correlated with phylogenetic relatedness in both pmens fig s4 the results suggested that phylogenetic relatedness played a negligible role in interactive relationships between bacterial taxa in bio cake 3 5 keystone taxa in bio cake community assembly two parameters within module connectivity zi and connectivity among modules pi were used to decipher topological roles of bacterial otus in the two networks the z p plot of these two networks fig 4c and d shows that the majority of the nodes in both networks were peripherals with most of their edges within their modules ecologically peripherals represent specialists while module hubs and connectors represent generalists and network hubs are indicators of supergeneralists olesen et al 2007 about 6 3 of otus were generalists in low flux bio cake where all the members are connectors in contrast 2 3 of otus were generalists in high flux bio cake including 0 6 module hubs and 1 7 connectors table s10 however no supergeneralists were identified in either of the networks from an ecological perspective the generalists observed in the networks can be considered keystone taxa that drive the biofouling processes of these keystone populations 5 and 11 bacterial taxa were exclusive to the bio cake under high flux and low flux conditions respectively table s11 additionally these networks shared three keystone taxa i e g dechloromonas f rhodocyclaceae and f caldilineaceae quorum sensing related taxa such as g legionella and g pseudomonas as keystone fouling causing members were also observed in both bio cake networks in very low abundances average 0 01 0 93 implying that some low abundant bacteria played significant roles in driving the bio cake community structure furthermore stronger taxa environment relationships were observed in low flux pmens than in high flux pmens as revealed by the pearson test fig 5 interestingly nitrates and polysaccharides showed significantly positive correlations with most keystone fouling related taxa indicating that these two environmental factors are the most relevant environmental filters cod and protein concentrations were also positively correlated with relative abundances of some keystone populations further suggesting that the role of biopolymers in bio cake community development is fairly important moreover bacterial interactions within both networks were predominantly positive low flux bio cake 60 3 positive interaction high flux bio cake 57 1 positive interaction signifying the occurrence of prevalent mutualism or commensalism fig 4a and b faust and raes 2012 4 discussion to date studies on the microbial ecology of bio cake communities have mainly been focused on the diversity composition and structure of bacterial communities jo et al 2016 lu et al 2016b therefore little is known about how bio cake microbiota assemble from the source community here in an mbr operated at two distinct fluxes we assessed patterns of bacterial community compositions in bio cakes and assembly processes that determine these patterns 4 1 mechanically regulated bio cake community assembly it is known that permeate drag force and aeration stress are key drivers of bio cake community assembly the permeate drag can propel the species toward the membrane surface and aeration can enhance the bio cake dispersal from membranes in this study different drag forces associated with various fluxes led to distinct bio cake community assembly processes in low flux conditions the bio cake community was deterministically shaped to a certain extent due to the effect of the environmental filter which refers to abiotic environmental conditions e g substrate types and concentrations this is unlike formation in high flux conditions besemer et al and wilhelm et al pointed out that biofilm communities in streams are deterministically shaped by local environmental conditions rather than being shaped by stochastic dispersal from the source community besemer et al 2012 wilhelm et al 2013 in contrast high drag force unselectively drives species from the bulk sludge for bio cake formation our results are consistent with those of a recent study focusing on natural ecosystems which demonstrated that the hydrodynamic conditions in a fluvial river could shape biofilm community assembly by mediating either the deterministic or stochastic processes li et al 2015 biofouling can increase determinism in bio cake community assemblies this is likely attributable to the increasing biotic interactions between initial and subsequent colonizers likewise deterministic processes played an increasingly important role in stream biofilm community assembly with biofilm development veach et al 2016 4 2 substrate regulated bio cake community assembly previous studies have mostly attributed the fouling role of biopolymers such as polysaccharides to clogging or gel layer formation rosenberger et al 2006 yoshida et al 2015 few studies focus on the interaction between biopolymers degradation or synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances eps and bacteria three keystone taxa shared by the two networks in our study i e g dechloromonas f rhodocyclaceae and f caldilineaceae are facultative anaerobic bacteria coates et al 2001 doherty et al 2015 forget et al 2010 and can better adapt to oxygen limited microenvironments in a cake layer some members of f rhodocyclaceae and g dechloromonas could potentially contribute to nitrate reduction and recalcitrant organic compound degradation coates et al 2001 mcilroy et al 2015 oren 2014 the findings of previous studies also show that nitrogen concentration in the permeate is lower than that in the reactor supernatant hai et al 2011 lu et al 2016b meng et al 2013 these substantially corroborate the presence of denitrifiers in biofilms attached to membrane surfaces a very recent study used the metagenomics approach to further reveal that the genetic composition of the bacteria involved in nitrate reduction are prevalent in bio cake microbiota rehman et al 2019 additionally several members of the hydrophilic f caldilineaceae play foulant microbe fixing roles in membranes choi et al 2017 xu et al 2018 thus facilitating biofilm formation in mbrs among the unique keystone fouling related lineages observed in low flux bio cakes most bacterial populations were motile and involved in biomacromolecule metabolism such as proteins and polysaccharides degradation table s9 in contrast keystone taxa in high flux bio cakes were less motile and harbored less potential for protein and polysaccharide utilization the eps on membranes create the local environment i e nutrients or carbon sources for the bio cake taxa ng and ng 2010 for example they trigger the process of colonization and biofilm development on membranes huang et al 2008a the motile bacteria in bio cakes get access to substrates more easily than other bacteria some of the bacteria in bio cakes must or will attempt to utilize the eps released by the deposited bacteria or the cell debris of dead bacteria this ultimately leads to a different bacterial community assembly than that from activated sludge ju and zhang 2015 in summary our results suggest that biopolymers may be playing a more important role in membrane fouling than previously appreciated 4 3 ecologically mediated bio cake community assembly the increased determinism in bio cake community assemblies during biofouling development is associated with biotic interactions between initial and subsequent colonizers as demonstrated in this work co occurring species in bio cakes developed under low flux conditions displayed a more clustered distribution than those in bio cakes formed under high flux conditions this proves the higher relative importance of deterministic processes in the former type of ecological network additionally the higher network modularity at high flux than that at low flux indicates a greater extent of niche differentiation which is suggestive of weaker interactions among microbial populations faust and raes 2012 generally direct e g biological interactions or indirect e g shared ecological niches microbial interplay represents a deterministic rather than stochastic process barberan et al 2012 all the above findings confirmed that deterministic processes played an important role in the species species association within low flux bio cakes further supporting the mechanism for bio cake community assembly bacterial assembly in activated sludge was found to be deterministically shaped by taxonomic relatedness in the study by ju et al 2014 in this work we found that phylogenetic similarity played a negligible role on the ecological networks within bio cake bacterial communities reconfirming that distinct assembly mechanisms exist between bio cakes and their source communities the dominantly positive interactions between the keystone taxa and their neighbors in bio cake communities are associated with the occurrence of pervasive mutualism or commensalism i metabolic cooperation where one species utilizes a metabolite produced by a neighboring species for instance the protein hydrolyzers saprospiraceae cross feed on proteins excreted by comamonadaceae members otu2929 vs otu1851 in module 1 ii some bacteria can help other species survive by improving the local environment the aerobic heterotrophs pirellula consume oxygen providing local anaerobic conditions for facultative anaerobic caldilineaceae otu825 vs otu1855 in module 0 in addition the occurrence of quorum sensing related bacteria in the ecological networks under both fluxes suggests the contribution of bacterial communication to bio cake community assembly similar to previous findings on other ecosystems deng et al 2016 jousset et al 2017 philippot et al 2013 the results of this study indicate that all keystone fouling related species possessed very low abundance 4 4 implications and research needs in reality wastewater compositions include organic matter nutrients and indigenous flora and wastewater temperatures can largely impact bio cake assembly thus our mbr reactor was operated in well controlled conditions i e it was run at room temperature and fed with synthetic wastewater in order to reveal the assembly process clearly we found that bio cake community assembly was co regulated by mechanical forces environmental filters such as substrate type and concentration and biological interactions under low flux conditions bio cake formation and development were mainly dependent on surrounding substrates and less impacted by stochastic force in contrast high flux bio cake communities were significantly regulated by drag force resulting in the unselective attachment of species from the bulk sludge as a consequence keystone fouling related taxa under low flux conditions could be inherently predicted whereas the prediction of high flux bio cake community compositions was more challenging other operational conditions e g srt temperature that were found to impact microbial community assembly by mediating deterministic or stochastic processes ju et al 2017 lin et al 2017 could also influence bio cake community assembly the combined approach i e null model test and pmen proposed in this work offers a convenient means to explore other operational parameters driving bio cake community assembly and deconstructs keystone fouling causing populations in general it will aid plant operators obtain an in depth understanding of fouling ecology and develop specialized fouling control strategies for various mbr systems low abundance bacteria were found to play central roles in bio cake formation independent of flux conditions ecologically these low abundance species are of high importance to maintaining the structures and functions of the bio cake community fouling control should be focused on eliminating some low abundance fouling bacteria rather than the high abundance dominant bacteria present in bio cake microbiota the less abundant sub communities were likely controlled by stochastic factors lynch and neufeld 2015 magurran and henderson 2003 as such the relationship between the driving forces determinism vs stochasticity and abundant rare sub community assembly merits further investigation in addition because of the heterogeneity of bio cake communities the entire membrane module had to be taken out and flushed with water for a given sampling point this led to a relatively small sampling size e g a total of 9 samplings 27 sequencing analyses in our work intensive sampling or in depth analysis would aid in capturing some overlooked species jiang et al 2018 e g the identification of bacteria capable of quorum sensing kampouris et al 2018 the optimization of the sampling process or the designing of specific experimental devices is recommended for the achievement of a better resolution view of microbial communities 5 conclusion the main conclusions of this work are as follows 1 microbial diversity decreased with biofouling development and low flux bio cake communities harbored significantly lower diversities than high flux bio cake microbiomes 2 deterministic processes were found to dominate low flux bio cake community assembly whereas high flux bio cake communities were mainly shaped by stochastic processes in addition increased determinism was observed in the succession of bio cake communities independent of flux conditions 3 low flux bio cake networks possessed substantially lower modularity and higher average degree than the high flux networks highlighting that niche based deterministic processes played more important roles in the species species association within low flux bio cake communities 4 species environment relationships were stronger in the case of keystone fouling related taxa within low flux bio cake ecological networks than within high flux networks in addition these keystone fouling species were present in low abundance regardless of flux condition highlighting the need to eliminate these rare species rather than the abundant taxa for efficient fouling control conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of

18876,much about assembly processes dictating bio cake microbiota remains uncertain leading to poor understanding of membrane biofouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs this work aimed to reveal the underlying mechanisms driving bio cake community during the biofouling process under different flux conditions on the basis of 16s rrna sequences the results showed that bacterial diversity decreased with increasing fouling additionally low flux bio cake 8 lmh communities harbored much lower diversity than high flux 16 lmh bio cake microbiomes ecological null model analyses and phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens revealed that environmental filtering deterministically governed low flux bio cake communities in contrast high flux bio cake communities were mainly shaped in a stochastic manner this is likely due to the higher stochastic deposition of bacterial taxa from bulk sludge because of the presence of a stronger drag force moreover by lowering the flux the interactions between bacterial lineages were enhanced this is evidenced by the greater number of links the higher average degree and the higher average clustering coefficients within the pmens in low flux bio cakes than those in high flux bio cakes most keystone fouling related taxa in low flux bio cakes were motile and involved in nitrate reduction and polysaccharide protein metabolism this corroborated the important role of environmental filtering in the assembly process dictating low flux bio cake formation some low abundance taxa were observed to be key fouling related bacteria under both flux conditions indicating that a few populations play paramount ecological roles in triggering biofouling in summary our findings clearly indicate distinct bio cake community assembly patterns under different operational conditions and highlight the importance of developing specialized strategies for fouling control in individual mbr systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor membrane fouling bio cake assembly keystone fouling associated taxa wastewater treatment 1 introduction owing to the formation of bio cakes membrane fouling is one of the biggest factors preventing the widespread application of membrane bioreactors mbrs in wastewater treatment huang et al 2010 judd and judd 2010 le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2017 in practice bio cakes can be considered unique biofilms differing from conventional microbial aggregates used in wastewater treatment facilities ishizaki et al 2016 jo et al 2016 due to limited access to necessary substrates within bio cakes some bacteria species have to either compete aggressively on substrates accessible to them or cooperate tightly through cross feedings this leads to complex biofilm communities beyond our current understanding thus thorough understanding of the dynamics of biofilm communities in mbr systems under different operational conditions is critical for research and industrial applications bio cake formation normally varies based on operating conditions substrate type and availability for biofilm growth and bacterial interaction bio cake communities are highly impacted by operation mode aeration transmembrane pressure tmp and flux chomiak et al 2015 huang et al 2008a kimura et al 2008 lu et al 2016a meng et al 2008 metzger et al 2007 ng and ng 2010 a study by jeong et al 2016 for instance showed increased abundance of fluviicola and flavobacterium along with tmp development the role of local substrates including type and concentration delille et al 2007 marsolek and rittmann 2016 in bio cake community formation have not been paid sufficient attention unlike operating parameters moreover the dynamic changes in bacterial interactions make biofouling far more complex than has been able to be understood lu et al 2016a therefore this merits further investigation despite considerable efforts having been dedicated to the study of bio cake communities huang et al 2008b jo et al 2016 lu et al 2016a matar et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 many open questions and knowledge gaps regarding ecological network and keystone fouling related taxa remain because of the heterogeneity of bulk sludge variability of wastewater compositions and instability of operating parameters in mbr plants it is difficult to determine how random disposal stochastic process and species sorting deterministic process contribute to biofilm formation matar et al 2017 identification of the roles of these two processes in bio cake community formation can greatly aid in developing a targeted strategy for fouling control during mbr operation statistical analyses such as the null model test can be applied to characterize niche based deterministic and stochastic processes dictating the assembly patterns of sludge related microbial communities ju et al 2014 ju and zhang 2015 ofiţeru et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 in addition ecological network analysis can characterize the interplay between co occurring species in microbial communities barberan et al 2012 deng et al 2012 2016 zhou et al 2011 enabling identification of the keystone populations crucial for maintaining microbiota structure deng et al 2012 using these methods we believe that bio cake community assembly patterns and the roles of keystone populations in biofouling development can be largely illuminated this work aimed to reveal necessity laws from the contingency phenomena in bio cake community the impacts of flux fouling status and environmental filters on keystone microbial populations were identified and explored in depth specifically based on an examination of three well controlled membrane modules we attempted to unravel the roles of determinism versus stochasticity in shaping bio cake communities moreover phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmen analyses were conducted to decipher the interaction patterns and ecological roles of co occurring taxa we were able to further explore the formation mechanisms of bio cakes in mbr systems and identify the determinants of bacterial assembly in bio cakes under different operational conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr operation the lab scale mbr reactor used in this work had an effective total volume of 24 l of which 50 was used for an anoxic tank and 50 was used for an aerobic tank fig s1 in the supplementary information the seed sludge used for the system startup was obtained from a local full scale wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china before the startup of this mbr the seed sludge was acclimated to a wastewater feed for 60 days synthetic wastewater table s1 was used as feed wastewater for the mbr three pristine flat sheet membrane modules 0 1 m2 0 1 μm pvdf sinap 10 sinap membrane s t co shanghai china were submerged in the aerobic tank these modules are hereinafter referred to as module 1 module 2 and module 3 continuous suction of the membrane modules without any relaxation was achieved by three peristaltic pumps to obtain a permeate the transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded at intervals of 10 min using the labview program national instruments austin tx usa when the tmp increased to ca 25 kpa a combination of physical washing and chemical cleaning immersion in 0 3 naocl solution for 12 h was applied to for permeability recovery details of the operating parameters are presented in table s2 the critical flux of the membrane was determined to be ca 16 l m2 h lmh to investigate the effects of the membrane flux on the evolution of bio cake compositions and bio cake microbiota assembly mechanisms modules 1 2 and 3 were operated at fluxes of 8 and 16 lmh the entire operation was divided into two periods based on the operating flux of the three modules in period i 1 91 d the membrane fluxes of modules 1 and 2 were 8 and 16 lmh respectively whereas module 3 was operated at 16 1 77 d and 8 lmh 78 91 d during this period the permeate of module 3 was recycled back to the reactor to maintain a constant hrt of 10 h in period ii 92 153 d the operating fluxes of all the three modules were maintained at 8 lmh and no permeate was recycled back to the reactor according to the turning point of fouling development tmp ca 10 kpa bio cake samples were collected at tmps of 5 10 and 25 kpa which represented initial moderate and severe fouling states respectively for low flux operation 8 lmh bio cake samples were only collected at low tmps 5 and 10 kpa because no tmp jump occurred during the experimental period ca 80 days 2 2 sample collection the sampling points of bio cake and bulk sludge are shown in fig 1 three biological replicates of bio cake and one bulk sludge sample were collected at each sampling point briefly when the tmp reached target values i e 5 10 and 25 kpa the fouled module was taken out and flushed with high pressure pure water to collect bio cake samples the sampling scheme used for the entire operation has been presented in table s2 six bulk sludge subsamples and triplicate subsamples of each bio cake sample were collected for dna extraction and molecular biological analysis 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing microbial dna was

extracted using 2 agarose gel further purified using the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa and quantified using quantifluor st promega usa according to the manufacturer s protocols purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired end sequenced 2 300 on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa following the instructions by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession number srp150044 2 4 processing of sequencing data raw fastq files were demultiplexed quality filtered by trimmomatic and merged by flash with the following guidelines i the reads were truncated at any site receiving an average quality score 20 over a 50 bp sliding window ii reads containing more than 2 nucleotide mismatches or ambiguous bases were removed iii sequences with overlaps longer than 10 bp were merged according to their overlap sequence operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with 97 similarity cutoff using uparse version 7 1 http drive5 com uparse and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime additionally the number of sequences in the biomass samples was normalized to equal that in the sample with the lowest number of sequences i e 29172 the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed by the rdp classifier algorithm http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu123 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 2 5 network construction using the rmt based approach for comparison with the low flux bio cake bacterial network only samples at 5 and 10 kpa were used for high flux bio cake network construction in addition to reduce the network complexity only those otus present in all bio cake samples at each flux were selected for the network construction pair wise otu associations were calculated using the pearson correlation strong pearson s r 0 6 and significant p value 0 01 correlations were shown in the ecological networks the pmens of the bio cake community were constructed by using the random matrix theory rmt based approach according to previous studies deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 the pmens were constructed on a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena in brief the relative abundance of sequence numbers was used to obtain the correlation matrices which were then converted into similarity matrices subsequently an appropriate threshold value for defining the network structure st was determined using the rmt based network approach according to the st value an adjacency matrix encoding the connection strength between each pair of otus was obtained each network was separated into modules by fast greedy modularity optimization in addition for network comparison corresponding random networks of both pmens were generated using the maslov sneppen method maslov and sneppen 2002 and keeping the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewiring all of the edge positions in the pmens then a standard z test was applied to determine the significance between the pmens and their corresponding random networks the small world coefficient σ was calculated to investigate the small world property of the networks i e the degree of clustering and shortness of paths between nodes telesford et al 2011 gephi webatlas paris france was used for network visualization and modular analysis bastian et al 2009 2 6 statistical analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analyses nmds were conducted using vegan of r 3 3 1 based on the bray curtis distance to determine the differences in the bacterial community structure two nonparametric multivariate statistical tests i e a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices adonis and an analysis of similarity anosim were performed using the vegan package in the r statistical computing environment the null model test was conducted on the basis of the method proposed by chase et al 2011 which holds species richness at each time point alpha diversity and across all time points gamma diversity constant in this work the regional species pool gamma diversity was represented by the total number of otus detected in all samples the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp was adopted to examine the significance of the differences in microbial communities from null model expectations standard effect size ses derived from this null model analysis could describe the influence of deterministic processes on community dynamics and assemblages in addition according to the algorithm developed by zhou et al 2014 selection strength ss was used to quantify the role of deterministic i e niche based selection processes in structuring community composition briefly ss can be calculated as follows ss j obs j exp j obs j obs and j exp denote the observed jaccard s similarity and average null expected jaccard s similarity respectively 2 7 physico chemical analyses the concentrations of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrate total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 the ph and dissolved oxygen do of the bulk liquid in the reactor were monitored by a ph meter phs 3d precision scientific instrument corp shanghai china and a do meter oxi 3310 wtw germany respectively the bulk solutions of the bio cake were mixed well using magnetic stirrers and then filtered through 0 45 μm membranes the filtrate was used to analyze polysaccharides and proteins in the bio cake according to the dubois et al 1956 and lowry et al 1951 methods respectively furthermore the polysaccharides and proteins in the supernatant of the mbr were monitored regularly the differences in the effluent qualities from the three membranes operated under different fluxes were analyzed by a one way anova based on a tukey s test spss 19 0 chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 performance and fouling evolution of the membranes over the entire operation the average cod tn and tp removals were approximately 91 38 78 50 and 57 36 respectively as expected concentrations of nitrate in the permeate were found to be 13 00 lower than those in the supernatant table s3 this was attributed to the positive roles of the bio cakes in nutrient elimination hai et al 2011 lu et al 2016b further details on the mbr performance are presented in table s3 in addition effluent qualities from membranes at two different fluxes were not significantly different it was found that the applied flux governs the patterns of tmp development and good reproducibility was achieved i e model 2 and 3 in period i and model 1 2 and 3 in period ii during operation under high flux two stages of tmp development was found during the first 20 days the tmp increased gradually at the rate of 0 50 kpa day when membrane fouling occurred the rate of tmp increase rose dramatically to 2 16 kpa day which was 332 higher than that observed in stage i in contrast under low flux the tmp increased gradually at the rate of 0 11 kpa day as expected a more rapid rise in tmp was achieved in the high flux operation mode 16 lmh than that in the low flux operation 8 lmh fig 1 the amounts of polysaccharides and proteins embedded in the bio cake varied substantially as a function of the applied fluxes and tmp levels table s4 the polysaccharide contents of low flux bio cake were significantly higher than those of high flux bio cake at the same tmp level p 0 01 table s4 additionally the ratio of polysaccharides to proteins increased progressively with fouling development for both fluxes 3 2 phylogenetic dynamics of bio cake microbiota a total of 1 450 526 high quality filtered sequences for 27 grab biomass samples were achieved by illumina high throughput sequencing for comparison at the same sequencing depth normalization of the sequence number was performed by randomly extracting 29 172 sequences from each sample the top 30 genera detected in all biomass samples were screened and classified fig 2 a the genera detected in these samples were affiliated with proteobacteria average 36 32 fig s2 chloroflexi average 31 88 planctomycetes average 9 83 bacteroidetes average 9 77 actinobacteria average 2 83 nitrospirae average 2 55 and verrucomicrobia average 1 76 respectively in addition the dominant phyla and genera average abundance 1 0 in high flux bio cake microbiota were found to be similar in composition but vary in abundance as compared to those in low flux bio cake microbiomes tables s5 and s6 the good s coverages for all the tested samples were higher than 99 suggesting that the majority of bacterial diversity in each sample had been captured based on the assessment of diversity indices introduced by shannon and chao bio diversity indices were relatively higher in the high flux scenario as compared to the those in the low flux conditions regardless of the tmp on the membrane table s7 as the fouling developed i e as the tmp increased a consistent decrease in biodiversity was observed for both flux conditions fig 2b it should be noted that the biodiversity of the bulk sludge did not show significant trends but fluctuated within ca 20 during the entire study despite of reactor performance this observation indicated that the biodiversity of the bio cake on the membrane did not impact the biodiversity development in the bulk suspension but was more closely related to operational status of the mbr system to further describe the bacterial community dynamics of bulk sludge and the bio cake microbiome nmds based analysis on the bray curtis dissimilarity non phylogenetic index was conducted fig 2c bulk sludge microbiomes were distributed along the nmds axis1 values ranged from 0 15 to 0 15 while the nmds axis2 values were all below zero in contrast the non phylogenetic index of bio cake microbiome was scattered across all quadrants indicating distinct distribution patterns of bacterial diversity in these two types of microbial aggregates moreover the high flux bio cake microbiotas were clustered in the second and third quadrants whereas the ones under lower flux were mainly in the first and fourth quadrants showing a clear separation of bio cake communities under different fluxes this observation was consistent with the results reported by huang et al 2008a the tmp development i e fouling stages had significant impacts on biodiversity in the bio cake during the initial stage of fouling 5 kpa biodiversity on the membrane was significantly different to the that of the bulk sludge as the fouling developed a greater similarity was observed between the bio cake and the bulk sludge after tmp increased to 10 kpa gaps in biodiversity between bio cake and sludge microbiomes decreased indicating that bulk sludge played an increased role in determining high flux bio cake communities along with fouling development the phylogenetic relationship among the bio cake microbiota measured by the weighted unifrac distance fig s3 showed that the bio cake samples could be grouped into three distinct categories initial fouling layer under high flux operation bio cake at the moderate fouling stage 10 kpa and bio cake at the severe fouling stage 25 kpa under both high and low flux conditions there were distinct patterns in the beta diversity dynamics of the bio cake on membranes under different fluxes and fouling stages two complementary nonparametric analyses adonis and analysis of similarity also supported the above findings table s8 3 3 deterministic vs stochastic processes in guiding bio cake community assembly to explore the mechanisms of bio cake assembly patterns null model analysis of the beta diversity tests introduced by chase and myers 2011 were conducted as shown in table 1 the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp test suggested that the observed beta diversities centroid of actual communities were indistinguishable from the null expectations for the bulk sludge and bio cake microbiota at high flux operation p 0 05 these results indicated that these bacterial communities were mainly formed in a stochastic random manner in contrast the observed beta diversity was statistically different p 0 05 from null random expectations for the bio cake residing on low flux membranes which indicates that the bio community under low flux conditions assembled developed in a deterministic manner furthermore the observed jaccard s similarities of the low flux bio cake communities were significantly greater than the expected similarities for stochastically assembled communities table s7 according to principles of microbial ecology chase 2007 zhang et al 2016 we further found that abiotic environmental filtering where local abiotic environmental conditions select against certain species to form local communities rather than biotic interactions was the dominant process influencing the structuring of low flux bio cake microbiomes ses which has been employed to describe the deterministic effect was higher for the low flux biofilm relative to the bulk sludge and high flux biofilm table s9 except the bio cake at 10 kpa according to the calculated ss fig 3 table s9 which is an indicator of the niche based selection process the stochastic processes i e 1 ss could contribute an average of 71 00 of the community dynamics in the bulk sludge in comparison the roles of the deterministic process dictated the succession of the bio cake microbiomes at low flux ranging from 51 59 to 53 43 leading to stochastic processes ranging from 46 57 to 48 40 conversely the stochastic processes were dominant in shaping the structure of the bio cake on high flux membranes ranging from 70 81 to 79 45 it was also found that the relative importance of determinism in mediating the succession of bio cake communities increased with the increment of tmp for both flux conditions 3 4 network topology features of bio cake communities two rmt based network graphs were constructed to reveal the ecological interplays of co occurring species in bio cake microbiomes under the two fluxes fig 4 a and b in the two networks we obtained 352 nodes and 918 edges 61 22 positive and 38 78 negative for the bio cake at high flux and 221 nodes and 2068 edges 56 04 positive and 43 96 negative for the bio cake at low flux the topological parameters such as the clustering coefficients harmonic geodesic distance and modularity were significantly higher than the corresponding random networks moreover the small world coefficients σ of both networks were higher than 1 strongly suggesting that the pmens in bio cake microbiomes possessed small world and modular structures wu et al 2016 zhou et al 2010 in comparison with that in high flux bio cakes the pmen in low flux bio cakes harbored significantly higher connectivity higher clustering coefficient and shorter geodesic distances table 2 indicating that the bacterial structure was more complex and network interactions were much more intense with a low flux operation in addition the low flux bio cake network possessed a substantially lower modularity and a higher average degree in comparison to the high flux bio cake table 2 the mantel test showed that both negative and positive correlations within the first and last bins were not correlated with phylogenetic relatedness in both pmens fig s4 the results suggested that phylogenetic relatedness played a negligible role in interactive relationships between bacterial taxa in bio cake 3 5 keystone taxa in bio cake community assembly two parameters within module connectivity zi and connectivity among modules pi were used to decipher topological roles of bacterial otus in the two networks the z p plot of these two networks fig 4c and d shows that the majority of the nodes in both networks were peripherals with most of their edges within their modules ecologically peripherals represent specialists while module hubs and connectors represent generalists and network hubs are indicators of supergeneralists olesen et al 2007 about 6 3 of otus were generalists in low flux bio cake where all the members are connectors in contrast 2 3 of otus were generalists in high flux bio cake including 0 6 module hubs and 1 7 connectors table s10 however no supergeneralists were identified in either of the networks from an ecological perspective the generalists observed in the networks can be considered keystone taxa that drive the biofouling processes of these keystone populations 5 and 11 bacterial taxa were exclusive to the bio cake under high flux and low flux conditions respectively table s11 additionally these networks shared three keystone taxa i e g dechloromonas f rhodocyclaceae and f caldilineaceae quorum sensing related taxa such as g legionella and g pseudomonas as keystone fouling causing members were also observed in both bio cake networks in very low abundances average 0 01 0 93 implying that some low abundant bacteria played significant roles in driving the bio cake community structure furthermore stronger taxa environment relationships were observed in low flux pmens than in high flux pmens as revealed by the pearson test fig 5 interestingly nitrates and polysaccharides showed significantly positive correlations with most keystone fouling related taxa indicating that these two environmental factors are the most relevant environmental filters cod and protein concentrations were also positively correlated with relative abundances of some keystone populations further suggesting that the role of biopolymers in bio cake community development is fairly important moreover bacterial interactions within both networks were predominantly positive low flux bio cake 60 3 positive interaction high flux bio cake 57 1 positive interaction signifying the occurrence of prevalent mutualism or commensalism fig 4a and b faust and raes 2012 4 discussion to date studies on the microbial ecology of bio cake communities have mainly been focused on the diversity composition and structure of bacterial communities jo et al 2016 lu et al 2016b therefore little is known about how bio cake microbiota assemble from the source community here in an mbr operated at two distinct fluxes we assessed patterns of bacterial community compositions in bio cakes and assembly processes that determine these patterns 4 1 mechanically regulated bio cake community assembly it is known that permeate drag force and aeration stress are key drivers of bio cake community assembly the permeate drag can propel the species toward the membrane surface and aeration can enhance the bio cake dispersal from membranes in this study different drag forces associated with various fluxes led to distinct bio cake community assembly processes in low flux conditions the bio cake community was deterministically shaped to a certain extent due to the effect of the environmental filter which refers to abiotic environmental conditions e g substrate types and concentrations this is unlike formation in high flux conditions besemer et al and wilhelm et al pointed out that biofilm communities in streams are deterministically shaped by local environmental conditions rather than being shaped by stochastic dispersal from the source community besemer et al 2012 wilhelm et al 2013 in contrast high drag force unselectively drives species from the bulk sludge for bio cake formation our results are consistent with those of a recent study focusing on natural ecosystems which demonstrated that the hydrodynamic conditions in a fluvial river could shape biofilm community assembly by mediating either the deterministic or stochastic processes li et al 2015 biofouling can increase determinism in bio cake community assemblies this is likely attributable to the increasing biotic interactions between initial and subsequent colonizers likewise deterministic processes played an increasingly important role in stream biofilm community assembly with biofilm development veach et al 2016 4 2 substrate regulated bio cake community assembly previous studies have mostly attributed the fouling role of biopolymers such as polysaccharides to clogging or gel layer formation rosenberger et al 2006 yoshida et al 2015 few studies focus on the interaction between biopolymers degradation or synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances eps and bacteria three keystone taxa shared by the two networks in our study i e g dechloromonas f rhodocyclaceae and f caldilineaceae are facultative anaerobic bacteria coates et al 2001 doherty et al 2015 forget et al 2010 and can better adapt to oxygen limited microenvironments in a cake layer some members of f rhodocyclaceae and g dechloromonas could potentially contribute to nitrate reduction and recalcitrant organic compound degradation coates et al 2001 mcilroy et al 2015 oren 2014 the findings of previous studies also show that nitrogen concentration in the permeate is lower than that in the reactor supernatant hai et al 2011 lu et al 2016b meng et al 2013 these substantially corroborate the presence of denitrifiers in biofilms attached to membrane surfaces a very recent study used the metagenomics approach to further reveal that the genetic composition of the bacteria involved in nitrate reduction are prevalent in bio cake microbiota rehman et al 2019 additionally several members of the hydrophilic f caldilineaceae play foulant microbe fixing roles in membranes choi et al 2017 xu et al 2018 thus facilitating biofilm formation in mbrs among the unique keystone fouling related lineages observed in low flux bio cakes most bacterial populations were motile and involved in biomacromolecule metabolism such as proteins and polysaccharides degradation table s9 in contrast keystone taxa in high flux bio cakes were less motile and harbored less potential for protein and polysaccharide utilization the eps on membranes create the local environment i e nutrients or carbon sources for the bio cake taxa ng and ng 2010 for example they trigger the process of colonization and biofilm development on membranes huang et al 2008a the motile bacteria in bio cakes get access to substrates more easily than other bacteria some of the bacteria in bio cakes must or will attempt to utilize the eps released by the deposited bacteria or the cell debris of dead bacteria this ultimately leads to a different bacterial community assembly than that from activated sludge ju and zhang 2015 in summary our results suggest that biopolymers may be playing a more important role in membrane fouling than previously appreciated 4 3 ecologically mediated bio cake community assembly the increased determinism in bio cake community assemblies during biofouling development is associated with biotic interactions between initial and subsequent colonizers as demonstrated in this work co occurring species in bio cakes developed under low flux conditions displayed a more clustered distribution than those in bio cakes formed under high flux conditions this proves the higher relative importance of deterministic processes in the former type of ecological network additionally the higher network modularity at high flux than that at low flux indicates a greater extent of niche differentiation which is suggestive of weaker interactions among microbial populations faust and raes 2012 generally direct e g biological interactions or indirect e g shared ecological niches microbial interplay represents a deterministic rather than stochastic process barberan et al 2012 all the above findings confirmed that deterministic processes played an important role in the species species association within low flux bio cakes further supporting the mechanism for bio cake community assembly bacterial assembly in activated sludge was found to be deterministically shaped by taxonomic relatedness in the study by ju et al 2014 in this work we found that phylogenetic similarity played a negligible role on the ecological networks within bio cake bacterial communities reconfirming that distinct assembly mechanisms exist between bio cakes and their source communities the dominantly positive interactions between the keystone taxa and their neighbors in bio cake communities are associated with the occurrence of pervasive mutualism or commensalism i metabolic cooperation where one species utilizes a metabolite produced by a neighboring species for instance the protein hydrolyzers saprospiraceae cross feed on proteins excreted by comamonadaceae members otu2929 vs otu1851 in module 1 ii some bacteria can help other species survive by improving the local environment the aerobic heterotrophs pirellula consume oxygen providing local anaerobic conditions for facultative anaerobic caldilineaceae otu825 vs otu1855 in module 0 in addition the occurrence of quorum sensing related bacteria in the ecological networks under both fluxes suggests the contribution of bacterial communication to bio cake community assembly similar to previous findings on other ecosystems deng et al 2016 jousset et al 2017 philippot et al 2013 the results of this study indicate that all keystone fouling related species possessed very low abundance 4 4 implications and research needs in reality wastewater compositions include organic matter nutrients and indigenous flora and wastewater temperatures can largely impact bio cake assembly thus our mbr reactor was operated in well controlled conditions i e it was run at room temperature and fed with synthetic wastewater in order to reveal the assembly process clearly we found that bio cake community assembly was co regulated by mechanical forces environmental filters such as substrate type and concentration and biological interactions under low flux conditions bio cake formation and development were mainly dependent on surrounding substrates and less impacted by stochastic force in contrast high flux bio cake communities were significantly regulated by drag force resulting in the unselective attachment of species from the bulk sludge as a consequence keystone fouling related taxa under low flux conditions could be inherently predicted whereas the prediction of high flux bio cake community compositions was more challenging other operational conditions e g srt temperature that were found to impact microbial community assembly by mediating deterministic or stochastic processes ju et al 2017 lin et al 2017 could also influence bio cake community assembly the combined approach i e null model test and pmen proposed in this work offers a convenient means to explore other operational parameters driving bio cake community assembly and deconstructs keystone fouling causing populations in general it will aid plant operators obtain an in depth understanding of fouling ecology and develop specialized fouling control strategies for various mbr systems low abundance bacteria were found to play central roles in bio cake formation independent of flux conditions ecologically these low abundance species are of high importance to maintaining the structures and functions of the bio cake community fouling control should be focused on eliminating some low abundance fouling bacteria rather than the high abundance dominant bacteria present in bio cake microbiota the less abundant sub communities were likely controlled by stochastic factors lynch and neufeld 2015 magurran and henderson 2003 as such the relationship between the driving forces determinism vs stochasticity and abundant rare sub community assembly merits further investigation in addition because of the heterogeneity of bio cake communities the entire membrane module had to be taken out and flushed with water for a given sampling point this led to a relatively small sampling size e g a total of 9 samplings 27 sequencing analyses in our work intensive sampling or in depth analysis would aid in capturing some overlooked species jiang et al 2018 e g the identification of bacteria capable of quorum sensing kampouris et al 2018 the optimization of the sampling process or the designing of specific experimental devices is recommended for the achievement of a better resolution view of microbial communities 5 conclusion the main conclusions of this work are as follows 1 microbial diversity decreased with biofouling development and low flux bio cake communities harbored significantly lower diversities than high flux bio cake microbiomes 2 deterministic processes were found to dominate low flux bio cake community assembly whereas high flux bio cake communities were mainly shaped by stochastic processes in addition increased determinism was observed in the succession of bio cake communities independent of flux conditions 3 low flux bio cake networks possessed substantially lower modularity and higher average degree than the high flux networks highlighting that niche based deterministic processes played more important roles in the species species association within low flux bio cake communities 4 species environment relationships were stronger in the case of keystone fouling related taxa within low flux bio cake ecological networks than within high flux networks in addition these keystone fouling species were present in low abundance regardless of flux condition highlighting the need to eliminate these rare species rather than the abundant taxa for efficient fouling control conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of

18877,to elucidate the effects of uv disinfection on antibiotic resistance in biologically treated wastewater we investigated the antibiotic resistance profiles species of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args in antibiotic resistant bacteria before and after treatment uv disinfection greatly changed the bacterial community structure and the antibiotic resistance in wastewater the antibiotic resistance in wastewater samples was strongly associated with the bacterial community the proportions of gram positive bacteria gradually increased with increasing uv fluence the proportions of bacteria resistant to cephalexin penicillin and vancomycin all greatly decreased after uv treatment in both sampling events july 2018 and january 2019 and those for bacteria resistant to ofloxacin ciprofloxacin and sulfadiazine increased resulting from the alternative antibiotic resistance profiles among different genera uv disinfection induced the selection of multi antibiotic resistant mar bacteria for example the mar indices of aeromonas the dominant genus during the treatments were significantly increased after uv irradiation p 0 05 the mar index was also markedly increased p 0 05 at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 in both events in uv10 treatment the bacterial community structure was greatly changed the genera with relatively low mar indices replaced that with high mar indices and became the dominant genera as a result the mar indices of treated samples showed a decreased trend after 10 mj cm2 uv irradiation the detection frequencies of args located on the chromosome varied mainly due to the evolution of the microbial community the occurrence of args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx and sul1 located on plasmid dna decreased after uv disinfection and the average detection frequencies of tet and sul genes decreased by 15 and 6 respectively p 0 05 generally speaking the effect of uv disinfection on the enrichment of antibiotic resistance is limited in this study and horizontal gene transfer via the plasmids in surviving bacteria might be impaired due to the decreased abundance of args on the plasmids graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv disinfection antibiotic resistance microbial community multi antibiotic resistance index plasmid dna 1 introduction for decades antibiotics have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of diseases in humans and animals as well as for livestock breeding levy and marshall 2004 li et al 2018a it was estimated that in 2013 53800 tons of antibiotics were discharged into the environment in china zhang et al 2015a antibiotics in the environment have promoted the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args leading to an increase in antibiotic resistant pathogens zhu et al 2013 berendonk et al 2015 the spread of infection causing arb is considered to be a major threat to human health by the world health organization who 2014 due to the high bacterial densities abundant nutrients and selective pressures induced by pollutant compounds including antibiotics biocides pharmaceuticals and heavy metals municipal wastewater provides suitable conditions for arb reproduction and args horizontal gene transfer zhang et al 2012 rizzo et al 2013a manaia et al 2016 besides human commensal and environmentally relevant microbiota are encountered in wastewater treatment plants facilitating the sharing of args among them and even introducing new resistance mechanisms to pathogenic microorganisms glady croue et al 2018 however these treatment plants are neither particularly designed to eliminate arb nor even to remove args and various arb are still present in biologically treated wastewater pruden et al 2013 to reduce the risk to human health and ensure ecological security advanced treatments are needed to further eliminate the arb and args present in secondary effluent uv disinfection is considered to be a promising approach to achieve these goals since compared to chlorination it does not produce toxic by products hong et al 2018 furthermore uv c light penetrates the cell walls of bacteria and is directly absorbed by nucleic acids resulting in the inactivation of arb and damage to args via the formation of dimers of adjacent cytosines or thymines mckinney and pruden 2012 al jassim et al 2017 the maximum absorption of uv by nucleic acids occurs at a wavelength of 254 nm chang et al 2017 guo et al 2013a found that uv disinfection effectively removed erythromycin and tetracycline resistant bacteria but the latter were more resistant to uv irradiation than the former at low uv irradiation fluences and the proportion of tetracycline resistant bacteria was nearly double that before uv disinfection distinct responses of bacteria resistant to different antibiotics under uv irradiation were also have been reported by meckes and guo et al meckes 1982 guo et al 2013b they all attributed it to the microbial selectivity of uv treatment on arb however how uv disinfection affects the selection of arb remained unclear huang et al 2016 investigated uv inactivation in 16 tetracycline resistant isolates and found that isolates from different genera had diverse responses to uv irradiation and even isolates from the same genus also had different responses zhang et al 2017 revealed that multi antibiotic resistant mar escherichia coli was more resistant to uv irradiation than antibiotic sensitive e coli at low uv fluences however several studies reported no statistically significant difference between the removal efficiency of antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive e coli templeton et al 2009 guo et al 2012 huang et al 2013 on the whole few studies have comprehensively investigated the effects of uv disinfection on bacterial community structure and antibiotic resistance in wastewater also the underlying relationships between bacterial community shifts and changes in antibiotic resistance have been little discussed previous studies have investigated the changes in args abundance before and after uv disinfection using the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction q pcr sousa et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 but this technique does not represent the distribution of args in viable bacteria because dissociated args and args in dead cells are all counted antibiotic resistance can be disseminated through vertical transfer i e by cell division and horizontal gene transfer including conjugation transduction and natural transformation dodd 2012 and among the three mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer conjugation based on viable donor and recipient cells is presumed to have more of a role than the others lerminiaux and cameron 2018 indicating the importance of investigating the presence of args in surviving bacteria of uv irradiation it has already been reported that the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria are significantly changed after uv disinfection cockerill et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013b however the alterations of args in surviving bacteria during uv disinfection have received less attention it was reported that the stability of functional genes on genome and plasmid was different and some plasmids were easy to be lost when the cost to the host of carrying the plasmid outweighs the benefit of the plasmid borne accessory genes turner et al 1998 bergstrom et al 2000 considering the potential distinct effects of uv irradiation on the args located on genomic and plasmid dna and the crucial role of plasmids in the dissemination of args kottara et al 2018 studies on args at different locations need to be conducted in order to have better security assessment of uv disinfected effluent to the best of our knowledge this work is the first study of the variations in args separately on the chromosome and plasmid in arb before and after uv irradiation the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the uv inactivation efficiency and effects of uv irradiation on the phenotypes of cultivable isolates resistant to ten antibiotics tetracycline sulfadiazine cephalexin penicillin erythromycin vancomycin gentamicin chloramphenicol ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin which almost cover all classes of antibiotics that are widely used in human disease prevention and livestock and poultry breeding zhang et al 2015a bacteria resistant to these antibiotics have received more and more attentions in recent years zhang et al 2015a b yang et al 2017 moreover args conferring resistance to these antibiotics were detected at high concentrations in different matrixes zhu et al 2013 lin et al 2016 2 explore the underlying relationships between bacterial community shifts and antibiotic resistance changes in wastewater and 3 study the effects of uv treatment on args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx sul1 and sul2 located in different locations chromosome or plasmid in surviving arb 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the wastewater samples used in this study were taken from the effluent of the biological process in a municipal wastewater treatment plant using a cyclic activated sludge system a variant of sequencing batch reactor sbr in zhuozhou hebei province china after collection in two sterile 1 l polyethylene containers the samples were immediately stored on ice and transported to the lab the experiments were conducted within 5 h after sampling in order to get a reliable result samples were collected on two occasions july 2018 and january 2019 the initial total cultivable heterotrophic bacteria were 2 0 105 2 8 105 cfu ml in july event and 1 4 103 1 5 103 cfu ml in january event 2 2 disinfection experiments a laboratory scale device was designed and built based on the descriptions of mckinney and pruden 2012 and bolton and linden 2003 briefly the apparatus mainly consisted of four low pressure mercury lamps emitting nearly monochromatic light at a wavelength of 254 nm and a collimated beam tube fig s1 the lamps were preheated for at least 20 min before experiments in order to achieve a constant uv fluence rate 0 50 mw cm2 which was measured by a radiometer with a uv254 detector uv photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university china the irradiation experiments were performed at room temperature 25 2 c in the dark and the fluences were set by controlling the exposure times in china fluences of 20 and 80 mj cm2 are usually used for wastewater discharge and reclamation respectively hu et al 2016 thus we exposed the samples to collimated uv light for 0 10 15 20 40 100 and 160 s to obtain the corresponding irradiation fluences of 0 5 7 5 10 20 50 and 80 mj cm2 these treatments were named as rw uv5 uv7 5 uv10 uv20 uv50 and uv80 respectively in the disinfection procedure a 90 mm petri dish with a 40 ml wastewater sample was placed under the center of the collimated tube and then gently stirred throughout the irradiation experiment for each treatment the procedure was replicated three times 2 3 enumeration isolation and identification of bacteria to determine the removal levels of heterotrophic bacteria under different uv fluences the samples were serially diluted in saline solution 0 85 and then 0 1 ml of the dilutions were plated on luria bertani agar solarbio china in triplicate according to the plate counting results cultivable bacteria were not detectable in uv50 for uv7 5 uv10 and uv20 more repeats were plated to obtain enough isolates in order to assess the variations in the cultivable heterotrophic bacterial community and antibiotic resistant phenotypes under uv irradiation strains from each sample were randomly selected from the plates and further purified using the plate streak method han et al 2018 genomic dna was extracted from the purified isolates for identification the 16s rrna genes were amplified using the universal bacterial primers 27f 5 agagtttgattctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 ggttaccttgttacgactt 3 the pcr was executed following the procedure initial denaturation at 94 c for 5 min then 35 cycles at 94 c for 1 min 57 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 c for 7 min the pcr products were sent to sangon biotech shanghai china for dna sequencing the sequences assembled were analyzed by comparison with sequences in genbank database using the blast alignment search tool http www ncbi nlm nih gov blast the species of the isolate was determined as the species with the highest score in the blast results zhang et al 2015b 2 4 antibiotic susceptibility test to determine the antibiotic resistance profiles of the purified isolates antibiotic susceptibility tests were carried out according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines 2010 a total of ten antibiotics were tested tetracycline tc 16 μg ml sulfadiazine sd 512 μg ml cephalexin cep 16 μg ml penicillin pen 16 μg ml erythromycin ery 8 μg ml vancomycin van 32 μg ml gentamicin gen 16 μg ml chloramphenicol cap 32 μg ml ofloxacin ofx 8 μg ml and ciprofloxacin cip 32 μg ml the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations of these antibiotics recommended by clsi were used in this study staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and e coli atcc 25922 served as negative controls an inoculum prepared with a specific concentration was inoculated on mueller hinton agar solarbio china plate and then incubated at 35 c for 16 20 h an isolate was regarded as resistant to one antibiotic if clear colonies were observed on a plate with this antibiotic and no s aureus atcc 29213 or e coli atcc 25922 colonies were observed on the same plate at the same time all the experiments were conducted at least twice the antibiotic resistance frequency was determined as 1 d e t e c t i o n f r e q u e n c y a b 100 where a is the number of isolates resistant to antibiotics and b is the number of isolates from the sample zhang et al 2015b the mar index was applied to estimate the potential resistance of bacteria to multiple antibiotics it was calculated as follows 2 m a r index a b c where a is the aggregate resistance score of all isolates in one sample if one isolate was observed resisting to one antibiotic it will get one point if not it will get zero point b is the number of antibiotics tested and c is the number of isolates in the sample zhang et al 2015b 2 5 detection of args in arb the presence of 7 args located on genomic dna and plasmid dna was detected in tc resistant bacteria and sd resistant bacteria genomic dna was extracted from isolated arb using a tianamp bacterial dna kit tiangen china plasmid dna was also extracted from these arb using an omega plasmid mini kit omega bio tek usa the primers of the args were listed in table s1 the pcr reaction mixture comprised 10 μl of 2 taq supermaster mix dye plus tiangen china 1 μl of template dna genomic dna or plasmid dna 0 2 μl of each 10 μm primer personalbio china and 8 6 μl of ddh2o the pcr procedure was initial denaturation at 94 c for 5 min then 35 cycles at 94 c for 1 min annealing for 30s temperature in table s1 72 c for 30s and a final extension step at 72 c for 7 min each amplification product was loaded on a 1 0 horizontal agarose gel containing 10000 gelred vazyme china the gel was run in 50 tae buffer for 30 min under 120 v and then visualized under uv transillumination biorad ca triplicate pcr assays were conducted for each sample and ddh2o replacing primers served as negative control 2 6 data analyses every isolated strain was regarded as a sample and significant differences between mar index and prevalence of args in treatments were determined using a two sided z test p 0 05 statistical analysis was performed using spss 19 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of arb in the wastewater rw we detected high frequencies of bacteria resistant to the ten antibiotics in biologically treated wastewater collected on two occasions july 2018 and january 2019 similar resistance profiles were observed for both dates however the strains isolated from the july event exhibited more resistance than those isolated from the january event fig 1 among them bacteria resistant to cep were the most prevalent species with a proportion of 73 fig 1 their prevalence might be due to the extensive use of cep in the clinical treatment of infections 2670 tons were consumed in china in 2013 and over 95 was used for humans zhang et al 2015a sd pen and van resistant bacteria were also major arb in rw at frequencies 60 fig 1 van resistant bacteria have also been found at a high frequency in surface water zhang et al 2016 the average percentage of tc resistant bacteria was 36 a value quite similar to the results from studies of wastewater treatment plants and surface water zhang et al 2015b 2016 but significantly higher than that found in one treatment plant in italy in which heterotrophic bacteria resistant to tc were only 3 7 turolla et al 2018 although gen 13 and cap resistant bacteria 11 had the lowest proportions in our study fig 1 they were still markedly higher than those in another study guo et al 2013b akinbowale et al 2006 tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 104 bacteria isolated from different parts of australia and found that resistance to cep ery and tc was widespread while resistance to cap and gen was less common this is quite similar to our results all strains were susceptible to cip in akinbowale s study while the resistance frequency was 24 in our work it may be mainly due to the high concentration of quinolones in the environment in china guo et al 2013b 3 2 the evolution of antibiotic resistance under uv irradiation the resistance rates of the isolates to the ten antibiotics varied following an increase of irradiation fluence as a whole the proportions of tc cap sd ery ofx cip and gen resistant bacteria increased after uv treatment while those for cep pen and van resistant bacteria decreased in july event fig 2 a the proportions of tc cap ery and gen resistant bacteria decreased after uv treatment in january event fig 2b guo et al 2013 reported that the ratios of cultivable bacteria resistant to tc sd van and cap became higher after uv treatment while the percentages of cep ery gen and cip resistant bacteria decreased the differences were resulted from the variations of bacterial community in wastewater samples collected in different occasions and studies fig 3 the antibiotic resistance frequencies to most of antibiotics increased at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 fig 2 and the mar indices of most genera also showed an upward trend after the uv irradiation table 1 it was mainly due to the fact that most of the mar bacteria survived uv irradiation for example the mar indices of aeromonas the dominant bacterium in rw and uv5 were markedly increased after 5 mj cm2 uv irradiation p 0 05 aeromonas strains resistant to 5 antibiotics accounted for 90 in uv5 but only 76 in rw table s2 three aeromonas strains were resistant to all 10 antibiotics but none of them were detected in rw table s2 furthermore the proportion of pathogenic species e g a caviae and a hydrophila was significantly higher than that in rw table s3 zhang et al 2017 also found that mar e coli was more resistant to uv than antibiotic sensitive e coli and the discrepancy in inactivation efficiency was more distinct at low uv fluences 20 mj cm2 al jassim et al 2017 investigated the responses of two e coli strains to solar irradiation and found that the virulent and antibiotic resistant e coli pi 7 displayed a prolonged persistence compared with e coli dsm1103 a nonvirulent and less antibiotic resistant strain for more functional genes associated with protective and repair mechanisms were upregulated to participate in confronting the sequelae of solar irradiation in e coli pi 7 it was reported that the capsular material could slow down the changes in membrane characteristics and contribute high uv resistance rusin and gerba 2001 and arb produce more capsular material than antibiotic sensitive strains during uv irradiation another reason for the increase in resistance frequencies may be related to the increased tolerance to antibiotics after uv irradiation zhang et al 2017 reported that the tolerance of originally antibiotic sensitive e coli to some antibiotics was significantly enhanced after uv irradiation leading to changes in the antibiotic resistance profiles of the surviving strains however it was found that mar bacteria single antibiotic resistant and antibiotic susceptible ones all showed similar inactivation profiles during solar photo fenton disinfection giannakis et al 2018a bacteria possessing resistance to antibiotics do not seem to have an enhanced resistance towards solar photo fenton treatment it was demonstrated that the solar photo fenton disinfection is mainly an intracellular advanced oxidation process in which fe2 and h2o2 were transported into bacterial cell and caused irreversible damage to the cell giannakis et al 2018b that might be the reason of a better performance of solar photo fenton in args removal compared with uv h2o2 ferro et al 2017 although some mar bacteria were more resistant to uv than less antibiotic resistant strains from the same species or genera the discrepancies among bacteria from different genera or phyla appeared to play a more decisive role in protection against uv irradiation similar trends of bacterial communities were observed under uv irradiation in both events fig 3 and s2 in general the abundance of gram negative bacteria decreased gradually and the proportion of gram positive bacteria increased with increasing fluence it can be attributed to the differences in cell wall structure between gram negative and gram positive organisms the latter have a thick peptidoglycan layer which can absorb more uv impairing its penetration mckinney and pruden 2012 furthermore the four peptide side chain in the peptidoglycan layer of gram positive organisms is more complex and the chemical bonds are more difficult to be attacked than those of gram negative bacteria li et al 2011 however it was reported that the bacterial structure did not significantly affect the inactivation efficacy of solar photo fenton disinfection giannakis et al 2018a and similar result was also observed during electrochemical disinfection shang et al 2013 it was also reported that the difference in inactivating mrsa and p aeruginosa was greatly reduced by the combined tio2 uv and h2o2 uv treatments compared with uv treatment guo et al 2017 it might be due to the strong oxidant e g oh produced in these processes which could cause almost non selective inactivation li et al 2011 the bacterial community was greatly changed in uv 7 5 fig 3 and s2 the antibiotic resistance of wastewater was also greatly affected by the alteration of bacterial populations in july event the dominant bacteria in uv7 5 had lower resistance frequencies to these antibiotics than that in other treatments table 2 especially the resistant frequencies of these bacteria to tc and cap were extremely low and acidovorax were absolutely susceptible to tc and cap table 2 as a result the abundance of bacteria resistant to most antibiotics was reduced in uv7 5 fig 2a nevertheless the percentages of bacteria resistant to ofx ery gen and cip increased compared to that in rw fig 2a this was attributed to the relatively high resistance frequencies of dominant genera to these antibiotics table 2 for example aeromonas accounted for 36 of total bacteria in rw and contributed 25 resistance to ofx however stenotrophomonas only accounted for 16 in uv7 5 but contributed 31 resistance to ofx in the january event enterococcus became the dominant genus in uv7 5 and the resistant frequencies to all antibiotics except pen and van were relatively high leading to high resistant frequencies to most antibiotics in uv7 5 fig 2b and table 2 for uv10 in the july event the dominant genera comamonas enterococcus and microbacterium had relatively high resistance to gen and cap table 2 so the resistance frequencies to these antibiotics greatly increased fig 2a but their resistance frequencies to cep pen and van were relatively low except for enterococcus and microbacterium to cep contributing a decline of resistance frequencies to these antibiotics in uv10 table 2 the proportions of bacteria in phylum actinobacteria and firmicutes were greatly increased after 10 mj cm2 uv irradiation in the january event while the resistance frequencies of most genera in these two phylum such as bacillus were very low as a result the resistance frequencies to most antibiotics were reduced in uv10 fig 2b besides over 50 flavobacterium and 40 deinococcus bacterial strains isolated from uv20 were pigment producing bacteria in the july and january event respectively fig s2 it might be due to the absorption of uv by the pigment preventing damage to sensitive components such as dna the pigment also might act as an antioxidant scavenging the reactive oxygen species generated by uv irradiation so as to protect dna and prevent the lipid peroxidation of the membrane moeller et al 2005 all isolates of flavobacterium in uv20 became uncultivable during second plate streaking however one isolate of flavobacterium in rw was always active during the experiment so we hypothesized that some functions relating to cell reproduction in flavobacterium were damaged by uv irradiation but this did not emerge immediately and the reason needs to be further investigated in the future so the traditional cultivable based method may underestimate the uv inactivation efficiency due to the inability to cultivate flavobacterium isolates in uv20 were not included in antibiotic resistance studies the mar indices of samples in both events all significantly increased after 5 mj cm2 uv irradiation p 0 05 from 0 44 to 0 51 in july event and from 0 39 to 0 46 in january event however the mar indices decreased with the further increase of uv irradiations and the mar index of uv10 was even lower than that of rw in january event this was also consistent with the alteration of mar bacteria the percentage of mar bacteria increased in uv5 especially for those resistant to at least 9 drugs fig 4 however the percentage of isolates resistant to 6 antibiotics declined with increases in fluence fig 4 this was mainly due to the great changes in the bacterial community at high fluences as shown in fig s2 and table 2 bacillus enterococcus comamonas and trichococcus with relatively low mar indices replaced aeromonas and escherichia with high mar indices and became the dominant genera in uv10 in both events it should be noted that although the antibiotic resistances of samples were not enriched or even impaired the mar indices of bacteria still increased after uv irradiation comparing with the counterparts in rw table 1 thus the abundant presence of the robust arb in receiving water will further promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through vertical transfer and horizontal gene transfer some previous studies have revealed that the levels of antibiotic resistance significantly increased in receiving water causing great threat to the ecosystem pruden et al 2012 lorenzo et al 2018 furthermore antibiotic resistant infections are usually more serious last longer and are more likely to lead death than susceptible infections when the treated wastewater was reused for agricultural irrigation farmers could be directly exposed to these microbial contaminants e g pathogenic arb through occupational contact and public consumers could also be indirectly exposed through consumption of food product that was contaminated by arb leading to a higher probability of antibiotic resistant infections al jassim et al 2015 3 3 variation of args during uv irradiation treatments the changing patterns of bacterial populations and antibiotic resistance of wastewater samples under uv irradiation were similar in both sampling events as a result the sd and tc resistant bacteria survived uv irradiation in the july event were selected to study the variation of args the presence of 7 args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx sul1 and sul2 were detected among the corresponding arb in order to explore the potentially different changes of genomic and plasmid args under uv irradiation args at these two locations were separately assessed the seven args were all present in both genomic and plasmid dna among the five tet genes teta was detected at a markedly higher frequency on plasmid than that on genomic dna and tetm had the highest abundance in both genomic and plasmid dna fig 5 our results are consistent with previous research which indicated that tetm was the dominant tetracycline resistance gene in most cases liu et al 2014 chen et al 2015 li et al 2018b the reason for its prevalence may be that the tetm gene has the widest host range of any tet gene being found in 42 genera chen et al 2015 and tetm is closely associated with conjugative transposons roberts 2005 which contributes to the dissemination of tetm among microorganisms the two sul genes were more likely to be located on plasmids than the chromosome in this work the total detection frequency genome plasmid of sul2 113 was higher than that of sul1 102 and the frequency of sul2 on the plasmid was greater than that of sul1 fig 5 in consistent with previous studies gao et al 2012 liu et al 2014 the sul1 gene was typically associated with class 1 integrons while sul2 was generally detected on small non conjugative or large transmissible multi resistant plasmids which would facilitate its wide spread in the environment gao et al 2012 the presence of args located on the chromosome in arb was studied before and after uv irradiation the average harboring frequency of tet genes showed a slight fluctuation while that of sul genes decreased greatly by 14 p 0 05 table 3 it was mainly caused by the change in the microbial community roberts 2005 for example no sul1 gene was present in the genomic dna of gram positive bacteria in this study table s4 while the proportion of gram positive bacteria increased with increasing uv fluence leading to the lowest detection frequency of sul genes in uv10 the average detection frequencies of tet genes in most of the dominant genera showed an upward trend upon uv irradiation table s5 so bacterial community shifts might not be the only reason for the changes in the distribution of args under uv irradiation it has been reported that genomic genes related to oxidative stress cellular repair and protective mechanisms and args are simultaneously upregulated in mar e coli during solar irradiation al jassim et al 2017 so there might be interactions between args and genes related to uv defense like co selection contributing to the increase of args present on the chromosome it has also been reported that some args e g the baca gene are associated with the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and other cell wall components jia et al 2015 which would be helpful in the repair of cell walls damaged during uv irradiation it is not clear whether these args in this study also have similar functions the trends of arg variation in plasmid dna were quite different from those in genomic dna the frequencies of six args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx and sul1 showed a downward trend with increasing uv fluence tables s4 s5 the average detection frequencies of tet and sul genes decreased by 15 p 0 05 and 6 after uv irradiation table 3 the percentage of bacteria harboring 3 5 tet genes decreased by 30 and the ratio of bacteria simultaneously carrying sul1 and sul2 was also reduced data not shown besides we also investigated the variation of plasmid borne args in aeromonas which was dominant in rw and uv5 the presence of most of its args decreased at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 ranging from 13 to 18 table s4 s5 it indicated a loss of args in surviving bacteria after uv irradiation the decreased presence of args in surviving bacteria was also observed in chlorination and photocatalytic disinfection venieri et al 2017 it should be mentioned that many results of the variations of args were not statistically significant especially at low irradiation fluence 5 mj cm2 these deviations might be due to that the strains were different ones before and after uv irradiation and the resistome in bacteria with the same antibiotic resistance profiles were quite different for example the harboring frequency of plasmid borne sul1 gene might be lower in rw comparing with other treatments so the variation of plasmid borne sul1 gene was not significant even if the loss of args occurred in surviving bacteria and it was found that a considerable amount of injured bacteria could be cultivable during photocatalysis dunlop et al 2015 however the proportion of injured bacteria survived uv irradiation still remained unclear so the variations of args might not be significant if the proportion was small anyhow the decrease in detection frequencies of plasmid borne args in surviving bacteria was broadly observed in this study rysz et al 2013 explored the maintenance of plasmid borne tet genes in p aeruginosa and found a higher rate of arg loss when it was grown in minimal growth medium than in richer luria resulting from the loss of plasmids since the maintenance of antibiotic resistant plasmids can be a metabolic burden a lack of energy sources would decrease the generational stability of plasmids when bacteria are subjected to adverse conditions or injured a series of genes are activated and upregulated to overcome these situations no doubt consuming large amounts of energy al jassim et al 2017 so it was hypothesized that bacteria would selectively discard some plasmids to minimize the metabolic burden so as to have enough energy for self repair therefore it might be the loss of antibiotic resistant plasmids that contributed to the reduction in the detection frequencies of plasmid borne args under uv irradiation in this study oguma et al 2001 found that cryptosporidium parvum had the ability to repair after uv irradiation but its pathogenicity was lost it was reported that 1 e coli with ampicillin resistant plasmids could recover by photo reactivation after uv inactivation and maintain the antibiotic resistance encoded in plasmids guo et al 2012 the different results may be due to the different bacteria used in these studies which showed various responses to uv kottara et al 2018 obaseiki ebor and smith 1992 reported that r plasmid peb017 not only conferred bacterial resistance but also enhanced the ability to defend against uv irradiation this might explain the increase of average detection frequencies of args in escherichia and trichococcus table s4 their args might mostly exist on plasmids like that contributing to their increased abundance bacteria can transfer beneficial plasmid genes e g args to the chromosome through the transposons then discard the plasmid to alleviate the metabolic cost kottara et al 2018 so it seems that genes carried by the chromosome are more stable than plasmid encoding genes especially when the hosts are under adverse conditions in general the args located on the chromosome were less affected by uv irradiation and the changes of detection frequencies were more strongly related to evolution in the bacterial community however we suggest that the reduction of the detection frequencies of args located on plasmids is mainly caused by the loss of plasmids due to the reduction of plasmid borne args horizontal gene transfer is weakened in surviving bacteria from this point of view uv irradiation can effectively reduce the adverse environmental effect of disinfected wastewater 4 conclusions uv irradiation greatly changed the microbial community structure the proportions of gram positive bacteria gradually increased with uv fluence the antibiotic resistance frequencies varied among different genera leading to fluctuations in antibiotic resistance upon uv irradiation the proportions of bacteria resistant to cep pen and van all greatly decreased after uv treatment in both events and those for bacteria resistant to ofx cip and sd increased the mar index of the sample was markedly increased p 0 05 at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 however the mar index of treated samples did not increase or even be impaired after 10 mj cm2 uv irradiation because the bacterial community structure was greatly changed and the genera with relatively low mar indices became the dominant genera in uv10 uv disinfection resulted in the selection of mar bacteria the antibiotic resistance of most genera was enhanced after uv irradiations comparing with their counterparts in rw thus the discharge of arb to receiving water will further promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through vertical transfer and horizontal gene transfer and human health will be threatened by a higher probability of antibiotic resistant infections during the reuse of treated wastewater thus more studies on integrated technologies like uv h2o2 and photo fenton should be conducted to get a better performance on eliminating antibiotic resistance in the case of args located on genomic dna the average detection frequency of tet genes only showed a slight fluctuation and that of sul genes decreased by 14 p 0 05 the changes in the detection frequencies of args were mainly due to the alteration of the microbial community in contrast the presence of most plasmid borne args 6 out of 7 showed a downward trend and the average detection frequencies of the tet and sul genes decreased by 15 p 0 05 and 6 after uv disinfection the reduction of detection frequencies of plasmid borne args might mainly be due to the loss of plasmids future work on successive treatment of purified strains is needed to explore the effects of uv irradiation on surviving arb at subcellular and molecular level for the control of args dissemination conflicts of interest there

18877,to elucidate the effects of uv disinfection on antibiotic resistance in biologically treated wastewater we investigated the antibiotic resistance profiles species of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args in antibiotic resistant bacteria before and after treatment uv disinfection greatly changed the bacterial community structure and the antibiotic resistance in wastewater the antibiotic resistance in wastewater samples was strongly associated with the bacterial community the proportions of gram positive bacteria gradually increased with increasing uv fluence the proportions of bacteria resistant to cephalexin penicillin and vancomycin all greatly decreased after uv treatment in both sampling events july 2018 and january 2019 and those for bacteria resistant to ofloxacin ciprofloxacin and sulfadiazine increased resulting from the alternative antibiotic resistance profiles among different genera uv disinfection induced the selection of multi antibiotic resistant mar bacteria for example the mar indices of aeromonas the dominant genus during the treatments were significantly increased after uv irradiation p 0 05 the mar index was also markedly increased p 0 05 at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 in both events in uv10 treatment the bacterial community structure was greatly changed the genera with relatively low mar indices replaced that with high mar indices and became the dominant genera as a result the mar indices of treated samples showed a decreased trend after 10 mj cm2 uv irradiation the detection frequencies of args located on the chromosome varied mainly due to the evolution of the microbial community the occurrence of args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx and sul1 located on plasmid dna decreased after uv disinfection and the average detection frequencies of tet and sul genes decreased by 15 and 6 respectively p 0 05 generally speaking the effect of uv disinfection on the enrichment of antibiotic resistance is limited in this study and horizontal gene transfer via the plasmids in surviving bacteria might be impaired due to the decreased abundance of args on the plasmids graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv disinfection antibiotic resistance microbial community multi antibiotic resistance index plasmid dna 1 introduction for decades antibiotics have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of diseases in humans and animals as well as for livestock breeding levy and marshall 2004 li et al 2018a it was estimated that in 2013 53800 tons of antibiotics were discharged into the environment in china zhang et al 2015a antibiotics in the environment have promoted the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args leading to an increase in antibiotic resistant pathogens zhu et al 2013 berendonk et al 2015 the spread of infection causing arb is considered to be a major threat to human health by the world health organization who 2014 due to the high bacterial densities abundant nutrients and selective pressures induced by pollutant compounds including antibiotics biocides pharmaceuticals and heavy metals municipal wastewater provides suitable conditions for arb reproduction and args horizontal gene transfer zhang et al 2012 rizzo et al 2013a manaia et al 2016 besides human commensal and environmentally relevant microbiota are encountered in wastewater treatment plants facilitating the sharing of args among them and even introducing new resistance mechanisms to pathogenic microorganisms glady croue et al 2018 however these treatment plants are neither particularly designed to eliminate arb nor even to remove args and various arb are still present in biologically treated wastewater pruden et al 2013 to reduce the risk to human health and ensure ecological security advanced treatments are needed to further eliminate the arb and args present in secondary effluent uv disinfection is considered to be a promising approach to achieve these goals since compared to chlorination it does not produce toxic by products hong et al 2018 furthermore uv c light penetrates the cell walls of bacteria and is directly absorbed by nucleic acids resulting in the inactivation of arb and damage to args via the formation of dimers of adjacent cytosines or thymines mckinney and pruden 2012 al jassim et al 2017 the maximum absorption of uv by nucleic acids occurs at a wavelength of 254 nm chang et al 2017 guo et al 2013a found that uv disinfection effectively removed erythromycin and tetracycline resistant bacteria but the latter were more resistant to uv irradiation than the former at low uv irradiation fluences and the proportion of tetracycline resistant bacteria was nearly double that before uv disinfection distinct responses of bacteria resistant to different antibiotics under uv irradiation were also have been reported by meckes and guo et al meckes 1982 guo et al 2013b they all attributed it to the microbial selectivity of uv treatment on arb however how uv disinfection affects the selection of arb remained unclear huang et al 2016 investigated uv inactivation in 16 tetracycline resistant isolates and found that isolates from different genera had diverse responses to uv irradiation and even isolates from the same genus also had different responses zhang et al 2017 revealed that multi antibiotic resistant mar escherichia coli was more resistant to uv irradiation than antibiotic sensitive e coli at low uv fluences however several studies reported no statistically significant difference between the removal efficiency of antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive e coli templeton et al 2009 guo et al 2012 huang et al 2013 on the whole few studies have comprehensively investigated the effects of uv disinfection on bacterial community structure and antibiotic resistance in wastewater also the underlying relationships between bacterial community shifts and changes in antibiotic resistance have been little discussed previous studies have investigated the changes in args abundance before and after uv disinfection using the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction q pcr sousa et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 but this technique does not represent the distribution of args in viable bacteria because dissociated args and args in dead cells are all counted antibiotic resistance can be disseminated through vertical transfer i e by cell division and horizontal gene transfer including conjugation transduction and natural transformation dodd 2012 and among the three mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer conjugation based on viable donor and recipient cells is presumed to have more of a role than the others lerminiaux and cameron 2018 indicating the importance of investigating the presence of args in surviving bacteria of uv irradiation it has already been reported that the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria are significantly changed after uv disinfection cockerill et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013b however the alterations of args in surviving bacteria during uv disinfection have received less attention it was reported that the stability of functional genes on genome and plasmid was different and some plasmids were easy to be lost when the cost to the host of carrying the plasmid outweighs the benefit of the plasmid borne accessory genes turner et al 1998 bergstrom et al 2000 considering the potential distinct effects of uv irradiation on the args located on genomic and plasmid dna and the crucial role of plasmids in the dissemination of args kottara et al 2018 studies on args at different locations need to be conducted in order to have better security assessment of uv disinfected effluent to the best of our knowledge this work is the first study of the variations in args separately on the chromosome and plasmid in arb before and after uv irradiation the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the uv inactivation efficiency and effects of uv irradiation on the phenotypes of cultivable isolates resistant to ten antibiotics tetracycline sulfadiazine cephalexin penicillin erythromycin vancomycin gentamicin chloramphenicol ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin which almost cover all classes of antibiotics that are widely used in human disease prevention and livestock and poultry breeding zhang et al 2015a bacteria resistant to these antibiotics have received more and more attentions in recent years zhang et al 2015a b yang et al 2017 moreover args conferring resistance to these antibiotics were detected at high concentrations in different matrixes zhu et al 2013 lin et al 2016 2 explore the underlying relationships between bacterial community shifts and antibiotic resistance changes in wastewater and 3 study the effects of uv treatment on args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx sul1 and sul2 located in different locations chromosome or plasmid in surviving arb 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the wastewater samples used in this study were taken from the effluent of the biological process in a municipal wastewater treatment plant using a cyclic activated sludge system a variant of sequencing batch reactor sbr in zhuozhou hebei province china after collection in two sterile 1 l polyethylene containers the samples were immediately stored on ice and transported to the lab the experiments were conducted within 5 h after sampling in order to get a reliable result samples were collected on two occasions july 2018 and january 2019 the initial total cultivable heterotrophic bacteria were 2 0 105 2 8 105 cfu ml in july event and 1 4 103 1 5 103 cfu ml in january event 2 2 disinfection experiments a laboratory scale device was designed and built based on the descriptions of mckinney and pruden 2012 and bolton and linden 2003 briefly the apparatus mainly consisted of four low pressure mercury lamps emitting nearly monochromatic light at a wavelength of 254 nm and a collimated beam tube fig s1 the lamps were preheated for at least 20 min before experiments in order to achieve a constant uv fluence rate 0 50 mw cm2 which was measured by a radiometer with a uv254 detector uv photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university china the irradiation experiments were performed at room temperature 25 2 c in the dark and the fluences were set by controlling the exposure times in china fluences of 20 and 80 mj cm2 are usually used for wastewater discharge and reclamation respectively hu et al 2016 thus we exposed the samples to collimated uv light for 0 10 15 20 40 100 and 160 s to obtain the corresponding irradiation fluences of 0 5 7 5 10 20 50 and 80 mj cm2 these treatments were named as rw uv5 uv7 5 uv10 uv20 uv50 and uv80 respectively in the disinfection procedure a 90 mm petri dish with a 40 ml wastewater sample was placed under the center of the collimated tube and then gently stirred throughout the irradiation experiment for each treatment the procedure was replicated three times 2 3 enumeration isolation and identification of bacteria to determine the removal levels of heterotrophic bacteria under different uv fluences the samples were serially diluted in saline solution 0 85 and then 0 1 ml of the dilutions were plated on luria bertani agar solarbio china in triplicate according to the plate counting results cultivable bacteria were not detectable in uv50 for uv7 5 uv10 and uv20 more repeats were plated to obtain enough isolates in order to assess the variations in the cultivable heterotrophic bacterial community and antibiotic resistant phenotypes under uv irradiation strains from each sample were randomly selected from the plates and further purified using the plate streak method han et al 2018 genomic dna was extracted from the purified isolates for identification the 16s rrna genes were amplified using the universal bacterial primers 27f 5 agagtttgattctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 ggttaccttgttacgactt 3 the pcr was executed following the procedure initial denaturation at 94 c for 5 min then 35 cycles at 94 c for 1 min 57 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 c for 7 min the pcr products were sent to sangon biotech shanghai china for dna sequencing the sequences assembled were analyzed by comparison with sequences in genbank database using the blast alignment search tool http www ncbi nlm nih gov blast the species of the isolate was determined as the species with the highest score in the blast results zhang et al 2015b 2 4 antibiotic susceptibility test to determine the antibiotic resistance profiles of the purified isolates antibiotic susceptibility tests were carried out according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines 2010 a total of ten antibiotics were tested tetracycline tc 16 μg ml sulfadiazine sd 512 μg ml cephalexin cep 16 μg ml penicillin pen 16 μg ml erythromycin ery 8 μg ml vancomycin van 32 μg ml gentamicin gen 16 μg ml chloramphenicol cap 32 μg ml ofloxacin ofx 8 μg ml and ciprofloxacin cip 32 μg ml the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations of these antibiotics recommended by clsi were used in this study staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and e coli atcc 25922 served as negative controls an inoculum prepared with a specific concentration was inoculated on mueller hinton agar solarbio china plate and then incubated at 35 c for 16 20 h an isolate was regarded as resistant to one antibiotic if clear colonies were observed on a plate with this antibiotic and no s aureus atcc 29213 or e coli atcc 25922 colonies were observed on the same plate at the same time all the experiments were conducted at least twice the antibiotic resistance frequency was determined as 1 d e t e c t i o n f r e q u e n c y a b 100 where a is the number of isolates resistant to antibiotics and b is the number of isolates from the sample zhang et al 2015b the mar index was applied to estimate the potential resistance of bacteria to multiple antibiotics it was calculated as follows 2 m a r index a b c where a is the aggregate resistance score of all isolates in one sample if one isolate was observed resisting to one antibiotic it will get one point if not it will get zero point b is the number of antibiotics tested and c is the number of isolates in the sample zhang et al 2015b 2 5 detection of args in arb the presence of 7 args located on genomic dna and plasmid dna was detected in tc resistant bacteria and sd resistant bacteria genomic dna was extracted from isolated arb using a tianamp bacterial dna kit tiangen china plasmid dna was also extracted from these arb using an omega plasmid mini kit omega bio tek usa the primers of the args were listed in table s1 the pcr reaction mixture comprised 10 μl of 2 taq supermaster mix dye plus tiangen china 1 μl of template dna genomic dna or plasmid dna 0 2 μl of each 10 μm primer personalbio china and 8 6 μl of ddh2o the pcr procedure was initial denaturation at 94 c for 5 min then 35 cycles at 94 c for 1 min annealing for 30s temperature in table s1 72 c for 30s and a final extension step at 72 c for 7 min each amplification product was loaded on a 1 0 horizontal agarose gel containing 10000 gelred vazyme china the gel was run in 50 tae buffer for 30 min under 120 v and then visualized under uv transillumination biorad ca triplicate pcr assays were conducted for each sample and ddh2o replacing primers served as negative control 2 6 data analyses every isolated strain was regarded as a sample and significant differences between mar index and prevalence of args in treatments were determined using a two sided z test p 0 05 statistical analysis was performed using spss 19 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of arb in the wastewater rw we detected high frequencies of bacteria resistant to the ten antibiotics in biologically treated wastewater collected on two occasions july 2018 and january 2019 similar resistance profiles were observed for both dates however the strains isolated from the july event exhibited more resistance than those isolated from the january event fig 1 among them bacteria resistant to cep were the most prevalent species with a proportion of 73 fig 1 their prevalence might be due to the extensive use of cep in the clinical treatment of infections 2670 tons were consumed in china in 2013 and over 95 was used for humans zhang et al 2015a sd pen and van resistant bacteria were also major arb in rw at frequencies 60 fig 1 van resistant bacteria have also been found at a high frequency in surface water zhang et al 2016 the average percentage of tc resistant bacteria was 36 a value quite similar to the results from studies of wastewater treatment plants and surface water zhang et al 2015b 2016 but significantly higher than that found in one treatment plant in italy in which heterotrophic bacteria resistant to tc were only 3 7 turolla et al 2018 although gen 13 and cap resistant bacteria 11 had the lowest proportions in our study fig 1 they were still markedly higher than those in another study guo et al 2013b akinbowale et al 2006 tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 104 bacteria isolated from different parts of australia and found that resistance to cep ery and tc was widespread while resistance to cap and gen was less common this is quite similar to our results all strains were susceptible to cip in akinbowale s study while the resistance frequency was 24 in our work it may be mainly due to the high concentration of quinolones in the environment in china guo et al 2013b 3 2 the evolution of antibiotic resistance under uv irradiation the resistance rates of the isolates to the ten antibiotics varied following an increase of irradiation fluence as a whole the proportions of tc cap sd ery ofx cip and gen resistant bacteria increased after uv treatment while those for cep pen and van resistant bacteria decreased in july event fig 2 a the proportions of tc cap ery and gen resistant bacteria decreased after uv treatment in january event fig 2b guo et al 2013 reported that the ratios of cultivable bacteria resistant to tc sd van and cap became higher after uv treatment while the percentages of cep ery gen and cip resistant bacteria decreased the differences were resulted from the variations of bacterial community in wastewater samples collected in different occasions and studies fig 3 the antibiotic resistance frequencies to most of antibiotics increased at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 fig 2 and the mar indices of most genera also showed an upward trend after the uv irradiation table 1 it was mainly due to the fact that most of the mar bacteria survived uv irradiation for example the mar indices of aeromonas the dominant bacterium in rw and uv5 were markedly increased after 5 mj cm2 uv irradiation p 0 05 aeromonas strains resistant to 5 antibiotics accounted for 90 in uv5 but only 76 in rw table s2 three aeromonas strains were resistant to all 10 antibiotics but none of them were detected in rw table s2 furthermore the proportion of pathogenic species e g a caviae and a hydrophila was significantly higher than that in rw table s3 zhang et al 2017 also found that mar e coli was more resistant to uv than antibiotic sensitive e coli and the discrepancy in inactivation efficiency was more distinct at low uv fluences 20 mj cm2 al jassim et al 2017 investigated the responses of two e coli strains to solar irradiation and found that the virulent and antibiotic resistant e coli pi 7 displayed a prolonged persistence compared with e coli dsm1103 a nonvirulent and less antibiotic resistant strain for more functional genes associated with protective and repair mechanisms were upregulated to participate in confronting the sequelae of solar irradiation in e coli pi 7 it was reported that the capsular material could slow down the changes in membrane characteristics and contribute high uv resistance rusin and gerba 2001 and arb produce more capsular material than antibiotic sensitive strains during uv irradiation another reason for the increase in resistance frequencies may be related to the increased tolerance to antibiotics after uv irradiation zhang et al 2017 reported that the tolerance of originally antibiotic sensitive e coli to some antibiotics was significantly enhanced after uv irradiation leading to changes in the antibiotic resistance profiles of the surviving strains however it was found that mar bacteria single antibiotic resistant and antibiotic susceptible ones all showed similar inactivation profiles during solar photo fenton disinfection giannakis et al 2018a bacteria possessing resistance to antibiotics do not seem to have an enhanced resistance towards solar photo fenton treatment it was demonstrated that the solar photo fenton disinfection is mainly an intracellular advanced oxidation process in which fe2 and h2o2 were transported into bacterial cell and caused irreversible damage to the cell giannakis et al 2018b that might be the reason of a better performance of solar photo fenton in args removal compared with uv h2o2 ferro et al 2017 although some mar bacteria were more resistant to uv than less antibiotic resistant strains from the same species or genera the discrepancies among bacteria from different genera or phyla appeared to play a more decisive role in protection against uv irradiation similar trends of bacterial communities were observed under uv irradiation in both events fig 3 and s2 in general the abundance of gram negative bacteria decreased gradually and the proportion of gram positive bacteria increased with increasing fluence it can be attributed to the differences in cell wall structure between gram negative and gram positive organisms the latter have a thick peptidoglycan layer which can absorb more uv impairing its penetration mckinney and pruden 2012 furthermore the four peptide side chain in the peptidoglycan layer of gram positive organisms is more complex and the chemical bonds are more difficult to be attacked than those of gram negative bacteria li et al 2011 however it was reported that the bacterial structure did not significantly affect the inactivation efficacy of solar photo fenton disinfection giannakis et al 2018a and similar result was also observed during electrochemical disinfection shang et al 2013 it was also reported that the difference in inactivating mrsa and p aeruginosa was greatly reduced by the combined tio2 uv and h2o2 uv treatments compared with uv treatment guo et al 2017 it might be due to the strong oxidant e g oh produced in these processes which could cause almost non selective inactivation li et al 2011 the bacterial community was greatly changed in uv 7 5 fig 3 and s2 the antibiotic resistance of wastewater was also greatly affected by the alteration of bacterial populations in july event the dominant bacteria in uv7 5 had lower resistance frequencies to these antibiotics than that in other treatments table 2 especially the resistant frequencies of these bacteria to tc and cap were extremely low and acidovorax were absolutely susceptible to tc and cap table 2 as a result the abundance of bacteria resistant to most antibiotics was reduced in uv7 5 fig 2a nevertheless the percentages of bacteria resistant to ofx ery gen and cip increased compared to that in rw fig 2a this was attributed to the relatively high resistance frequencies of dominant genera to these antibiotics table 2 for example aeromonas accounted for 36 of total bacteria in rw and contributed 25 resistance to ofx however stenotrophomonas only accounted for 16 in uv7 5 but contributed 31 resistance to ofx in the january event enterococcus became the dominant genus in uv7 5 and the resistant frequencies to all antibiotics except pen and van were relatively high leading to high resistant frequencies to most antibiotics in uv7 5 fig 2b and table 2 for uv10 in the july event the dominant genera comamonas enterococcus and microbacterium had relatively high resistance to gen and cap table 2 so the resistance frequencies to these antibiotics greatly increased fig 2a but their resistance frequencies to cep pen and van were relatively low except for enterococcus and microbacterium to cep contributing a decline of resistance frequencies to these antibiotics in uv10 table 2 the proportions of bacteria in phylum actinobacteria and firmicutes were greatly increased after 10 mj cm2 uv irradiation in the january event while the resistance frequencies of most genera in these two phylum such as bacillus were very low as a result the resistance frequencies to most antibiotics were reduced in uv10 fig 2b besides over 50 flavobacterium and 40 deinococcus bacterial strains isolated from uv20 were pigment producing bacteria in the july and january event respectively fig s2 it might be due to the absorption of uv by the pigment preventing damage to sensitive components such as dna the pigment also might act as an antioxidant scavenging the reactive oxygen species generated by uv irradiation so as to protect dna and prevent the lipid peroxidation of the membrane moeller et al 2005 all isolates of flavobacterium in uv20 became uncultivable during second plate streaking however one isolate of flavobacterium in rw was always active during the experiment so we hypothesized that some functions relating to cell reproduction in flavobacterium were damaged by uv irradiation but this did not emerge immediately and the reason needs to be further investigated in the future so the traditional cultivable based method may underestimate the uv inactivation efficiency due to the inability to cultivate flavobacterium isolates in uv20 were not included in antibiotic resistance studies the mar indices of samples in both events all significantly increased after 5 mj cm2 uv irradiation p 0 05 from 0 44 to 0 51 in july event and from 0 39 to 0 46 in january event however the mar indices decreased with the further increase of uv irradiations and the mar index of uv10 was even lower than that of rw in january event this was also consistent with the alteration of mar bacteria the percentage of mar bacteria increased in uv5 especially for those resistant to at least 9 drugs fig 4 however the percentage of isolates resistant to 6 antibiotics declined with increases in fluence fig 4 this was mainly due to the great changes in the bacterial community at high fluences as shown in fig s2 and table 2 bacillus enterococcus comamonas and trichococcus with relatively low mar indices replaced aeromonas and escherichia with high mar indices and became the dominant genera in uv10 in both events it should be noted that although the antibiotic resistances of samples were not enriched or even impaired the mar indices of bacteria still increased after uv irradiation comparing with the counterparts in rw table 1 thus the abundant presence of the robust arb in receiving water will further promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through vertical transfer and horizontal gene transfer some previous studies have revealed that the levels of antibiotic resistance significantly increased in receiving water causing great threat to the ecosystem pruden et al 2012 lorenzo et al 2018 furthermore antibiotic resistant infections are usually more serious last longer and are more likely to lead death than susceptible infections when the treated wastewater was reused for agricultural irrigation farmers could be directly exposed to these microbial contaminants e g pathogenic arb through occupational contact and public consumers could also be indirectly exposed through consumption of food product that was contaminated by arb leading to a higher probability of antibiotic resistant infections al jassim et al 2015 3 3 variation of args during uv irradiation treatments the changing patterns of bacterial populations and antibiotic resistance of wastewater samples under uv irradiation were similar in both sampling events as a result the sd and tc resistant bacteria survived uv irradiation in the july event were selected to study the variation of args the presence of 7 args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx sul1 and sul2 were detected among the corresponding arb in order to explore the potentially different changes of genomic and plasmid args under uv irradiation args at these two locations were separately assessed the seven args were all present in both genomic and plasmid dna among the five tet genes teta was detected at a markedly higher frequency on plasmid than that on genomic dna and tetm had the highest abundance in both genomic and plasmid dna fig 5 our results are consistent with previous research which indicated that tetm was the dominant tetracycline resistance gene in most cases liu et al 2014 chen et al 2015 li et al 2018b the reason for its prevalence may be that the tetm gene has the widest host range of any tet gene being found in 42 genera chen et al 2015 and tetm is closely associated with conjugative transposons roberts 2005 which contributes to the dissemination of tetm among microorganisms the two sul genes were more likely to be located on plasmids than the chromosome in this work the total detection frequency genome plasmid of sul2 113 was higher than that of sul1 102 and the frequency of sul2 on the plasmid was greater than that of sul1 fig 5 in consistent with previous studies gao et al 2012 liu et al 2014 the sul1 gene was typically associated with class 1 integrons while sul2 was generally detected on small non conjugative or large transmissible multi resistant plasmids which would facilitate its wide spread in the environment gao et al 2012 the presence of args located on the chromosome in arb was studied before and after uv irradiation the average harboring frequency of tet genes showed a slight fluctuation while that of sul genes decreased greatly by 14 p 0 05 table 3 it was mainly caused by the change in the microbial community roberts 2005 for example no sul1 gene was present in the genomic dna of gram positive bacteria in this study table s4 while the proportion of gram positive bacteria increased with increasing uv fluence leading to the lowest detection frequency of sul genes in uv10 the average detection frequencies of tet genes in most of the dominant genera showed an upward trend upon uv irradiation table s5 so bacterial community shifts might not be the only reason for the changes in the distribution of args under uv irradiation it has been reported that genomic genes related to oxidative stress cellular repair and protective mechanisms and args are simultaneously upregulated in mar e coli during solar irradiation al jassim et al 2017 so there might be interactions between args and genes related to uv defense like co selection contributing to the increase of args present on the chromosome it has also been reported that some args e g the baca gene are associated with the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and other cell wall components jia et al 2015 which would be helpful in the repair of cell walls damaged during uv irradiation it is not clear whether these args in this study also have similar functions the trends of arg variation in plasmid dna were quite different from those in genomic dna the frequencies of six args teta tetc tetm tetw tetx and sul1 showed a downward trend with increasing uv fluence tables s4 s5 the average detection frequencies of tet and sul genes decreased by 15 p 0 05 and 6 after uv irradiation table 3 the percentage of bacteria harboring 3 5 tet genes decreased by 30 and the ratio of bacteria simultaneously carrying sul1 and sul2 was also reduced data not shown besides we also investigated the variation of plasmid borne args in aeromonas which was dominant in rw and uv5 the presence of most of its args decreased at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 ranging from 13 to 18 table s4 s5 it indicated a loss of args in surviving bacteria after uv irradiation the decreased presence of args in surviving bacteria was also observed in chlorination and photocatalytic disinfection venieri et al 2017 it should be mentioned that many results of the variations of args were not statistically significant especially at low irradiation fluence 5 mj cm2 these deviations might be due to that the strains were different ones before and after uv irradiation and the resistome in bacteria with the same antibiotic resistance profiles were quite different for example the harboring frequency of plasmid borne sul1 gene might be lower in rw comparing with other treatments so the variation of plasmid borne sul1 gene was not significant even if the loss of args occurred in surviving bacteria and it was found that a considerable amount of injured bacteria could be cultivable during photocatalysis dunlop et al 2015 however the proportion of injured bacteria survived uv irradiation still remained unclear so the variations of args might not be significant if the proportion was small anyhow the decrease in detection frequencies of plasmid borne args in surviving bacteria was broadly observed in this study rysz et al 2013 explored the maintenance of plasmid borne tet genes in p aeruginosa and found a higher rate of arg loss when it was grown in minimal growth medium than in richer luria resulting from the loss of plasmids since the maintenance of antibiotic resistant plasmids can be a metabolic burden a lack of energy sources would decrease the generational stability of plasmids when bacteria are subjected to adverse conditions or injured a series of genes are activated and upregulated to overcome these situations no doubt consuming large amounts of energy al jassim et al 2017 so it was hypothesized that bacteria would selectively discard some plasmids to minimize the metabolic burden so as to have enough energy for self repair therefore it might be the loss of antibiotic resistant plasmids that contributed to the reduction in the detection frequencies of plasmid borne args under uv irradiation in this study oguma et al 2001 found that cryptosporidium parvum had the ability to repair after uv irradiation but its pathogenicity was lost it was reported that 1 e coli with ampicillin resistant plasmids could recover by photo reactivation after uv inactivation and maintain the antibiotic resistance encoded in plasmids guo et al 2012 the different results may be due to the different bacteria used in these studies which showed various responses to uv kottara et al 2018 obaseiki ebor and smith 1992 reported that r plasmid peb017 not only conferred bacterial resistance but also enhanced the ability to defend against uv irradiation this might explain the increase of average detection frequencies of args in escherichia and trichococcus table s4 their args might mostly exist on plasmids like that contributing to their increased abundance bacteria can transfer beneficial plasmid genes e g args to the chromosome through the transposons then discard the plasmid to alleviate the metabolic cost kottara et al 2018 so it seems that genes carried by the chromosome are more stable than plasmid encoding genes especially when the hosts are under adverse conditions in general the args located on the chromosome were less affected by uv irradiation and the changes of detection frequencies were more strongly related to evolution in the bacterial community however we suggest that the reduction of the detection frequencies of args located on plasmids is mainly caused by the loss of plasmids due to the reduction of plasmid borne args horizontal gene transfer is weakened in surviving bacteria from this point of view uv irradiation can effectively reduce the adverse environmental effect of disinfected wastewater 4 conclusions uv irradiation greatly changed the microbial community structure the proportions of gram positive bacteria gradually increased with uv fluence the antibiotic resistance frequencies varied among different genera leading to fluctuations in antibiotic resistance upon uv irradiation the proportions of bacteria resistant to cep pen and van all greatly decreased after uv treatment in both events and those for bacteria resistant to ofx cip and sd increased the mar index of the sample was markedly increased p 0 05 at a fluence of 5 mj cm2 however the mar index of treated samples did not increase or even be impaired after 10 mj cm2 uv irradiation because the bacterial community structure was greatly changed and the genera with relatively low mar indices became the dominant genera in uv10 uv disinfection resulted in the selection of mar bacteria the antibiotic resistance of most genera was enhanced after uv irradiations comparing with their counterparts in rw thus the discharge of arb to receiving water will further promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through vertical transfer and horizontal gene transfer and human health will be threatened by a higher probability of antibiotic resistant infections during the reuse of treated wastewater thus more studies on integrated technologies like uv h2o2 and photo fenton should be conducted to get a better performance on eliminating antibiotic resistance in the case of args located on genomic dna the average detection frequency of tet genes only showed a slight fluctuation and that of sul genes decreased by 14 p 0 05 the changes in the detection frequencies of args were mainly due to the alteration of the microbial community in contrast the presence of most plasmid borne args 6 out of 7 showed a downward trend and the average detection frequencies of the tet and sul genes decreased by 15 p 0 05 and 6 after uv disinfection the reduction of detection frequencies of plasmid borne args might mainly be due to the loss of plasmids future work on successive treatment of purified strains is needed to explore the effects of uv irradiation on surviving arb at subcellular and molecular level for the control of args dissemination conflicts of interest there

18878,the hybrid membrane bioreactor nanofiltration treatment process can be an effective approach for treating the landfill leachate but the residual leachate concentrate highly loaded with the humic substance and salts remains an environmental concern herein a loose nanofiltration membrane molecular weight cut off of 860 da was used to recover the humic substance which can act as a key component of organic fertilizer from the leachate concentrate the loose nanofiltration membrane showed the high permeation fluxes and high transmissions 94 7 for most inorganic ions i e na k cl and no3 while retaining 95 7 0 3 of the humic substance demonstrating its great potential in effective fractionation of humic substance from inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate the operation conditions i e cross flow rates and temperatures had more pronounced impacts on the filtration performance of the loose nanofiltration membrane increasing cross flow rates from 60 to 260 l h 1 resulted in an improvement of ca 7 3 in the humic substance rejection mainly due to the reduced concentration polarization effect in contrast the solute rejection of the nanofiltration membrane was negatively dependent on the temperature the rejection of humic substance decreased from 96 3 0 3 to 92 0 0 4 with increasing the temperature from 23 to 35 c likely due to the enlargement of the membrane pore size and enhancement in solute diffusivity the humic substance was enriched from 1735 to 15 287 mg l 1 yielding a 91 2 recovery ratio with 85 7 desalination efficiency at a concentration factor of 9 6 the recovered hs had significantly stimulated the seed germination and growth of the green mungbean plants with no obvious phytotoxicity these results demonstrate that loose nanofiltration can be an effective promising technology to recover the humic substance as a valuable fertilizer component towards sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill leachate concentrate loose nanofiltration membrane fractionation humic substance recovery fertilizer sustainable management 1 introduction landfilling is an economical and widely practiced solution to management of municipal solid wastes a key challenge is that huge amounts of the landfill leachate are generated due to rainwater percolation organics biodegradation and physicochemical interactions during landfilling wang et al 2012 the landfill leachate is a strongly polluted complex stream containing large amounts of organic and inorganic contaminants i e humic substances ammonia nitrogen heavy metals xenobiotics and inorganic salts and poses detrimental hazards to the ecosystem and human health without appropriate treatment yuan et al 2017 yi et al 2017 the leachate can be treated by chemical physical and biological methods to reduce contaminant concentrations iskander et al 2018 an integrated process combining biodegradation and membrane filtration can effectively treat the landfill leachate to minimize the waste discharge ahmed and lan 2012 examples of such integration include a membrane bioreactor mbr and nanofiltration reverse osmosis which can meet the stringent effluent discharge standards due to the high efficiency for removal of contaminants e g ammonia nitrogen heavy metals and highly toxic pollutants and low energy consumption compared to the conventional strategies hu et al 2018 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 zolfaghari et al 2016 nevertheless the leachate concentrate generated in this hybrid process inevitably emerges as a key issue typically representing 15 30 of the incoming raw leachate calabrò et al 2010 the leachate concentrate is highly loaded with dissolved organic matters but has a low ratio of biological oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand cod indicating a poor biodegradability the elevated salinity of the leachate concentrate could also jeopardize the efficacy of biological degradation to minimize the impact of the leachate concentrate several conventional approaches including recirculation talalaj and biedka 2015 calabrò et al 2010 solidification stabilization hunce et al 2012 ince et al 2010 evaporation yang et al 2018 and coagulation qiu et al 2016 long et al 2017 aziz et al 2018 have been investigated recirculation of the leachate concentrate back to the landfill is the simplest method but it would result in accumulation of inorganic salts an increase in cod and enrichment of heavy metals calabrò et al 2010 solidification and evaporation may be the acceptable solutions to minimizing the volume of the leachate concentrate when the energy consumption and operation cost are not the major concerns hunce et al 2012 xu et al 2006 coagulation flocculation yields an insufficient removal of dissolved organic matters in the concentrated leachate calling for further treatment lessoued et al 2017 long et al 2017 chemical oxidation processes especially advanced oxidation are of increasing interest for removal of the refractory organic matters in the leachate concentrate at an expense of high energy demand and high chemical dosage jung et al 2017 ghazi et al 2014 oulego et al 2016 for sustainable waste management a conceptual paradigm shift is necessary to focus on resource recovery from the waste streams beyond contaminant removal clark et al 2016 he et al 2017 lin et al 2015a b mccarty et al 2011 kuriqi 2014 kuriqi et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 the leachate concentrate is rich in the humic substance hs i e humic acid and fulvic acid and it is an important component of an organic fertilizer for plant growth however the leachate concentrate fails to be utilized directly as a liquid organic fertilizer due to its low hs content but high salinity thus effective fractionation and extraction of the hs will be of strong interest recovery of humic acids has been investigated through chemical precipitation but the recovered humic acids were not further examined for their fertilizer effect iskander et al 2019 another recovery strategy is based on membrane filtration specifically nanofiltration nf membranes with pore sizes of 0 5 2 nm or molecular weight cut offs mwcos of 200 1000 da have been considered as an advanced separation and purification tool in fractionation of the saline liquor with high concentrations of organic matters based on the synergistic effect of size exclusion and donnan repulsion capelle et al 2002 wang and tang 2011 xie and xu 2011 chidambaram et al 2015 woods et al 2016 tan et al 2018 the commonly used commercial nf membranes e g utc 60 mwco 150 da from toray nf 90 mwco 200 da and nf 270 mwco 250 da from dow filmtec dk mwco 300 da from osmonics and np030 mwco 400 da from microdyn nadir all have tight surface structures resulting in the moderate rejections of ofmonovalent salts i e nacl and almost complete rejections of divalent salts i e na2so4 and mgso4 these tight nf membranes could compromise the fractionation and desalination of the leachate concentrate for producing water soluble fertilizer because the high salt rejection not only deteriorates the membrane flux due to the increasing trans membrane osmotic pressure van der bruggen et al 2001 but also potentially results in an excessively increasing salt concentration in leachate concentrate when the nf concentration step is applied for desalination wang et al 2002 in contrast ultrafiltration uf membranes have large pore sizes and allow for a nearly free passage of inorganic salts and thus fail to effectively fractionate the hs and inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate because of the insufficient rejection of the hs with small molecular weights from 300 to 3000 da therefore an advanced fractionation strategy should be developed by taking advantage of both nf and uf membranes for sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate in this study a loose nf membrane with an mwco of 860 da was employed for fractionation of the landfill leachate concentrate and consequent recovery of the hs as a water soluble fertilizer the retention behavior of the loose nf membrane was systematically investigated under different operation conditions i e cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and ph to understand its applicability in sustainable treatment of the leachate concentrate liquor additionally the concentration process of the leachate concentrate liquor by the loose nf membrane was specifically designed for desalination of leachate concentrate and harvesting the hs finally the plant metabolism test was performed to investigate the efficacy of the recovered hs solution as fertilizer the objective of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the loose nf technology for recovering the hs as an organic fertilizer from the leachate concentrate liquor and to encourage further efforts towards the potential industrial application of this technology in view of sustainable management of high salinity leachate concentrate streams 2 experimental 2 1 landfill leachate concentrate and membrane the landfill leachate concentrate used in this study was sampled from a full scale leachate treatment plant in fuzhou city fujian province china in which an integrated mbr and nf process was applied with a daily treatment capacity of 1500 m3 in the landfill leachate treatment plant the leachate was treated via mbr to remove organic matters and heavy metals subsequently the biologically treated leachate was further treated by a nf membrane with a mwco of 300 da to meet the discharge standard in china ultimately the nf leachate concentrate was generated and collected in a concentrate tank at room temperature the properties of the leachate concentrate are shown in table s1 of supplementary information si only trace amounts of heavy metal ions such as cr co and ni were observed in the leachate concentrate after the treatment of the integrated mbr and nf process the other heavy metal ions i e ba pb cu zn cd and as were not detected this presents a low toxicity for ecosystem underlining the potential of leachate concentrate as a water soluble fertilizer a thin film composite loose nf membrane with polyamide chemistry sepro nf 6 mwco 860 da was kindly supplied by ultura usa due to the loose surface structure this nf membrane has a high water permeability i e 14 1 0 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a low salt rejection i e 8 9 for 1 0 g l 1 nacl at 25 c at ph 7 the zeta potential of the nf membrane is 40 mv 2 2 filtration performance test the filtration performance of the loose nf membrane for the leachate concentrate solution was investigated with a cross flow permeation cell with an effective area of 22 9 cm2 fig s1 lin et al 2016a b fig s2 shows the flowchart of the methodology applied in this study firstly initial filtration experiments were conducted with single salt solutions at different operating pressures and concentrations secondly the filtration of leachate concentrate was carried out at different operation conditions i e cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and feed ph both the retentate and permeate were recirculated into the feed tank to keep the feed concentration constant prior to the filtration experiments the nf membrane was pre compacted with pure water at 8 bar and 26 c for 1 h to stabilize the membrane flux afterwards a concentration process by the loose nf membrane in a batch mode was designed to desalinate the leachate concentrate for recovery of the hs as a water soluble fertilizer briefly a ca 2000 ml leachate concentrate solution as the feed was concentrated by a factor of 9 6 at 6 bar and 26 c the permeate stream was collected in a permeate tank the feed and permeate were sampled at a fixed interval for the measurement of the solute rejection the permeation flux j and rejection coefficient r of the nf membrane were determined by equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 j v a t 2 r c f c p c f 100 where v is the volume of water collected during a fixed time interval t and a is the effective membrane area c f and c p are the concentration of the solutes in the feed and permeate respectively 2 3 simulation for concentration of leachate concentrate by loose nf in the concentration step of the leachate concentrate the presence of the hs and inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate is a critical indicator for fertilizer applications to verify the contents of these solutes i e hs and inorganic salts a simulation for concentration of the leachate concentrate by the loose nf membrane was performed the content c t of the hs and inorganic salts in the nf concentration step can be estimated as ye et al 2018 3 c t c 0 η r i where c 0 is the initial concentration of the hs or inorganic salts in the concentration step η is the concentration factor of the feed solution defined as the ratio of the initial feed volume v 0 to the ultimate volume v t during the concentration step and r i is the observed rejection coefficient of component i in the concentration step 2 4 metabolism test of plant with recovered hs fertilizer the metabolism test of the plants is critical to assess the efficacy of the recovered hs as a water soluble fertilizer through concentration and desalination by the loose nf membrane the plant metabolism test was evaluated by germination and growth of mungbean seeds due to their fast growth rates firstly two green mungbean seeds were transplanted to a pot filled with 0 25 kg natural siliceous sands i e 12 2 1 mixture of siliceous sands with sizes of 0 6 1 5 and 3 0 mm and covered by the siliceous sands to prevent the seeds from drying and then the treated leachate concentrate through concentration and desalination by the loose nf membrane was diluted into different concentrations i e 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l 1 hs as the fertilizer for irrigating the green mungbean seeds a 50 ml solution was applied to irrigate the green mungbean seeds for each day due to the water evaporation under the sunlight exposure after the development of first trifoliolate leaf for the control samples the experiment was terminated the elongation and weight of the roots and shoots of the green sumgbean plants were then measured to determine the plant metabolism for evaluating the phytotoxicity of the treated landfill leachate concentrate as the water soluble fertilizer in this experiment each treatment was replicated for six times 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of cations i e na k mg and ca and heavy metals were determined through icp oes optima 3000 perkin elmer inc usa the measurement of anions i e cl no3 no2 and so4 2 was performed by ion chromatography ic 881 compact mehrohm swiss the concentration of the hs was measured in terms of total organic carbon toc using a toc analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu japan the conductivity of the feed and permeate stream was measured by a thermo scientific orion star a212 benchtop conductivity meter orion usa the determination of uv254 value was carried out by a uv 1780 ultraviolet spectrophotometer shimadzu japan it is worth noting that a univariate linear regression was applied to evaluate the significant effect of operating parameters i e cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and feed ph on the hs rejection and the significant effect of the hs dosage on the plant metabolism through p value a p value of less than 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 filtration of inorganic salts to recover the hs from a leachate concentrate as a water soluble fertilizer a high permeation of salts through the loose nf membrane is critically important because it can reduce the accumulation of the inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate thus enhancing the membrane flux the results show that the rejections of inorganic salts decreased with the salt concentrations fig 1 a this is mainly attributed to the lower electrostatic repulsion through reducing the debye length of electrostatic interaction between the solute and charges of the membrane at a higher ionic strength the loose nf membrane has a considerably larger pore radius compared to the hydrated radii of common ions i e na k nh4 mg2 ca2 cl no2 no3 and so4 2 nightingale 1959 therefore the electrostatic repulsion effect plays a critical role in the salt retention resulting in higher rejections of the divalent ions than those of the monovalent ions in this study the rejections of the monovalent salts i e na k cl and no3 as principal ion species in the leachate concentrate for the nf membrane were lower than 5 3 at high concentrations compared to tight nf membranes i e utc 60 from toray nf 90 from dow filmtec ds5 dk from osmonics ne90 from saehan and np030 from microdyn nadir reported in previous studies koyuncu 2002 van der bruggen et al 2001 tang et al 2009 lin et al 2016a b the loose nf membrane used in this study has a lower salt rejection potentially leading to a reduced trans membrane osmotic pressure difference for enhancing the permeate flux the flux of the nf membrane in all the salt solutions was positively related to the operating pressure fig 1b this allows for enhanced rejections of inorganic salts through the dilution effect whereas the ions are electrically and sterically hindered for permeation the rejections of all the tested salts for the nf membrane could be well fitted by the spiegler kedem equation fig s3 and this is consistent with the data from other studies of tight nf membranes van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2002 wang et al 1997 however the rejections of the monovalent salts for the nf membrane did not substantially increase with increasing operating pressures for instance the rejections of nacl and kcl increased from 4 3 to 6 5 and from 3 5 to 6 0 respectively when the operating pressure increased from 2 to 7 bar such a high salt permeation of the loose nf membrane demonstrates its great potential in the treatment of the leachate concentrate 3 2 filtration of leachate concentrate the effects of the operating parameters including the cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and feed ph on the retention behavior of the nf membrane were systematically investigated 3 2 1 effects of cross flow rate the effects of the cross flow rate i e 60 100 140 180 220 and 260 l h 1 on the nf performance at 6 bar and 26 c were investigated during the filtration of the leachate concentrate fig 2 the rejections of the hs and ions increased with the increasing cross flow rates this is due to the reduction of concentration polarization through increasing the shear force across the nf membrane which can hinder the solute permeation through the membrane the rejection of the hs increased from 88 4 0 5 to 95 7 0 3 when the cross flow rate increased from 60 to 260 l h 1 fig 2a demonstrating that the significant improvement in the hs rejection is favorable for the recovery of the hs during the leachate concentrate treatment at high cross flow rates because of the loose structure on the membrane surface the inorganic salts easily permeate through the nf membrane reflected by the reduction in conductivity fig 2b for example the reduction in conductivity across the nf membrane was 4 2 0 5 at the cross flow rate of 60 l h 1 indicating the penetration of most of the inorganic salts through the nf membrane and further highlighting the importance of using a loose nf membrane in the hs recovery furthermore the enhanced reduction in conductivity with the cross flow rates can be expected due to the increasing salt rejections this is consistent with the case of the hs specifically the rejections of divalent ions i e mg2 ca2 and so4 2 in the leachate concentrate increased from 26 1 0 9 to 37 3 1 8 from 23 6 1 2 to 35 0 1 5 and from 35 3 1 1 to 46 3 1 8 respectively fig 2c however the rejections of the principal components i e mainly monovalent ions including na k cl no3 and no2 in the leachate concentrate slightly raised from 4 4 0 8 to 9 1 1 1 na from 5 3 0 7 to 10 1 0 7 k from 3 3 0 2 to 6 7 0 3 cl from 6 3 0 5 to 13 0 0 7 no3 and from 3 4 0 3 to 6 8 0 5 no2 respectively 3 2 2 effects of operating pressure the tested nf membrane has a loose surface structure which results in an acceptably high permeability in real applications to reduce the energy consumption a low operating pressure not higher than 7 bar was applied to treat the leachate concentrate and the tests were conducted at a cross flow rate of 260 l h 1 and 26 c an increase in operating pressure significantly enhanced the rejections of both the hs and ions fig 3 in general two competitive phenomena i e dilution effect and concentration polarization dominated the separation behavior of the solutes for the loose nf membrane under the conditions of increased operating pressure seidel et al 2001 lin et al 2016a b the permeation flux increased with the operating pressure thereby enhancing the dilution effect and reducing the effective solute concentration on the permeate side on the other hand the increasing operating pressure can intensify the degree of concentration polarization effect facilitating the transport of solutes through the nf membrane and thus compromising the solute rejection in practice the observed rejections of the solutes in the leachate concentrate are strongly dependent on the extent of each of those mechanisms the dilution effect dictates the rejections of the hs and salts over concentration polarization effect in the whole operating pressure range the impacts of the operating pressure on the solute rejections may be less pronounced at a higher operating pressure although a univariate linear regression between the operating pressure and hs rejection yields an extremely low p value 0 05 and demonstrates a statistically significant effect with acceptable errors taking the error bars for the hs rejection into consideration furthermore a slight increment ca 0 2 in the hs rejection was observed when the operating pressure increased from 6 to 7 bar fig 3a meanwhile the reduction in conductivity across the membrane slightly increased from 8 3 0 5 to 8 7 0 6 fig 3b which can be specifically demonstrated by the rejections of different ion species in fig 3c in the present study the optimal operating pressure for the treatment of the leachate concentrate by the loose nf membrane was determined to be 6 bar 3 2 3 effects of temperature the temperature of the leachate varies in a landfill and can affect the performance of membrane technology therefore the effects of temperature on the performance of the loose nf membrane were investigated from 23 c to 35 c as expected the solute rejections decreased with increasing temperature fig 4 this is mainly ascribed to two factors first the thermal expansion of the polyamide skin layer of the nf membrane is enhanced as the feed temperature increases resulting in an enlargement of membrane pores this can ultimately diminish the solute rejections dang et al 2014 similar phenomena were also reported for other polymeric nf membranes shen and schäfer 2015 sharma et al 2003 such as nf 270 from dow filmtec dl from osmonics and tfcs from koch during the filtration of trace organics second the elevated feed temperature can significantly enhance the diffusion coefficient of solutes allowing for a rapid permeation of the solutes through the nf membrane in this study the solution temperature has a more pronounced impact on the solute rejections the effects of solution temperature on the rejections of the hs and monovalent ions i e cl no2 and no3 can be negligible which is consistent with the previous studies dang et al 2014 the rejection of so4 2 decreased from 51 5 1 9 to 29 6 1 7 while the rejections of the hs and cl ions decreased from 96 3 0 3 to 92 0 0 4 and from 7 9 0 7 to 2 3 0 2 respectively over the range of tested temperatures fig 4c 3 2 4 effects of feed ph the landfill leachate not only has a complexity in composition but also shows a fluctuation in ph the effects of feed ph on the nf performance was investigated at 6 bar and cross flow rate of 260 l h 1 as expected the rejection of the hs for the loose nf membrane increased with ph due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the hs and membrane surface fig 5 a the zeta potential of the leachate concentrate decreases from 10 3 to 22 0 mv between ph 5 6 and 8 4 and the zeta potential of the nf membrane dropped from ca 11 0 to ca 62 9 mv fig s4 and fig s5 however the improvement in the hs rejection with increasing ph is within 2 1 i e rising from 94 3 0 4 to 96 4 0 2 indicating that the size exclusion effect might have dominated the hs retention behavior of the nf membrane during the filtration of the leachate concentrate although the electrostatic repulsion could be partially involved for enhancing the hs rejection this is consistent with the retention of inorganic ions fig 5b the increasing ph has a less pronounced effect for the nf membrane on the rejections of monovalent ions i e na k cl no2 and no3 because the loose surface structure of the nf membrane can substantially diminish the effect of electrostatic repulsion caused by the charge interaction between the membrane surface and monovalent ions in contrast the electrostatic repulsion effect had a moderate impact on the filtration of divalent ions for the nf membrane resulting in a greater improvement in the rejections of divalent ions i e ca2 mg2 and so4 2 the slight variation in the hs and ion rejection over the studied ph range indicates the strong applicability of the loose nf membrane as an alternative for sustainable treatment of the leachate concentrate stream 3 3 desalination of leachate concentrate and enrichment of hs by concentration process practically the content of the hs in the leachate concentrate should be at a high level to minimize the volume of the leachate concentrate streams for its facile transport with water soluble fertilizer purpose therefore a concentration process was designed based on the loose nf membrane for enrichment of the hs from the landfill leachate concentrate an increasing conductivity was observed with increasing concentration factors during the 980 min operation fig 6 most of the inorganic salts permeated through the loose nf membrane resulting in a slight increase in conductivity specifically the conductivity of the leachate concentrate increased by 28 4 from 10 11 to 12 56 ms cm 1 meanwhile the conductivity of the permeate increased by 25 7 which ranges from 9 26 to 11 02 ms cm 1 when the concentration factor reached 9 6 during the concentration process the content of the hs increased from 1735 to 15 287 mg l 1 at a concentration factor of 9 6 benefited from the sufficient rejection of the hs which increases from 95 5 to 97 1 fig 7 a and fig 7c the concentration of the inorganic salts slightly increased from 5590 to 7684 mg l 1 indicating a high salt permeation to facilitate the desalination of the leachate concentrate during the concentration process this is consistent with the conductivity measurement in fig 6 in particular the concentrations of cl and na as primary components in the leachate concentrate increased from 2723 to 2896 mg l 1 and from 1144 to 1693 mg l 1 respectively this indicates that the slight elevation of nacl content poses a negligible impact on soil salinity when the treated leachate concentrate is applied as a water soluble organic fertilizer the dashed curves in fig 7a and b represent the model calculations for the concentration process of the leachate concentrate based on equation 3 these model calculations show a good agreement with the experimental data using constant values of the rejection coefficient 96 1 for hs 3 8 for cl 9 1 for no3 3 5 for no2 40 2 for so4 2 14 6 for na 13 5 for k 36 2 for mg2 and 39 0 for ca2 these results also suggest that the simplified simulation through equation 3 can predict the quantity of the complicated components in the leachate concentrate with an acceptable error the rejections of the solutes in the leachate concentrate during the concentration process were highly variable fig 7c for instance the rejections of the cations including na k mg2 and ca2 increased with the concentration factor while the rejections of the anions i e cl no3 no2 and so4 2 dropped this is due to the fact that the elevated concentration of the hs carrying negative charges in the leachate concentrate allows for the binding of the cations to maintain the neutrality of the feed resulting in an enhanced rejection of the cations however the enhanced electrostatic repulsion caused by donnan effect significantly repels the anions reducing the rejection of the anions the rejection of divalent ion i e so4 2 decreased moderately from 45 2 to 29 6 due to the low salt rejection the loose nf membrane had an overall desalination efficiency of 85 7 during the concentration of the leachate concentrate fig 7c the removal efficiency of different ion species was 88 9 cl 87 6 no3 88 5 no2 71 7 so4 2 84 6 na 84 7 k 72 5 mg2 and 71 3 ca2 respectively a recovery efficiency of 91 8 for the hs was obtained i e and 8 2 of the hs was lost with permeate a loose nanofiltration membrane cascade system may be used to improve the recovery efficiency in the future practical operation 3 4 plant metabolism test with recovered hs fertilizer to investigate the effectiveness of the recovered hs as a fertilizer the seed germination and elongation of roots and shoots of the green mungbean plants was performed fig 8 as demonstrated in fig 8a the supplementation of the recovered hs derived from the landfill leachate concentrate could promote the growth of the green mungbean plants with no phytotoxicity the green mungbean plants irrigated with the diluted hs solutions showed a more intensive propagation of lateral roots compared with the green mungbean plants grown in the control solution this is attributed to the important role of the hs in stimulating the root growth and enhancement of the root initiation during the plant metabolism arancon et al 2006 atiyeh et al 2002 nardi et al 2002 the height of the green mungbean plants shows a statistically significant increase by 54 7 i e from 16 05 1 75 to 24 83 1 68 cm for each plant with p 0 05 when the dosage of the recovered hs increased from 0 to 100 ppm fig 8b meanwhile the fresh weight for each green mungbean plant tremendously increased from 0 42 0 06 to 0 93 0 07 g with statistically linear increment of 121 4 p 0 05 fig 8c the elongation of both roots and shoots for the green mungbean plants was enhanced as well for example the length of the roots and shoots for each green mungbean plant increased from 8 75 1 16 to 12 47 1 53 cm and from 7 30 1 05 to 12 37 1 11 cm with increasing the dosage of the recovered hs from 0 to 100 ppm respectively the treated green mungbean plants have shown an increase by 282 7 in the fresh weight of the root i e increasing from 0 11 0 03 to 0 41 0 11 g the stimulatory effect of the hs on the shoot growth positively correlated to the root response as shown in fig 8c the fresh weight of the shoot for the treated green mungbean plant increased from 0 31 0 04 to 0 53 0 07 g with an increment of 67 7 therefore these results have demonstrated the great potential of the leachate concentrate derived hs as a water soluble fertilizer to promote the plant metabolism in practical applications 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the effective recovery of the hs from the leachate concentrate by a loose nf membrane and successful application of the recovered hs as a water soluble fertilizer for plant growth the results have important implications to further investigation of loose nf technology for sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate with the following conclusions the nf membrane with a loose surface structure allowed for a consistently low rejection 5 3 to the primary ionic species i e na k cl and no3 but effectively retained the humic substance showing a great potential in effective fractionation of humic substance and inorganic salt in the leachate concentrate increasing cross flow rates from 60 to 260 l h 1 resulted in an improvement of ca 7 3 in hs rejection mainly due to the reduced concentration polarization effect this signifies that increasing cross flow rate can be an effective strategy to improve the recovery of the hs in a practical application the solute rejection of the loose nf membrane was negatively dependent on the temperature the rejection of the hs decreased from 96 3 0 3 to 92 0 0 4 with increasing the temperature from 23 to 35 c which resulted from enlargement of membrane pore size and enhancement in solute diffusivity with the concentration process by the loose nf membrane at a factor of 9 6 91 2 of the hs can be harvested with a 85 7 salt removal efficiency in particular the concentration of the hs was enriched from 1735 to 15 287 mg l 1 in the future a continuous pilot scale demonstration based on the loose nf membrane for the treatment of the landfill leachate concentrate will be performed and optimized to further validate this technology from an environmental and economical perspective the recovered leachate concentrate derived hs can enhance the growth of the green mungbean plants for fertilizer application presenting no obvious phytotoxicity specifically the height and fresh weight for the green mungbean plant increased by 54 7 and by 121 4 when the dosage of the recovered hs was elevated from 0 to 100 ppm respectively declaration of interests the authors declare

18878,the hybrid membrane bioreactor nanofiltration treatment process can be an effective approach for treating the landfill leachate but the residual leachate concentrate highly loaded with the humic substance and salts remains an environmental concern herein a loose nanofiltration membrane molecular weight cut off of 860 da was used to recover the humic substance which can act as a key component of organic fertilizer from the leachate concentrate the loose nanofiltration membrane showed the high permeation fluxes and high transmissions 94 7 for most inorganic ions i e na k cl and no3 while retaining 95 7 0 3 of the humic substance demonstrating its great potential in effective fractionation of humic substance from inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate the operation conditions i e cross flow rates and temperatures had more pronounced impacts on the filtration performance of the loose nanofiltration membrane increasing cross flow rates from 60 to 260 l h 1 resulted in an improvement of ca 7 3 in the humic substance rejection mainly due to the reduced concentration polarization effect in contrast the solute rejection of the nanofiltration membrane was negatively dependent on the temperature the rejection of humic substance decreased from 96 3 0 3 to 92 0 0 4 with increasing the temperature from 23 to 35 c likely due to the enlargement of the membrane pore size and enhancement in solute diffusivity the humic substance was enriched from 1735 to 15 287 mg l 1 yielding a 91 2 recovery ratio with 85 7 desalination efficiency at a concentration factor of 9 6 the recovered hs had significantly stimulated the seed germination and growth of the green mungbean plants with no obvious phytotoxicity these results demonstrate that loose nanofiltration can be an effective promising technology to recover the humic substance as a valuable fertilizer component towards sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill leachate concentrate loose nanofiltration membrane fractionation humic substance recovery fertilizer sustainable management 1 introduction landfilling is an economical and widely practiced solution to management of municipal solid wastes a key challenge is that huge amounts of the landfill leachate are generated due to rainwater percolation organics biodegradation and physicochemical interactions during landfilling wang et al 2012 the landfill leachate is a strongly polluted complex stream containing large amounts of organic and inorganic contaminants i e humic substances ammonia nitrogen heavy metals xenobiotics and inorganic salts and poses detrimental hazards to the ecosystem and human health without appropriate treatment yuan et al 2017 yi et al 2017 the leachate can be treated by chemical physical and biological methods to reduce contaminant concentrations iskander et al 2018 an integrated process combining biodegradation and membrane filtration can effectively treat the landfill leachate to minimize the waste discharge ahmed and lan 2012 examples of such integration include a membrane bioreactor mbr and nanofiltration reverse osmosis which can meet the stringent effluent discharge standards due to the high efficiency for removal of contaminants e g ammonia nitrogen heavy metals and highly toxic pollutants and low energy consumption compared to the conventional strategies hu et al 2018 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 zolfaghari et al 2016 nevertheless the leachate concentrate generated in this hybrid process inevitably emerges as a key issue typically representing 15 30 of the incoming raw leachate calabrò et al 2010 the leachate concentrate is highly loaded with dissolved organic matters but has a low ratio of biological oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand cod indicating a poor biodegradability the elevated salinity of the leachate concentrate could also jeopardize the efficacy of biological degradation to minimize the impact of the leachate concentrate several conventional approaches including recirculation talalaj and biedka 2015 calabrò et al 2010 solidification stabilization hunce et al 2012 ince et al 2010 evaporation yang et al 2018 and coagulation qiu et al 2016 long et al 2017 aziz et al 2018 have been investigated recirculation of the leachate concentrate back to the landfill is the simplest method but it would result in accumulation of inorganic salts an increase in cod and enrichment of heavy metals calabrò et al 2010 solidification and evaporation may be the acceptable solutions to minimizing the volume of the leachate concentrate when the energy consumption and operation cost are not the major concerns hunce et al 2012 xu et al 2006 coagulation flocculation yields an insufficient removal of dissolved organic matters in the concentrated leachate calling for further treatment lessoued et al 2017 long et al 2017 chemical oxidation processes especially advanced oxidation are of increasing interest for removal of the refractory organic matters in the leachate concentrate at an expense of high energy demand and high chemical dosage jung et al 2017 ghazi et al 2014 oulego et al 2016 for sustainable waste management a conceptual paradigm shift is necessary to focus on resource recovery from the waste streams beyond contaminant removal clark et al 2016 he et al 2017 lin et al 2015a b mccarty et al 2011 kuriqi 2014 kuriqi et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 the leachate concentrate is rich in the humic substance hs i e humic acid and fulvic acid and it is an important component of an organic fertilizer for plant growth however the leachate concentrate fails to be utilized directly as a liquid organic fertilizer due to its low hs content but high salinity thus effective fractionation and extraction of the hs will be of strong interest recovery of humic acids has been investigated through chemical precipitation but the recovered humic acids were not further examined for their fertilizer effect iskander et al 2019 another recovery strategy is based on membrane filtration specifically nanofiltration nf membranes with pore sizes of 0 5 2 nm or molecular weight cut offs mwcos of 200 1000 da have been considered as an advanced separation and purification tool in fractionation of the saline liquor with high concentrations of organic matters based on the synergistic effect of size exclusion and donnan repulsion capelle et al 2002 wang and tang 2011 xie and xu 2011 chidambaram et al 2015 woods et al 2016 tan et al 2018 the commonly used commercial nf membranes e g utc 60 mwco 150 da from toray nf 90 mwco 200 da and nf 270 mwco 250 da from dow filmtec dk mwco 300 da from osmonics and np030 mwco 400 da from microdyn nadir all have tight surface structures resulting in the moderate rejections of ofmonovalent salts i e nacl and almost complete rejections of divalent salts i e na2so4 and mgso4 these tight nf membranes could compromise the fractionation and desalination of the leachate concentrate for producing water soluble fertilizer because the high salt rejection not only deteriorates the membrane flux due to the increasing trans membrane osmotic pressure van der bruggen et al 2001 but also potentially results in an excessively increasing salt concentration in leachate concentrate when the nf concentration step is applied for desalination wang et al 2002 in contrast ultrafiltration uf membranes have large pore sizes and allow for a nearly free passage of inorganic salts and thus fail to effectively fractionate the hs and inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate because of the insufficient rejection of the hs with small molecular weights from 300 to 3000 da therefore an advanced fractionation strategy should be developed by taking advantage of both nf and uf membranes for sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate in this study a loose nf membrane with an mwco of 860 da was employed for fractionation of the landfill leachate concentrate and consequent recovery of the hs as a water soluble fertilizer the retention behavior of the loose nf membrane was systematically investigated under different operation conditions i e cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and ph to understand its applicability in sustainable treatment of the leachate concentrate liquor additionally the concentration process of the leachate concentrate liquor by the loose nf membrane was specifically designed for desalination of leachate concentrate and harvesting the hs finally the plant metabolism test was performed to investigate the efficacy of the recovered hs solution as fertilizer the objective of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the loose nf technology for recovering the hs as an organic fertilizer from the leachate concentrate liquor and to encourage further efforts towards the potential industrial application of this technology in view of sustainable management of high salinity leachate concentrate streams 2 experimental 2 1 landfill leachate concentrate and membrane the landfill leachate concentrate used in this study was sampled from a full scale leachate treatment plant in fuzhou city fujian province china in which an integrated mbr and nf process was applied with a daily treatment capacity of 1500 m3 in the landfill leachate treatment plant the leachate was treated via mbr to remove organic matters and heavy metals subsequently the biologically treated leachate was further treated by a nf membrane with a mwco of 300 da to meet the discharge standard in china ultimately the nf leachate concentrate was generated and collected in a concentrate tank at room temperature the properties of the leachate concentrate are shown in table s1 of supplementary information si only trace amounts of heavy metal ions such as cr co and ni were observed in the leachate concentrate after the treatment of the integrated mbr and nf process the other heavy metal ions i e ba pb cu zn cd and as were not detected this presents a low toxicity for ecosystem underlining the potential of leachate concentrate as a water soluble fertilizer a thin film composite loose nf membrane with polyamide chemistry sepro nf 6 mwco 860 da was kindly supplied by ultura usa due to the loose surface structure this nf membrane has a high water permeability i e 14 1 0 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a low salt rejection i e 8 9 for 1 0 g l 1 nacl at 25 c at ph 7 the zeta potential of the nf membrane is 40 mv 2 2 filtration performance test the filtration performance of the loose nf membrane for the leachate concentrate solution was investigated with a cross flow permeation cell with an effective area of 22 9 cm2 fig s1 lin et al 2016a b fig s2 shows the flowchart of the methodology applied in this study firstly initial filtration experiments were conducted with single salt solutions at different operating pressures and concentrations secondly the filtration of leachate concentrate was carried out at different operation conditions i e cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and feed ph both the retentate and permeate were recirculated into the feed tank to keep the feed concentration constant prior to the filtration experiments the nf membrane was pre compacted with pure water at 8 bar and 26 c for 1 h to stabilize the membrane flux afterwards a concentration process by the loose nf membrane in a batch mode was designed to desalinate the leachate concentrate for recovery of the hs as a water soluble fertilizer briefly a ca 2000 ml leachate concentrate solution as the feed was concentrated by a factor of 9 6 at 6 bar and 26 c the permeate stream was collected in a permeate tank the feed and permeate were sampled at a fixed interval for the measurement of the solute rejection the permeation flux j and rejection coefficient r of the nf membrane were determined by equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 j v a t 2 r c f c p c f 100 where v is the volume of water collected during a fixed time interval t and a is the effective membrane area c f and c p are the concentration of the solutes in the feed and permeate respectively 2 3 simulation for concentration of leachate concentrate by loose nf in the concentration step of the leachate concentrate the presence of the hs and inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate is a critical indicator for fertilizer applications to verify the contents of these solutes i e hs and inorganic salts a simulation for concentration of the leachate concentrate by the loose nf membrane was performed the content c t of the hs and inorganic salts in the nf concentration step can be estimated as ye et al 2018 3 c t c 0 η r i where c 0 is the initial concentration of the hs or inorganic salts in the concentration step η is the concentration factor of the feed solution defined as the ratio of the initial feed volume v 0 to the ultimate volume v t during the concentration step and r i is the observed rejection coefficient of component i in the concentration step 2 4 metabolism test of plant with recovered hs fertilizer the metabolism test of the plants is critical to assess the efficacy of the recovered hs as a water soluble fertilizer through concentration and desalination by the loose nf membrane the plant metabolism test was evaluated by germination and growth of mungbean seeds due to their fast growth rates firstly two green mungbean seeds were transplanted to a pot filled with 0 25 kg natural siliceous sands i e 12 2 1 mixture of siliceous sands with sizes of 0 6 1 5 and 3 0 mm and covered by the siliceous sands to prevent the seeds from drying and then the treated leachate concentrate through concentration and desalination by the loose nf membrane was diluted into different concentrations i e 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l 1 hs as the fertilizer for irrigating the green mungbean seeds a 50 ml solution was applied to irrigate the green mungbean seeds for each day due to the water evaporation under the sunlight exposure after the development of first trifoliolate leaf for the control samples the experiment was terminated the elongation and weight of the roots and shoots of the green sumgbean plants were then measured to determine the plant metabolism for evaluating the phytotoxicity of the treated landfill leachate concentrate as the water soluble fertilizer in this experiment each treatment was replicated for six times 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of cations i e na k mg and ca and heavy metals were determined through icp oes optima 3000 perkin elmer inc usa the measurement of anions i e cl no3 no2 and so4 2 was performed by ion chromatography ic 881 compact mehrohm swiss the concentration of the hs was measured in terms of total organic carbon toc using a toc analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu japan the conductivity of the feed and permeate stream was measured by a thermo scientific orion star a212 benchtop conductivity meter orion usa the determination of uv254 value was carried out by a uv 1780 ultraviolet spectrophotometer shimadzu japan it is worth noting that a univariate linear regression was applied to evaluate the significant effect of operating parameters i e cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and feed ph on the hs rejection and the significant effect of the hs dosage on the plant metabolism through p value a p value of less than 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 filtration of inorganic salts to recover the hs from a leachate concentrate as a water soluble fertilizer a high permeation of salts through the loose nf membrane is critically important because it can reduce the accumulation of the inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate thus enhancing the membrane flux the results show that the rejections of inorganic salts decreased with the salt concentrations fig 1 a this is mainly attributed to the lower electrostatic repulsion through reducing the debye length of electrostatic interaction between the solute and charges of the membrane at a higher ionic strength the loose nf membrane has a considerably larger pore radius compared to the hydrated radii of common ions i e na k nh4 mg2 ca2 cl no2 no3 and so4 2 nightingale 1959 therefore the electrostatic repulsion effect plays a critical role in the salt retention resulting in higher rejections of the divalent ions than those of the monovalent ions in this study the rejections of the monovalent salts i e na k cl and no3 as principal ion species in the leachate concentrate for the nf membrane were lower than 5 3 at high concentrations compared to tight nf membranes i e utc 60 from toray nf 90 from dow filmtec ds5 dk from osmonics ne90 from saehan and np030 from microdyn nadir reported in previous studies koyuncu 2002 van der bruggen et al 2001 tang et al 2009 lin et al 2016a b the loose nf membrane used in this study has a lower salt rejection potentially leading to a reduced trans membrane osmotic pressure difference for enhancing the permeate flux the flux of the nf membrane in all the salt solutions was positively related to the operating pressure fig 1b this allows for enhanced rejections of inorganic salts through the dilution effect whereas the ions are electrically and sterically hindered for permeation the rejections of all the tested salts for the nf membrane could be well fitted by the spiegler kedem equation fig s3 and this is consistent with the data from other studies of tight nf membranes van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2002 wang et al 1997 however the rejections of the monovalent salts for the nf membrane did not substantially increase with increasing operating pressures for instance the rejections of nacl and kcl increased from 4 3 to 6 5 and from 3 5 to 6 0 respectively when the operating pressure increased from 2 to 7 bar such a high salt permeation of the loose nf membrane demonstrates its great potential in the treatment of the leachate concentrate 3 2 filtration of leachate concentrate the effects of the operating parameters including the cross flow rate operating pressure temperature and feed ph on the retention behavior of the nf membrane were systematically investigated 3 2 1 effects of cross flow rate the effects of the cross flow rate i e 60 100 140 180 220 and 260 l h 1 on the nf performance at 6 bar and 26 c were investigated during the filtration of the leachate concentrate fig 2 the rejections of the hs and ions increased with the increasing cross flow rates this is due to the reduction of concentration polarization through increasing the shear force across the nf membrane which can hinder the solute permeation through the membrane the rejection of the hs increased from 88 4 0 5 to 95 7 0 3 when the cross flow rate increased from 60 to 260 l h 1 fig 2a demonstrating that the significant improvement in the hs rejection is favorable for the recovery of the hs during the leachate concentrate treatment at high cross flow rates because of the loose structure on the membrane surface the inorganic salts easily permeate through the nf membrane reflected by the reduction in conductivity fig 2b for example the reduction in conductivity across the nf membrane was 4 2 0 5 at the cross flow rate of 60 l h 1 indicating the penetration of most of the inorganic salts through the nf membrane and further highlighting the importance of using a loose nf membrane in the hs recovery furthermore the enhanced reduction in conductivity with the cross flow rates can be expected due to the increasing salt rejections this is consistent with the case of the hs specifically the rejections of divalent ions i e mg2 ca2 and so4 2 in the leachate concentrate increased from 26 1 0 9 to 37 3 1 8 from 23 6 1 2 to 35 0 1 5 and from 35 3 1 1 to 46 3 1 8 respectively fig 2c however the rejections of the principal components i e mainly monovalent ions including na k cl no3 and no2 in the leachate concentrate slightly raised from 4 4 0 8 to 9 1 1 1 na from 5 3 0 7 to 10 1 0 7 k from 3 3 0 2 to 6 7 0 3 cl from 6 3 0 5 to 13 0 0 7 no3 and from 3 4 0 3 to 6 8 0 5 no2 respectively 3 2 2 effects of operating pressure the tested nf membrane has a loose surface structure which results in an acceptably high permeability in real applications to reduce the energy consumption a low operating pressure not higher than 7 bar was applied to treat the leachate concentrate and the tests were conducted at a cross flow rate of 260 l h 1 and 26 c an increase in operating pressure significantly enhanced the rejections of both the hs and ions fig 3 in general two competitive phenomena i e dilution effect and concentration polarization dominated the separation behavior of the solutes for the loose nf membrane under the conditions of increased operating pressure seidel et al 2001 lin et al 2016a b the permeation flux increased with the operating pressure thereby enhancing the dilution effect and reducing the effective solute concentration on the permeate side on the other hand the increasing operating pressure can intensify the degree of concentration polarization effect facilitating the transport of solutes through the nf membrane and thus compromising the solute rejection in practice the observed rejections of the solutes in the leachate concentrate are strongly dependent on the extent of each of those mechanisms the dilution effect dictates the rejections of the hs and salts over concentration polarization effect in the whole operating pressure range the impacts of the operating pressure on the solute rejections may be less pronounced at a higher operating pressure although a univariate linear regression between the operating pressure and hs rejection yields an extremely low p value 0 05 and demonstrates a statistically significant effect with acceptable errors taking the error bars for the hs rejection into consideration furthermore a slight increment ca 0 2 in the hs rejection was observed when the operating pressure increased from 6 to 7 bar fig 3a meanwhile the reduction in conductivity across the membrane slightly increased from 8 3 0 5 to 8 7 0 6 fig 3b which can be specifically demonstrated by the rejections of different ion species in fig 3c in the present study the optimal operating pressure for the treatment of the leachate concentrate by the loose nf membrane was determined to be 6 bar 3 2 3 effects of temperature the temperature of the leachate varies in a landfill and can affect the performance of membrane technology therefore the effects of temperature on the performance of the loose nf membrane were investigated from 23 c to 35 c as expected the solute rejections decreased with increasing temperature fig 4 this is mainly ascribed to two factors first the thermal expansion of the polyamide skin layer of the nf membrane is enhanced as the feed temperature increases resulting in an enlargement of membrane pores this can ultimately diminish the solute rejections dang et al 2014 similar phenomena were also reported for other polymeric nf membranes shen and schäfer 2015 sharma et al 2003 such as nf 270 from dow filmtec dl from osmonics and tfcs from koch during the filtration of trace organics second the elevated feed temperature can significantly enhance the diffusion coefficient of solutes allowing for a rapid permeation of the solutes through the nf membrane in this study the solution temperature has a more pronounced impact on the solute rejections the effects of solution temperature on the rejections of the hs and monovalent ions i e cl no2 and no3 can be negligible which is consistent with the previous studies dang et al 2014 the rejection of so4 2 decreased from 51 5 1 9 to 29 6 1 7 while the rejections of the hs and cl ions decreased from 96 3 0 3 to 92 0 0 4 and from 7 9 0 7 to 2 3 0 2 respectively over the range of tested temperatures fig 4c 3 2 4 effects of feed ph the landfill leachate not only has a complexity in composition but also shows a fluctuation in ph the effects of feed ph on the nf performance was investigated at 6 bar and cross flow rate of 260 l h 1 as expected the rejection of the hs for the loose nf membrane increased with ph due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the hs and membrane surface fig 5 a the zeta potential of the leachate concentrate decreases from 10 3 to 22 0 mv between ph 5 6 and 8 4 and the zeta potential of the nf membrane dropped from ca 11 0 to ca 62 9 mv fig s4 and fig s5 however the improvement in the hs rejection with increasing ph is within 2 1 i e rising from 94 3 0 4 to 96 4 0 2 indicating that the size exclusion effect might have dominated the hs retention behavior of the nf membrane during the filtration of the leachate concentrate although the electrostatic repulsion could be partially involved for enhancing the hs rejection this is consistent with the retention of inorganic ions fig 5b the increasing ph has a less pronounced effect for the nf membrane on the rejections of monovalent ions i e na k cl no2 and no3 because the loose surface structure of the nf membrane can substantially diminish the effect of electrostatic repulsion caused by the charge interaction between the membrane surface and monovalent ions in contrast the electrostatic repulsion effect had a moderate impact on the filtration of divalent ions for the nf membrane resulting in a greater improvement in the rejections of divalent ions i e ca2 mg2 and so4 2 the slight variation in the hs and ion rejection over the studied ph range indicates the strong applicability of the loose nf membrane as an alternative for sustainable treatment of the leachate concentrate stream 3 3 desalination of leachate concentrate and enrichment of hs by concentration process practically the content of the hs in the leachate concentrate should be at a high level to minimize the volume of the leachate concentrate streams for its facile transport with water soluble fertilizer purpose therefore a concentration process was designed based on the loose nf membrane for enrichment of the hs from the landfill leachate concentrate an increasing conductivity was observed with increasing concentration factors during the 980 min operation fig 6 most of the inorganic salts permeated through the loose nf membrane resulting in a slight increase in conductivity specifically the conductivity of the leachate concentrate increased by 28 4 from 10 11 to 12 56 ms cm 1 meanwhile the conductivity of the permeate increased by 25 7 which ranges from 9 26 to 11 02 ms cm 1 when the concentration factor reached 9 6 during the concentration process the content of the hs increased from 1735 to 15 287 mg l 1 at a concentration factor of 9 6 benefited from the sufficient rejection of the hs which increases from 95 5 to 97 1 fig 7 a and fig 7c the concentration of the inorganic salts slightly increased from 5590 to 7684 mg l 1 indicating a high salt permeation to facilitate the desalination of the leachate concentrate during the concentration process this is consistent with the conductivity measurement in fig 6 in particular the concentrations of cl and na as primary components in the leachate concentrate increased from 2723 to 2896 mg l 1 and from 1144 to 1693 mg l 1 respectively this indicates that the slight elevation of nacl content poses a negligible impact on soil salinity when the treated leachate concentrate is applied as a water soluble organic fertilizer the dashed curves in fig 7a and b represent the model calculations for the concentration process of the leachate concentrate based on equation 3 these model calculations show a good agreement with the experimental data using constant values of the rejection coefficient 96 1 for hs 3 8 for cl 9 1 for no3 3 5 for no2 40 2 for so4 2 14 6 for na 13 5 for k 36 2 for mg2 and 39 0 for ca2 these results also suggest that the simplified simulation through equation 3 can predict the quantity of the complicated components in the leachate concentrate with an acceptable error the rejections of the solutes in the leachate concentrate during the concentration process were highly variable fig 7c for instance the rejections of the cations including na k mg2 and ca2 increased with the concentration factor while the rejections of the anions i e cl no3 no2 and so4 2 dropped this is due to the fact that the elevated concentration of the hs carrying negative charges in the leachate concentrate allows for the binding of the cations to maintain the neutrality of the feed resulting in an enhanced rejection of the cations however the enhanced electrostatic repulsion caused by donnan effect significantly repels the anions reducing the rejection of the anions the rejection of divalent ion i e so4 2 decreased moderately from 45 2 to 29 6 due to the low salt rejection the loose nf membrane had an overall desalination efficiency of 85 7 during the concentration of the leachate concentrate fig 7c the removal efficiency of different ion species was 88 9 cl 87 6 no3 88 5 no2 71 7 so4 2 84 6 na 84 7 k 72 5 mg2 and 71 3 ca2 respectively a recovery efficiency of 91 8 for the hs was obtained i e and 8 2 of the hs was lost with permeate a loose nanofiltration membrane cascade system may be used to improve the recovery efficiency in the future practical operation 3 4 plant metabolism test with recovered hs fertilizer to investigate the effectiveness of the recovered hs as a fertilizer the seed germination and elongation of roots and shoots of the green mungbean plants was performed fig 8 as demonstrated in fig 8a the supplementation of the recovered hs derived from the landfill leachate concentrate could promote the growth of the green mungbean plants with no phytotoxicity the green mungbean plants irrigated with the diluted hs solutions showed a more intensive propagation of lateral roots compared with the green mungbean plants grown in the control solution this is attributed to the important role of the hs in stimulating the root growth and enhancement of the root initiation during the plant metabolism arancon et al 2006 atiyeh et al 2002 nardi et al 2002 the height of the green mungbean plants shows a statistically significant increase by 54 7 i e from 16 05 1 75 to 24 83 1 68 cm for each plant with p 0 05 when the dosage of the recovered hs increased from 0 to 100 ppm fig 8b meanwhile the fresh weight for each green mungbean plant tremendously increased from 0 42 0 06 to 0 93 0 07 g with statistically linear increment of 121 4 p 0 05 fig 8c the elongation of both roots and shoots for the green mungbean plants was enhanced as well for example the length of the roots and shoots for each green mungbean plant increased from 8 75 1 16 to 12 47 1 53 cm and from 7 30 1 05 to 12 37 1 11 cm with increasing the dosage of the recovered hs from 0 to 100 ppm respectively the treated green mungbean plants have shown an increase by 282 7 in the fresh weight of the root i e increasing from 0 11 0 03 to 0 41 0 11 g the stimulatory effect of the hs on the shoot growth positively correlated to the root response as shown in fig 8c the fresh weight of the shoot for the treated green mungbean plant increased from 0 31 0 04 to 0 53 0 07 g with an increment of 67 7 therefore these results have demonstrated the great potential of the leachate concentrate derived hs as a water soluble fertilizer to promote the plant metabolism in practical applications 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the effective recovery of the hs from the leachate concentrate by a loose nf membrane and successful application of the recovered hs as a water soluble fertilizer for plant growth the results have important implications to further investigation of loose nf technology for sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate with the following conclusions the nf membrane with a loose surface structure allowed for a consistently low rejection 5 3 to the primary ionic species i e na k cl and no3 but effectively retained the humic substance showing a great potential in effective fractionation of humic substance and inorganic salt in the leachate concentrate increasing cross flow rates from 60 to 260 l h 1 resulted in an improvement of ca 7 3 in hs rejection mainly due to the reduced concentration polarization effect this signifies that increasing cross flow rate can be an effective strategy to improve the recovery of the hs in a practical application the solute rejection of the loose nf membrane was negatively dependent on the temperature the rejection of the hs decreased from 96 3 0 3 to 92 0 0 4 with increasing the temperature from 23 to 35 c which resulted from enlargement of membrane pore size and enhancement in solute diffusivity with the concentration process by the loose nf membrane at a factor of 9 6 91 2 of the hs can be harvested with a 85 7 salt removal efficiency in particular the concentration of the hs was enriched from 1735 to 15 287 mg l 1 in the future a continuous pilot scale demonstration based on the loose nf membrane for the treatment of the landfill leachate concentrate will be performed and optimized to further validate this technology from an environmental and economical perspective the recovered leachate concentrate derived hs can enhance the growth of the green mungbean plants for fertilizer application presenting no obvious phytotoxicity specifically the height and fresh weight for the green mungbean plant increased by 54 7 and by 121 4 when the dosage of the recovered hs was elevated from 0 to 100 ppm respectively declaration of interests the authors declare

with antimicrobial properties that is non toxic and stable over time fig 1 laboratory testing suggested that the antimicrobial hand towel hereafter referred to as treated towel may help remove e coli contamination from hands but field testing to evaluate the impact of the treated towels on populations living in fecally contaminated environments was needed in this study we examined whether use of the treated hand towels effectively reduced e coli contamination on maternal hands through two randomized crossover trials in rural and peri urban settings in western kenya 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design we selected a population of 125 households to participate in two field trials the first trial was a double blinded placebo controlled crossover trial to examine the effectiveness of the treated towel fig 1 compared to an identical untreated placebo towel hereafter referred to as untreated towel in daily use through surprise home visits the second trial was a triple crossover trial in three rounds to explore the treated towel s effectiveness immediately following handwashing under more controlled conditions 2 2 study population the trials took place in households in peri urban and rural neighborhoods in kisumu county kenya from july 2011 january 2012 during 2008 09 kisumu county had the mortality rate for children under five years old 74 deaths per 1000 live births and had the highest burden of diarrheal diseases in kenya kenya national bureau of statistics 2010 2 3 sample size calculation to calculate the sample size required for the study we assumed that at least 40 of mothers using the treated towels would have at least one log10 reduction of e coli on their hands compared to baseline and that mothers using untreated towels would have no reduction of e coli using these assumptions a confidence level of 95 and power of 80 we calculated a sample size of 40 persons for each of the intervention and comparison groups 80 persons in total in trial 1 to account for attrition of 10 and the possible impact of a lack of adherence to recommended use of treated towels on the effectiveness of the intervention we increased the estimated sample size by 50 thus 60 persons were recruited for each group yielding a total study recruitment of 120 persons 2 4 sample selection in july 2011 we randomly selected twelve census enumeration areas eas in kisumu county for the treated towel evaluation using a full list of all eas in kisumu county we generated random numbers and after sorting the numbers in a descending order selected the top 12 eas we then conducted a census of households in these 12 eas and similarly selected a random sample of approximately 10 mothers each with at least one child under five years of age from each ea enrolling a total of 125 mothers 2 5 trial 1 trial 1 was conducted from july to october 2011 to determine whether daily use of the treated towel reduced e coli contamination of hands following handwashing fig 2 we first conducted a baseline survey of 125 participants interviewing each participant regarding household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics handwashing practices and observations on the presence of soap and handwashing technique following the interview we examined participants hands for e coli using the glove juice method detailed below as baseline measures gave each participant a free bar of soap and provided instructions on proper handwashing technique including the key times for handwashing next the 125 participants received three weekly unannounced home visits to obtain baseline measures participants were then randomly assigned into two groups random numbers were generated after sorting the first half was allocated into a and the rest into b one group received a treated towel plus soap and the other group received an untreated towel plus soap participants were encouraged to use the towels after handwashing and whenever they needed to wipe or dry their hands treated and untreated towels were identical in size shape and color and towels were distributed in a double blind fashion i e neither the research team nor recipients knew which towel was received except one investigator once a week for a three week period round 1 the field team made a surprise home visit at random times each week to each of the enrolled women and obtained a hand rinse sample for e coli testing after the 3rd visit the towels provided to groups a and b were removed from the homes we then gave each group the type of towel they had not received for round 1 as well as 1 bar of soap after a one week washout period we resumed weekly visits to obtain hand rinse samples from enrolled women for a three week period round 2 a total of nine visits three for baseline three for round 1 and three for round 2 were made per household we also conducted a qualitative study of towel use among 52 participants randomly selected from a household list at the end of round 1 or 2 selected participants were invited to have an in depth interview idi if a woman declined we continued to the next names on the list until a participant agreed to participate field team members included a senior behavioral scientist and research assistants with previous qualitative research experience within the communities where the study was conducted after trial 1 treated towels and soap were distributed to the participants and they were encouraged to continue good hand hygiene practices 2 6 trial 2 we conducted trial 2 in january 2012 to compare three handwashing drying methods under more controlled conditions fig 2 for this study 65 participants were randomly selected from the 125 mothers enrolled at baseline given a free antimicrobial towel and provided a refresher training on proper handwashing technique and towel use participants were randomized into three groups a b or c we made one surprise home visit to each mother during each of the three rounds asked mothers to wash and dry their hands using the method indicated for that visit and obtained hand rinse samples immediately afterward the three methods were 1 soap and water sw air dry 2 sw treated towel and 3 water only treated towel for each round each group of mothers was assigned a different handwashing and drying method by the end of the study each mother had used and had hand rinse samples tested for each of the three methods 2 7 hand rinse sample collection participants hands were tested for e coli using a modified glove juice method https globalhandwashing org fig 3 in the laboratory whirl pak fort atkinson wi usa bags were aseptically filled with 150 ml of sterile distilled water eluent and closed securely bags were carried in coolers to households where the hand rinses were conducted a participant was asked to place one hand into the bag and use the other hand to secure the bag around her wrist the sample collector then gently massaged the entire surface below the wrist of the hand inside the bag for 30 s this was repeated within the same bag with the participant s other hand the sample bag was then secured and transported in a cooler on ice to the laboratory where it was processed within 8 h of collection 2 8 escherichia coli testing in the laboratory each sample bag was gently mixed by inverting and 100 ml poured into sterile plastic bottles in addition a 1 100 dilution of sample was prepared in sterile distilled water e coli in rinse samples were quantified using idexx quantitray 2000 westbrook me usa most probable number mpn methodology and colilert 18 media according to manufacturer s instructions positive controls eluent water seeded with a lab strain of e coli and lab blanks eluent water only were assayed each sampling day to validate test performance and to ensure lack of contamination in eluent water respectively each sample was assigned into one of three categories based on estimated mpn of e coli in 100 ml of hand rinse eluent undetectable 1 mpn moderately

statistical analyses were done using sas v9 4 cary nc usa differences in demographic socioeconomic characteristics and hand hygiene practices between households included and excluded at baseline in each study were examined using chi square test for categorical variables fisher s exact test was used for small sample sizes t test or wilcoxon rank sum test were used as appropriate for continuous

was applied treating the three contamination levels as an ordinal outcome variable and the handwashing drying method sw air dry sw towel or water only towel as an exposure variable the standard handwashing method sw air dry was set as a reference category we examined covariates including mothers age 20 20 to 26 26 years education level completed primary or less secondary or higher having electricity at household yes or no having children 2 under five years old 1 or 0 observed latrine at home yes or no and having an improved water source including borehole rain water catchment covered well piped water protected spring yes or no for both trials in addition to address possible correlations from the repeated home visits in the same household we used the generalized estimating equation approach to analyze the data liang and zeger 1986 in the idi of trial 1 audio recordings and handwritten field notes were used for data collection from 52 participants and then reviewed during debriefing sessions data were transcribed and translated into english by bilingual research assistants and entered as microsoft word documents into atlas ti atlasti com to facilitate text searching

used soap water air dry to 19 1 when using soap water treated towel to 18 5 when using water only treated towel the odds of maternal hands exhibiting a higher level of e coli contamination were not statistically different among the three handwashing and drying methods used by participants table 6 similarly no covariates were associated with detectable e coli contamination on participants hands 4 discussion findings from these field studies suggested that use of antimicrobial towels for drying did not reduce the odds of e coli contamination on mothers hands compared to use of untreated towels the use of treated towels did not reduce the level of contamination observed during random hand testing a result that has been observed in at least three other studies of handwashing with soap pickering et al 2010 2011 ram et al 2011 slayton et al 2016 nor did they confer an advantage when microbiologic testing was conducted immediately following handwashing there are several possible explanations for the lack of effectiveness of the treated towel in decreasing e coli contamination of maternal hands first the treated towels themselves might have acted as fomites although similar technology used in treated towels has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have antimicrobial properties gerba et al 2012 bacterial colonization of towels may have taken place during household use in the fecally contaminated environments of study communities slayton et al 2016 and the towels may have reintroduced e coli to participants hands between handwashing and hand rinse sampling this potential explanation however does not explain the findings in trial 2 in which air drying after washing with soap and water did not diminish contamination compared to treated towel use after washing with soap and water second it is possible that the handwashing technique among study participants was poor and facilitated recontamination for example total removal of e coli may not occur after handwashing because some organisms may lie beyond the reach of handwashing e g under fingernails however women were given instructions for proper handwashing at the beginning of both studies and in both studies handwashing technique was observed before collecting the hand rinse samples and found to be adequate finally the water used for handwashing in these homes may have been contaminated with e coli which could have contributed to hand recontamination during rinsing at least one other study has found an association between stored water quality and hand contamination pickering et al 2010 unlike that study which took place in an area of tanzania where participants used improved water sources i e bottled borewell or municipal tap most of our study participants reported unsafe water storage practices and one fifth reported using unimproved water sources the results of this evaluation are consistent with studies of handwashing with antimicrobial soap that have shown no difference in bacterial contamination of hands and no health impact compared to untreated soap luby et al 2004 2005 aiello et al 2007 despite other studies that suggested that use of antimicrobial soap reduced bacterial contamination paulson 1994 sickbert bennett et al 2004 furthermore in trial 2 use of the treated towel following handwashing with soap and water did not perform better than use of treated towel following handwashing with water alone results of studies of antimicrobial soap and hand towels do not justify widespread promotion of these products which tend to be more expensive than traditional alternatives aiello et al 2007 slayton et al 2016 further evaluation is necessary to determine whether other types of health benefits are obtained from use of treated towels the importance of hygienic hand drying to effective handwashing has not been adequately addressed snelling et al 2011 huang et al 2012 person et al 2013 although inexpensive towels or cloths are readily available in most settings safe use requires frequent washing and consequently multiple towels in each household to ensure availability gerba et al 2014 which may be challenging for low income families with limited disposable income and time schilling et al 2013 similarly use of disposable towels is not economically sustainable for many families in the developing world more research into novel hand drying technologies or implementation approaches is needed this study had several important limitations first placement of treated towels in the household which we did not systematically observe during all visits may have influenced study results several women in idis said they kept the towels in the most accessible places such as the kitchen or on the wall towels located in kitchens might have been used not only for hand drying but also during food preparation cooking or wiping surfaces and could have resulted in increased contamination and transmission of bacteria to maternal hands gerba et al 2014 second frequency of towel washing which has been correlated to degree of contamination with e coli gerba et al 2014 might have affected microbiological results in trial 1 towels were observed to be dirty in more than a third of home visits but we excluded observable dirtiness of towels as a covariable in our analysis because of a high missing rate it appears that although the antimicrobial towels were designed to reduce the need for washing towel cleanliness continues to be important for effective hand hygiene third we did not obtain data on the activities of mothers immediately before towel use or handwashing such as changing babies nappies which could have affected the results we addressed the difficulty of adequately identifying the many behaviors that potentially could have contaminated the towel by using a randomized double blinded crossover design to reduce inter subject variability fourth we excluded participants who had two or more missing home visits per round in trial 1 which could have contributed to selection bias the missing home visits occurred because of our study design i e the visits took place at random times during the day some women went to market days or moved away which were independent of hand hygiene efficacy in a separate sensitivity analysis including those who only had one visit per round the results remained similar data not shown fifth by design in trial 2 we did not observe the method women used for handwashing and drying between our visits although the women were given a treated towel to use they could have used their habitual drying method instead which would have confounded the microbiological results finally because the study population was limited to a relatively small sample of 125 mothers or less in kisumu county the results may not be generalizable to other similar populations in addition only 65 mothers included in trial 2 was subject to the decreased statistical power 5 conclusion this study aimed at investigating the potential use of the antimicrobial hand towels to reduce e coli contamination on maternal hands results presented in this study did not support a direct association between treated towel use and reduced e coli contamination on maternal hands under field conditions in western kenyan communities considering the absence of effective novel technologies for hand drying and the likelihood that air drying is inconsistently practiced hand drying methods remain an important component of hand hygiene however for hand towel use to improve hand hygiene towel cleanliness can only be ensured through regular washing and drying hand drying has not typically been considered in studies of the impact of hand hygiene on health but deserves increased attention in

kenya largely because clean materials for hand drying are often unavailable in one study performed in western kenya investigators observed that despite widespread promotion of air drying after washing hands people wiped their hands both while dirty and after handwashing on available clothing waistcloths curtains or rags person et al 2013 wet hands transfer microbes more readily than dry hands and although drying hands on a clean towel can help remove microbes by creating friction the use of contaminated cloth can compromise the benefits of handwashing patrick et al 1997 soiled fabric and damp materials has been linked to the spread of bacterial viral and fungal infections sehulster et al 2003 to address the hand drying problem vestergaard www vestergaard com developed a 30 40 cm hand towel with antimicrobial properties that is non toxic and stable over time fig 1 laboratory testing suggested that the antimicrobial hand towel hereafter referred to as treated towel may help remove e coli contamination from hands but field testing to evaluate the impact of the treated towels on populations living in fecally contaminated environments was needed in this study we examined whether use of the treated hand towels effectively reduced e coli contamination on maternal hands through two randomized crossover trials in rural and peri urban settings in western kenya 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design we selected a population of 125 households to participate in two field trials the first trial was a double blinded placebo controlled crossover trial to examine the effectiveness of the treated towel fig 1 compared to an identical untreated placebo towel hereafter referred to as untreated towel in daily use through surprise home visits the second trial was a triple crossover trial in three rounds to explore the treated towel s effectiveness immediately following handwashing under more controlled conditions 2 2 study population the trials took place in households in peri urban and rural neighborhoods in kisumu county kenya from july 2011 january 2012 during 2008 09 kisumu county had the mortality rate for children under five years old 74 deaths per 1000 live births and had the highest burden of diarrheal diseases in kenya kenya national bureau of statistics 2010 2 3 sample size calculation to calculate the sample size required for the study we assumed that at least 40 of mothers using the treated towels would have at least one log10 reduction of e coli on their hands compared to baseline and that mothers using untreated towels would have no reduction of e coli using these assumptions a confidence level of 95 and power of 80 we calculated a sample size of 40 persons for each of the intervention and comparison groups 80 persons in total in trial 1 to account for attrition of 10 and the possible impact of a lack of adherence to recommended use of treated towels on the effectiveness of the intervention we increased the estimated sample size by 50 thus 60 persons were recruited for each group yielding a total study recruitment of 120 persons 2 4 sample selection in july 2011 we randomly selected twelve census enumeration areas eas in kisumu county for the treated towel evaluation using a full list of all eas in kisumu county we generated random numbers and after sorting the numbers in a descending order selected the top 12 eas we then conducted a census of households in these 12 eas and similarly selected a random sample of approximately 10 mothers each with at least one child under five years of age from each ea enrolling a total of 125 mothers 2 5 trial 1 trial 1 was conducted from july to october 2011 to determine whether daily use of the treated towel reduced e coli contamination of hands following handwashing fig 2 we first conducted a baseline survey of 125 participants interviewing each participant regarding household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics handwashing practices and observations on the presence of soap and handwashing technique following the interview we examined participants hands for e coli using the glove juice method detailed below as baseline measures gave each participant a free bar of soap and provided instructions on proper handwashing technique including the key times for handwashing next the 125 participants received three weekly unannounced home visits to obtain baseline measures participants were then randomly assigned into two groups random numbers were generated after sorting the first half was allocated into a and the rest into b one group received a treated towel plus soap and the other group received an untreated towel plus soap participants were encouraged to use the towels after handwashing and whenever they needed to wipe or dry their hands treated and untreated towels were identical in size shape and color and towels were distributed in a double blind fashion i e neither the research team nor recipients knew which towel was received except one investigator once a week for a three week period round 1 the field team made a surprise home visit at random times each week to each of the enrolled women and obtained a hand rinse sample for e coli testing after the 3rd visit the towels provided to groups a and b were removed from the homes we then gave each group the type of towel they had not received for round 1 as well as 1 bar of soap after a one week washout period we resumed weekly visits to obtain hand rinse samples from enrolled women for a three week period round 2 a total of nine visits three for baseline three for round 1 and three for round 2 were made per household we also conducted a qualitative study of towel use among 52 participants randomly selected from a household list at the end of round 1 or 2 selected participants were invited to have an in depth interview idi if a woman declined we continued to the next names on the list until a participant agreed to participate field team members included a senior behavioral scientist and research assistants with previous qualitative research experience within the communities where the study was conducted after trial 1 treated towels and soap were distributed to the participants and they were encouraged to continue good hand hygiene practices 2 6 trial 2 we conducted trial 2 in january 2012 to compare three handwashing drying methods under more controlled conditions fig 2 for this study 65 participants were randomly selected from the 125 mothers enrolled at baseline given a free antimicrobial towel and provided a refresher training on proper handwashing technique and towel use participants were randomized into three groups a b or c we made one surprise home visit to each mother during each of the three rounds asked mothers to wash and dry their hands using the method indicated for that visit and obtained hand rinse samples immediately afterward the three methods were 1 soap and water sw air dry 2 sw treated towel and 3 water only treated towel for each round each group of mothers was assigned a different handwashing and drying method by the end of the study each mother had used and had hand rinse samples tested for each of the three methods 2 7 hand rinse sample collection participants hands were tested for e coli using a modified glove juice method https globalhandwashing org fig 3 in the laboratory whirl pak fort atkinson wi usa bags were aseptically filled with 150 ml of sterile distilled water eluent and closed securely bags were carried in coolers to households where the hand rinses were conducted a participant was asked to place one hand into the bag and use the other hand to secure the bag around her wrist the sample collector then gently massaged the entire surface below the wrist of the hand inside the bag for 30 s this was repeated within the same bag with the participant s other hand the sample bag was then secured and transported in a cooler on ice to the laboratory where it was processed within 8 h of collection 2 8 escherichia coli testing in the laboratory each sample bag was gently mixed by inverting and 100 ml poured into sterile plastic bottles in addition a 1 100 dilution of sample was prepared in sterile distilled water e coli in rinse samples were quantified using idexx quantitray 2000 westbrook me usa most probable number mpn methodology and colilert 18 media according to manufacturer s instructions positive controls eluent water seeded with a lab strain of e coli and lab blanks eluent water only were assayed each sampling day to validate test performance and to ensure lack of contamination in eluent water respectively each sample was assigned into one of three categories based on estimated mpn of e coli in 100 ml of hand rinse eluent undetectable 1 mpn moderately contaminated 1 100 mpn and highly contaminated 100 mpn 2 9 statistical analysis data were collected using personal digital assistants and entered into a microsoft access database redmond wa usa all statistical analyses were done using sas v9 4 cary nc usa differences in demographic socioeconomic characteristics and hand hygiene practices between households included and excluded at baseline in each study were examined using chi square test for categorical variables fisher s exact test was used for small sample sizes t test or wilcoxon rank sum test were used as appropriate for continuous variables to explore associations between the hand contamination and treated towel use in trial 1 ordinal logistic regression was applied by treating the three contamination levels 1 1 100 100 mpn 100 ml hand rinse eluent as an ordinal outcome variable and the type of towel used for drying hands baseline treated towel untreated towel as an exposure variable similarly in trial 2 the same analysis was applied treating the three contamination levels as an ordinal outcome variable and the handwashing drying method sw air dry sw towel or water only towel as an exposure variable the standard handwashing method sw air dry was set as a reference category we examined covariates including mothers age 20 20 to 26 26 years education level completed primary or less secondary or higher having electricity at household yes or no having children 2 under five years old 1 or 0 observed latrine at home yes or no and having an improved water source including borehole rain water catchment covered well piped water protected spring yes or no for both trials in addition to address possible correlations from the repeated home visits in the same household we used the generalized estimating equation approach to analyze the data liang and zeger 1986 in the idi of trial 1 audio recordings and handwritten field notes were used for data collection from 52 participants and then reviewed during debriefing sessions data were transcribed and translated into english by bilingual research assistants and entered as microsoft word documents into atlas ti atlasti com to facilitate text searching and data coding 2 10 ethical considerations the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the centers for disease control and prevention institutional review board protocol number 6102 and the ethical review committee of the kenya medical research institute protocol number 2033 oral informed consent was obtained from all study participants in their native languages luo or luhya and personal

used soap water air dry to 19 1 when using soap water treated towel to 18 5 when using water only treated towel the odds of maternal hands exhibiting a higher level of e coli contamination were not statistically different among the three handwashing and drying methods used by participants table 6 similarly no covariates were associated with detectable e coli contamination on participants hands 4 discussion findings from these field studies suggested that use of antimicrobial towels for drying did not reduce the odds of e coli contamination on mothers hands compared to use of untreated towels the use of treated towels did not reduce the level of contamination observed during random hand testing a result that has been observed in at least three other studies of handwashing with soap pickering et al 2010 2011 ram et al 2011 slayton et al 2016 nor did they confer an advantage when microbiologic testing was conducted immediately following handwashing there are several possible explanations for the lack of effectiveness of the treated towel in decreasing e coli contamination of maternal hands first the treated towels themselves might have acted as fomites although similar technology used in treated towels has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have antimicrobial properties gerba et al 2012 bacterial colonization of towels may have taken place during household use in the fecally contaminated environments of study communities slayton et al 2016 and the towels may have reintroduced e coli to participants hands between handwashing and hand rinse sampling this potential explanation however does not explain the findings in trial 2 in which air drying after washing with soap and water did not diminish contamination compared to treated towel use after washing with soap and water second it is possible that the handwashing technique among study participants was poor and facilitated recontamination for example total removal of e coli may not occur after handwashing because some organisms may lie beyond the reach of handwashing e g under fingernails however women were given instructions for proper handwashing at the beginning of both studies and in both studies handwashing technique was observed before collecting the hand rinse samples and found to be adequate finally the water used for handwashing in these homes may have been contaminated with e coli which could have contributed to hand recontamination during rinsing at least one other study has found an association between stored water quality and hand contamination pickering et al 2010 unlike that study which took place in an area of tanzania where participants used improved water sources i e bottled borewell or municipal tap most of our study participants reported unsafe water storage practices and one fifth reported using unimproved water sources the results of this evaluation are consistent with studies of handwashing with antimicrobial soap that have shown no difference in bacterial contamination of hands and no health impact compared to untreated soap luby et al 2004 2005 aiello et al 2007 despite other studies that suggested that use of antimicrobial soap reduced bacterial contamination paulson 1994 sickbert bennett et al 2004 furthermore in trial 2 use of the treated towel following handwashing with soap and water did not perform better than use of treated towel following handwashing with water alone results of studies of antimicrobial soap and hand towels do not justify widespread promotion of these products which tend to be more expensive than traditional alternatives aiello et al 2007 slayton et al 2016 further evaluation is necessary to determine whether other types of health benefits are obtained from use of treated towels the importance of hygienic hand drying to effective handwashing has not been adequately addressed snelling et al 2011 huang et al 2012 person et al 2013 although inexpensive towels or cloths are readily available in most settings safe use requires frequent washing and consequently multiple towels in each household to ensure availability gerba et al 2014 which may be challenging for low income families with limited disposable income and time schilling et al 2013 similarly use of disposable towels is not economically sustainable for many families in the developing world more research into novel hand drying technologies or implementation approaches is needed this study had several important limitations first placement of treated towels in the household which we did not systematically observe during all visits may have influenced study results several women in idis said they kept the towels in the most accessible places such as the kitchen or on the wall towels located in kitchens might have been used not only for hand drying but also during food preparation cooking or wiping surfaces and could have resulted in increased contamination and transmission of bacteria to maternal hands gerba et al 2014 second frequency of towel washing which has been correlated to degree of contamination with e coli gerba et al 2014 might have affected microbiological results in trial 1 towels were observed to be dirty in more than a third of home visits but we excluded observable dirtiness of towels as a covariable in our analysis because of a high missing rate it appears that although the antimicrobial towels were designed to reduce the need for washing towel cleanliness continues to be important for effective hand hygiene third we did not obtain data on the activities of mothers immediately before towel use or handwashing such as changing babies nappies which could have affected the results we addressed the difficulty of adequately identifying the many behaviors that potentially could have contaminated the towel by using a randomized double blinded crossover design to reduce inter subject variability fourth we excluded participants who had two or more missing home visits per round in trial 1 which could have contributed to selection bias the missing home visits occurred because of our study design i e the visits took place at random times during the day some women went to market days or moved away which were independent of hand hygiene efficacy in a separate sensitivity analysis including those who only had one visit per round the results remained similar data not shown fifth by design in trial 2 we did not observe the method women used for handwashing and drying between our visits although the women were given a treated towel to use they could have used their habitual drying method instead which would have confounded the microbiological results finally because the study population was limited to a relatively small sample of 125 mothers or less in kisumu county the results may not be generalizable to other similar populations in addition only 65 mothers included in trial 2 was subject to the decreased statistical power 5 conclusion this study aimed at investigating the potential use of the antimicrobial hand towels to reduce e coli contamination on maternal hands results presented in this study did not support a direct association between treated towel use and reduced e coli contamination on maternal hands under field conditions in western kenyan communities considering the absence of effective novel technologies for hand drying and the likelihood that air drying is inconsistently practiced hand drying methods remain an important component of hand hygiene however for hand towel use to improve hand hygiene towel cleanliness can only be ensured through regular washing and drying hand drying has not typically been considered in studies of the impact of hand hygiene on health but deserves increased attention in
