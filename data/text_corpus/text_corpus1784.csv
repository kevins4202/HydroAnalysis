8920,waterlogging is a significant abiotic stress that reduces the oxygen supply to roots in the rhizosphere impairing plant growth and development cowpea is highly sensitive to waterlogging and their grain yield is affected by genotype and growth stage understanding the growth and physiological responses of cowpea to waterlogging stress is crucial for developing strategies to improve crop yield in waterlogged environments in this two year field trial we quantified the impact of ten days of waterlogging on morpho physiological attributes seed yield components and seed quality of two cowpea genotypes ucr 369 and epicselect 4 at different growth stages waterlogging during the reproductive r2 growth stage had the most substantial impact on cowpea with an average reduction of leaf area by 65 chlorophyll content by 39 stomatal conductance gs by 93 and photochemical efficiency by 32 compared to non waterlogged plants these effects were less pronounced during the vegetative v4 and physiological maturity r7 growth stages lower photosynthetic capacity resulted in reduction of biomass accumulation pod dry weight number of pods per plant and seed weight under waterlogging epicselect 4 was more sensitive to waterlogging at the r2 stage showing a greater reduction in seed yield 58 compared to ucr 369 46 additionally ucr 369 maintained seed protein content under waterlogging conditions while it decreased by 8 in epicselect 4 seeds overall ucr 369 was more tolerant to waterlogging stress than epicselect 4 with the most apparent effect of waterlogging on yields occurring at the r2 stage due to the high energy demands of the cowpea reproductive process our study highlights the importance of selecting cowpea genotypes with greater tolerance to waterlogging stress during the reproductive stage to mitigate the negative effects of waterlogging on seed yield in flood prone environments these results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cowpea s responses to waterlogging stress and can aid in developing strategies for improving cowpea yield in waterlogged environments which are expected to become more frequent due to climate change keywords waterlogging tolerance biomass photosynthesis cowpea yield seed protein hypoxia vigna unguiculata l data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the years global climate change has increased the frequency severity and duration of flood events adversely affecting the sustainability of crop production arias et al 2021 voesenek and bailey serres 2015 recent climate models predict that climate change variables including temperature and precipitation will rise further over the next century masson delmotte et al 2021 annual daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 14 by 2050 and about 35 by the end of the 21st century ipcc 2021 the increase in precipitation will lead to more frequent and extreme waterlogging events in many parts of the world including the united states usgcrp 2017 witt et al 2022 in this context waterlogging due to heavy precipitation poor soil drainage and over irrigation has been documented to affect more than 1700 million hectares of arable land globally each year voesenek and sasidharan 2013 moreover waterlogging is a detrimental abiotic stress limiting the average global crop yield by 33 tian et al 2021 however the impacts of waterlogging on crop yield vary by species growth stage stress duration soil type and genotypes langan et al 2022 previous studies have reported that waterlogging reduces the yield of wheat by 15 45 herzog et al 2016 cool season legumes by 9 41 pampana et al 2016 soybeans by 28 48 sathi et al 2022 barley by 15 68 masoni et al 2016 ploschuk et al 2018 oats by 42 81 arduini et al 2019 maize by 6 80 tian et al 2019 and cowpeas by 10 91 timsina et al 1994a hence maintaining yield in the face of increased climatic extremes is critical for future crop breeding programs waterlogging causes significant changes in the soil environment by inhibiting the diffusion of gases required for root growth and function arduini et al 2019 jayasundara et al 1997 consequently waterlogged soils become anaerobic after being saturated for a few hours because roots and soil microbes oxygen demand exceeds the atmosphere s influx ploschuk et al 2018 previous studies have shown that a decrease in soil redox potential reflects oxygen deprivation in the soil and its rate of depletion depends primarily on soil depth and temperature cannell et al 1985 ponnamperuma 1972 in addition soil waterlogging inhibits the oxidative decomposition of gases such as ethylene and co2 leading to root growth and development herzog et al 2016 plants alleviate the effects of soil hypoxia through a series of anatomical morpho physiological and metabolic responses for example waterlogged plants rapidly switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic fermentation reducing atp production from 36 moles of glucose metabolized to 2 moles gibbs and greenway 2003 sousa and de sodek 2002 starch reserves are rapidly depleted during anaerobic fermentation as harmful byproducts such as alcohols aldehydes and reactive oxygen species ros are produced cotrozzi et al 2021 langan et al 2022 sairam et al 2011 cowpea is one of the world s most important leguminous crops with widespread adaptation and cultivation according to fao 2022 the cultivated area of cowpea in 2022 was 15 1 million hectares with a global production of 8 9 million tonnes generally like many other legumes cowpeas are considered sensitive to waterlogging kumar et al 2013 noori et al 2017 ploschuk et al 2022 thus when the soil water content is 2 3 cm above the soil level the growth and development of cowpeas are impeded minchin and summerfield 1976 umaharan et al 1997 previous studies have opined that significant reductions in the water conductivity of cowpea s root system and leaf water potential are the primary consequences of waterlogging ashraf 2012 takele and mcdavid 1994 when the water potential of the leaves exceeds that of the soil water uptake becomes difficult in response plants close their stomata to avoid or delay extreme drops in leaf water potential ogbaga et al 2014 thus limiting cowpea s photosynthetic capacity by causing a series of morphological changes for instance increasing waterlogging duration gradually decreased the plant height leaf area and biomass of four cowpea genotypes umaharan et al 1997 waterlogging affects cowpea growth and physiology disrupting carbon metabolism and reducing biomass and yields olorunwa et al 2022 ploschuk et al 2018 moreover waterlogging has a genotype dependent effect on cowpea s morphological characteristics and yield minchin et al 1978 for example tolerant cowpea genotypes may exhibit improved biomass accumulation and growth under moderate waterlogging conditions while sensitive genotypes may show reduced leaf area biomass and seed yield under severe waterlogging conditions jayasundara et al 1997 takele and mcdavid 1994 cowpea yield is a complex integration of different physiological processes therefore the negative impacts of waterlogging stress on the photosynthetic machinery would decrease cowpea yield based on the severity and duration of the stress pampana et al 2016 tian et al 2021 previous studies have shown that waterlogging at different growth stages reduces the yields of leguminous crops including soybean linkemer et al 1998 cowpea umaharan et al 1997 mungbean ahmed et al 2002 chickpea noori et al 2017 and cool season grain legumes pampana et al 2016 however these studies concluded that the damage was more significant during the reproductive growth stage because this stage is associated with pollination fertilization gametogenesis embryogenesis and grain formation all of which influence crop productivity wang et al 2017 minchin et al 1978 revealed that waterlogging during flowering in cowpea resulted in more than 50 yield reduction due to flower abortion grain abscission poor pod formation and seed set possibly due to limited carbohydrate supply waterlogging has multiple effects on seed yield and associated traits which may be related to three factors crop genotype crop duration and crop growth stage tian et al 2021 however no comprehensive studies have assessed the effects of waterlogging on different growth stages of cowpea even though their production is heavily dependent on rainfall and irrigation during the summer in the united states hence a better understanding of the impact of waterlogging on the growth and physiology of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages is needed to improve management practices to optimize seed yield for economic gain in the current study a two year waterlogging experiment was conducted at the v4 r2 and r7 stages of cowpea genotypes with different waterlogging tolerance growth attributes leaf physiological parameters yield related traits and quality of these genotypes were assessed after ten days of waterlogging to answer the following research questions 1 what are the detrimental effects of waterlogging stress on morphological and physiological traits of cowpea at different growth stages 2 how does waterlogging affect cowpea seed yield and quality at different growth stages 3 when is the critical growth stage of waterlogging stress in cowpea genotypes and 4 are there differences in the physiological and yield related traits between waterlogged tolerant and sensitive cowpea genotypes therefore this study will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of waterlogging tolerance in cowpea and provide data that may be beneficial in developing strategies to maintain cowpea yields in wetland environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year study was conducted in 2021 and 2022 in the experimental field at mississippi state university located in the north mississippi

split plot design to investigate the effects of waterlogging on cowpea growth and physiological traits at different growth stages the main plot consisted of two treatments waterlogging and control and the subplot consisted of two cowpea genotypes ucr 369 and epicselect 4 the field was divided into three blocks corresponding to different developmental stages of cowpea as defined by the cowpea growth scale developed by schwartz and langham 2010 including v4 fourth trifoliate leaf r2 50 100 of flowers are open and r7 physiological maturity one pod at mature color each block was divided into two plots one for each treatment with a 2 5 m buffer zone between the two waterlogging treatments the cowpea genotypes were planted in a randomized complete block design with four replicates within each block to ensure the soil remained saturated during treatments levees targeting 5 10 cm in height were constructed to separate the control plot from the waterlogging plot at approximately 30 das when the plant began to branch the cowpea plants were subjected to two experimental treatments ten days of waterlogging and control during the v4 growth stage first block morphological and physiological data were assessed on each plot immediately after the 10 day waterlogging treatment after taking the morphological and physiological measurements the waterlogged conditions were drained and the plants were allowed to recover for the remainder of the growing season similar treatments were applied with approximately 50 das 75 flowering to the second and about 70 das to the third block morphological

graphs of lsd means were plotted with sigmaplot 14 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions there were no significant differences in mean temperature between the two growth seasons throughout the cowpea growth phase with temperatures averaging 25 0 c and 26 2 c in 2021 and 2022 respectively during waterlogging at v4 the average temperature was 25 9 c in 2021 and 26 1 c in 2022 fig 1 however at the r2 growth stage the mean temperature was higher in 2022 28 3 c compared to 2021 27 3 c similarly at the r7 growth stage the mean temperature was higher in 2022 28 4 c compared to 2021 26 1 c fig 1 additionally there was considerable variation in rainfall between the two years the growing season in 2021 was wetter with a total rainfall of 343 9 mm while in 2022 it was only 224 3 mm 3 2 morphological parameters waterlogging had a differential impact on cowpea s plant height at different growth stages and the alterations in the two growing seasons were similar fig 2 a b the adverse effects of waterlogging stress on the growth parameters of two cowpea genotypes at different growth stages are shown in fig 2 the effects of waterlogging on the plant height of the two cowpea genotypes were most significant in the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages compared with the control the plant height of ucr 369 and epicselect 4 decreased by 37 and 52 respectively after ten days of waterlogging in the r2 growth stage the adverse effects vary by growth stage cowpea genotype and growing seasons after ten days of waterlogging the leaves of waterlogged cowpea genotypes senescence rapidly decreasing the cowpea s leaf numbers while those on the control plants remain green until maturity fig 2 c d epicselect 4 had the most significant decrease in leaf number after ten days of waterlogging at r2 followed by v4 and r7 fig 2 c d a similar response was observed in ucr 369 in both growing seasons thus the r2 growth stage is critical to waterlogging stress in cowpeas the most significant effect of waterlogging was the reduction in leaf area per plant by more than 80 in epicselect 4 compared to the control treatments fig 2 e f the leaf area of ucr 369 in r2 was the most susceptible to waterlogging followed by r7 and v4 however damage to the leaf area in epicselect 4 was the greatest in r7 at 90 followed by 84 in v4 and 82 in r2 fig 2 f the total dry weight of cowpea genotypes decreased with waterlogging at different growth stages fig 2 g h in response to ten days of waterlogging the reduction of cowpea biomass varied with genotypes growth stages and growing seasons in ucr 369 10 day waterlogging reduced leaf biomass by 49 and 42 in v4 and r2 respectively but had no significant effect in the r7 stage of the 2021 growing season fig 2 g in contrast waterlogging reduced biomass in epicselect 4 by 79 60 and 54 at r2 v4 and r7 respectively in 2021 a similar response occurred during the 2022 growing season but with the greatest decline in the v4 stage of both genotypes fig 2 h 3 3 rwc msi and spad after ten days of waterlogging the rwc of both cowpea genotypes decreased at different growth stages and the changes were similar in the two year study fig 3 a b the rwc of epicselect 4 decreased the most in the 10 day waterlogging treatment in the r2 stage followed by r7 and v4 waterlogged ucr 369 maintained a significantly higher rwc than epicselect 4 under waterlogging at different growth stages fig 3 a b after ten days of waterlogging msi significantly decreased by 29 and 32 in the v4 and r2 stages but remained unchanged in the r7 fig 3 c d however there was no difference in the response of msi to waterlogging at different growth stages of ucr 369 fig 3 c d compared with the control treatments the spad value of both cowpea genotypes decreased at different growth stages in the 2021 and 2022 growing seasons fig 3 a b the largest reduction in spad occurred in the r7 stage of epicselect 4 followed by the r2 and v4 growth stages however in ucr 369 waterlogging at the v4 resulted in the greatest effect on the spad of the functional leaves followed by r2 and r7 in addition the impact of waterlogging on the spad of epicselect 4 was greater than that of ucr 369 the highest spad value was observed in ucr 369 at the v4 growth stage under the control treatment fig 3 a b 3 4 leaf gas exchange parameters waterlogging inhibited the leaf gas exchange parameters of the functional leaves of the two cowpea genotypes which vary at different growth stages fig 4 the most significant effects of waterlogging on a e and gs were observed at r2 followed by r7 and v4 stages changes in a e and gs in ucr 369 were more detrimental in the 2021 growing season than in the two growing seasons in epicselect 4 fig 4 a f moreover the decline of a e and gs was comparatively higher in epicselect 4 than in the ucr 369 genotype on average the a decreased by 67 63 and 44 at the r2 r7 and v4 stages respectively relative to the control treatment the corresponding a of epicselect 4 decreased by 92 86 and 82 at r2 r7 and v4 stages respectively compared to the control treatments decreased gs of epicselect 4 in v4 and r2 increased ci fig 4 g h however there was no difference in ci of ucr 369 at different growth stages fig 4 g h the ci gs and a interplay imply that ci did not play any role in the decreased a instead only gs was responsible under waterlogging conditions 3 5 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters the φpsii etr fv fm and qp showed similar responses as the photosynthetic parameters ten days of waterlogging reduced φpsii by 76 and 84 at r2 70 and 77 at v4 and 68 and 80 at r7 in ucr 369 and epicselect 4 respectively fig 5 a b a corresponding response was measured for the etr of both cowpea genotypes at different growth stages fig 5 c d the fv fm and qp were significantly decreased after ten days of waterlogging with the most significant reductions observed in the r2 stage which decreased by 24 and 68 for ucr 369 respectively epicselect 4 decreased by 39 and 79 compared to the control respectively fig 5 e h moreover photoinhibition was comparatively higher in epicselect 4 than in ucr 369 cowpea genotypes 3 6 seed yield and yield related attributes exposure to waterlogging at different growth stages reduced cowpea seed yield and yield components including pdw npp nsp and sw table 1 cowpea sw per plant was most susceptible to waterlogging damage at r2 followed by v4 and r7 with the most significant reduction in epicselect 4 compared to the control plants waterlogging decreased sw by an average of 76 82 and 17 for ucr 369 at the v4 r2 and r7 stages respectively on the other hand ten days of waterlogging resulted in a reduction of sw in epicselect 4 by 78 83 and 29 at the v4 r2 and r7 stages waterlogging affected cowpea seed yield components with the most significant effect at the r2 stage followed by v4 and r7 pdw npp and nsp of ucr 369 were reduced after ten days of waterlogging relative to the control with the most significant decline of 73 67 and 28 in r2 respectively table 1 epicselect 4 decreased by 81 79 and 47 in pdw npp and nsp at the r2 stage table 1 there was no difference in the response of hsw in waterlogged ucr 369 at different growth stages which was consistent in the two growing seasons table 1 however only the hsw of epicselect 4 decreased by 37 and 19 in the 2022 and 2021 growing seasons respectively 3 7 seed quality parameters in ucr 369 ten days of waterlogging did not cause a significant change in the total protein content of cowpea seed at different growth stages which was consistent in the two growing seasons table 2 however waterlogging decreased the seed protein of epicselect 4 with the greatest decrease at the r2 stage the interaction between waterlogging treatment and cowpea genotype significantly affected the starch content of cowpea seeds table 2 cowpea starch content increased the highest when ucr 369 was subjected to waterlogging at the r2 stage while there was no difference in epicselect 4 table 2 cowpea seed fiber of ucr 369 showed no difference but decreased in epicselect 4 with the greatest effect in the r2 stage table 2 the seed phenolics of ucr 369 were the lowest at the r2 stage while they increased significantly in epicselect 4 table 2 compared with the control the sucrose of ucr 369 seeds decreased at v4 and r7 stages but remained unchanged at r2 however the seed sucrose in epicselect 4 only decreased at the r2 stage table 2 4 discussion waterlogging is one of the significant abiotic stresses inhibiting plant growth physiology and metabolic processes resulting in a severe decline in crop yields pan et al 2021 tian et al 2021 the projected frequency of extreme events due to climate change will have profound effects on plants susceptible to waterlogging waterlogging reduces oxygen diffusion in the soil leading to hypoxia which limits plant root respiration energy production and nutrient uptake and damages root tissue through oxidative stress cotrozzi et al 2021 wang et al 2017 these waterlogging effects on roots have devastating consequences on the shoot s physiology hindering plant growth and development olorunwa et al 2022 in this study waterlogging also impaired cowpea s growth and physiological performance adversely affecting seed yield and quality these impacts varied between genotypes more tolerant ucr 369 and less tolerant epicselect 4 and growth stages of cowpea regarding cowpea s growth stage the impact of ten days of waterlogging on cowpea genotypes was ranked as r2 v4 r7 r2 is the most critical growth stage for reproductive growth at this stage ten days of waterlogging severely inhibited the morphological development physiological processes and yield formation of cowpea seeds previous studies have established the susceptibility of legumes to waterlogging during the r2 stage due to the high energy requirements for pollination gametogenesis fertilization and pod filling jayasundara et al 1997 noori et al 2017 pampana et al 2016 previous research has shown that plants recover better from waterlogging damage during the vegetative stage than during the reproductive stage as the plant has more resources available for recovery during the former stage liu et al 2015 this may explain the more significant impact of waterlogging on cowpea during the r2 growth stage where resources are being allocated toward reproduction additionally the r2 stage coincides with the hottest period of the year and high temperatures may have worsened the oxygen depletion caused by waterlogging leading to significant losses in cowpea seed yield in contrast waterlogging during the r7 stage when cowpeas have completed vegetative and reproductive growth had minimal effects on morphological physiological and yield characteristics 4 1 effects of waterlogging on growth traits of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages waterlogging induced changes in plant biochemistry and physiology leading to growth changes in many crops including cowpeas panozzo et al 2019 waterlogging alters cowpea plant morphology due to reduced water and nutrient uptake and transportation caused by energy deficits during anaerobic respiration kaur et al 2020 resulting in limited cell expansion and leaf growth gibbs and greenway 2003 in this study the effects of 10 day waterlogging stress genotype and growth stage on cowpea s morphological parameters were significant earlier experiments by olorunwa et al 2022 found that cowpea roots were restricted under 10 day waterlogging stress resulting in reduced shoot growth several previous studies have shown that waterlogging significantly reduces cowpea plant height biomass leaf number and leaf area hong et al 1977 jayawardhane et al 2022 kumar et al 2013 the results of this study showed that ten days of waterlogging reduced plant height and leaf number in cowpea at the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages fig 2 therefore due to the high energy demands of the various reproductive processes of cowpea the most significant decline occurred in the r2 stage under waterlogging the effects of waterlogging stress on leaf area and biomass depend on plant growth stage duration and genotypes umaharan et al 1997 reported greater reductions in leaf biomass in more tolerant cowpea cultivars compared to less tolerant cultivars with smaller leaf areas smaller leaves are better for reducing waterlogging stress than larger ones because their high boundary layer conductivities prevent heat build up leigh et al 2017 similarly this study showed that the tolerant genotype ucr 369 with a larger leaf area experienced the most significant declines under waterlogging at r2 followed by r7 and v4 stages fig 2 c the findings of this study are consistent with those of previous research on legumes ahmed et al 2002 bacanamwo and purcell 1999 which suggests that reducing leaf area to avoid water loss is one of the morphological adaptation mechanisms of legumes under waterlogging stress another possible mechanism is that waterlogging stress disrupts nutrient uptake and assimilation in cowpea plants leading to observed decreases in leaf number and biomass arduini et al 2019 phukan et al 2016 anaerobic conditions under waterlogged conditions limit the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium which are crucial for plant growth and development elzenga and van veen 2010 herzog et al 2016 kaur et al 2020 furthermore key enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation such as nitrate reductase and acid phosphatase have been shown to have reduced activity under waterlogged conditions gu et al 2019 ren et al 2017 the r2 stage when nutrient demand is high appears to be the most sensitive to waterlogging stress as indicated by the greatest reductions in leaf biomass observed in soybeans and mungbeans at this stage ahmed et al 2002 ploschuk et al 2018 rhine et al 2010 the decrease was associated with reductions in the chlorophyll content index fig 3 and the photosynthetic rate fig 4 in the present study the decline in leaf biomass was the lowest in ucr 369 at the r7 stage this can be explained by the fact that at the r7 stage vegetative and reproductive growth is almost established and changes in biomass under stress are generally smaller than at the r2 stage where vegetative and reproductive organs are still growing these findings are consistent with earlier research on cowpeas umaharan et al 1997 mungbeans ahmed et al 2002 and soybeans ploschuk et al 2022 which confirmed similar results therefore this study demonstrated that the r2 and r7 growth stages are the most sensitive and tolerant to waterlogging stress in cowpea and related crops respectively 4 2 effects of waterlogging on leaf physiological characteristics of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages waterlogging induced anaerobiosis reduces root hydraulic conductivity decreasing leaf turgor and gs and adversely affecting the photosynthetic process of plants shao et al 2013 previous studies utilized msi and rwc as indicators of waterlogging tolerance in legumes where relatively high values were associated with waterlogging tolerance garcia et al 2020 kumar et al 2013 this implies that a decrease in rwc and msi in waterlogging sensitive genotypes could be associated with plant growth reduction which is consistent with the findings of kumar et al 2013 interestingly ucr 369 maintained a significantly higher rwc than epicselect 4 under ten days of waterlogging fig 3 which may explain the lower reduction in plant height leaf area and total dry weight of ucr 369 compared to epicselect 4 therefore it can be inferred that the difference in the rwc of these two genotypes may be responsible for the observed differences in their responses to waterlogging stress moreover the inability to maintain plant water status in epicselect 4 could be attributed to rapid stomata closure when subjected to waterlogging malik et al 2001 the significant decrease in rwc and msi at the r2 stage suggests that flooded cowpea plants may suffer from impaired water transport resulting in poor pod formation and reduced yield consistent with the current results cowpeas and soybeans exposed to soil waterlogging stress during early flowering have been reported to exhibit impaired water relations and reduced hydraulic conductivity resulting in a yield reduction of more than 50 hirasawa et al 1994 minchin et al 1978 the accumulation of dry matter and the formation of cowpea seeds depend on the process of photosynthesis which is considered one of the most sensitive physiological processes to waterlogging shao et al 2013 tian et al 2019 previous studies have shown that waterlogging rapidly closes stomata damages chlorophyll content and alters the translocation of photosynthates leading to a decline in a with corresponding reductions in plant growth and seed yield ren et al 2014 shao et al 2013 this study revealed that a was sensitive to waterlogging which decreased in the two cowpea genotypes at different growth stages fig 4 the relative reduction in a was more pronounced in epicselect 4 than in ucr 369 in addition the inhibition of a gs and e is consistent with the decrease in spad and msi this indicates that waterlogging affects plant photosynthetic performance possibly due to reduced chlorophyll content and impaired mesophyll cell function plant leaf spad value and chlorophyll concentration are excellent indicators of plant carbon fixation and nitrogen status under waterlogging stress mielke et al 2010 ploschuk et al 2022 in this study waterlogging reduced spad by 22 35 in ucr 369 and 43 58 in epicselect 4 compared to controls fig 3 e f earlier studies in soybeans have reported similar findings and attributed significant degradation of chlorophyll concentrations under waterlogging to inhibited oxygen supplies limiting oxidase and chlorophyllase activities lapaz et al 2020 pereira et al 2020 similar reductions in chlorophyll in the leaves were observed in field peas at various growth stages by pociecha et al 2008 moreover because chlorophyll is integral to absorbing light energy during the photosynthetic process wang et al 2017 decreased chlorophyll content under waterlogging may reduce the efficiency of cowpea s conversion of light energy into chemical energy thus the decrease in chlorophyll will limit a and the production of photosynthates ultimately reducing biomass and seed yield the interplay between a ci and gs suggests that gs plays a crucial role in the inhibition of a under waterlogging stress this finding is consistent with previous studies on soybeans yamane and iijima 2016 mungbean ahmed et al 2002 and field beans pociecha et al 2008 and highlights the importance of stomatal regulation in plant adaptation to waterlogging stress however the lack of difference in ci between the control and waterlogging treatments in ucr 369 fig 4 g h indicates that only gs contributes to the inhibition of a in this genotype however the increase in ci and the decrease in gs under flooded conditions in epicselect 4 suggest that stomatal and non stomal limitations contribute significantly to a in waterlogging sensitive genotypes it can also be found that after ten days of waterlogging the a of ucr 369 decreased by 67 63 and 44 in the r2 r7 and v4 stages respectively and by 92 86 and 82 in epicselect 4 the present results are in support of the previous findings in soybeans yamane and iijima 2016 mungbean ahmed et al 2002 and field beans pociecha et al 2008 hence evidence from the current study and previous studies indicated that the photosynthesis of cowpea leaves decreased more obviously in the r2 stage than in the v4 stage under waterlogging stress recent studies have established chlorophyll fluorescence as an effective tool to detect functional changes in the photosynthetic process of cowpea and related crops under waterlogging ahmed et al 2002 kim et al 2018 this study demonstrated that ten days of waterlogging stress alters chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in the two cowpea genotypes as a non stomatal factor limiting a at different growth stages declines in φpsii etr fv fm and qp were observed in waterlogged cowpea genotypes compared to controls these reductions in fluorescence indicate damage to the psii limiting light interception in cowpea s leaves with a corresponding decrease in a in addition the results of this study demonstrated that the adverse effects of waterlogging stress on stomatal factors were greater than those of non stomatal factors therefore changes in a are shown to be more strongly dependent on the reduction of gs than on psii photoinhibition overall the findings indicated that waterlogging stress had the greatest impact on cowpea leaf physiology at the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages consistent with the results of previous studies ahmed et al 2002 shao et al 2013 these modifications in the leaf physiology consequently resulted in seed yield losses 4 3 effect of waterlogging on seed yield yield related attributes and seed quality of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages the present results indicated that ten days of waterlogging had a negative impact on the seed yield of both genotypes with the seed weight per plant decreasing the most at the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages table 1 the reduction in seed yield can be attributed to poor pod setting high flower abortion rate and lower seed formation rate caused by waterlogging which is consistent with previous studies hong et al 1977 minchin et al 1978 timsina et al 1994b minchin et al 1978 found that waterlogging during the reproductive stage significantly impacts cowpea yield and its components with the number of pods per plant being the most affected similar results were reported in the reproductive stage of mungbean relative to the vegetative stage ahmed et al 2002 similarly in the present study the number of pods per plant decreased the most during the r2 stage of the cowpea genotype with epicselect 4 being more susceptible to waterlogging than ucr 369 the reduced number of pods per plant can be attributed to a restricted supply of carbohydrates from the source to the sink resulting in lower biomass and flower abortion minchin et al 1978 umaharan et al 1997 which leads to a decrease in the number of seeds per plant the results also showed that limited dry matter accumulation due to leaf senescence and impaired a in the r2 stage under waterlogging conditions resulted in a significant decrease in pod dry weight per plant for both cowpea genotypes with epicselect 4 81 showing a more substantial reduction than ucr 369 73 the reduction in pod dry weight per plant further decreased the seed yield of both genotypes these findings suggest that the development of fewer pods in cowpea genotypes could be a tolerance mechanism used by cowpea to adapt to waterlogging and maintain yield furthermore waterlogging had a significant effect on the seed composition of the cowpea genotypes with a decrease in seed protein content in epicselect 4 but not in ucr 369 this result is consistent with previous studies that have reported a reduction in nitrogen accumulation in cowpea seeds under waterlogging conditions resulting in a significant decrease in seed protein content ravelombola et al 2016 weng et al 2019 in this experiment ten days of waterlogging at different growth stages did not cause any change in the seed protein content of ucr 369 however waterlogging at the r2 stage resulted in lower seed protein content in epicselect 4 suggesting that waterlogging of the sensitive cowpea genotypes at the reproductive stage is detrimental to seed protein content in addition the current study shows that the ucr 369 tan has a seed protein content of between 19 and 21 while the epicselect 4 pinkeye is between 25 and 28 this result supports the results of weng et al 2019 who reported that cowpea seed protein content ranged from 23 to 31 in pinkeye and from 19 to 20 in tan colored genotypes moreover waterlogging decreased the protein content of cowpea seeds increased the starch content and reduced the sucrose and phenolic contents in the waterlogged cowpea seeds at the r2 stage these changes in seed composition can be attributed to increased aba concentrations under waterlogging conditions which increased the activity of critical enzymes that convert soluble sugars to starch araki et al 2012 huang et al 2022 ren et al 2018 5 conclusion based on the results of the experiments in 2021 and 2022 we conclude that waterlogging at different growth stages of cowpea leads to significant reductions in plant growth physiology and seed yield epicselect 4 exhibited greater sensitivity to waterlogging stress at the r2 stage compared to ucr 369 showing larger reductions in leaf area 82 chlorophyll content 75 gs 96 and photochemical efficiency 39 these findings highlight the importance of genotype selection as a crucial practice to cope with waterlogging stress in cowpea cultivation furthermore our results demonstrate that cowpea genotypes are most sensitive to waterlogging during the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages with the r2 stage being particularly vulnerable due to the high energy demands of the cowpea reproductive process to sustain yield producers need to use cowpea genotypes that are tolerant to waterlogging during reproductive stages in addition developing cultivars that are not only tolerant to waterlogging stress but also yield well under normal weather conditions will provide a sustainable and resilient solution for cowpea cultivation in areas prone to increased waterlogging events this approach will not only help farmers to mitigate the negative impacts of waterlogging on cowpea yields but also improve the overall productivity and profitability of the crop therefore researchers and breeders must prioritize the development of tolerant cowpea cultivars such as ucr 369 to secure a resilient future for the crop and the farmers who rely on it funding the current research is based on work that is supported by the usda nifa hatch project under

8920,waterlogging is a significant abiotic stress that reduces the oxygen supply to roots in the rhizosphere impairing plant growth and development cowpea is highly sensitive to waterlogging and their grain yield is affected by genotype and growth stage understanding the growth and physiological responses of cowpea to waterlogging stress is crucial for developing strategies to improve crop yield in waterlogged environments in this two year field trial we quantified the impact of ten days of waterlogging on morpho physiological attributes seed yield components and seed quality of two cowpea genotypes ucr 369 and epicselect 4 at different growth stages waterlogging during the reproductive r2 growth stage had the most substantial impact on cowpea with an average reduction of leaf area by 65 chlorophyll content by 39 stomatal conductance gs by 93 and photochemical efficiency by 32 compared to non waterlogged plants these effects were less pronounced during the vegetative v4 and physiological maturity r7 growth stages lower photosynthetic capacity resulted in reduction of biomass accumulation pod dry weight number of pods per plant and seed weight under waterlogging epicselect 4 was more sensitive to waterlogging at the r2 stage showing a greater reduction in seed yield 58 compared to ucr 369 46 additionally ucr 369 maintained seed protein content under waterlogging conditions while it decreased by 8 in epicselect 4 seeds overall ucr 369 was more tolerant to waterlogging stress than epicselect 4 with the most apparent effect of waterlogging on yields occurring at the r2 stage due to the high energy demands of the cowpea reproductive process our study highlights the importance of selecting cowpea genotypes with greater tolerance to waterlogging stress during the reproductive stage to mitigate the negative effects of waterlogging on seed yield in flood prone environments these results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cowpea s responses to waterlogging stress and can aid in developing strategies for improving cowpea yield in waterlogged environments which are expected to become more frequent due to climate change keywords waterlogging tolerance biomass photosynthesis cowpea yield seed protein hypoxia vigna unguiculata l data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the years global climate change has increased the frequency severity and duration of flood events adversely affecting the sustainability of crop production arias et al 2021 voesenek and bailey serres 2015 recent climate models predict that climate change variables including temperature and precipitation will rise further over the next century masson delmotte et al 2021 annual daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 14 by 2050 and about 35 by the end of the 21st century ipcc 2021 the increase in precipitation will lead to more frequent and extreme waterlogging events in many parts of the world including the united states usgcrp 2017 witt et al 2022 in this context waterlogging due to heavy precipitation poor soil drainage and over irrigation has been documented to affect more than 1700 million hectares of arable land globally each year voesenek and sasidharan 2013 moreover waterlogging is a detrimental abiotic stress limiting the average global crop yield by 33 tian et al 2021 however the impacts of waterlogging on crop yield vary by species growth stage stress duration soil type and genotypes langan et al 2022 previous studies have reported that waterlogging reduces the yield of wheat by 15 45 herzog et al 2016 cool season legumes by 9 41 pampana et al 2016 soybeans by 28 48 sathi et al 2022 barley by 15 68 masoni et al 2016 ploschuk et al 2018 oats by 42 81 arduini et al 2019 maize by 6 80 tian et al 2019 and cowpeas by 10 91 timsina et al 1994a hence maintaining yield in the face of increased climatic extremes is critical for future crop breeding programs waterlogging causes significant changes in the soil environment by inhibiting the diffusion of gases required for root growth and function arduini et al 2019 jayasundara et al 1997 consequently waterlogged soils become anaerobic after being saturated for a few hours because roots and soil microbes oxygen demand exceeds the atmosphere s influx ploschuk et al 2018 previous studies have shown that a decrease in soil redox potential reflects oxygen deprivation in the soil and its rate of depletion depends primarily on soil depth and temperature cannell et al 1985 ponnamperuma 1972 in addition soil waterlogging inhibits the oxidative decomposition of gases such as ethylene and co2 leading to root growth and development herzog et al 2016 plants alleviate the effects of soil hypoxia through a series of anatomical morpho physiological and metabolic responses for example waterlogged plants rapidly switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic fermentation reducing atp production from 36 moles of glucose metabolized to 2 moles gibbs and greenway 2003 sousa and de sodek 2002 starch reserves are rapidly depleted during anaerobic fermentation as harmful byproducts such as alcohols aldehydes and reactive oxygen species ros are produced cotrozzi et al 2021 langan et al 2022 sairam et al 2011 cowpea is one of the world s most important leguminous crops with widespread adaptation and cultivation according to fao 2022 the cultivated area of cowpea in 2022 was 15 1 million hectares with a global production of 8 9 million tonnes generally like many other legumes cowpeas are considered sensitive to waterlogging kumar et al 2013 noori et al 2017 ploschuk et al 2022 thus when the soil water content is 2 3 cm above the soil level the growth and development of cowpeas are impeded minchin and summerfield 1976 umaharan et al 1997 previous studies have opined that significant reductions in the water conductivity of cowpea s root system and leaf water potential are the primary consequences of waterlogging ashraf 2012 takele and mcdavid 1994 when the water potential of the leaves exceeds that of the soil water uptake becomes difficult in response plants close their stomata to avoid or delay extreme drops in leaf water potential ogbaga et al 2014 thus limiting cowpea s photosynthetic capacity by causing a series of morphological changes for instance increasing waterlogging duration gradually decreased the plant height leaf area and biomass of four cowpea genotypes umaharan et al 1997 waterlogging affects cowpea growth and physiology disrupting carbon metabolism and reducing biomass and yields olorunwa et al 2022 ploschuk et al 2018 moreover waterlogging has a genotype dependent effect on cowpea s morphological characteristics and yield minchin et al 1978 for example tolerant cowpea genotypes may exhibit improved biomass accumulation and growth under moderate waterlogging conditions while sensitive genotypes may show reduced leaf area biomass and seed yield under severe waterlogging conditions jayasundara et al 1997 takele and mcdavid 1994 cowpea yield is a complex integration of different physiological processes therefore the negative impacts of waterlogging stress on the photosynthetic machinery would decrease cowpea yield based on the severity and duration of the stress pampana et al 2016 tian et al 2021 previous studies have shown that waterlogging at different growth stages reduces the yields of leguminous crops including soybean linkemer et al 1998 cowpea umaharan et al 1997 mungbean ahmed et al 2002 chickpea noori et al 2017 and cool season grain legumes pampana et al 2016 however these studies concluded that the damage was more significant during the reproductive growth stage because this stage is associated with pollination fertilization gametogenesis embryogenesis and grain formation all of which influence crop productivity wang et al 2017 minchin et al 1978 revealed that waterlogging during flowering in cowpea resulted in more than 50 yield reduction due to flower abortion grain abscission poor pod formation and seed set possibly due to limited carbohydrate supply waterlogging has multiple effects on seed yield and associated traits which may be related to three factors crop genotype crop duration and crop growth stage tian et al 2021 however no comprehensive studies have assessed the effects of waterlogging on different growth stages of cowpea even though their production is heavily dependent on rainfall and irrigation during the summer in the united states hence a better understanding of the impact of waterlogging on the growth and physiology of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages is needed to improve management practices to optimize seed yield for economic gain in the current study a two year waterlogging experiment was conducted at the v4 r2 and r7 stages of cowpea genotypes with different waterlogging tolerance growth attributes leaf physiological parameters yield related traits and quality of these genotypes were assessed after ten days of waterlogging to answer the following research questions 1 what are the detrimental effects of waterlogging stress on morphological and physiological traits of cowpea at different growth stages 2 how does waterlogging affect cowpea seed yield and quality at different growth stages 3 when is the critical growth stage of waterlogging stress in cowpea genotypes and 4 are there differences in the physiological and yield related traits between waterlogged tolerant and sensitive cowpea genotypes therefore this study will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of waterlogging tolerance in cowpea and provide data that may be beneficial in developing strategies to maintain cowpea yields in wetland environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year study was conducted in 2021 and 2022 in the experimental field at mississippi state university located in the north mississippi

split plot design to investigate the effects of waterlogging on cowpea growth and physiological traits at different growth stages the main plot consisted of two treatments waterlogging and control and the subplot consisted of two cowpea genotypes ucr 369 and epicselect 4 the field was divided into three blocks corresponding to different developmental stages of cowpea as defined by the cowpea growth scale developed by schwartz and langham 2010 including v4 fourth trifoliate leaf r2 50 100 of flowers are open and r7 physiological maturity one pod at mature color each block was divided into two plots one for each treatment with a 2 5 m buffer zone between the two waterlogging treatments the cowpea genotypes were planted in a randomized complete block design with four replicates within each block to ensure the soil remained saturated during treatments levees targeting 5 10 cm in height were constructed to separate the control plot from the waterlogging plot at approximately 30 das when the plant began to branch the cowpea plants were subjected to two experimental treatments ten days of waterlogging and control during the v4 growth stage first block morphological and physiological data were assessed on each plot immediately after the 10 day waterlogging treatment after taking the morphological and physiological measurements the waterlogged conditions were drained and the plants were allowed to recover for the remainder of the growing season similar treatments were applied with approximately 50 das 75 flowering to the second and about 70 das to the third block morphological and physiological data were also collected immediately after the 10 day waterlogging treatment in these blocks after taking the morphological and physiological measurements the waterlogged conditions were drained and the plants were allowed to recover for the remainder of the growing season finally cowpea plants were harvested to quantify seed yield related traits and quality 2 4 data collection 2

graphs of lsd means were plotted with sigmaplot 14 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions there were no significant differences in mean temperature between the two growth seasons throughout the cowpea growth phase with temperatures averaging 25 0 c and 26 2 c in 2021 and 2022 respectively during waterlogging at v4 the average temperature was 25 9 c in 2021 and 26 1 c in 2022 fig 1 however at the r2 growth stage the mean temperature was higher in 2022 28 3 c compared to 2021 27 3 c similarly at the r7 growth stage the mean temperature was higher in 2022 28 4 c compared to 2021 26 1 c fig 1 additionally there was considerable variation in rainfall between the two years the growing season in 2021 was wetter with a total rainfall of 343 9 mm while in 2022 it was only 224 3 mm 3 2 morphological parameters waterlogging had a differential impact on cowpea s plant height at different growth stages and the alterations in the two growing seasons were similar fig 2 a b the adverse effects of waterlogging stress on the growth parameters of two cowpea genotypes at different growth stages are shown in fig 2 the effects of waterlogging on the plant height of the two cowpea genotypes were most significant in the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages compared with the control the plant height of ucr 369 and epicselect 4 decreased by 37 and 52 respectively after ten days of waterlogging in the r2 growth stage the adverse effects vary by growth stage cowpea genotype and growing seasons after ten days of waterlogging the leaves of waterlogged cowpea genotypes senescence rapidly decreasing the cowpea s leaf numbers while those on the control plants remain green until maturity fig 2 c d epicselect 4 had the most significant decrease in leaf number after ten days of waterlogging at r2 followed by v4 and r7 fig 2 c d a similar response was observed in ucr 369 in both growing seasons thus the r2 growth stage is critical to waterlogging stress in cowpeas the most significant effect of waterlogging was the reduction in leaf area per plant by more than 80 in epicselect 4 compared to the control treatments fig 2 e f the leaf area of ucr 369 in r2 was the most susceptible to waterlogging followed by r7 and v4 however damage to the leaf area in epicselect 4 was the greatest in r7 at 90 followed by 84 in v4 and 82 in r2 fig 2 f the total dry weight of cowpea genotypes decreased with waterlogging at different growth stages fig 2 g h in response to ten days of waterlogging the reduction of cowpea biomass varied with genotypes growth stages and growing seasons in ucr 369 10 day waterlogging reduced leaf biomass by 49 and 42 in v4 and r2 respectively but had no significant effect in the r7 stage of the 2021 growing season fig 2 g in contrast waterlogging reduced biomass in epicselect 4 by 79 60 and 54 at r2 v4 and r7 respectively in 2021 a similar response occurred during the 2022 growing season but with the greatest decline in the v4 stage of both genotypes fig 2 h 3 3 rwc msi and spad after ten days of waterlogging the rwc of both cowpea genotypes decreased at different growth stages and the changes were similar in the two year study fig 3 a b the rwc of epicselect 4 decreased the most in the 10 day waterlogging treatment in the r2 stage followed by r7 and v4 waterlogged ucr 369 maintained a significantly higher rwc than epicselect 4 under waterlogging at different growth stages fig 3 a b after ten days of waterlogging msi significantly decreased by 29 and 32 in the v4 and r2 stages but remained unchanged in the r7 fig 3 c d however there was no difference in the response of msi to waterlogging at different growth stages of ucr 369 fig 3 c d compared with the control treatments the spad value of both cowpea genotypes decreased at different growth stages in the 2021 and 2022 growing seasons fig 3 a b the largest reduction in spad occurred in the r7 stage of epicselect 4 followed by the r2 and v4 growth stages however in ucr 369 waterlogging at the v4 resulted in the greatest effect on the spad of the functional leaves followed by r2 and r7 in addition the impact of waterlogging on the spad of epicselect 4 was greater than that of ucr 369 the highest spad value was observed in ucr 369 at the v4 growth stage under the control treatment fig 3 a b 3 4 leaf gas exchange parameters waterlogging inhibited the leaf gas exchange parameters of the functional leaves of the two cowpea genotypes which vary at different growth stages fig 4 the most significant effects of waterlogging on a e and gs were observed at r2 followed by r7 and v4 stages changes in a e and gs in ucr 369 were more detrimental in the 2021 growing season than in the two growing seasons in epicselect 4 fig 4 a f moreover the decline of a e and gs was comparatively higher in epicselect 4 than in the ucr 369 genotype on average the a decreased by 67 63 and 44 at the r2 r7 and v4 stages respectively relative to the control treatment the corresponding a of epicselect 4 decreased by 92 86 and 82 at r2 r7 and v4 stages respectively compared to the control treatments decreased gs of epicselect 4 in v4 and r2 increased ci fig 4 g h however there was no difference in ci of ucr 369 at different growth stages fig 4 g h the ci gs and a interplay imply that ci did not play any role in the decreased a instead only gs was responsible under waterlogging conditions 3 5 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters the φpsii etr fv fm and qp showed similar responses as the photosynthetic parameters ten days of waterlogging reduced φpsii by 76 and 84 at r2 70 and 77 at v4 and 68 and 80 at r7 in ucr 369 and epicselect 4 respectively fig 5 a b a corresponding response was measured for the etr of both cowpea genotypes at different growth stages fig 5 c d the fv fm and qp were significantly decreased after ten days of waterlogging with the most significant reductions observed in the r2 stage which decreased by 24 and 68 for ucr 369 respectively epicselect 4 decreased by 39 and 79 compared to the control respectively fig 5 e h moreover photoinhibition was comparatively higher in epicselect 4 than in ucr 369 cowpea genotypes 3 6 seed yield and yield related attributes exposure to waterlogging at different growth stages reduced cowpea seed yield and yield components including pdw npp nsp and sw table 1 cowpea sw per plant was most susceptible to waterlogging damage at r2 followed by v4 and r7 with the most significant reduction in epicselect 4 compared to the control plants waterlogging decreased sw by an average of 76 82 and 17 for ucr 369 at the v4 r2 and r7 stages respectively on the other hand ten days of waterlogging resulted in a reduction of sw in epicselect 4 by 78 83 and 29 at the v4 r2 and r7 stages waterlogging affected cowpea seed yield components with the most significant effect at the r2 stage followed by v4 and r7 pdw npp and nsp of ucr 369 were reduced after ten days of waterlogging relative to the control with the most significant decline of 73 67 and 28 in r2 respectively table 1 epicselect 4 decreased by 81 79 and 47 in pdw npp and nsp at the r2 stage table 1 there was no difference in the response of hsw in waterlogged ucr 369 at different growth stages which was consistent in the two growing seasons table 1 however only the hsw of epicselect 4 decreased by 37 and 19 in the 2022 and 2021 growing seasons respectively 3 7 seed quality parameters in ucr 369 ten days of waterlogging did not cause a significant change in the total protein content of cowpea seed at different growth stages which was consistent in the two growing seasons table 2 however waterlogging decreased the seed protein of epicselect 4 with the greatest decrease at the r2 stage the interaction between waterlogging treatment and cowpea genotype significantly affected the starch content of cowpea seeds table 2 cowpea starch content increased the highest when ucr 369 was subjected to waterlogging at the r2 stage while there was no difference in epicselect 4 table 2 cowpea seed fiber of ucr 369 showed no difference but decreased in epicselect 4 with the greatest effect in the r2 stage table 2 the seed phenolics of ucr 369 were the lowest at the r2 stage while they increased significantly in epicselect 4 table 2 compared with the control the sucrose of ucr 369 seeds decreased at v4 and r7 stages but remained unchanged at r2 however the seed sucrose in epicselect 4 only decreased at the r2 stage table 2 4 discussion waterlogging is one of the significant abiotic stresses inhibiting plant growth physiology and metabolic processes resulting in a severe decline in crop yields pan et al 2021 tian et al 2021 the projected frequency of extreme events due to climate change will have profound effects on plants susceptible to waterlogging waterlogging reduces oxygen diffusion in the soil leading to hypoxia which limits plant root respiration energy production and nutrient uptake and damages root tissue through oxidative stress cotrozzi et al 2021 wang et al 2017 these waterlogging effects on roots have devastating consequences on the shoot s physiology hindering plant growth and development olorunwa et al 2022 in this study waterlogging also impaired cowpea s growth and physiological performance adversely affecting seed yield and quality these impacts varied between genotypes more tolerant ucr 369 and less tolerant epicselect 4 and growth stages of cowpea regarding cowpea s growth stage the impact of ten days of waterlogging on cowpea genotypes was ranked as r2 v4 r7 r2 is the most critical growth stage for reproductive growth at this stage ten days of waterlogging severely inhibited the morphological development physiological processes and yield formation of cowpea seeds previous studies have established the susceptibility of legumes to waterlogging during the r2 stage due to the high energy requirements for pollination gametogenesis fertilization and pod filling jayasundara et al 1997 noori et al 2017 pampana et al 2016 previous research has shown that plants recover better from waterlogging damage during the vegetative stage than during the reproductive stage as the plant has more resources available for recovery during the former stage liu et al 2015 this may explain the more significant impact of waterlogging on cowpea during the r2 growth stage where resources are being allocated toward reproduction additionally the r2 stage coincides with the hottest period of the year and high temperatures may have worsened the oxygen depletion caused by waterlogging leading to significant losses in cowpea seed yield in contrast waterlogging during the r7 stage when cowpeas have completed vegetative and reproductive growth had minimal effects on morphological physiological and yield characteristics 4 1 effects of waterlogging on growth traits of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages waterlogging induced changes in plant biochemistry and physiology leading to growth changes in many crops including cowpeas panozzo et al 2019 waterlogging alters cowpea plant morphology due to reduced water and nutrient uptake and transportation caused by energy deficits during anaerobic respiration kaur et al 2020 resulting in limited cell expansion and leaf growth gibbs and greenway 2003 in this study the effects of 10 day waterlogging stress genotype and growth stage on cowpea s morphological parameters were significant earlier experiments by olorunwa et al 2022 found that cowpea roots were restricted under 10 day waterlogging stress resulting in reduced shoot growth several previous studies have shown that waterlogging significantly reduces cowpea plant height biomass leaf number and leaf area hong et al 1977 jayawardhane et al 2022 kumar et al 2013 the results of this study showed that ten days of waterlogging reduced plant height and leaf number in cowpea at the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages fig 2 therefore due to the high energy demands of the various reproductive processes of cowpea the most significant decline occurred in the r2 stage under waterlogging the effects of waterlogging stress on leaf area and biomass depend on plant growth stage duration and genotypes umaharan et al 1997 reported greater reductions in leaf biomass in more tolerant cowpea cultivars compared to less tolerant cultivars with smaller leaf areas smaller leaves are better for reducing waterlogging stress than larger ones because their high boundary layer conductivities prevent heat build up leigh et al 2017 similarly this study showed that the tolerant genotype ucr 369 with a larger leaf area experienced the most significant declines under waterlogging at r2 followed by r7 and v4 stages fig 2 c the findings of this study are consistent with those of previous research on legumes ahmed et al 2002 bacanamwo and purcell 1999 which suggests that reducing leaf area to avoid water loss is one of the morphological adaptation mechanisms of legumes under waterlogging stress another possible mechanism is that waterlogging stress disrupts nutrient uptake and assimilation in cowpea plants leading to observed decreases in leaf number and biomass arduini et al 2019 phukan et al 2016 anaerobic conditions under waterlogged conditions limit the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium which are crucial for plant growth and development elzenga and van veen 2010 herzog et al 2016 kaur et al 2020 furthermore key enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation such as nitrate reductase and acid phosphatase have been shown to have reduced activity under waterlogged conditions gu et al 2019 ren et al 2017 the r2 stage when nutrient demand is high appears to be the most sensitive to waterlogging stress as indicated by the greatest reductions in leaf biomass observed in soybeans and mungbeans at this stage ahmed et al 2002 ploschuk et al 2018 rhine et al 2010 the decrease was associated with reductions in the chlorophyll content index fig 3 and the photosynthetic rate fig 4 in the present study the decline in leaf biomass was the lowest in ucr 369 at the r7 stage this can be explained by the fact that at the r7 stage vegetative and reproductive growth is almost established and changes in biomass under stress are generally smaller than at the r2 stage where vegetative and reproductive organs are still growing these findings are consistent with earlier research on cowpeas umaharan et al 1997 mungbeans ahmed et al 2002 and soybeans ploschuk et al 2022 which confirmed similar results therefore this study demonstrated that the r2 and r7 growth stages are the most sensitive and tolerant to waterlogging stress in cowpea and related crops respectively 4 2 effects of waterlogging on leaf physiological characteristics of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages waterlogging induced anaerobiosis reduces root hydraulic conductivity decreasing leaf turgor and gs and adversely affecting the photosynthetic process of plants shao et al 2013 previous studies utilized msi and rwc as indicators of waterlogging tolerance in legumes where relatively high values were associated with waterlogging tolerance garcia et al 2020 kumar et al 2013 this implies that a decrease in rwc and msi in waterlogging sensitive genotypes could be associated with plant growth reduction which is consistent with the findings of kumar et al 2013 interestingly ucr 369 maintained a significantly higher rwc than epicselect 4 under ten days of waterlogging fig 3 which may explain the lower reduction in plant height leaf area and total dry weight of ucr 369 compared to epicselect 4 therefore it can be inferred that the difference in the rwc of these two genotypes may be responsible for the observed differences in their responses to waterlogging stress moreover the inability to maintain plant water status in epicselect 4 could be attributed to rapid stomata closure when subjected to waterlogging malik et al 2001 the significant decrease in rwc and msi at the r2 stage suggests that flooded cowpea plants may suffer from impaired water transport resulting in poor pod formation and reduced yield consistent with the current results cowpeas and soybeans exposed to soil waterlogging stress during early flowering have been reported to exhibit impaired water relations and reduced hydraulic conductivity resulting in a yield reduction of more than 50 hirasawa et al 1994 minchin et al 1978 the accumulation of dry matter and the formation of cowpea seeds depend on the process of photosynthesis which is considered one of the most sensitive physiological processes to waterlogging shao et al 2013 tian et al 2019 previous studies have shown that waterlogging rapidly closes stomata damages chlorophyll content and alters the translocation of photosynthates leading to a decline in a with corresponding reductions in plant growth and seed yield ren et al 2014 shao et al 2013 this study revealed that a was sensitive to waterlogging which decreased in the two cowpea genotypes at different growth stages fig 4 the relative reduction in a was more pronounced in epicselect 4 than in ucr 369 in addition the inhibition of a gs and e is consistent with the decrease in spad and msi this indicates that waterlogging affects plant photosynthetic performance possibly due to reduced chlorophyll content and impaired mesophyll cell function plant leaf spad value and chlorophyll concentration are excellent indicators of plant carbon fixation and nitrogen status under waterlogging stress mielke et al 2010 ploschuk et al 2022 in this study waterlogging reduced spad by 22 35 in ucr 369 and 43 58 in epicselect 4 compared to controls fig 3 e f earlier studies in soybeans have reported similar findings and attributed significant degradation of chlorophyll concentrations under waterlogging to inhibited oxygen supplies limiting oxidase and chlorophyllase activities lapaz et al 2020 pereira et al 2020 similar reductions in chlorophyll in the leaves were observed in field peas at various growth stages by pociecha et al 2008 moreover because chlorophyll is integral to absorbing light energy during the photosynthetic process wang et al 2017 decreased chlorophyll content under waterlogging may reduce the efficiency of cowpea s conversion of light energy into chemical energy thus the decrease in chlorophyll will limit a and the production of photosynthates ultimately reducing biomass and seed yield the interplay between a ci and gs suggests that gs plays a crucial role in the inhibition of a under waterlogging stress this finding is consistent with previous studies on soybeans yamane and iijima 2016 mungbean ahmed et al 2002 and field beans pociecha et al 2008 and highlights the importance of stomatal regulation in plant adaptation to waterlogging stress however the lack of difference in ci between the control and waterlogging treatments in ucr 369 fig 4 g h indicates that only gs contributes to the inhibition of a in this genotype however the increase in ci and the decrease in gs under flooded conditions in epicselect 4 suggest that stomatal and non stomal limitations contribute significantly to a in waterlogging sensitive genotypes it can also be found that after ten days of waterlogging the a of ucr 369 decreased by 67 63 and 44 in the r2 r7 and v4 stages respectively and by 92 86 and 82 in epicselect 4 the present results are in support of the previous findings in soybeans yamane and iijima 2016 mungbean ahmed et al 2002 and field beans pociecha et al 2008 hence evidence from the current study and previous studies indicated that the photosynthesis of cowpea leaves decreased more obviously in the r2 stage than in the v4 stage under waterlogging stress recent studies have established chlorophyll fluorescence as an effective tool to detect functional changes in the photosynthetic process of cowpea and related crops under waterlogging ahmed et al 2002 kim et al 2018 this study demonstrated that ten days of waterlogging stress alters chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in the two cowpea genotypes as a non stomatal factor limiting a at different growth stages declines in φpsii etr fv fm and qp were observed in waterlogged cowpea genotypes compared to controls these reductions in fluorescence indicate damage to the psii limiting light interception in cowpea s leaves with a corresponding decrease in a in addition the results of this study demonstrated that the adverse effects of waterlogging stress on stomatal factors were greater than those of non stomatal factors therefore changes in a are shown to be more strongly dependent on the reduction of gs than on psii photoinhibition overall the findings indicated that waterlogging stress had the greatest impact on cowpea leaf physiology at the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages consistent with the results of previous studies ahmed et al 2002 shao et al 2013 these modifications in the leaf physiology consequently resulted in seed yield losses 4 3 effect of waterlogging on seed yield yield related attributes and seed quality of cowpea genotypes at different growth stages the present results indicated that ten days of waterlogging had a negative impact on the seed yield of both genotypes with the seed weight per plant decreasing the most at the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages table 1 the reduction in seed yield can be attributed to poor pod setting high flower abortion rate and lower seed formation rate caused by waterlogging which is consistent with previous studies hong et al 1977 minchin et al 1978 timsina et al 1994b minchin et al 1978 found that waterlogging during the reproductive stage significantly impacts cowpea yield and its components with the number of pods per plant being the most affected similar results were reported in the reproductive stage of mungbean relative to the vegetative stage ahmed et al 2002 similarly in the present study the number of pods per plant decreased the most during the r2 stage of the cowpea genotype with epicselect 4 being more susceptible to waterlogging than ucr 369 the reduced number of pods per plant can be attributed to a restricted supply of carbohydrates from the source to the sink resulting in lower biomass and flower abortion minchin et al 1978 umaharan et al 1997 which leads to a decrease in the number of seeds per plant the results also showed that limited dry matter accumulation due to leaf senescence and impaired a in the r2 stage under waterlogging conditions resulted in a significant decrease in pod dry weight per plant for both cowpea genotypes with epicselect 4 81 showing a more substantial reduction than ucr 369 73 the reduction in pod dry weight per plant further decreased the seed yield of both genotypes these findings suggest that the development of fewer pods in cowpea genotypes could be a tolerance mechanism used by cowpea to adapt to waterlogging and maintain yield furthermore waterlogging had a significant effect on the seed composition of the cowpea genotypes with a decrease in seed protein content in epicselect 4 but not in ucr 369 this result is consistent with previous studies that have reported a reduction in nitrogen accumulation in cowpea seeds under waterlogging conditions resulting in a significant decrease in seed protein content ravelombola et al 2016 weng et al 2019 in this experiment ten days of waterlogging at different growth stages did not cause any change in the seed protein content of ucr 369 however waterlogging at the r2 stage resulted in lower seed protein content in epicselect 4 suggesting that waterlogging of the sensitive cowpea genotypes at the reproductive stage is detrimental to seed protein content in addition the current study shows that the ucr 369 tan has a seed protein content of between 19 and 21 while the epicselect 4 pinkeye is between 25 and 28 this result supports the results of weng et al 2019 who reported that cowpea seed protein content ranged from 23 to 31 in pinkeye and from 19 to 20 in tan colored genotypes moreover waterlogging decreased the protein content of cowpea seeds increased the starch content and reduced the sucrose and phenolic contents in the waterlogged cowpea seeds at the r2 stage these changes in seed composition can be attributed to increased aba concentrations under waterlogging conditions which increased the activity of critical enzymes that convert soluble sugars to starch araki et al 2012 huang et al 2022 ren et al 2018 5 conclusion based on the results of the experiments in 2021 and 2022 we conclude that waterlogging at different growth stages of cowpea leads to significant reductions in plant growth physiology and seed yield epicselect 4 exhibited greater sensitivity to waterlogging stress at the r2 stage compared to ucr 369 showing larger reductions in leaf area 82 chlorophyll content 75 gs 96 and photochemical efficiency 39 these findings highlight the importance of genotype selection as a crucial practice to cope with waterlogging stress in cowpea cultivation furthermore our results demonstrate that cowpea genotypes are most sensitive to waterlogging during the r2 stage followed by the v4 and r7 stages with the r2 stage being particularly vulnerable due to the high energy demands of the cowpea reproductive process to sustain yield producers need to use cowpea genotypes that are tolerant to waterlogging during reproductive stages in addition developing cultivars that are not only tolerant to waterlogging stress but also yield well under normal weather conditions will provide a sustainable and resilient solution for cowpea cultivation in areas prone to increased waterlogging events this approach will not only help farmers to mitigate the negative impacts of waterlogging on cowpea yields but also improve the overall productivity and profitability of the crop therefore researchers and breeders must prioritize the development of tolerant cowpea cultivars such as ucr 369 to secure a resilient future for the crop and the farmers who rely on it funding the current research is based on work that is supported by the usda nifa hatch project under

sorghum were grown for 5 years 2002 2006 and sorghum pigeon pea intercrop and sole castor were grown for 3 years 2007 2009 under raised bed and flat bed conditions respectively the use of improved practices in vertisols produced 3 5 times higher yield compared to traditional practices with net returns estimated at us 800 1300 ha year compared to us 90 350 ha year under the traditional practice despite growing an additional crop chickpea yield under the improved practice was close to the yield obtained from the traditional practice in alfisols raised beds improved crop yields by 15 20

vertisols have high clay content develop deep cracks after drying and are difficult to plough when wet pathak et al 2016 hidalgo et al 2019 these soils occupy nearly 14 of the total arable land in the sat swindale 1981 poor drainage is one of the critical challenges during the rainy season therefore farmers prefer to keep their land fallow and raise crops using stored residual soil water during the post rainy season because vertisols have a relatively high water retention capacity selvaraju and ramaswami 1997 srinivasarao et al 2012 pal et al 2012 in contrast alfisols are characterized by high sand content and poor water retention capacity ahmad et al 2019 these soils occupy about 20 of the sat s arable land swindale 1981 soil crusting is a problem in alfisols pathak et al 2013 supplemental irrigation is critical to sustain crops during dry spells mandal et al 2007 sarker et al 2020 that are common during the rainy season in the sat growing a second crop during the post rainy season is only possible with the support of supplemental irrigation thus farmers in both alfisols and vertisols systems usually grow only one crop in the rainy or post rainy season kahinda et al 2007 sanfo et al 2017 vico et al 2020 such a challenges can be overcome through a range of land form management practices wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 fischer et al 2019 however a comprehensive analysis of the improved management of these soils is limited by the availability of sufficient hydrological agronomic and economic data long term field experiments at the international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics icrisat hyderabad have led to a large volume of meteorological hydrological and agronomic data for different cropping systems and land form conditions for both vertisols and alfisols with an overall objective to analyze such rich data this study aims to i suggest suitable cropping systems in terms of crop yield profitability and resource use efficiency and ii understand the impact of in situ land form management interventions on crop yields under both vertisols and alfisols we follow an interpretive machine learning iml approach padarian et al 2020 zhu et al 2021

watersheds the study was carried out at icrisat s research station 17 5192 n 78 2784 e in hyderabad india where alfisols and vertisols occur naturally within the farm making it a unique facility to undertake agricultural research covering both soil types two naturally drained watersheds of 2 5 ha representing alfisols and vertisols were monitored over a long period of time to generate data from the fields table 1 table 2 and fig 1 provide details of the location layout duration cropping system and land form management of the experiments 2 2 physical properties of vertisols and alfisols soil samples from 8 locations in vertisols and 24 locations in alfisols were collected to analyze their physical properties samples were collected at 15 cm depth interval to determine in situ dry bulk density using the core cutter method cresswell and hamilton 2002 soil textural fractions sand silt and clay content were determined using the hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 beverwijk 1967 organic carbon in these samples was analyzed using the walkley black wet oxidation method nelson and sommers 1982 soil water retention at 0 3 mpa field capacity and 15 0 mpa permanent wilting point were measured using pressure plate technique richards 1948 layer wise soil texture and retention parameters for vertisols and alfisols are presented in table 3 the sand content in vertisols ranged between 15 4 and 28 7 and clay content between 51 8 and 61 8 clay content increased with increasing depth silt content was almost consistent 20 6 22 7 across soil layers the field capacity of vertisols ranged from 0 28 to 0 40 w w and permanent wilting point between 0 21 and 0 31 w w bulk density of the top layers of vertisols was significantly lower 1 17 g cm3 compared to the deeper layers 1 33 1 36 g cm3 and organic carbon ranged between 0 16 and 0 27 as expected clay content plays a major role in vertisols giving high moisture retention capacity that can be directly correlated with their clay content 50 the soil depth of the experimental site was 1 8 m which can hold a maximum of 700 mm moisture and plant available water storage fc pwp of 200 mm alfisols are characterized by high sand content that ranges between 56 3 and 74 6 clay content between 18 1 and 35 4 and silt between 7 0 and 8 4 in different soil layers table 3 sand content decreased with increasing soil depth while clay content increased with soil depth field capacity and permanent wilting point were 0 11 and 0 06 w w in the top layers of alfisols compared to 0 13 0 17 and 0 07 0 10 w w respectively in the deeper layers bulk density of alfisols was between 1 45 g cm3 and 1 53 g cm3 and organic carbon ranged from 0 45 to 0 57 in different soil layers the soil depth of the experimental site was 1 0 m which can hold 200 mm water at field capacity and with a plant available water storage of 80 mm 2 3 experimental details 2 3 1 vertisol watersheds long term studies were undertaken between 1976 and 2009 in paired micro watersheds of almost similar size of 3 5 ha fig 1 of these raised beds were prepared in one of the watersheds as an improved practice while the other watershed was left with traditional flat bed conditions raised beds with 1 m wide and 0 5 m furrow were developed using a tropicultor singh et al 1999 khambalkar et al 2014 which function as mini bunds reducing the velocity of runoff and increasing water infiltration kampen and krantz 1976 intercropping of cereals and pulses sorghum pigeon pea or sequential cropping of cereals followed by pulses maize chickpea were practiced in raised beds table 1 sorghum pigeon pea intercropping and maize chickpea sequential cropping were followed in rotation for 34 years dry sowing was undertaken before the rainy season 2nd 3rd week of june as vertisols are difficult to manage under wet conditions and chickpea was sown in october the recommended dose of fertilizers 60 kg n ha and 20 kg p ha was applied to maintain soil fertility nitrogen was applied in split doses 50 as basal and the remaining at 30 days after sowing and phosphorus fertilizer was applied as a basal dose to represent farmers practice under vertisols the land was kept fallow during the rainy season and a sole crop of sorghum and chickpea was sown in two separate plots on a flat bed during october about 10 t ha of farmyard manure fym was applied every alternate year to represent the traditional practice data collected between 1976 and 2009 on sowing and harvesting dates are provided in table 1 crop cutting studies tek et al 2016 were conducted during the harvesting stage to determine crop yields from different experimental plots 2 3 2 alfisols watersheds the upstream side of the alfisols watershed was treated with raised beds and its downstream side was retained with flat beds fig 1 two cropping systems were followed at a time in both the raised beds and flat beds making it four treatments within a season sole sorghum and groundnut pigeon pea intercrop were followed between 2002 and 2006 for the next 3 years 2007 2009 sole castor and sorghum pigeon pea intercrop were adopted both in raised beds and flat beds table 2 shows the cropping system fertilizer dosage applied and sowing and harvesting months in the alfisols watershed crop cutting studies were undertaken during the harvesting stage to estimate crop yields from different experimental plots 2 4 meteorological and hydrological monitoring daily data on rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures pan evaporation and solar radiation were collected from the meteorological observatory located within one kilometer of the experimental sites fig 1 rainfall data was analyzed between 1978 and 2019 42 years to understand rainfall characteristics the analysis was done using the following classification dry year rainfall 20 of long term average normal year 20 of long term average and wet year rainfall 20 of long term average rao et al 2013 stage level recorders were installed in the paired watersheds to record surface runoff represented by g1 and g2 in alfisols and vertisols watersheds in fig 1 a stilling well was placed at the outlet which was hydraulically connected to the h flume the stage of the flowing water s depth was converted into water volume using a standard rating curve for different rainfall events chow 1959 kumar 2011 these stages were converted to values representing discharge runoff volume using the rating curves as detailed by pathak et al 2013 2016 and garg et al 2022a to understand the water utilization pattern from the root zone soil water content measurements were taken at bi monthly intervals in vertisol plots a soil core of 5 cm diameter was collected manually at every 15 cm up to a depth of 180 cm to measure soil water content through gravimetric method samples are collected from all 4 plots in vertisols during 2009 in alfisols tensiometers with pressure transducers soil measure sw 010 hubbell and sisson 1998 wang et al 1998 were installed at 60 75 cm 75 90 cm and 90 105 cm depths in all the plots for the bi monthly measurement of matric potential head between 2003 and 2009 2 5 water productivity data collected from all the experimental fields were analyzed to assess the influence of land form management interventions on surface runoff based on effective rainfall r eff which was estimated as the difference between measured rainfall mm and surface runoff mm values ali and mubarak 2017 as multiple crops were grown in four different fields it was difficult to compare the produce therefore crop yields and system level productivity for the entire year were analyzed by converting grain yield into sorghum equivalent yield sey such that all cropping systems could be compared assefa et al 2021 1

machine learning both step wise multiple linear regression mlr and random forest rf modeling breiman 2001 approaches were employed to estimate four response variables sey ni twp and ewp using five different predictor variables of cropping systems land form soil order effective rainfall r eff rainfall runoff and water regimes dry wet and normal based on the extent of rainfall the rf is an ensemble machine learning algorithm based on decision trees for which single decision trees are fitted by partitioning the covariate values of the calibration dataset partitions are evaluated based on a splitting metric and the partition providing the optimal value of the metric is selected this procedure is repeated until a user defined value of the node size is reached the prediction value of a single tree is taken as the average prediction of all nodes at the terminal leaf in rf an additional procedure of bootstrapping and aggregating is introduced where a user defined number of trees are built from bootstrap samples of the calibration data in each tree a random perturbation is further introduced where only a subset of the covariates is used for fitting the tree the final prediction from a rf model is the average of all the decision trees we also implemented a step wise mlr model which predicts a response variable based on several predictor variables both models were trained using 70 of the dataset and the remaining 30 was used to test their robustness to tune the hyper parameters of the models a ten fold cross validation technique is used the trained models were evaluated on the test data using coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and bias 5 r 2 1 j 1 n y j y ˆ j 2 j 1 n y j y 2 6 rmse 1 n j 1 n y j y ˆ j 2 7 bias j 1 n y ˆ j y j n where n is the number of observations y j and y ˆ j are the observed and predicted productivity parameters for the j th observation respectively and y j is the mean of the observed parameter after a predictive model was developed for a response variable we used the shapley additive explanation shap to quantify the influence of each predictor feature variable on a response variable lundberg and lee 2017 recent studies have shown that shap values may be used for determining the effects of environmental covariates on soil properties wadoux et al 2022 padarian et al 2020 similarly abramoff et al 2023 used these values to interpret the effects of climate change on global crop yield generally shap values are calculated for each observation in a training dataset the sum of shap values provides a quantitative measure for the deviation of estimated response variables at each observation point from the average estimate a positive shap value indicates that the predictor has a positive contribution on the corresponding response variable while the reverse is true for the negative values thus shap values provide both the local model explanation and a quantitative measure of how each feature variable influences a response variable at every observation point we used the kernelshap package ver 0 3 5 in the r software r core team 2023 to estimate shap values this package uses the kernelexplainer function which is an efficient and model agnostic method for estimating shap values for any model all the modeling and validation steps were carried out in rstudio 2023 03 0 rstudio team 2023 3 results 3 1 rainfall and other meteorological parameters annual rainfall at the study site ranged from 450 mm to 1500 mm with an average value of 860 mm nearly 85 of the annual rainfall was received between june and october which is the main cropping season in this region fig 2 shows the rainfall distribution pattern in a typical dry normal and wet year to illustrate the rainfall distribution and other meteorological parameters three different years were shown as dry normal and wet years the year 2002 was categorized as a dry year with a total rainfall of 522 mm between june and december runoff recorded during this year was negligible 20 mm in both vertisols and alfisols plots while the highest rainfall event during 2002 was about 40 mm its distribution was relatively uniform as the longest dry spell recorded during the year was less than 12 days the year 2003 was a normal year with 887 mm of rainfall of which about 70 644 mm was received during july to august further from the last week of august to the third week of september 25 days there was a long dry spell with the exception of one meagre rainfall event 8 mm total runoff volumes generated in the alfisols and vertisols during 2003 were in the order of about 181 198 mm and 85 141 mm respectively the year 2005 was a wet year with a total rainfall of 1072 mm which was well distributed with a combination of high to low intensity showers throughout the season total runoff volumes for such a wet year were in the order of 258 275 mm in alfisols and 224 344 mm in vertisols daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and pan evaporation values in selected dry 2002 normal 2003 and wet 2006 years are presented in fig 2 which show similar patterns across these water regimes for instance total pan evaporation between june and december was 1193 mm 1128 mm and 1022 mm in 2002 2003 and 2006 respectively average maximum and minimum temperatures in all three years between june and december were in the order of 30 c and 18 c respectively average solar radiation in 2002 2003 and 2006 was 17 mj m2 15 mj m2 and 16 mj m2 respectively 3 2 performance of improved and traditional practices 3 2 1 vertisols fig 3a shows the fluctuation in soil water contents and rainfall amounts during the year 2009 in the experimental vertisol plots of sorghum pigeon pea intercrop maize chickpea sequential cropping and fallow chickpea in the beginning of july total depth of soil water in the top 180 cm soil profile was estimated to be 480 520 mm which increased to about 600 mm by the end of october because of the monsoon rains soil water contents in fallow chickpea plots were slightly higher compared to those in maize chickpea or sorghum pigeon pea plots soil wetness started declining after october in all the three cropping systems by the end of december the total depth of soil water again reduced to about 550 mm 560 mm and 500 mm in the sorghum pigeon pea maize chickpea and fallow chickpea cropping systems fig 3b d show the volumetric soil water contents at different depths at the beginning of the rainy season 2 jul 2009 end of the rainy season 10 oct 2009 middle of the post rainy season 28 dec 2010 and end of the post rainy season 29 jan 2010 in the study plots moisture depletion was highest in the upper soil layers soil water contents at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depths fluctuated from 0 10 to 0 45 cm3 cm3 and 0 3 0 45 cm3 cm3 respectively soil water contents exceeded 0 40 cm3 cm3 across soil depths by the end of the rainy season in all the experimental plots moisture was depleted during the post rainy season due to water uptake by the crops chickpea or pigeon pea as residual moisture was the only source of water moisture depletion was prevalent up to a depth of 120 cm in fallow chickpea and moisture level of 0 45 cm3 cm3 across the soil profile declined to 0 30 0 40 cm3 cm3 at 30 90 cm depth and to 0 2 0 3 cm3 cm3 at 0 30 cm depth by the end of the post rainy season in maize chickpea high moisture depletion up to 180 cm depth was recorded indicating chickpea s deep rooting pattern fig 3c in sorghum pigeon pea intercrop moisture depletion was found up to 120 cm depth moisture level was higher than 0 40 cm3 cm3 below 120 cm and fluctuated to 0 30 cm3 cm3 between 30 and 120 cm and was 0 15 cm3 cm3 lower than the permanent wilting point in the top layers 0 30 cm fig 4 shows crop yields in raised beds and flat beds in the vertisol experiments in the flat beds chickpea and sorghum which were cultivated in two different plots during the post rainy season produced average yields of 1 2 t ha and 1 1 t ha respectively however the yields ranged from 1 0 to 1 4 t ha in chickpea and 0 6 1 6 t ha in sorghum within the interquartile range of the experimental data set in the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop sorghum which was harvested first produced an average of 3 3 t ha interquartile range of 3 1 4 0 t ha pigeon pea yield was about 1 1 t ha similarly maize chickpea sequential cropping under raised beds yielded an average of 4 6 t ha of maize interquartile range of 3 8 4 9 t ha and 1 4 t ha of chickpea interquartile range of 1 2 1 7 t ha a comparison of yields obtained from different cropping systems in vertisols under dry normal and wet years table 4 showed that out of the 34 years of field experiments 20 years were normal with an average rainfall june october of 750 mm 9 were wet years with an average rainfall of 1100 mm and 5 years were dry with 530 mm rainfall in sole sorghum grown under flat beds where only post rainy crops are cultivated using residual soil water content no significant difference in yield was observed between dry normal and wet years however average yield during the normal year was marginally higher 1 16 t ha compared to 1 1 t ha during dry years and 1 08 t ha during wet years in sole chickpea average yield was 1 2 t ha in normal years 1 15 t ha in dry years and 0 99 t ha in wet years in sorghum pigeon pea intercrop average sorghum yield was the highest in dry years 3 9 t ha which declined with increasing rainfall 3 52 t ha in normal years and 3 11 t ha in wet years as sorghum does not tolerate waterlogged conditions even for short periods pardales et al 1991 crop yields were affected despite the raised beds that facilitate to dispose of excess runoff the pigeon pea crop benefited from increasing rainfall owing to its deep root system 120 cm refer fig 4d that could tolerate waterlogging while also meeting water demand in wet years the average pigeon pea yield in dry years was 0 7 t ha compared to 1 1 t ha and 1 34 t ha in normal and wet years respectively this is the reason sorghum pigeon pea intercropping is widely practiced in the vertisols of northern karnataka southern telangana and maharashtra states rao and willey 1983 wani et al 2017 a similar trend was observed in maize chickpea sequential cropping where maize yields were the best in dry years 4 79 t ha compared to normal 4 33 t ha and wet years 4 09 t ha average chickpea yield increased with increase in rainfall during monsoons as it directly affected residual soil water content levels fig 4b c a comparison of sorghum equivalent yield estimated for all four cropping systems during dry normal and wet years table 4 showed that sey in sole sorghum ranged from 1 1 t ha to 1 16 t ha compared to 2 13 t ha to 2 59 t ha in sorghum pigeon pea intercropping it ranged between 5 93 t ha and 7 0 t ha in sorghum pigeon pea and 6 4 t ha and 6 7 t ha in maize chickpea sequential cropping this clearly indicates that sorghum pigeon pea intercropping and maize chickpea sequential cropping systems are superior to traditional practices while overall productivity increased with increasing rainfall in the improved practice it was mostly stagnant in the traditional practice during the study period 1976 2009 3 2 2 alfisols matric potential head was measured at 60 105 cm depth under different cropping systems sole sorghum sole castor fig 5a and groundnut pigeon pea and sorghum pigeon pea fig 5b in both raised beds and flat beds in sole sorghum and castor matric potential head reached a matric potential of 600 to 700 cm indicating that the crops have utilized residual moisture up to 1 m depth while matric potential head in the rainy season generally ranged from 0 to 300 cm it increased during dry spells and post rainy period more water depletion was recorded in intercropping compared to sole cropping matric potential heads with 60 105 cm soil layers in almost all the years reached to about 600 to 800 cm a comparison between raised beds and flat beds revealed lower matric potential head in the former than in the latter most of the time suggesting that raised beds harvested extra surface runoff which was available for subsequent crop utilization fig 5 also shows the sensitivity of matric potential heads to total rainfall and its distribution for example matric potential head was much higher 300 cm in wet years 2006 2007 compared to normal years 2003 2004 groundnut pigeon pea intercropping and sole sorghum were grown on raised beds and flat beds during 2002 2006 the average crop yield obtained from sole sorghum was 2 2 t ha range 1 3 2 5 t ha under flat beds compared to 2 5 t ha range 1 7 2 95 t ha under raised beds fig 6a b in the groundnut pigeon pea intercrop average groundnut yield was 0 3 t ha 0 2 1 25 t ha on flat beds compared to 0 35 t ha 0 3 1 5 t ha on raised beds pigeon pea which was harvested 3 months after groundnut gave 1 t ha under flat beds compared to 1 3 t ha under raised beds raised beds had an advantage of about 5 20 in terms of crop productivity a large variability in yield was observed during the study years experiments were undertaken during 2007 2009 with sole castor and sorghum pigeon pea intercrop under raised beds and flat beds average yield obtained from sole castor from flat beds and raised beds were 0 6 t ha and 0 9 t ha respectively fig 6c and d in the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop sorghum yield was 1 4 t ha in flat beds compared to 2 0 t ha in raised beds while pigeon pea yielded 0 6 t ha on flat beds compared to 0 8 t ha on raised beds table 5 shows the yields from different cropping system under both land form conditions in dry normal and wet years in alfisols between 2002 and 2006 2 years were normal with 750 mm rainfall 2 were wet with 1070 mm rainfall and 1 year was dry with 573 mm rainfall yields from sole sorghum were the highest in wet years 2 6 2 8 t ha followed by dry and normal years in the groundnut pigeon pea intercrop average groundnut yield in normal years ranged between 0 3 t ha and 0 4 t ha and pigeon pea yielded between 0 65 t ha and 0 87 t ha however yields obtained during dry and wet year were relatively higher rainfall distribution played an important role in fulfilling crop water requirement for example the year 2002 was a dry year with 573 mm rainfall but better rainfall distribution led to maximum yields fig 2 highest productivity was achieved in the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop 6 5 7 8 t ha followed by sole castor 3 8 4 5 t ha groundnut pigeon pea intercrop 2 62 3 5 t ha and sole sorghum 1 7 2 1 t ha 3 3 production function 3 3 1 vertisols a production function was developed to describe the relationship between effective rainfall and crop yield fig 7a shows the relationship between effective rainfall and yield of sorghum or maize and chickpea or pigeon pea obtained during different years fig 7b and c show the relationship between effective rainfall and yield of sorghum and chickpea grown on flat beds higher effective rainfall had a negative impact on maize and sorghum yields in flat beds while it had a positive impact on chickpea or pigeon pea yields in raised beds higher residual moisture helped both intercropped and sequential crops meet their water requirements when grown on raised beds it is interesting to note that in the traditional system of farming in which land is left fallow during the rainy season and a sole sorghum or chickpea crop is grown using residual moisture there was no positive correlation with effective monsoon rainfall therefore there was no additional yield gain in sole cropping compared to intercropping rather it correlated negatively as yield declined when soil water content was higher during wet years 3 3 2 alfisols the relationship between effective rainfall and sole sorghum yield in alfisols is presented in fig 8a the relationship between crop yield and rainfall was positive up to 600 mm after which it turned negative sorghum requires less water that is largely met with around 600 mm of rainfall and hence yields optimally bell et al 2020 assefa et al 2010 high rainfall may affect the crop negatively as it is sensitive to prolonged moisture availability and waterlogging that hinders grain formation the relationship between effective rainfall and groundnut and pigeon pea yields did not show a clear trend rainfall variability rather than total rainfall received appeared more responsible for crop yield the production function for castor and pigeon pea crops could not be established under the second phase of these experiments as adequate data sets were not available 3 4 water productivity and net returns 3 4 1 vertisols table 4 compares the annual net returns obtained from improved practices sorghum pigeon pea intercrop and maize chickpea sequential crop and traditional practices fallow sole sorghum or chickpea during normal years average annual net returns from the improved practice was us 1037 1284 ha compared to us 150 358 ha from the traditional practice in dry years it was us 889 1241 ha year from the improved practice compared to us 87 333 ha year from the traditional one net returns in normal and wet years were higher than in dry years in the improved practice only normal years showed better net returns compared to dry and wet years in the traditional practice this suggests that with increased rainfall there was effective resource utilization resulting in better returns under the improved practice compared to the poor resource utilization in the traditional practice annual net returns from maize chickpea sequential cropping us 1284 ha was the best followed by sorghum pigeon pea intercropping us 1037 ha and sole chickpea us 358 ha and sole post rainy sorghum us 150 ha the sorghum equivalent water productivity se wp in vertisols is presented in fig 9a d and table 4 the amount of water captured within the landscape rainfall runoff was taken in to account to estimate water productivity however a fraction that might have percolated deep was not included in this analysis water productivity in the improved practice ranged between 0 8 kg m3 and 1 25 kg m3 compared to between 0 08 kg m3 and 0 16 kg m3 in the traditional system clearly indicating that the former was 5 8 times better than the latter water productivity in the improved practice was the highest in dry years 1 1 1 25 kg m3 followed by normal 0 99 1 02 kg m3 and wet years 0 80 0 81 kg m3 under the traditional practice it was relatively higher in normal years 0 20 0 44 kg m3 and dry years 0 17 0 51 kg m3 compared to wet years 0 15 0 30 kg m3 economic water productivity ewp was calculated in vertisols table 4 and fig 10 a d demonstrating the economic returns from the use of every m3 of fresh water in different cropping systems in the improved practice it ranged between us 0 13 and us 0 24 m3 compared to between us 0 02 and us 0 07 m3 in the traditional practice in maize chickpea sequential cropping it was the highest us 0 16 0 24 m3 followed by the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop us 0 13 0 16 m3 sole chickpea us 0 04 0 07 m3 and post rainy sorghum us 0 016 0 025 m3 3 4 2 alfisols net returns from different cropping systems in alfisols are presented in fig 10 e h and table 5 under the groundnut pigeon pea intercrop during dry year net return was us 1637 1821 ha compared to us 429 553 ha in a normal year and us 1099 1139 ha in wet years as rainfall variability played an important role in crop production especially in alfisols the net income from dry years was highest compared to that from normal and wet years however long term data are needed for a better understanding of the trend in the second phase of the experiments net returns obtained from sorghum pigeon pea intercrop was us 1345 1569 ha and from sole castor us 766 831 ha raised beds helped realize a gain of us 100 ha on an average a comparison of all the four cropping systems showed maximum net return accruing from sorghum pigeon pea intercrop us 1345 1569 ha followed by sole castor us 766 831 ha and groundnut pigeon pea intercrop us 429 553 ha and sole sorghum us 275 308 ha further a comparison of sorghum equivalent wp indicated that water productivity from raised beds was 0 39 1 14 kg m3 compared to 0 30 1 0 kg m3 in flat beds the highest water productivity was obtained from sorghum pigeon pea intercrop 1 0 1 14 kg m3 followed by sole castor 0 61 0 67 kg m3 groundnut pigeon pea intercrop 0 5 0 66 kg m3 and sole sorghum 0 3 0 39 kg m3 the economic water productivity ewp in sorghum pigeon pea intercrop was us 0 21 0 23 m3 followed by sole castor us 0 12 0 13 m3 groundnut pigeon pea intercrop us 0 08 0 11 m3 and sole sorghum us 0 05 0 06 m3 fig 10 e h and table 5 3 5 estimation of crop and water productivity parameters table 6 shows the results of mlr and rf model validation for estimating four different crop and water productivity parameters as expected the rf approach provided a superior prediction accuracy with r2 values in the range of 0 74 for the sey to 0 80 for the ewp compared to the mlr approach r2 range 0 59 0 70 resulting rmse values ranged from us 0 04 m3 for ewp to us 236 ha for the net income we also performed a 10 fold cross validation results not shown and observed superior performance of rf models over mlr approaches consistently lower performance of the mlr models implies that there are non linear relationships in these datasets which mlr models fail to capture the resulting rank correlation coefficients kendall tau shown in the table 7 also suggest the presence of strong nonlinearity for both land form and cropping system features although extensive hyperparameter tuning was conducted to find out the best set of hyperparameters leading to the minimum cross validated prediction error we observed overfitting in the case of net income with its high bias value at us 17 13 ha nevertheless the scatter plots in fig 11 show close proximity of observed vs predicted response variables around 1 1 line suggesting that the rf model captured the observed variability in our datasets the results of interpretive machine learning approach captured with the shap values are summarized in fig 12 we considered five key feature variables of cropping systems effective rainfall land form soil order and water regime wet vs dry soil water regimes fig 12 shows these feature variables ranked in descending order of importance based on mean absolute shap values for each of the four predicted variables sey ewp ni a and ewp each point on the shap plot represents a data point in the trained model and has the same unit as its predicted variable e g shap value for sey has the unit of t ha because four out of five feature variables were categorical in nature shap plots show clustering of points along the x y plane annotations for each cluster belonging to a subclass shown as numbers of these categorical variables are also shown in this figure interestingly cropping system shows the highest mean feature importance for all the productivity parameters response variables followed by effective rainfall in three out of four cases specifically the sorghum pigeon pea intercropping subclass 1 and maize chickpea sequence subclass 2 have a positive impact on all the productivity parameters practicing these cropping systems increased the mean sey values up to 2 t ha fig 12a and ni a to about us 250 750 ha fig 12c on the other hand fallow sorghum subclass 3 and sorghum fallow subclass 7 cropping sequences negatively influenced all the productivity parameters reducing sey to the tune of 1 75 t ha fig 12a and ni a up to us 416 ha fig 12c in the case of land form the bbf land form showed positive influence on sey with an increase in the yield in the range of 0 5 1 t ha fig 12a whereas the flat bed type of land form has a significant negative impact on sey reducing yield to the tune of 0 24 0 69 t ha fig 12a fig 12 also shows that soil order plays a distinct role in influencing both yield and water use with superior overall system performance in alfisols than in vertisols although effective rainfall greater than 750 mm appears to increase sey to the tune of 0 25 1 25 t ha fig 12a wet or dry water regimes appear to play a limited role in influencing productivity parameters except for the net income which can increase for the wet years water regime 3 thus the shap values show consistent and quantifiable influence each feature variable bears on yield and water productivity parameters 4 discussion 4 1 opportunities for sustainable crop intensification the preceding section revealed how improved practices comprising land form management and a selection of suitable cropping systems not only enhanced resource land and water use efficiency but also led to higher productivity the raised bed method and dry sowing in vertisols facilitated double cropping in a year compared to single cropping in the traditional practice the long term field experiments also revealed that such intercropping and sequential cropping used available moisture more efficiently than in the traditional practice in the improved practice total production increased with increasing rainfall as there was consistent demand to utilize soil wetness for crop use on the contrary the traditional practice that targeted only the post rainy season to cultivate crops failed to use soil wetness effectively a significant amount of soil wetness that builds up during the rainy season is lost to non productive evaporation in the absence of crop cover while only marginal use of residual soil wetness occurs during the post rainy season in such conditions water productivity was 4 5 times lower in the traditional practice compared to the improved practice under the improved practice when the first crop which is generally of a short duration is harvested the intercrop which is often of a long duration and with deep roots avails the space and moisture from deeper soil layers to pick up growth so even if the rains are in excess of normal the deep rooted long duration crop can make use of the additional moisture to produce better yields this holds true for both intercrops and sequential crops in sequential cropping preparing the seed bed immediately after harvesting the preceding crop is convenient under the improved practice compared to the traditional one this is so because the preceding crop creates a favorable moisture regime quickly and sowing can be undertaken immediately after the harvest or by taking up sowing in the inter spaces relay crop under the traditional practice high moisture availability especially in the top soil layers could hinder timely sowing and delayed rains could further prolong sowing in alfisols rainfall distribution rather than total amount of rainfall is more critical to crop growth the soil s poor water retention capacity coupled with the absence of supplemental irrigation affects crops adversely during dry spells for example groundnut yield was much lower during 2003 which was a normal year compared to that in 2002 which was a dry year a spell of about 25 dry days during the crop season severely affected groundnut yields in 2003 this goes to show the importance of the choice of a cropping system in alfisols of the four cropping systems tested in two phases sorghum pigeon pea intercrop performed the best since sorghum requires less water it can partially withstand water scarce conditions while pigeon pea can utilize residual moisture from deep soil layers the poor yield of groundnut was largely responsible for the poor performance of the system especially due to the long dry spells which are common in the sat singh et al 2014b one or two supplemental irrigations could dramatically improve crop yields mandal et al 2020 sole castor performed better than groundnut pigeon pea intercrop and sole sorghum both in terms of net returns and water productivity castor is a commercial oilseed crop that is drought tolerant and also gives better economic returns babita et al 2010 the performance of all the four cropping systems was better under raised beds due to better drainage facility pathak et al 2016 have shown that raised beds in alfisols were helpful in harvesting 10 15 mm of additional soil water content while reducing soil loss by more than 50 anantha et al 2021a anantha et al 2021b all these factors contributed to a yield gain of 5 15 and additional economic returns of us 80 100 ha including the additional cost of preparing raised beds 4 2 comparison with other studies a few studies have explained the importance of land form management in crop intensification improving soil hydraulic properties and crop yields in similar agro ecological regions nouri et al 2019 reported results from a 34 year long term study in the alfisols of sub humid southeastern usa in which tillage and cover crops had an impact on soil hydraulic properties the incorporation of cover crops and no tillage practices improved infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity which was largely due to aggregation of soil structure liu et al 2020 using data from 4 years of field study conducted in the rainfed agriculture system of arid and semi arid provinces of china reported enhanced maize yield 50 more water use efficiency and economic benefits minimum by 140 through the use of ridge furrow system of land form treatment and plastic mulching compared to control treatments three years of field experiments in alfisols jensen et al 2003 in semi arid tanzania demonstrated the advantage of climate risks mitigation practices such as tied ridges and nutrient application to bridge the yield gap in a maize based cropping system a combination of tied ridge tillage and balanced fertilizer led to maize yields of 6 t ha compared to 1 t ha using farmer s practice rao et al 2015 studied the feasibility of double cropping in vertisols and balanced fertilizer application using 15 years of long term data in the sat of southern india sorghum chickpea or mungbean sorghum sequential cropping showed better resource use efficiency land water and nutrients compared to sole chickpea grown under traditional farmer s practice our results demonstrate the possibility of bridging large yield gaps in the dry semi arid tropics the application of supplemental irrigation can reduce the risk of intermittent dry spells common in the sat that impact profitable crop production in alfisols kumar et al 2016 the results also indicate that about 17 130 mm of runoff that was generated during normal years holds potential for rainwater harvesting for supplemental irrigation the construction of a 300 m3 10mx10mx3m farm pond can harvest about 50 of the runoff generated from 1 ha considering a minimum of two fillings during the rainy season singh et al 2014a anantha et al 2021b garg et al 2021 the water will be enough to provide one or two life saving irrigations during critical crop growth stages coinciding with dry spells results of the machine learning based interpretations are also consistent with the previous studies for instance sreedevi et al 2006 have shown that the maize chickpea and sorghum pigeon pea intercropping systems are beneficial where farmers could profit to the tune of us 365 430 ha respectively they also showed that the bbf type of land form practice can increase both sorghum yield and water productivity compared to the flat bed land form conservation of both soil and soil water contents in the bbf system of land preparation benefits farmers while draining out excess water during heavy rains similarly the shap value results are consistent with the observations of higher sorghum yield in alfisols than vertisols conducted in the same study site sahrawat et al 1995 this study also provides an in depth understanding of how various cropping systems can optimize available resources for sustainable crop intensification 5 conclusions long term field experiments were undertaken on alfisols and vertisols at the icrisat research farm to evaluate different cropping systems in vertisols a 34 year experiment was undertaken following double cropping improved practice on raised beds and comparing it with a sole crop on flat beds traditional practice sorghum pigeon pea intercrop or maize chickpea sequential cropping was followed under the improved practice whereas sole sorghum and chickpea were grown using residual soil water content under the traditional practice field experiments in alfisols were undertaken for 8 years between 2002 and 2009 by following raised bed and flat bed methods experiments were undertaken in two phases the cropping systems followed during the first phase were groundnut pigeon pea intercrop and sole sorghum between 2002 and 2006 and during the second phase between 2007 and 2009 sorghum pigeon pea intercrop and sole castor surface runoff and soil water contents were monitored in all the experimental watersheds along with agronomic measurements following are key findings of the study the average runoff generated in vertisols during a normal year was 10 of the total rainfall received 750 mm compared to 17 in alfisols runoff recorded in the dry years was less than 4 of the total rainfall in both the soil types alfisols which have poor water retention capacity provide the opportunity to harvest surface runoff through low cost water harvesting structures such as farm ponds vertisols have immense potential for sustainable crop intensification by following land form management treatments such as raised beds and appropriate cropping systems cereals pulses rotation or intercropping improved methods of cultivation in vertisols produced 6 0 7 0 t ha sey compared to only 1 0 2 6 t ha sey with traditional practices net returns obtained with improved production systems ranged between us 800 ha and us 1300 ha compared to us 92 ha and us 350 ha in the traditional practice further technical and economic water productivity were 3 5 folds higher in improved practices compared to traditional practices maize chickpea sequential cropping was superior followed by sorghum pigeon pea intercropping sole chickpea and sole sorghum in alfisols raised beds performed better than flat beds in terms of additional crop yield 10 15 and net returns us 80 100 ha year in terms of net returns sorghum pigeon pea intercrop us 1340 1570 ha year was the best followed by sole castor us 760 830 ha year groundnut pigeon pea intercrop us 430 550 ha year and sole sorghum us 270 300 ha year castor and pigeon pea being drought tolerant as well as high value crops brought higher economic returns compared to sole sorghum or groundnut pigeon pea intercropping intermittent droughts in groundnut crop led to poor yields even during normal years effective rainfall strongly correlated with pigeon pea or chickpea yields in vertisols under raised beds available soil water content was utilized more productively compared to that in the traditional practice despite raising a crop during the rainy season chickpea which was cultivated post monsoon performed equally or better under the improved practice compared to the traditional one intercropping and raised beds were found to be promising interventions especially in alfisols for better resource utilization in vertisols raised beds coupled with improved cultivation practices were promising options for crop intensification and enhanced resource use efficiency the study provided insights into the performance of different cropping systems in major soil types in the sat apart from revealing opportunities to harvest surface runoff

8921,land and water management interventions are key to achieving sustainable intensification in the drylands this study explores opportunities for doing so in vertisols and alfisols using 34 year 1976 2009 long term experimental data four cropping systems were evaluated in each soil types with two land form management interventions i e raised beds and flat beds surface runoff generated and soil water content in each system were monitored along with crop yields in vertisols maize chickpea sequential cropping and sorghum pigeon pea intercropping on raised beds representing an improved practice was followed for 34 years 1976 2009 sole chickpea and sole sorghum were grown on flat beds as a traditional system during the same period in alfisols groundnut pigeon pea intercrop and sole sorghum were grown for 5 years 2002 2006 and sorghum pigeon pea intercrop and sole castor were grown for 3 years 2007 2009 under raised bed and flat bed conditions respectively the use of improved practices in vertisols produced 3 5 times higher yield compared to traditional practices with net returns estimated at us 800 1300 ha year compared to us 90 350 ha year under the traditional practice despite growing an additional crop chickpea yield under the improved practice was close to the yield obtained from the traditional practice in alfisols raised beds improved crop yields by 15 20 compared to the flat bed method leading to an additional net return of us 80 100 ha year sorghum pigeon pea intercrop was found to be superior followed by sole castor groundnut pigeon pea intercrop

et al 2020 singh et al 2021 anantha et al 2022 garg et al 2022a garg et al 2022b semi arid tropics sat in peninsular india are dominated by two contrasting soil types i e vertisols and alfisols vertisols have high clay content develop deep cracks after drying and are difficult to plough when wet pathak et al 2016 hidalgo et al 2019 these soils occupy nearly 14 of the total arable land in the sat swindale 1981 poor drainage is one of the critical challenges during the rainy season therefore farmers prefer to keep their land fallow and raise crops using stored residual soil water during the post rainy season because vertisols have a relatively high water retention capacity selvaraju and ramaswami 1997 srinivasarao et al 2012 pal et al 2012 in contrast alfisols are characterized by high sand content and poor water retention capacity ahmad et al 2019 these soils occupy about 20 of the sat s arable land swindale 1981 soil crusting is a problem in alfisols pathak et al 2013 supplemental irrigation is critical to sustain crops during dry spells mandal et al 2007 sarker et al 2020 that are common during the rainy season in the sat growing a second crop during the post rainy season is only possible with the support of supplemental irrigation thus farmers in both alfisols and vertisols systems usually grow only one crop in the rainy or post rainy season kahinda et al 2007 sanfo et al 2017 vico et al 2020 such a challenges can be overcome through a range of land form management practices wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 fischer et al 2019 however a comprehensive analysis of the improved management of these soils is limited by the availability of sufficient hydrological agronomic and economic data long term field experiments at the international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics icrisat hyderabad have led to a large volume of meteorological hydrological and agronomic data for different cropping systems and land form conditions for both vertisols and alfisols with an overall objective to analyze such rich data this study aims to i suggest suitable cropping systems in terms of crop yield profitability and resource use efficiency and ii understand the impact of in situ land form management interventions on crop yields under both vertisols and alfisols we follow an interpretive machine learning iml approach padarian et al 2020 zhu et al 2021

watersheds the study was carried out at icrisat s research station 17 5192 n 78 2784 e in hyderabad india where alfisols and vertisols occur naturally within the farm making it a unique facility to undertake agricultural research covering both soil types two naturally drained watersheds of 2 5 ha representing alfisols and vertisols were monitored over a long period of time to generate data from the fields table 1 table 2 and fig 1 provide details of the location layout duration cropping system and land form management of the experiments 2 2 physical properties of vertisols and alfisols soil samples from 8 locations in vertisols and 24 locations in alfisols were collected to analyze their physical properties samples were collected at 15 cm depth interval to determine in situ dry bulk density using the core cutter method cresswell and hamilton 2002 soil textural fractions sand silt and clay content were determined using the hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 beverwijk 1967 organic carbon in these samples was analyzed using the walkley black wet oxidation method nelson and sommers 1982 soil water retention at 0 3 mpa field capacity and 15 0 mpa permanent wilting point were measured using pressure plate technique richards 1948 layer wise soil texture and retention parameters for vertisols and alfisols are presented in table 3 the sand content in vertisols ranged between 15 4 and 28 7 and clay content between 51 8 and 61 8 clay content increased with increasing depth silt content was almost consistent 20 6 22 7 across soil layers the field capacity of vertisols ranged from 0 28 to 0 40 w w and permanent wilting point between 0 21 and 0 31 w w bulk density of the top layers of vertisols was significantly lower 1 17 g cm3 compared to the deeper layers 1 33 1 36 g cm3 and organic carbon ranged between 0 16 and 0 27 as expected clay content plays a major role in vertisols giving high moisture retention capacity that can be directly correlated with their clay content 50 the soil depth of the experimental site was 1 8 m which can hold a maximum of 700 mm moisture and plant available water storage fc pwp of 200 mm alfisols are characterized by high sand content that ranges between 56 3 and 74 6 clay content between 18 1 and 35 4 and silt between 7 0 and 8 4 in different soil layers table 3 sand content decreased with increasing soil depth while clay content increased with soil depth field capacity and permanent wilting point were 0 11 and 0 06 w w in the top layers of alfisols compared to 0 13 0 17 and 0 07 0 10 w w respectively in the deeper layers bulk density of alfisols was between 1 45 g cm3 and 1 53 g cm3 and organic carbon ranged from 0 45 to 0 57 in different soil layers the soil depth of the experimental site was 1 0 m which can hold 200 mm water at field capacity and with a plant available water storage of 80 mm 2 3 experimental details 2 3 1 vertisol watersheds long term studies were undertaken between 1976 and 2009 in paired micro watersheds of almost similar size of 3 5 ha fig 1 of these raised beds were prepared in one of the watersheds as an improved practice while the other watershed was left with traditional flat bed conditions raised beds with 1 m wide and 0 5 m furrow were developed using a tropicultor singh et al 1999 khambalkar et al 2014 which function as mini bunds reducing the velocity of runoff and increasing water infiltration kampen and krantz 1976 intercropping of cereals and pulses sorghum pigeon pea or sequential cropping of cereals followed by pulses maize chickpea were practiced in raised beds table 1 sorghum pigeon pea intercropping and maize chickpea sequential cropping were followed in rotation for 34 years dry sowing was undertaken before the rainy season 2nd 3rd week of june as vertisols are difficult to manage under wet conditions and chickpea was sown in october the recommended dose of fertilizers 60 kg n ha and 20 kg p ha was applied to maintain soil fertility nitrogen was applied in split doses 50 as basal and the remaining at 30 days after sowing and phosphorus fertilizer was applied as a basal dose to represent farmers practice under vertisols the land was kept fallow during the rainy season and a sole crop of sorghum and chickpea was sown in two separate plots on a flat bed during october about 10 t ha of farmyard manure fym was applied every alternate year to represent the traditional practice data collected between 1976 and 2009 on sowing and harvesting dates are provided in table 1 crop cutting studies tek et al 2016 were conducted during the harvesting stage to determine crop yields from different experimental plots 2 3 2 alfisols watersheds the upstream side of the alfisols watershed was treated with raised beds and its downstream side was retained with flat beds fig 1 two cropping systems were followed at a time in both the raised beds and flat beds making it four treatments within a season sole sorghum and groundnut pigeon pea intercrop were followed between 2002 and 2006 for the next 3 years 2007 2009 sole castor and sorghum pigeon pea intercrop were adopted both in raised beds and flat beds table 2 shows the cropping system fertilizer dosage applied and sowing and harvesting months in the alfisols watershed crop cutting studies were undertaken during the harvesting stage to estimate crop yields from different experimental plots 2 4 meteorological and hydrological monitoring daily data on rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures pan evaporation and solar radiation were collected from the meteorological observatory located within one kilometer of the experimental sites fig 1 rainfall data was analyzed between 1978 and 2019 42 years to understand rainfall characteristics the analysis was done using the following classification dry year rainfall 20 of long term average normal year 20 of long term average and wet year rainfall 20 of long term average rao et al 2013 stage level recorders were installed in the paired watersheds to record surface runoff represented by g1 and g2 in alfisols and vertisols watersheds in fig 1 a stilling well was placed at the outlet which was hydraulically connected to the h flume the stage of the flowing water s depth was converted into water volume using a standard rating curve for different rainfall events chow 1959 kumar 2011 these stages were converted to values representing discharge runoff volume using the rating curves as detailed by pathak et al 2013 2016 and garg et al 2022a to understand the water utilization pattern from the root zone soil water content measurements were taken at bi monthly intervals in vertisol plots a soil core of 5 cm diameter was collected manually at every 15 cm up to a depth of 180 cm to measure soil water content through gravimetric method samples are collected from all 4 plots in vertisols during 2009 in alfisols tensiometers with pressure transducers soil measure sw 010 hubbell and sisson 1998 wang et al 1998 were installed at 60 75 cm 75 90 cm and 90 105 cm depths in all the plots for the bi monthly measurement of matric potential head between 2003 and 2009 2 5 water productivity data collected from all the experimental fields were analyzed to assess the influence of land form management interventions on surface runoff based on effective rainfall r eff which was estimated as the difference between measured rainfall mm and surface runoff mm values ali and mubarak 2017 as multiple crops were grown in four different fields it was difficult to compare the produce therefore crop yields and system level productivity for the entire year were analyzed by converting grain yield into sorghum equivalent yield sey such that all cropping systems could be compared assefa et al 2021 1 sey i y i p i p s where y i is the plot yield t ha of i th crop to be converted into its sey t ha p i is the price of the crop us t and p s us t is the price of sorghum similarly net returns ni a assefa et al 2021 technical water productivity twp ren et al 2021 and economic water productivity ewp wani et al 2017 values were estimated as follows 2 ni a us ha year i 1 n y i p i coc i 3 twp kg m

machine learning both step wise multiple linear regression mlr and random forest rf modeling breiman 2001 approaches were employed to estimate four response variables sey ni twp and ewp using five different predictor variables of cropping systems land form soil order effective rainfall r eff rainfall runoff and water regimes dry wet and normal based on the extent of rainfall the rf is an ensemble machine learning algorithm based on decision trees for which single decision trees are fitted by partitioning the covariate values of the calibration dataset partitions are evaluated based on a splitting metric and the partition providing the optimal value of the metric is selected this procedure is repeated until a user defined value of the node size is reached the prediction value of a single tree is taken as the average prediction of all nodes at the terminal leaf in rf an additional procedure of bootstrapping and aggregating is introduced where a user defined number of trees are built from bootstrap samples of the calibration data in each tree a random perturbation is further introduced where only a subset of the covariates is used for fitting the tree the final prediction from a rf model is the average of all the decision trees we also implemented a step wise mlr model which predicts a response variable based on several predictor variables both models were trained using 70 of the dataset and the remaining 30 was used to test their robustness to tune the hyper parameters of the models a ten fold cross validation technique is used the trained models were evaluated on the test data using coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and bias 5 r 2 1 j 1 n y j y ˆ j 2 j 1 n y j y 2 6 rmse 1 n j 1 n y j y ˆ j 2 7 bias j 1 n y ˆ j y j n where n is the number of observations y j and y ˆ j are the observed and predicted productivity parameters for the j th observation respectively and y j is the mean of the observed parameter after a predictive model was developed for a response variable we used the shapley additive explanation shap to quantify the influence of each predictor feature variable on a response variable lundberg and lee 2017 recent studies have shown that shap values may be used for determining the effects of environmental covariates on soil properties wadoux et al 2022 padarian et al 2020 similarly abramoff et al 2023 used these values to interpret the effects of climate change on global crop yield generally shap values are calculated for each observation in a training dataset the sum of shap values provides a quantitative measure for the deviation of estimated response variables at each observation point from the average estimate a positive shap value indicates that the predictor has a positive contribution on the corresponding response variable while the reverse is true for the negative values thus shap values provide both the local model explanation and a quantitative measure of how each feature variable influences a response variable at every observation point we used the kernelshap package ver 0 3 5 in the r software r core team 2023 to estimate shap values this package uses the kernelexplainer function which is an efficient and model agnostic method for estimating shap values for any model all the modeling and validation steps were carried out in rstudio 2023 03 0 rstudio team 2023 3 results 3 1 rainfall and other meteorological parameters annual rainfall at the study site ranged from 450 mm to 1500 mm with an average value of 860 mm nearly 85 of the annual rainfall was received between june and october which is the main cropping season in this region fig 2 shows the rainfall distribution pattern in a typical dry normal and wet year to illustrate the rainfall distribution and other meteorological parameters three different years were shown as dry normal and wet years the year 2002 was categorized as a dry year with a total rainfall of 522 mm between june and december runoff recorded during this year was negligible 20 mm in both vertisols and alfisols plots while the highest rainfall event during 2002 was about 40 mm its distribution was relatively uniform as the longest dry spell recorded during the year was less than 12 days the year 2003 was a normal year with 887 mm of rainfall of which about 70 644 mm was received during july to august further from the last week of august to the third week of september 25 days there was a long dry spell with the exception of one meagre rainfall event 8 mm total runoff volumes generated in the alfisols and vertisols during 2003 were in the order of about 181 198 mm and 85 141 mm respectively the year 2005 was a wet year with a total rainfall of 1072 mm which was well distributed with a combination of high to low intensity showers throughout the season total runoff volumes for such a wet year were in the order of 258 275 mm in alfisols and 224 344 mm in vertisols daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and pan evaporation values in selected dry 2002 normal 2003 and wet 2006 years are presented in fig 2 which show similar patterns across these water regimes for instance total pan evaporation between june and december was 1193 mm 1128 mm and 1022 mm in 2002 2003 and 2006 respectively average maximum and minimum temperatures in all three years between june and december were in the order of 30 c and 18 c respectively average solar radiation in 2002 2003 and 2006 was 17 mj m2 15 mj m2 and 16 mj m2 respectively 3 2 performance of improved and traditional practices 3 2 1 vertisols fig 3a shows the fluctuation in soil water contents and rainfall amounts during the year 2009 in the experimental vertisol plots of sorghum pigeon pea intercrop maize chickpea sequential cropping and fallow chickpea in the beginning of july total depth of soil water in the top 180 cm soil profile was estimated to be 480 520 mm which increased to about 600 mm by the end of october because of the monsoon rains soil water contents in fallow chickpea plots were slightly higher compared to those in maize chickpea or sorghum pigeon pea plots soil wetness started declining after october in all the three cropping systems by the end of december the total depth of soil water again reduced to about 550 mm 560 mm and 500 mm in the sorghum pigeon pea maize chickpea and fallow chickpea cropping systems fig 3b d show the volumetric soil water contents at different depths at the beginning of the rainy season 2 jul 2009 end of the rainy season 10 oct 2009 middle of the post rainy season 28 dec 2010 and end of the post rainy season 29 jan 2010 in the study plots moisture depletion was highest in the upper soil layers soil water contents at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depths fluctuated from 0 10 to 0 45 cm3 cm3 and 0 3 0 45 cm3 cm3 respectively soil water contents exceeded 0 40 cm3 cm3 across soil depths by the end of the rainy season in all the experimental plots moisture was depleted during the post rainy season due to water uptake by the crops chickpea or pigeon pea as residual moisture was the only source of water moisture depletion was prevalent up to a depth of 120 cm in fallow chickpea and moisture level of 0 45 cm3 cm3 across the soil profile declined to 0 30 0 40 cm3 cm3 at 30 90 cm depth and to 0 2 0 3 cm3 cm3 at 0 30 cm depth by the end of the post rainy season in maize chickpea high moisture depletion up to 180 cm depth was recorded indicating chickpea s deep rooting pattern fig 3c in sorghum pigeon pea intercrop moisture depletion was found up to 120 cm depth moisture level was higher than 0 40 cm3 cm3 below 120 cm and fluctuated to 0 30 cm3 cm3 between 30 and 120 cm and was 0 15 cm3 cm3 lower than the permanent wilting point in the top layers 0 30 cm fig 4 shows crop yields in raised beds and flat beds in the vertisol experiments in the flat beds chickpea and sorghum which were cultivated in two different plots during the post rainy season produced average yields of 1 2 t ha and 1 1 t ha respectively however the yields ranged from 1 0 to 1 4 t ha in chickpea and 0 6 1 6 t ha in sorghum within the interquartile range of the experimental data set in the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop sorghum which was harvested first produced an average of 3 3 t ha interquartile range of 3 1 4 0 t ha pigeon pea yield was about 1 1 t ha similarly maize chickpea sequential cropping under raised beds yielded an average of 4 6 t ha of maize interquartile range of 3 8 4 9 t ha and 1 4 t ha of chickpea interquartile range of 1 2 1 7 t ha a comparison of yields obtained from different cropping systems in vertisols under dry normal and wet years table 4 showed that out of the 34 years of field experiments 20 years were normal with an average rainfall june october of 750 mm 9 were wet years with an average rainfall of 1100 mm and 5 years were dry with 530 mm rainfall in sole sorghum grown under flat beds where only post rainy crops are cultivated using residual soil water content no significant difference in yield was observed between dry normal and wet years however average yield during the normal year was marginally higher 1 16 t ha compared to 1 1 t ha during dry years and 1 08 t ha during wet years in sole chickpea average yield was 1 2 t ha in normal years 1 15 t ha in dry years and 0 99 t ha in wet years in sorghum pigeon pea intercrop average sorghum yield was the highest in dry years 3 9 t ha which declined with increasing rainfall 3 52 t ha in normal years and 3 11 t ha in wet years as sorghum does not tolerate waterlogged conditions even for short periods pardales et al 1991 crop yields were affected despite the raised beds that facilitate to dispose of excess runoff the pigeon pea crop benefited from increasing rainfall owing to its deep root system 120 cm refer fig 4d that could tolerate waterlogging while also meeting water demand in wet years the average pigeon pea yield in dry years was 0 7 t ha compared to 1 1 t ha and 1 34 t ha in normal and wet years respectively this is the reason sorghum pigeon pea intercropping is widely practiced in the vertisols of northern karnataka southern telangana and maharashtra states rao and willey 1983 wani et al 2017 a similar trend was observed in maize chickpea sequential cropping where maize yields were the best in dry years 4 79 t ha compared to normal 4 33 t ha and wet years 4 09 t ha average chickpea yield increased with increase in rainfall during monsoons as it directly affected residual soil water content levels fig 4b c a comparison of sorghum equivalent yield estimated for all four cropping systems during dry normal and wet years table 4 showed that sey in sole sorghum ranged from 1 1 t ha to 1 16 t ha compared to 2 13 t ha to 2 59 t ha in sorghum pigeon pea intercropping it ranged between 5 93 t ha and 7 0 t ha in sorghum pigeon pea and 6 4 t ha and 6 7 t ha in maize chickpea sequential cropping this clearly indicates that sorghum pigeon pea intercropping and maize chickpea sequential cropping systems are superior to traditional practices while overall productivity increased with increasing rainfall in the improved practice it was mostly stagnant in the traditional practice during the study period 1976 2009 3 2 2 alfisols matric potential head was measured at 60 105 cm depth under different cropping systems sole sorghum sole castor fig 5a and groundnut pigeon pea and sorghum pigeon pea fig 5b in both raised beds and flat beds in sole sorghum and castor matric potential head reached a matric potential of 600 to 700 cm indicating that the crops have utilized residual moisture up to 1 m depth while matric potential head in the rainy season generally ranged from 0 to 300 cm it increased during dry spells and post rainy period more water depletion was recorded in intercropping compared to sole cropping matric potential heads with 60 105 cm soil layers in almost all the years reached to about 600 to 800 cm a comparison between raised beds and flat beds revealed lower matric potential head in the former than in the latter most of the time suggesting that raised beds harvested extra surface runoff which was available for subsequent crop utilization fig 5 also shows the sensitivity of matric potential heads to total rainfall and its distribution for example matric potential head was much higher 300 cm in wet years 2006 2007 compared to normal years 2003 2004 groundnut pigeon pea intercropping and sole sorghum were grown on raised beds and flat beds during 2002 2006 the average crop yield obtained from sole sorghum was 2 2 t ha range 1 3 2 5 t ha under flat beds compared to 2 5 t ha range 1 7 2 95 t ha under raised beds fig 6a b in the groundnut pigeon pea intercrop average groundnut yield was 0 3 t ha 0 2 1 25 t ha on flat beds compared to 0 35 t ha 0 3 1 5 t ha on raised beds pigeon pea which was harvested 3 months after groundnut gave 1 t ha under flat beds compared to 1 3 t ha under raised beds raised beds had an advantage of about 5 20 in terms of crop productivity a large variability in yield was observed during the study years experiments were undertaken during 2007 2009 with sole castor and sorghum pigeon pea intercrop under raised beds and flat beds average yield obtained from sole castor from flat beds and raised beds were 0 6 t ha and 0 9 t ha respectively fig 6c and d in the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop sorghum yield was 1 4 t ha in flat beds compared to 2 0 t ha in raised beds while pigeon pea yielded 0 6 t ha on flat beds compared to 0 8 t ha on raised beds table 5 shows the yields from different cropping system under both land form conditions in dry normal and wet years in alfisols between 2002 and 2006 2 years were normal with 750 mm rainfall 2 were wet with 1070 mm rainfall and 1 year was dry with 573 mm rainfall yields from sole sorghum were the highest in wet years 2 6 2 8 t ha followed by dry and normal years in the groundnut pigeon pea intercrop average groundnut yield in normal years ranged between 0 3 t ha and 0 4 t ha and pigeon pea yielded between 0 65 t ha and 0 87 t ha however yields obtained during dry and wet year were relatively higher rainfall distribution played an important role in fulfilling crop water requirement for example the year 2002 was a dry year with 573 mm rainfall but better rainfall distribution led to maximum yields fig 2 highest productivity was achieved in the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop 6 5 7 8 t ha followed by sole castor 3 8 4 5 t ha groundnut pigeon pea intercrop 2 62 3 5 t ha and sole sorghum 1 7 2 1 t ha 3 3 production function 3 3 1 vertisols a production function was developed to describe the relationship between effective rainfall and crop yield fig 7a shows the relationship between effective rainfall and yield of sorghum or maize and chickpea or pigeon pea obtained during different years fig 7b and c show the relationship between effective rainfall and yield of sorghum and chickpea grown on flat beds higher effective rainfall had a negative impact on maize and sorghum yields in flat beds while it had a positive impact on chickpea or pigeon pea yields in raised beds higher residual moisture helped both intercropped and sequential crops meet their water requirements when grown on raised beds it is interesting to note that in the traditional system of farming in which land is left fallow during the rainy season and a sole sorghum or chickpea crop is grown using residual moisture there was no positive correlation with effective monsoon rainfall therefore there was no additional yield gain in sole cropping compared to intercropping rather it correlated negatively as yield declined when soil water content was higher during wet years 3 3 2 alfisols the relationship between effective rainfall and sole sorghum yield in alfisols is presented in fig 8a the relationship between crop yield and rainfall was positive up to 600 mm after which it turned negative sorghum requires less water that is largely met with around 600 mm of rainfall and hence yields optimally bell et al 2020 assefa et al 2010 high rainfall may affect the crop negatively as it is sensitive to prolonged moisture availability and waterlogging that hinders grain formation the relationship between effective rainfall and groundnut and pigeon pea yields did not show a clear trend rainfall variability rather than total rainfall received appeared more responsible for crop yield the production function for castor and pigeon pea crops could not be established under the second phase of these experiments as adequate data sets were not available 3 4 water productivity and net returns 3 4 1 vertisols table 4 compares the annual net returns obtained from improved practices sorghum pigeon pea intercrop and maize chickpea sequential crop and traditional practices fallow sole sorghum or chickpea during normal years average annual net returns from the improved practice was us 1037 1284 ha compared to us 150 358 ha from the traditional practice in dry years it was us 889 1241 ha year from the improved practice compared to us 87 333 ha year from the traditional one net returns in normal and wet years were higher than in dry years in the improved practice only normal years showed better net returns compared to dry and wet years in the traditional practice this suggests that with increased rainfall there was effective resource utilization resulting in better returns under the improved practice compared to the poor resource utilization in the traditional practice annual net returns from maize chickpea sequential cropping us 1284 ha was the best followed by sorghum pigeon pea intercropping us 1037 ha and sole chickpea us 358 ha and sole post rainy sorghum us 150 ha the sorghum equivalent water productivity se wp in vertisols is presented in fig 9a d and table 4 the amount of water captured within the landscape rainfall runoff was taken in to account to estimate water productivity however a fraction that might have percolated deep was not included in this analysis water productivity in the improved practice ranged between 0 8 kg m3 and 1 25 kg m3 compared to between 0 08 kg m3 and 0 16 kg m3 in the traditional system clearly indicating that the former was 5 8 times better than the latter water productivity in the improved practice was the highest in dry years 1 1 1 25 kg m3 followed by normal 0 99 1 02 kg m3 and wet years 0 80 0 81 kg m3 under the traditional practice it was relatively higher in normal years 0 20 0 44 kg m3 and dry years 0 17 0 51 kg m3 compared to wet years 0 15 0 30 kg m3 economic water productivity ewp was calculated in vertisols table 4 and fig 10 a d demonstrating the economic returns from the use of every m3 of fresh water in different cropping systems in the improved practice it ranged between us 0 13 and us 0 24 m3 compared to between us 0 02 and us 0 07 m3 in the traditional practice in maize chickpea sequential cropping it was the highest us 0 16 0 24 m3 followed by the sorghum pigeon pea intercrop us 0 13 0 16 m3 sole chickpea us 0 04 0 07 m3 and post rainy sorghum us 0 016 0 025 m3 3 4 2 alfisols net returns from different cropping systems in alfisols are presented in fig 10 e h and table 5 under the groundnut pigeon pea intercrop during dry year net return was us 1637 1821 ha compared to us 429 553 ha in a normal year and us 1099 1139 ha in wet years as rainfall variability played an important role in crop production especially in alfisols the net income from dry years was highest compared to that from normal and wet years however long term data are needed for a better understanding of the trend in the second phase of the experiments net returns obtained from sorghum pigeon pea intercrop was us 1345 1569 ha and from sole castor us 766 831 ha raised beds helped realize a gain of us 100 ha on an average a comparison of all the four cropping systems showed maximum net return accruing from sorghum pigeon pea intercrop us 1345 1569 ha followed by sole castor us 766 831 ha and groundnut pigeon pea intercrop us 429 553 ha and sole sorghum us 275 308 ha further a comparison of sorghum equivalent wp indicated that water productivity from raised beds was 0 39 1 14 kg m3 compared to 0 30 1 0 kg m3 in flat beds the highest water productivity was obtained from sorghum pigeon pea intercrop 1 0 1 14 kg m3 followed by sole castor 0 61 0 67 kg m3 groundnut pigeon pea intercrop 0 5 0 66 kg m3 and sole sorghum 0 3 0 39 kg m3 the economic water productivity ewp in sorghum pigeon pea intercrop was us 0 21 0 23 m3 followed by sole castor us 0 12 0 13 m3 groundnut pigeon pea intercrop us 0 08 0 11 m3 and sole sorghum us 0 05 0 06 m3 fig 10 e h and table 5 3 5 estimation of crop and water productivity parameters table 6 shows the results of mlr and rf model validation for estimating four different crop and water productivity parameters as expected the rf approach provided a superior prediction accuracy with r2 values in the range of 0 74 for the sey to 0 80 for the ewp compared to the mlr approach r2 range 0 59 0 70 resulting rmse values ranged from us 0 04 m3 for ewp to us 236 ha for the net income we also performed a 10 fold cross validation results not shown and observed superior performance of rf models over mlr approaches consistently lower performance of the mlr models implies that there are non linear relationships in these datasets which mlr models fail to capture the resulting rank correlation coefficients kendall tau shown in the table 7 also suggest the presence of strong nonlinearity for both land form and cropping system features although extensive hyperparameter tuning was conducted to find out the best set of hyperparameters leading to the minimum cross validated prediction error we observed overfitting in the case of net income with its high bias value at us 17 13 ha nevertheless the scatter plots in fig 11 show close proximity of observed vs predicted response variables around 1 1 line suggesting that the rf model captured the observed variability in our datasets the results of interpretive machine learning approach captured with the shap values are summarized in fig 12 we considered five key feature variables of cropping systems effective rainfall land form soil order and water regime wet vs dry soil water regimes fig 12 shows these feature variables ranked in descending order of importance based on mean absolute shap values for each of the four predicted variables sey ewp ni a and ewp each point on the shap plot represents a data point in the trained model and has the same unit as its predicted variable e g shap value for sey has the unit of t ha because four out of five feature variables were categorical in nature shap plots show clustering of points along the x y plane annotations for each cluster belonging to a subclass shown as numbers of these categorical variables are also shown in this figure interestingly cropping system shows the highest mean feature importance for all the productivity parameters response variables followed by effective rainfall in three out of four cases specifically the sorghum pigeon pea intercropping subclass 1 and maize chickpea sequence subclass 2 have a positive impact on all the productivity parameters practicing these cropping systems increased the mean sey values up to 2 t ha fig 12a and ni a to about us 250 750 ha fig 12c on the other hand fallow sorghum subclass 3 and sorghum fallow subclass 7 cropping sequences negatively influenced all the productivity parameters reducing sey to the tune of 1 75 t ha fig 12a and ni a up to us 416 ha fig 12c in the case of land form the bbf land form showed positive influence on sey with an increase in the yield in the range of 0 5 1 t ha fig 12a whereas the flat bed type of land form has a significant negative impact on sey reducing yield to the tune of 0 24 0 69 t ha fig 12a fig 12 also shows that soil order plays a distinct role in influencing both yield and water use with superior overall system performance in alfisols than in vertisols although effective rainfall greater than 750 mm appears to increase sey to the tune of 0 25 1 25 t ha fig 12a wet or dry water regimes appear to play a limited role in influencing productivity parameters except for the net income which can increase for the wet years water regime 3 thus the shap values show consistent and quantifiable influence each feature variable bears on yield and water productivity parameters 4 discussion 4 1 opportunities for sustainable crop intensification the preceding section revealed how improved practices comprising land form management and a selection of suitable cropping systems not only enhanced resource land and water use efficiency but also led to higher productivity the raised bed method and dry sowing in vertisols facilitated double cropping in a year compared to single cropping in the traditional practice the long term field experiments also revealed that such intercropping and sequential cropping used available moisture more efficiently than in the traditional practice in the improved practice total production increased with increasing rainfall as there was consistent demand to utilize soil wetness for crop use on the contrary the traditional practice that targeted only the post rainy season to cultivate crops failed to use soil wetness effectively a significant amount of soil wetness that builds up during the rainy season is lost to non productive evaporation in the absence of crop cover while only marginal use of residual soil wetness occurs during the post rainy season in such conditions water productivity was 4 5 times lower in the traditional practice compared to the improved practice under the improved practice when the first crop which is generally of a short duration is harvested the intercrop which is often of a long duration and with deep roots avails the space and moisture from deeper soil layers to pick up growth so even if the rains are in excess of normal the deep rooted long duration crop can make use of the additional moisture to produce better yields this holds true for both intercrops and sequential crops in sequential cropping preparing the seed bed immediately after harvesting the preceding crop is convenient under the improved practice compared to the traditional one this is so because the preceding crop creates a favorable moisture regime quickly and sowing can be undertaken immediately after the harvest or by taking up sowing in the inter spaces relay crop under the traditional practice high moisture availability especially in the top soil layers could hinder timely sowing and delayed rains could further prolong sowing in alfisols rainfall distribution rather than total amount of rainfall is more critical to crop growth the soil s poor water retention capacity coupled with the absence of supplemental irrigation affects crops adversely during dry spells for example groundnut yield was much lower during 2003 which was a normal year compared to that in 2002 which was a dry year a spell of about 25 dry days during the crop season severely affected groundnut yields in 2003 this goes to show the importance of the choice of a cropping system in alfisols of the four cropping systems tested in two phases sorghum pigeon pea intercrop performed the best since sorghum requires less water it can partially withstand water scarce conditions while pigeon pea can utilize residual moisture from deep soil layers the poor yield of groundnut was largely responsible for the poor performance of the system especially due to the long dry spells which are common in the sat singh et al 2014b one or two supplemental irrigations could dramatically improve crop yields mandal et al 2020 sole castor performed better than groundnut pigeon pea intercrop and sole sorghum both in terms of net returns and water productivity castor is a commercial oilseed crop that is drought tolerant and also gives better economic returns babita et al 2010 the performance of all the four cropping systems was better under raised beds due to better drainage facility pathak et al 2016 have shown that raised beds in alfisols were helpful in harvesting 10 15 mm of additional soil water content while reducing soil loss by more than 50 anantha et al 2021a anantha et al 2021b all these factors contributed to a yield gain of 5 15 and additional economic returns of us 80 100 ha including the additional cost of preparing raised beds 4 2 comparison with other studies a few studies have explained the importance of land form management in crop intensification improving soil hydraulic properties and crop yields in similar agro ecological regions nouri et al 2019 reported results from a 34 year long term study in the alfisols of sub humid southeastern usa in which tillage and cover crops had an impact on soil hydraulic properties the incorporation of cover crops and no tillage practices improved infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity which was largely due to aggregation of soil structure liu et al 2020 using data from 4 years of field study conducted in the rainfed agriculture system of arid and semi arid provinces of china reported enhanced maize yield 50 more water use efficiency and economic benefits minimum by 140 through the use of ridge furrow system of land form treatment and plastic mulching compared to control treatments three years of field experiments in alfisols jensen et al 2003 in semi arid tanzania demonstrated the advantage of climate risks mitigation practices such as tied ridges and nutrient application to bridge the yield gap in a maize based cropping system a combination of tied ridge tillage and balanced fertilizer led to maize yields of 6 t ha compared to 1 t ha using farmer s practice rao et al 2015 studied the feasibility of double cropping in vertisols and balanced fertilizer application using 15 years of long term data in the sat of southern india sorghum chickpea or mungbean sorghum sequential cropping showed better resource use efficiency land water and nutrients compared to sole chickpea grown under traditional farmer s practice our results demonstrate the possibility of bridging large yield gaps in the dry semi arid tropics the application of supplemental irrigation can reduce the risk of intermittent dry spells common in the sat that impact profitable crop production in alfisols kumar et al 2016 the results also indicate that about 17 130 mm of runoff that was generated during normal years holds potential for rainwater harvesting for supplemental irrigation the construction of a 300 m3 10mx10mx3m farm pond can harvest about 50 of the runoff generated from 1 ha considering a minimum of two fillings during the rainy season singh et al 2014a anantha et al 2021b garg et al 2021 the water will be enough to provide one or two life saving irrigations during critical crop growth stages coinciding with dry spells results of the machine learning based interpretations are also consistent with the previous studies for instance sreedevi et al 2006 have shown that the maize chickpea and sorghum pigeon pea intercropping systems are beneficial where farmers could profit to the tune of us 365 430 ha respectively they also showed that the bbf type of land form practice can increase both sorghum yield and water productivity compared to the flat bed land form conservation of both soil and soil water contents in the bbf system of land preparation benefits farmers while draining out excess water during heavy rains similarly the shap value results are consistent with the observations of higher sorghum yield in alfisols than vertisols conducted in the same study site sahrawat et al 1995 this study also provides an in depth understanding of how various cropping systems can optimize available resources for sustainable crop intensification 5 conclusions long term field experiments were undertaken on alfisols and vertisols at the icrisat research farm to evaluate different cropping systems in vertisols a 34 year experiment was undertaken following double cropping improved practice on raised beds and comparing it with a sole crop on flat beds traditional practice sorghum pigeon pea intercrop or maize chickpea sequential cropping was followed under the improved practice whereas sole sorghum and chickpea were grown using residual soil water content under the traditional practice field experiments in alfisols were undertaken for 8 years between 2002 and 2009 by following raised bed and flat bed methods experiments were undertaken in two phases the cropping systems followed during the first phase were groundnut pigeon pea intercrop and sole sorghum between 2002 and 2006 and during the second phase between 2007 and 2009 sorghum pigeon pea intercrop and sole castor surface runoff and soil water contents were monitored in all the experimental watersheds along with agronomic measurements following are key findings of the study the average runoff generated in vertisols during a normal year was 10 of the total rainfall received 750 mm compared to 17 in alfisols runoff recorded in the dry years was less than 4 of the total rainfall in both the soil types alfisols which have poor water retention capacity provide the opportunity to harvest surface runoff through low cost water harvesting structures such as farm ponds vertisols have immense potential for sustainable crop intensification by following land form management treatments such as raised beds and appropriate cropping systems cereals pulses rotation or intercropping improved methods of cultivation in vertisols produced 6 0 7 0 t ha sey compared to only 1 0 2 6 t ha sey with traditional practices net returns obtained with improved production systems ranged between us 800 ha and us 1300 ha compared to us 92 ha and us 350 ha in the traditional practice further technical and economic water productivity were 3 5 folds higher in improved practices compared to traditional practices maize chickpea sequential cropping was superior followed by sorghum pigeon pea intercropping sole chickpea and sole sorghum in alfisols raised beds performed better than flat beds in terms of additional crop yield 10 15 and net returns us 80 100 ha year in terms of net returns sorghum pigeon pea intercrop us 1340 1570 ha year was the best followed by sole castor us 760 830 ha year groundnut pigeon pea intercrop us 430 550 ha year and sole sorghum us 270 300 ha year castor and pigeon pea being drought tolerant as well as high value crops brought higher economic returns compared to sole sorghum or groundnut pigeon pea intercropping intermittent droughts in groundnut crop led to poor yields even during normal years effective rainfall strongly correlated with pigeon pea or chickpea yields in vertisols under raised beds available soil water content was utilized more productively compared to that in the traditional practice despite raising a crop during the rainy season chickpea which was cultivated post monsoon performed equally or better under the improved practice compared to the traditional one intercropping and raised beds were found to be promising interventions especially in alfisols for better resource utilization in vertisols raised beds coupled with improved cultivation practices were promising options for crop intensification and enhanced resource use efficiency the study provided insights into the performance of different cropping systems in major soil types in the sat apart from revealing opportunities to harvest surface runoff

8922,film antitranspirant at can effectively reduce yield losses of rapeseed crops under drought by blocking stomata if applied at the critical stage however the physiological mechanism by which film at mitigates drought damage remains unclear to investigate the effect of different concentrations of at from 1 to 3 on rapeseed yields and its components of rapeseed under terminal drought we carried out two field experiments at two locations in the year 2021 using rain shelters to simulate terminal drought at bird s nest bn and flat nook fn the study was conducted in a randomised complete block design with different concentrations of film at vapor gard a i di 1 p menthene from 0 to 3 applied at the flowering stage of water stressed rapeseed soil and plant water status leaf gas exchange seed yield and yield components etc were examined drought depressed leaf gas exchange and resulted in large yield losses aboveground biomass seed yield pod number and oil yield showed linear increases with at concentrations consistently from both sites with every 1 increase in concentration seed yield was predicted to increase by 0 61 and 0 23 t ha 1 at bn and fn respectively the improvement in seed yield was strongly associated with pod number r2 0 97 and 0 76 respectively p 0 001 further pod number and leaf relative water content were positively correlated albeit with differences between the two sites it was concluded that increasing concentrations can enhance yield benefits of film at on rapeseed subjected to drought and the greater yield from film at appeared to be mediated through the improvement in leaf water status as high concentrations of film at are less cost effective and conventional spraying methods only cover the adaxial surface improving leaf coverage considering both sides of the leaf surface would help lower the cost and extend the commercial use of film at keywords oilseed rape water deficit stomatal conductance photosynthesis water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapeseed brassica napus l one of the most important oilseed crops plays a vital role in meeting global demands for edible oil biofuels and fodder to keep up with the growing global population wu et al 2018 numerous research studies have revealed that agricultural drought greatly impacts rapeseed production this detrimental effect will be amplified by the increased intensity and severity of drought from climate change pachauri et al 2014 the flowering stage is commonly recognised as the critical period for rapeseed when plants have the greatest number of newly opened flowers and near open buds which are highly dependent on the assimilate availability for the development of ovules kirkegaard et al 2018 impaired assimilation supply caused by water stress reduces sink size thus leading to yield losses weymann et al 2015 therefore it is imperative to develop effective agronomy tools to mitigate drought damage in addition to breeding methods film ats detailed abbreviations and definitions used in the paper are listed in table 1 are water emulsifiable polymers that form a physically waterproof layer to block stomata thereby reducing water loss through transpiration kettlewell and holloway 2010 the reduction in stomatal conductance is expected to depress the photosynthesis that depends on the diffusion of co2 through stomata so it is more applicable to ornamental horticultural plants with more emphasis on reducing water loss than assimilation das and raghavendra 1979 however film at can give yield benefits on crops under drought if applied at the right time i e most sensitive to water stress which was first reported on wheat kettlewell et al 2010 more robust evidence has helped understand the underlying physiological mechanism reviewed by mphande et al 2020 and referenced therein with increasing research on the timing effect of film at on wheat and a wider variety of plants however there are few articles about at application on brassica crops patil and de 1978 sprayed film at mobileaf 10 once at the early flowering stage of brassica campestris under dryland conditions in addition to two other types of ats all at applications resulted in yield benefits among which film at improved the seed yield by 26 accompanied by greater leaf relative water content compared to 0 at more recently faralli et al 2016 applied film at 1 di p menthene on winter rapeseed brassica napus at the flowering stage under controlled drought and they reported that at improved seed dry weight by 17 primarily by increasing pod number later the same authors found similar improvement in winter rapeseed from the field conditions and at efficacy for yield benefits was highly related to the magnitude of water stress faralli et al 2017a 2017b they used three concentrations 0 5 1 l ha 1 1 2 l ha 1 and 2 4 l ha 1 of di p menthene in one experiment and there was an indication that increasing concentration at the beginning of flowering increased yield but this was not significant therefore there is a need for further work to investigate rapeseed responses to film at when applied at various concentrations under both controlled and field conditions we firstly investigated the response of spring rapeseed to different concentrations of film at in the glasshouse xiang et al 2022 showing significant physiological responses to at concentrations in terms of gas exchange however the lack of consistent responses in yield and yield components strongly indicates the need for further work on at with higher concentrations and field studies under terminal drought are required in future research terminal drought is an important pattern of water supply dynamics and is well known to occur more frequently in mediterranean climates around the world and stored soil moisture systems of the semi arid tropics berger et al 2016 therefore we conducted two field experiments with the aims of i investigating the responses of rapeseed under terminal drought to different concentrations of at and ii understanding the physiological mechanism of at related yield improvement the null hypothesis tested is that there is no significant difference in physiological responses and yield and its components of rapeseed treated with film antitranspirant with increasing concentrations from 1 to 3 essential physiological parameters are determined to estimate plant water status gas exchange and endogenous aba content in plant tissues in addition to yield and yield components 2 materials and

blocks at fn details of treatments in each block are summarised in table 4 at bn each block consisted of four drought plots four well watered benchmark plots were located on one side of the polytunnel to estimate the magnitude of drought at fn each rain shelter was treated as one block and each block comprised six drought plots and two benchmark plots located at one end of each rain shelter note

performed for extraction procedures including boiling for 10 mins and rinsing for 20 mins oil yield t ha 1 was then calculated as the product of oil content and seed yield 2 9 statistical analysis data were analysed using genstat 18th edition vsn international hemel hempstead uk shapiro wilk and levene tests were used for estimating normality and homogeneity of variance prior to conducting an analysis of variance anova one way anova with polynomial contrasts was conducted to explore plant responses to at in terms of leaf temperature gas exchange endo aba in plant tissues leaf rwc and yield related parameters post hoc analyses were performed using tukey s test at p 0 05 to compare the difference between treatments simple linear regression analysis with treatments as groups using replicates was applied separately for two sites to test the relationship of gas exchange agb seed yield pod number and oil yield with at concentrations combined data of yield and yield components were fitted with a linear regression model against leaf rwc using means 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the mean daily air temperature at both sites was 17 c through the growing seasons and the minimum and maximum rh were 36 1 95 5 and 43 4 97 0 at bn and fn respectively fig 1a b after spray application until harvest the daily air temperature on average was 21 8 c at bn slightly higher than fn 19 6 c however min and max rh were lower at bn than at fn i e 36 8 95 6 and 43 0 97 1 respectively during the whole season the average sr received was 16 3 and 16 7 mj m 2 day 1 at bn and fn respectively it was 17 7 and 16 1 mj m 2 day 1 after spraying fig 1c compared to bn with early planting rapeseed plants at fn started flowering earlier and had a shorter growing season by 11 in terms of thermal time table 3 3 2 soil water status average soil vwc smp in benchmark plots was maintained at 27 5 0 01 mpa and 19 8 0 01 mpa throughout the growing season at bn and fn respectively in contrast soil moisture vwc smp in the top 60 cm significantly decreased with increasing dap at bn and fn showing no differences between at treated plots relative to 0at from regression analysis in groups data not shown overall soil water deficits were greater at bn than at fn at harvest soil moisture vwc smp decreased to below pwp at bn but it was not the case at fn particularly in smp fig 2 at bn soil vwc decreased from an average of 21 6 at 41 dap to 14 8 just above pwp at 74 dap one day before spraying and it further gradually declined to 12 6 at harvest i e 136 dap fig 2a the corresponding readings of smp were from 0 04 mpa to 0 77 mpa and ultimately to 2 08 mpa fig 2b at fn soil vwc decreased from the average of 13 2 at 36 dap to 12 2 at 56 dap one day before spraying and then it continually reduced to 9 69 at 112 dap near harvest with corresponding smp values of 0 10 0 22 and 0 67 mpa respectively fig 2c d 3 3 leaf temperature leaf temperature fluctuated considerably depending on the weather conditions at sampling fig 3 relative to the well watered benchmark spray treatments increased leaf temperature significantly to varying extents at both sites except for bn at 2 das table 6 l t at 2 das in 0at was 4 3 c and 1 3 c at bn and fn respectively while at 7 das l t was 1 5 c and 1 4 c fig 3 at had significant effects on l t at three sampling dates at both sites and a linear relationship was observed at fn although deviations from fn at 7das were significant when compared to 0at at increased l t by 67 and 35 at bn and fn respectively by averaging concentrations from the two sampling times 3 4 gas exchange drought inhibited g s and a and improved wuei substantially relative to the benchmark at both sites without statistical comparisons due to the non randomisation of benchmark plots fig 4 with the development of terminal drought responses in gas exchange to at application were more prominent at 8 das over 3 das across two trials table 6 at 8das in bn there was a significant and linear relationship between g s wuei and at concentrations readings of g s a and wuei at 8das were 0 3 mol m 2 s 1 16 5 µmol m 2 s 1 and 57 6 µmol co2 mol h2o 1 in 0at respectively when at increased from 0 to 3 at 8 das g s decreased by an average of 16 while wuei increased by 12 fig 4b j at fn g s a and wuei in 0at were 0 7 mol m 2 s 1 19 8 µmol m 2 s 1 and 32 2 µmol co2 mol h2o 1 only a had a significant and linear relationship with at concentrations table 6 at reduced a by an average of 18 across all concentrations at fn fig 4h 3 5 yield and yield components at both sites the application of at significantly influenced agb seed yield and pod number per hectare although with borderline significances in agb and seed yield at bn table 7 compared to the benchmark drought decreased agb and seed yield by an average of 43 and 37 at bn respectively fig 5a b and more markedly by 49 and 56 at fn fig 6a b although non randomised benchmark plots were not included in statistical analysis agb and seed yield in 0at were 13 5 5 6 t ha 1 and 5 6 1 5 ha 1 at bn and fn respectively at at 1 3 increased agb and seed yield by an average of 12 and 14 at bn respectively and to a greater extent by 31 and 34 at fn relative to 0at table 7 among all concentrations applied 3 at significantly increased agb and seed yield at fn only by 48 and 52 respectively compared to the benchmark terminal drought decreased pod number by an average of 38 and 34 at bn fig 5d and fn fig 6d respectively average at concentrations increased pod number per hectare by 7 and 25 at bn and fn respectively compared to 0at i e 57 and 15 1 million ha 1 at bn and fn respectively 3 at was significantly higher than 0at increased by 42 from both sites table 7 the oil content from the benchmark was 42 and 47 at bn and fn respectively compared to the benchmark oil content from drought plots was slightly lower decreased by 6 and 2 at bn and fn respectively fig 5 g fig 6 g compared to 0at 3 at increased oil yield by 31 and 45 at bn and fn respectively with the latter showing significance across all concentrations at application increased oil yield by 15 and 28 at bn and fn respectively however there were no significant effects observed on hi or tsw table 7 seed yield at bn and fn was linearly associated with at concentrations and so were agb pod number and oil yield table 7 with a 1 increase in the concentration of at the projected increase in agb seed yield and oil yield were respectively 1 35 0 61 0 25 t ha 1 at bn fig 5a b h and 0 85 0 23 0 10 t ha 1 at fn fig 6a b h pod number at bn showed very high variabilities due to significant deviations so it was not included in the linear regression model table 7 at fn every 1 increase in at concentrations was predicted to increase pod number per hectare by 1 92 106 fig 6d from the regression of yield with its components we found that seed yield was highly associated with pod number followed by seeds per pod at bn fig 7a c this is also consistent with fn in seed yield showing the highest positive correlation with pod number fig 7b but a negative correlation with seeds per pod with large variabilities fig 7d although leaf rwc was not significantly affected by at application at either sampling of the two sites fig a3 pod number was strongly associated with leaf rwc from the regression analysis on combined data with bn and fn showing different linear trends fig 8b pod number was predicted to increase at bn nearly six times more than it would be at fn with every 1 improvement in leaf rwc 4 discussion previous studies demonstrated that rapeseed plants exhibited significant physiological responses to at 0 25 1 and improvements in some yield components under glasshouse conditions xiang et al 2022 in the present field study with higher concentrations of at 1 3 we reject our null hypothesis and show that when applied at the flowering stage at improved seed yield of water stressed rapeseed by an average of 24 across concentrations and two sites this yield improvement was also reported in winter rapeseed michele et al 2017 and other crops like wheat mphande et al 2021b furthermore seed yield and at concentrations were linearly correlated indicating that the optimum concentration is above 3 and increasing concentrations of at above 3 may result in greater yield for rapeseed under terminal drought stomatal closure is the earliest response to drought for the maintenance of leaf water potential which restricts the diffusion of water and co2 into the leaf flexas and medrano 2002 we showed that drought reduced g s and a by an average of 73 37 and 39 22 across two sampling times at bn and fn respectively and improved wuei by 176 and 31 as compared to the well watered benchmark fig 4 negative effects of drought on rapeseed have been widely reported by previous research hess et al 2015 yan et al 2016 the degree of which is positively associated with the magnitude of water stress faralli et al 2016 an increase in wuei of water stressed rapeseed has also been reported by elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 and biswas et al 2019 compared to fn the further suppression of g s at bn could be explained by the greater and longer lasting soil water deficit and drought at bn developed about three times faster than at fn in terms of soil smp fig 7 from the previous glasshouse study under controlled drought conditions we found that g s and a of at treated rapeseed plants had a significant and negative relationship with specific at concentrations 0 25 1 the greater detrimental effects of increasing concentrations from 1 to 3 were also observed from some sampling times at the two sites in the present study under terminal drought but with large variabilities between them due to variable environmental conditions in the field table 6 as concentrations increased more stomata were blocked with higher leaf coverage which augmented the suppression of g s xiang et al 2021 to confirm this a preliminary pot experiment was conducted to estimate leaf coverage of different at concentrations by arranging four replicates at an interspace the same as plants in the field experiment results showed that leaf coverage and at concentrations were positively correlated and leaf coverage increased approximately from 20 to 30 when at was applied from 1 to 3 fig a4 apart from concentrations drought intensity would also impact gas exchange responses to at application del amor et al 2010 under drought conditions rapeseed plants adopting a conventional strategy via stomatal closing would result in less leaf cooling elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 which could also be confirmed by increased leaf temperature from water stressed plots fig 3 after at application reduced g s is expected to reduce leaf transpiration thus increasing leaf temperature gale and hagan 1966 this is also confirmed in the present study when compared to 0at the application of at increased leaf temperature by 1 1 1 8 c averaging all concentrations at both sites fig 3 this is consistent with previous studies by faralli et al 2016 on winter rapeseed and gatti et al 2016 on grapevines faralli et al 2016 found that vg at 1 increased leaf temperature significantly compared to well watered control and leaf temperature increased by 1 c compared to unsprayed control similarly gatti et al 2016 applied a higher concentration of vg at 2 and found that sprayed leaves were moderately warmer by 1 2 c than unsprayed ones the heating effect can be explained by greater resistance to the passage of water vapour from at application thereby increasing the turgidity of guard cells and slowing evaporative cooling effects davenport et al 1972 in addition l t increased linearly as at concentrations increased from 1 to 3 but with highly significant deviations at both sites table 6 this suggests that the relationship between l t and at concentrations may not always be linear and a more complex relationship may involve leaf metabolic processes following blocked stomata or canopy structure could also impact the relationship the aba accumulation in guard cells triggers stomatal closure thus preventing plants from losing excessive water under drought conditions kollist et al 2014 previous studies conducted by faralli et al 2017a showed that at application at the flowering stage of winter rapeseed reduced endo aba concentration in the leaf and pod at 7 and 16 das similar findings have also been reported on wheat mphande et al 2021b in our study however differences between treatments in endo aba of leaves at 7 14 das or of pods at 28 das were not significant fig a5 this might be explained by the dynamic responses of endo aba to different environmental conditions leaf synthesised aba might be loaded to the phloem and transported to the roots wilkinson and davies 2002 alternatively our colleagues compared vg and fluridone aba inhibitor on wheat and found no significant difference in endo aba from fluridone application but vg sprayed reduced endo aba due to the conservation of plant water by suppressing transpiration mphande 2021 unpublished data nevertheless the role of aba in the activity of film at remains elusive and requires further research during flowering and pod set the relationship between source and sink regulates the availability of assimilates necessary for seed filling diepenbrock 2000 numerous studies have reported that terminal drought can cause massive yield losses in rapeseed faralli et al 2017b elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 which is also supported by our study showing that terminal drought resulted in 46 6 seed yield losses across two sites compared to the benchmark fig 5b fig 6b the large decrease was strongly associated with reductions in agb and pod number by 46 6 and 36 4 respectively fig 7 which can be explained by a substantial decline of available assimilates during the flowering stage which in turn negatively affected the formation of pods and seed size johnston et al 2002 wang et al 2011 leading to abortion and or abscission of pods particularly tesfamariam et al 2010 however yield losses caused by drought were lower at bn than at fn which were 36 5 and 56 7 relative to the benchmark respectively without statistical comparisons because of non randomisation in benchmark plots one possible explanation would be the huge difference in initial nutrients available for plants in the soil as both sites showed similar levels of air temperature and rh initial available n from bn was almost eight times higher than from fn 300 vs 70 kg ha 1 respectively greater n supply can improve individual plant growth through a higher leaf area index and a prolonged period of photosynthetic activity thereby producing high yields wang et al 2014 additionally plants at bn had a 13 longer growth period than at fn in terms of thermal time due to early planting which resulted in greater dry matter accumulation sieling et al 2017 taken together these two important factors boosted plant growth at bn and produced a much higher yield at bn than at fn and other related parameters figs 5 6 although fungicide and insecticide were applied at both sites plants at fn were still affected by pollen beetles and fungus disease particularly during the reproductive stage which may have partially accounted for yield losses in the current study we first demonstrated that seed yield had a linear and positive relationship with concentrations of at from 1 to 3 similar relationships were also observed in agb pod number ha and oil yield with at concentrations table 7 an increase in agb by 22 across at concentrations and two sites relative to 0at is consistent with faralli et al 2016 who studied winter rapeseed and found two types of film at at 1 increased aboveground dry matter by an average of about 17 under terminal drought this improvement in shoot biomass has also been demonstrated in other crops such as sweet corn shekour et al 1987 fava bean davenport et al 1972 wheat mphande et al 2021a and olives cirillo et al 2021 from the glasshouse study however we only observed improvements in some yield components xiang et al 2022 the individual plants in a controlled environment can experience different light and water conditions compared to those in the field resulting in different responses to at application there may be two reasons for the difference in yield response in our glasshouse and field studies first soil hydraulics that affect the expansive growth of reproductive organs pod and seed in varying degrees leading to pod and seed abortion varied between these two studies turc and tardieu 2018 soil moisture decreased gradually throughout the whole season in the field experiments while potted plants in the glasshouse experienced rapid onset of water deficit and soil moisture was maintained at a similar level i e 30 awc equal to 20 vwc only at the flowering stage albeit with fluctuations fig 2 a non limiting shoot leaf and pod water status could have been maintained for longer with at application under slower soil drying thereby preventing some of the pod abortion seen in drought stricken plants without at second different ways of imposing drought can impact the capability of yield compensation during seed filling stage as terminal drought developed with increasing dap in the field drought may have imposed more restrictions on the capacity of surviving pods and seeds for compensatory growth at the later seed filling stage kirkegaard et al 2018 improving leaf water status particularly during the flowering stage is vital in determining final crop production as it is closely associated with gas exchange raza et al 2017 the application of at physically blocks leaf stomata and reduces water loss through transpiration improving leaf water status davenport et al 1972 this is also reported by faralli et al 2017a on winter rapeseed showing that plants treated with at 1 exhibited significantly higher rwc relative to unsprayed control however in the present study we failed to see a significant increase in leaf rwc at 2 or 14 das from two sites compared to 0at fig a3 the lack of statistical significance in leaf rwc might be attributed to variable environmental conditions at the time of sampling different types of drought and plant varieties may also result in the discrepancy compared with faralli et al 2017a nevertheless pod number and leaf rwc were significantly and positively correlated with separate lines from the two experiments fig 8b indicating the greater pod number from increasing at concentration appeared to be mediated by leaf rwc since seed yield was strongly related to pod number fig 7a b it can be deduced that greater seed yield from increasing at concentration may also have been mediated by rwc fig 8a our study showed a greater yield from increasing at concentrations which confirms findings from a previous study conducted at fn on winter rapeseed faralli et al 2017b researchers sprayed three concentrations of film at vg on winter rapeseed subject to terminal drought showing that at at 1 0 5 2 1 and 4 l ha 1 2 increased seed yield by 14 14 and 21 respectively when at applied at the flowering stage although with no significant differences between concentrations this strong relationship with at concentrations was also reported by fahey and rogiers 2019 on grape bunches dipped in 0 1 2 and 3 vg solutions showing a linear and positive relationship between the bunch mass loss and at concentrations for water stressed rapeseed therefore we can improve seed yield by increasing concentrations of film at based on the current price of rapeseed and the average cost of spraying an at product vapor gard the improvement from 1 2 l ha 1 and 3 2 l ha 1 at flowering of rapeseed under drought would approximately result in an economic benefit of 29 36 ha and 555 88 ha respectively more details available in table a1 higher concentrations however would increase the cost of products and reduce economic profits which is less cost effective and practical since rapeseed stomata are unequally distributed between the surfaces with 44 of total stomata on the adaxial and 56 on the abaxial surface table a2 an alternative to increasing the concentration is to optimise the spraying method to achieve higher leaf coverage i e stomatal blockage of both adaxial and abaxial surface results from a preliminary study showed that leaf coverage was approximately 20 and 30 at the concentration of 1 and 3 at respectively fig a4 on the other hand only one genotype was used in our study further work is recommended on different genotypes at more than one location year when water supply and demand vary to verify the response of water stressed rapeseed to film at at different concentrations 5 conclusion in the present study drought caused yield losses as compared to well watered benchmark although benchmark was not included in the statistical test after film at was applied at the flowering stage leaf temperature increased as expected due to blocked stomata accompanied by the inhibition of gas exchange but improved intrinsic water use efficiency a linear and positive relationship was found in seed yield aboveground biomass pod number and oil yield with at concentrations this at involved yield improvement was predominantly determined by increased pod number and it was shown that pod number was closely correlated to leaf water status i e relative water content therefore we conclude that rapeseed yield can be improved by increasing at concentrations when plants are under terminal drought the yield benefit from at application appeared to be mediated by improving leaf water status future research on the root shoot water relations and osmotic responses to film at would be worthwhile for understanding the relationship of at with plant water status and the role of aba involved in the mode of action of film at merits further investigation improving leaf coverage considering both sides of leaf surfaces would also help lower the cost and extend the commercial use of film at credit authorship contribution statement jie xiang was involved in methodology formal analysis investigation

8922,film antitranspirant at can effectively reduce yield losses of rapeseed crops under drought by blocking stomata if applied at the critical stage however the physiological mechanism by which film at mitigates drought damage remains unclear to investigate the effect of different concentrations of at from 1 to 3 on rapeseed yields and its components of rapeseed under terminal drought we carried out two field experiments at two locations in the year 2021 using rain shelters to simulate terminal drought at bird s nest bn and flat nook fn the study was conducted in a randomised complete block design with different concentrations of film at vapor gard a i di 1 p menthene from 0 to 3 applied at the flowering stage of water stressed rapeseed soil and plant water status leaf gas exchange seed yield and yield components etc were examined drought depressed leaf gas exchange and resulted in large yield losses aboveground biomass seed yield pod number and oil yield showed linear increases with at concentrations consistently from both sites with every 1 increase in concentration seed yield was predicted to increase by 0 61 and 0 23 t ha 1 at bn and fn respectively the improvement in seed yield was strongly associated with pod number r2 0 97 and 0 76 respectively p 0 001 further pod number and leaf relative water content were positively correlated albeit with differences between the two sites it was concluded that increasing concentrations can enhance yield benefits of film at on rapeseed subjected to drought and the greater yield from film at appeared to be mediated through the improvement in leaf water status as high concentrations of film at are less cost effective and conventional spraying methods only cover the adaxial surface improving leaf coverage considering both sides of the leaf surface would help lower the cost and extend the commercial use of film at keywords oilseed rape water deficit stomatal conductance photosynthesis water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapeseed brassica napus l one of the most important oilseed crops plays a vital role in meeting global demands for edible oil biofuels and fodder to keep up with the growing global population wu et al 2018 numerous research studies have revealed that agricultural drought greatly impacts rapeseed production this detrimental effect will be amplified by the increased intensity and severity of drought from climate change pachauri et al 2014 the flowering stage is commonly recognised as the critical period for rapeseed when plants have the greatest number of newly opened flowers and near open buds which are highly dependent on the assimilate availability for the development of ovules kirkegaard et al 2018 impaired assimilation supply caused by water stress reduces sink size thus leading to yield losses weymann et al 2015 therefore it is imperative to develop effective agronomy tools to mitigate drought damage in addition to breeding methods film ats detailed abbreviations and definitions used in the paper are listed in table 1 are water emulsifiable polymers that form a physically waterproof layer to block stomata thereby reducing water loss through transpiration kettlewell and holloway 2010 the reduction in stomatal conductance is expected to depress the photosynthesis that depends on the diffusion of co2 through stomata so it is more applicable to ornamental horticultural plants with more emphasis on reducing water loss than assimilation das and raghavendra 1979 however film at can give yield benefits on crops under drought if applied at the right time i e most sensitive to water stress which was first reported on wheat kettlewell et al 2010 more robust evidence has helped understand the underlying physiological mechanism reviewed by mphande et al 2020 and referenced therein with increasing research on the timing effect of film at on wheat and a wider variety of plants however there are few articles about at application on brassica crops patil and de 1978 sprayed film at mobileaf 10 once at the early flowering stage of brassica campestris under dryland conditions in addition to two other types of ats all at applications resulted in yield benefits among which film at improved the seed yield by 26 accompanied by greater leaf relative water content compared to 0 at more recently faralli et al 2016 applied film at 1 di p menthene on winter rapeseed brassica napus at the flowering stage under controlled drought and they reported that at improved seed dry weight by 17 primarily by increasing pod number later the same authors found similar improvement in winter rapeseed from the field conditions and at efficacy for yield benefits was highly related to the magnitude of water stress faralli et al 2017a 2017b they used three concentrations 0 5 1 l ha 1 1 2 l ha 1 and 2 4 l ha 1 of di p menthene in one experiment and there was an indication that increasing concentration at the beginning of flowering increased yield but this was not significant therefore there is a need for further work to investigate rapeseed responses to film at when applied at various concentrations under both controlled and field conditions we firstly investigated the response of spring rapeseed to different concentrations of film at in the glasshouse xiang et al 2022 showing significant physiological responses to at concentrations in terms of gas exchange however the lack of consistent responses in yield and yield components strongly indicates the need for further work on at with higher concentrations and field studies under terminal drought are required in future research terminal drought is an important pattern of water supply dynamics and is well known to occur more frequently in mediterranean climates around the world and stored soil moisture systems of the semi arid tropics berger et al 2016 therefore we conducted two field experiments with the aims of i investigating the responses of rapeseed under terminal drought to different concentrations of at and ii understanding the physiological mechanism of at related yield improvement the null hypothesis tested is that there is no significant difference in physiological responses and yield and its components of rapeseed treated with film antitranspirant with increasing concentrations from 1 to 3 essential physiological parameters are determined to estimate plant water status gas exchange and endogenous aba content in plant tissues in addition to yield and yield components 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and agronomic management two field experiments were conducted at bn and fn harper adams university hau 52 46 n 2 25 w in 2021 the previous crop of both was wheat ten soil samples of the top 30 cm were collected randomly from both sites using a rotary corer drill prior to the start of trials and they were mixed up in a sealable plastic bag to form one representative sample for each the two soil samples were then stored at 4 c and sent for physicochemical analysis in a private laboratory nrm coopers bridge bracknell uk results and methods used for analysis are shown in table 2 the soil at bn and fn was ploughed and power harrowed before sowing to simulate terminal drought by keeping the rain out one fixed polytunnel at bn covered all plots and the soil was cultivated inside the polytunnel while four polythene shelters were installed at fn on fixed metal frames one for each block after the soil was cultivated two tinytag loggers gemini data loggers uk monitored air temperature and rh at bn and two selected polytunnels at fn daily sr data were obtained from the meteorological station based at hau located within a one kilometre distance

mirakel npz lembke germany were sown by hand in four rows with 15 cm between rows and 8 cm between plants within rows at 1 2 cm depth seedlings at the early leaf development stage were thinned to 50 plants m 2 the sowing dates of the two experiments are listed in table 3 alongside at application and harvesting dates all treatments received light irrigations to ensure uniform seed germination and plant emergence following the establishment of seedlings irrigation in experimental plots was withheld from 1 month after planting i e gs12 13 whereas benchmark plots were irrigated with three 1 m dripper tapes dripper spacing 20 cm output 250 l h 1 tsx 506 t tape access irrigation ltd northampton uk for 1 h approximately 17 mm h 1 on mondays wednesdays and fridays at 9 00 10 00 am for optimal growth until harvest at bn nitrogen fertiliser ammonium nitrate 34 5 n at 100 kg n ha 1 was incorporated into the soil using a tractor drawn plough on 02 march 2021 fungicide propulse a i carboxamide

omex agriculture ltd uk at 5 l ha 1 on 01 july 2021 due to an unexpected delay in receiving soil analysis results from the laboratory the same amount of nitrogen fertiliser was applied to both sites to reduce soil variance and to ensure plant optimal growth a mixture of insecticide hallmark zeon a i lambda cyhalothrin syngenta uk ltd uk at 75 ml ha 1 and fungicide propulse at 1 l ha 1 was applied on 02 july 2021 weeding was manually done at both sites 2 2 experimental design the study was conducted in a randomised complete block design with a single factor including eight blocks at bn and four blocks at fn details of treatments in each block are summarised in table 4 at bn each block consisted of four drought plots four well watered benchmark plots were located on one side of the polytunnel to estimate the magnitude of drought at fn each rain shelter was treated as one block and each block comprised six drought plots and two benchmark plots located at one end of each rain shelter note that benchmark plots of two experiments were not part of randomisation so they were not included in statistical analyses the layout of drought and benchmark plots from both sites is presented in fig a1 2 3 spray application film at vapor gard a i di 1 p enthane miller chemical and fertilizer corp hanover pa was applied to the canopy at a 0 5 m distance from the nozzle at the early flowering stage di 1 p menthene is a terpene polymer also known as pinolene produced by distillation from conifer resins a range of concentrations of at from 1 to 3 was applied and unsprayed plots i e 0at were

contamination between treatments solutions water were prepared in individual tanks and nozzles were brushed thoroughly using corresponding solutions water prior to spraying on plants 2 4 soil moisture dynamics access tubes were installed in the central part of representative plots within each block at both sites to monitor the dynamic soil moisture in both drought and benchmark plots as shown in fig a1 soil vwc in the depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm was measured by time domain reflectometry tdr trime tdr imko micromodultechnik gmbh ettlingen germany approximately twice a week throughout the growing season the tdr probe was calibrated by the manufacturer before use to compare the magnitude of drought between the two sites soil vwc was converted to smp according to the equations of corresponding swrc the equations of swrc for the two sites were determined on undisturbed soil using the pressure membrane apparatus 0700cg23f1 manifold soil moisture equipment corp usa bittelli and flury 2009 low pressure steps including 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 bar were applied with a 1 bar pressure plate and 3 5 10 and 15 bars were used for high pressure steps with a 5 bar pressure plate soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 30 and 30 60 cm using the steel corer diameter 5 cm height 5 cm and then samples were shaped using a knife to fit the size of the ring diameter 5 cm height 1 cm for the pressure application a minimum of two days without any outflow were required for equilibration to be attained once the equilibrium was established samples were removed from the pressure plates to measure gwc there were three replicates for each depth and each pressure step the porous plates were cleaned thoroughly with deionised water to prevent cross effects between pressures bd g cm3 was measured on sub soil samples n 3 for swrc at depths of 0 30 cm mean 1 47 sd 0 05 at bn mean 1 45 sd 0 8 at fn and 30 60 cm bn mean 1 66 sd 0 05 at bn mean 1 52 sd 0 03 at fn respectively soil vwc was then calculated by multiplying gwc by the mean of the two depths of bn followed by the linear model fitted with vwc against log transformed smp to obtain the equation of swrc

humidity obtained from the logger and the distance 0 5 m after calibration the temperatures of five randomly selected leaves per plot were acquired and the means of five recordings were recorded for each plot l t was used for data analysis calculated as the mean of benchmark plots subtracted from the individual plot for ws treatments 2 6 gas exchange analysis g s mol m 2 s 1 and a µmol m 2 s 1

blue led array with a flow rate of 300 µmol s 1 the co2 concentration of inlet air through the leaf chamber was 380 ppm all the data were recorded when steady state photosynthesis was achieved after 3 5 mins the flow check was calibrated before the first sampling time for each of the two experiments to check if the cycle times were long enough for the gas through the analysis cell to become stable before taking readings wuei μmol co2 mol h2o 1 was calculated from a divided by g s 2 7 endogenous aba concentration and leaf relative water content the first fully expanded leaf and one pod from the bottom of the terminal raceme of five plants per plot were collected for endo aba assay leaves were sampled at 7 and 14 das and pods at 28 das during 12 00 14 00 table 5 samples from each plot were placed into individual 50 ml vials and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored in a 80 c freezer for endo aba assay frozen leaves and pods were freeze dried for five days and further processed in accordance with the cusabio aba elisa protocol code csb e09159pl cusabio biotechnology co ltd wuhan hubei province 430206 china http www cusabio com leaves were collected for the analysis of rwc at 2 and 14 das at bn n 8 and fn n 4 table 5 two leaf discs per leaf were collected from fully expanded leaves at 12 00 14 00 using a punch diameter 32 mm and placed individually in a 50 ml tube fw was determined using a four decimal balance kern abs120 4 germany leaves were then soaked in the tube with distilled water and placed in a refrigerator at 4 c for 24 h next tw was recorded by carefully blotting the leaf discs on a paper towel before weighing them dw was then determined by placing them in a labelled paper envelope and oven drying at 105 c for 24 h leaf rwc was calculated according to

subsamples of 10 plants were randomly selected to determine pod number by hand followed by oven drying at 105 c for 48 h to determine aboveground biomass based on 0 moisture pod number per hectare and agb t ha 1 were then calculated by dividing the number of subsampled plants i e 10 by corresponding plant populations ha 1 seeds were obtained by threshing all pods manually followed by oven drying at

pictures of seeds spread out on white paper using analyse particles programme in image j software https ij imjoy io individual seed weight was calculated as the mean of the six samples by dividing seed weight by seed number per sample tsw was then calculated by multiplying individual seed weight by 1000 seed number per pod seed pod 1 was calculated from seed number ha 1 derived from seed yield and individual seed weight divided by pod number per hectare and the harvest index was calculated as the ratio of seed yield to agb oil content was determined using the soxtec system soxtec 1043 fat extraction unit foss in britain ireland uk dried samples were prepared by milling 10 g seeds per replicate using a coffee grinder duplicates 0 5 g samples with 10 g sand and 40 ml petroleum were performed for extraction procedures including boiling for 10 mins and rinsing for 20 mins oil yield t ha 1 was then calculated as the product of oil content and seed yield 2 9 statistical analysis data were analysed using genstat 18th edition vsn international hemel hempstead uk shapiro wilk and levene tests were used for estimating normality and homogeneity of variance prior to conducting an analysis of variance anova one way anova with polynomial contrasts was conducted to explore plant responses to at in terms of leaf temperature gas exchange endo aba in plant tissues leaf rwc and yield related parameters post hoc analyses were performed using tukey s test at p 0 05 to compare the difference between treatments simple linear regression analysis with treatments as groups using replicates was applied separately for two sites to test the relationship of gas exchange agb seed yield pod number and oil yield with at concentrations combined data of yield and yield components were fitted with a linear regression model against leaf rwc using means 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the mean daily air temperature at both sites was 17 c through the growing seasons and the minimum and maximum rh were 36 1 95 5 and 43 4 97 0 at bn and fn respectively fig 1a b after spray application until harvest the daily air temperature on average was 21 8 c at bn slightly higher than fn 19 6 c however min and max rh were lower at bn than at fn i e 36 8 95 6 and 43 0 97 1 respectively during the whole season the average sr received was 16 3 and 16 7 mj m 2 day 1 at bn and fn respectively it was 17 7 and 16 1 mj m 2 day 1 after spraying fig 1c compared to bn with early planting rapeseed plants at fn started flowering earlier and had a shorter growing season by 11 in terms of thermal time table 3 3 2 soil water status average soil vwc smp in benchmark plots was maintained at 27 5 0 01 mpa and 19 8 0 01 mpa throughout the growing season at bn and fn respectively in contrast soil moisture vwc smp in the top 60 cm significantly decreased with increasing dap at bn and fn showing no differences between at treated plots relative to 0at from regression analysis in groups data not shown overall soil water deficits were greater at bn than at fn at harvest soil moisture vwc smp decreased to below pwp at bn but it was not the case at fn particularly in smp fig 2 at bn soil vwc decreased from an average of 21 6 at 41 dap to 14 8 just above pwp at 74 dap one day before spraying and it further gradually declined to 12 6 at harvest i e 136 dap fig 2a the corresponding readings of smp were from 0 04 mpa to 0 77 mpa and ultimately to 2 08 mpa fig 2b at fn soil vwc decreased from the average of 13 2 at 36 dap to 12 2 at 56 dap one day before spraying and then it continually reduced to 9 69 at 112 dap near harvest with corresponding smp values of 0 10 0 22 and 0 67 mpa respectively fig 2c d 3 3 leaf temperature leaf temperature fluctuated considerably depending on the weather conditions at sampling fig 3 relative to the well watered benchmark spray treatments increased leaf temperature significantly to varying extents at both sites except for bn at 2 das table 6 l t at 2 das in 0at was 4 3 c and 1 3 c at bn and fn respectively while at 7 das l t was 1 5 c and 1 4 c fig 3 at had significant effects on l t at three sampling dates at both sites and a linear relationship was observed at fn although deviations from fn at 7das were significant when compared to 0at at increased l t by 67 and 35 at bn and fn respectively by averaging concentrations from the two sampling times 3 4 gas exchange drought inhibited g s and a and improved wuei substantially relative to the benchmark at both sites without statistical comparisons due to the non randomisation of benchmark plots fig 4 with the development of terminal drought responses in gas exchange to at application were more prominent at 8 das over 3 das across two trials table 6 at 8das in bn there was a significant and linear relationship between g s wuei and at concentrations readings of g s a and wuei at 8das were 0 3 mol m 2 s 1 16 5 µmol m 2 s 1 and 57 6 µmol co2 mol h2o 1 in 0at respectively when at increased from 0 to 3 at 8 das g s decreased by an average of 16 while wuei increased by 12 fig 4b j at fn g s a and wuei in 0at were 0 7 mol m 2 s 1 19 8 µmol m 2 s 1 and 32 2 µmol co2 mol h2o 1 only a had a significant and linear relationship with at concentrations table 6 at reduced a by an average of 18 across all concentrations at fn fig 4h 3 5 yield and yield components at both sites the application of at significantly influenced agb seed yield and pod number per hectare although with borderline significances in agb and seed yield at bn table 7 compared to the benchmark drought decreased agb and seed yield by an average of 43 and 37 at bn respectively fig 5a b and more markedly by 49 and 56 at fn fig 6a b although non randomised benchmark plots were not included in statistical analysis agb and seed yield in 0at were 13 5 5 6 t ha 1 and 5 6 1 5 ha 1 at bn and fn respectively at at 1 3 increased agb and seed yield by an average of 12 and 14 at bn respectively and to a greater extent by 31 and 34 at fn relative to 0at table 7 among all concentrations applied 3 at significantly increased agb and seed yield at fn only by 48 and 52 respectively compared to the benchmark terminal drought decreased pod number by an average of 38 and 34 at bn fig 5d and fn fig 6d respectively average at concentrations increased pod number per hectare by 7 and 25 at bn and fn respectively compared to 0at i e 57 and 15 1 million ha 1 at bn and fn respectively 3 at was significantly higher than 0at increased by 42 from both sites table 7 the oil content from the benchmark was 42 and 47 at bn and fn respectively compared to the benchmark oil content from drought plots was slightly lower decreased by 6 and 2 at bn and fn respectively fig 5 g fig 6 g compared to 0at 3 at increased oil yield by 31 and 45 at bn and fn respectively with the latter showing significance across all concentrations at application increased oil yield by 15 and 28 at bn and fn respectively however there were no significant effects observed on hi or tsw table 7 seed yield at bn and fn was linearly associated with at concentrations and so were agb pod number and oil yield table 7 with a 1 increase in the concentration of at the projected increase in agb seed yield and oil yield were respectively 1 35 0 61 0 25 t ha 1 at bn fig 5a b h and 0 85 0 23 0 10 t ha 1 at fn fig 6a b h pod number at bn showed very high variabilities due to significant deviations so it was not included in the linear regression model table 7 at fn every 1 increase in at concentrations was predicted to increase pod number per hectare by 1 92 106 fig 6d from the regression of yield with its components we found that seed yield was highly associated with pod number followed by seeds per pod at bn fig 7a c this is also consistent with fn in seed yield showing the highest positive correlation with pod number fig 7b but a negative correlation with seeds per pod with large variabilities fig 7d although leaf rwc was not significantly affected by at application at either sampling of the two sites fig a3 pod number was strongly associated with leaf rwc from the regression analysis on combined data with bn and fn showing different linear trends fig 8b pod number was predicted to increase at bn nearly six times more than it would be at fn with every 1 improvement in leaf rwc 4 discussion previous studies demonstrated that rapeseed plants exhibited significant physiological responses to at 0 25 1 and improvements in some yield components under glasshouse conditions xiang et al 2022 in the present field study with higher concentrations of at 1 3 we reject our null hypothesis and show that when applied at the flowering stage at improved seed yield of water stressed rapeseed by an average of 24 across concentrations and two sites this yield improvement was also reported in winter rapeseed michele et al 2017 and other crops like wheat mphande et al 2021b furthermore seed yield and at concentrations were linearly correlated indicating that the optimum concentration is above 3 and increasing concentrations of at above 3 may result in greater yield for rapeseed under terminal drought stomatal closure is the earliest response to drought for the maintenance of leaf water potential which restricts the diffusion of water and co2 into the leaf flexas and medrano 2002 we showed that drought reduced g s and a by an average of 73 37 and 39 22 across two sampling times at bn and fn respectively and improved wuei by 176 and 31 as compared to the well watered benchmark fig 4 negative effects of drought on rapeseed have been widely reported by previous research hess et al 2015 yan et al 2016 the degree of which is positively associated with the magnitude of water stress faralli et al 2016 an increase in wuei of water stressed rapeseed has also been reported by elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 and biswas et al 2019 compared to fn the further suppression of g s at bn could be explained by the greater and longer lasting soil water deficit and drought at bn developed about three times faster than at fn in terms of soil smp fig 7 from the previous glasshouse study under controlled drought conditions we found that g s and a of at treated rapeseed plants had a significant and negative relationship with specific at concentrations 0 25 1 the greater detrimental effects of increasing concentrations from 1 to 3 were also observed from some sampling times at the two sites in the present study under terminal drought but with large variabilities between them due to variable environmental conditions in the field table 6 as concentrations increased more stomata were blocked with higher leaf coverage which augmented the suppression of g s xiang et al 2021 to confirm this a preliminary pot experiment was conducted to estimate leaf coverage of different at concentrations by arranging four replicates at an interspace the same as plants in the field experiment results showed that leaf coverage and at concentrations were positively correlated and leaf coverage increased approximately from 20 to 30 when at was applied from 1 to 3 fig a4 apart from concentrations drought intensity would also impact gas exchange responses to at application del amor et al 2010 under drought conditions rapeseed plants adopting a conventional strategy via stomatal closing would result in less leaf cooling elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 which could also be confirmed by increased leaf temperature from water stressed plots fig 3 after at application reduced g s is expected to reduce leaf transpiration thus increasing leaf temperature gale and hagan 1966 this is also confirmed in the present study when compared to 0at the application of at increased leaf temperature by 1 1 1 8 c averaging all concentrations at both sites fig 3 this is consistent with previous studies by faralli et al 2016 on winter rapeseed and gatti et al 2016 on grapevines faralli et al 2016 found that vg at 1 increased leaf temperature significantly compared to well watered control and leaf temperature increased by 1 c compared to unsprayed control similarly gatti et al 2016 applied a higher concentration of vg at 2 and found that sprayed leaves were moderately warmer by 1 2 c than unsprayed ones the heating effect can be explained by greater resistance to the passage of water vapour from at application thereby increasing the turgidity of guard cells and slowing evaporative cooling effects davenport et al 1972 in addition l t increased linearly as at concentrations increased from 1 to 3 but with highly significant deviations at both sites table 6 this suggests that the relationship between l t and at concentrations may not always be linear and a more complex relationship may involve leaf metabolic processes following blocked stomata or canopy structure could also impact the relationship the aba accumulation in guard cells triggers stomatal closure thus preventing plants from losing excessive water under drought conditions kollist et al 2014 previous studies conducted by faralli et al 2017a showed that at application at the flowering stage of winter rapeseed reduced endo aba concentration in the leaf and pod at 7 and 16 das similar findings have also been reported on wheat mphande et al 2021b in our study however differences between treatments in endo aba of leaves at 7 14 das or of pods at 28 das were not significant fig a5 this might be explained by the dynamic responses of endo aba to different environmental conditions leaf synthesised aba might be loaded to the phloem and transported to the roots wilkinson and davies 2002 alternatively our colleagues compared vg and fluridone aba inhibitor on wheat and found no significant difference in endo aba from fluridone application but vg sprayed reduced endo aba due to the conservation of plant water by suppressing transpiration mphande 2021 unpublished data nevertheless the role of aba in the activity of film at remains elusive and requires further research during flowering and pod set the relationship between source and sink regulates the availability of assimilates necessary for seed filling diepenbrock 2000 numerous studies have reported that terminal drought can cause massive yield losses in rapeseed faralli et al 2017b elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 which is also supported by our study showing that terminal drought resulted in 46 6 seed yield losses across two sites compared to the benchmark fig 5b fig 6b the large decrease was strongly associated with reductions in agb and pod number by 46 6 and 36 4 respectively fig 7 which can be explained by a substantial decline of available assimilates during the flowering stage which in turn negatively affected the formation of pods and seed size johnston et al 2002 wang et al 2011 leading to abortion and or abscission of pods particularly tesfamariam et al 2010 however yield losses caused by drought were lower at bn than at fn which were 36 5 and 56 7 relative to the benchmark respectively without statistical comparisons because of non randomisation in benchmark plots one possible explanation would be the huge difference in initial nutrients available for plants in the soil as both sites showed similar levels of air temperature and rh initial available n from bn was almost eight times higher than from fn 300 vs 70 kg ha 1 respectively greater n supply can improve individual plant growth through a higher leaf area index and a prolonged period of photosynthetic activity thereby producing high yields wang et al 2014 additionally plants at bn had a 13 longer growth period than at fn in terms of thermal time due to early planting which resulted in greater dry matter accumulation sieling et al 2017 taken together these two important factors boosted plant growth at bn and produced a much higher yield at bn than at fn and other related parameters figs 5 6 although fungicide and insecticide were applied at both sites plants at fn were still affected by pollen beetles and fungus disease particularly during the reproductive stage which may have partially accounted for yield losses in the current study we first demonstrated that seed yield had a linear and positive relationship with concentrations of at from 1 to 3 similar relationships were also observed in agb pod number ha and oil yield with at concentrations table 7 an increase in agb by 22 across at concentrations and two sites relative to 0at is consistent with faralli et al 2016 who studied winter rapeseed and found two types of film at at 1 increased aboveground dry matter by an average of about 17 under terminal drought this improvement in shoot biomass has also been demonstrated in other crops such as sweet corn shekour et al 1987 fava bean davenport et al 1972 wheat mphande et al 2021a and olives cirillo et al 2021 from the glasshouse study however we only observed improvements in some yield components xiang et al 2022 the individual plants in a controlled environment can experience different light and water conditions compared to those in the field resulting in different responses to at application there may be two reasons for the difference in yield response in our glasshouse and field studies first soil hydraulics that affect the expansive growth of reproductive organs pod and seed in varying degrees leading to pod and seed abortion varied between these two studies turc and tardieu 2018 soil moisture decreased gradually throughout the whole season in the field experiments while potted plants in the glasshouse experienced rapid onset of water deficit and soil moisture was maintained at a similar level i e 30 awc equal to 20 vwc only at the flowering stage albeit with fluctuations fig 2 a non limiting shoot leaf and pod water status could have been maintained for longer with at application under slower soil drying thereby preventing some of the pod abortion seen in drought stricken plants without at second different ways of imposing drought can impact the capability of yield compensation during seed filling stage as terminal drought developed with increasing dap in the field drought may have imposed more restrictions on the capacity of surviving pods and seeds for compensatory growth at the later seed filling stage kirkegaard et al 2018 improving leaf water status particularly during the flowering stage is vital in determining final crop production as it is closely associated with gas exchange raza et al 2017 the application of at physically blocks leaf stomata and reduces water loss through transpiration improving leaf water status davenport et al 1972 this is also reported by faralli et al 2017a on winter rapeseed showing that plants treated with at 1 exhibited significantly higher rwc relative to unsprayed control however in the present study we failed to see a significant increase in leaf rwc at 2 or 14 das from two sites compared to 0at fig a3 the lack of statistical significance in leaf rwc might be attributed to variable environmental conditions at the time of sampling different types of drought and plant varieties may also result in the discrepancy compared with faralli et al 2017a nevertheless pod number and leaf rwc were significantly and positively correlated with separate lines from the two experiments fig 8b indicating the greater pod number from increasing at concentration appeared to be mediated by leaf rwc since seed yield was strongly related to pod number fig 7a b it can be deduced that greater seed yield from increasing at concentration may also have been mediated by rwc fig 8a our study showed a greater yield from increasing at concentrations which confirms findings from a previous study conducted at fn on winter rapeseed faralli et al 2017b researchers sprayed three concentrations of film at vg on winter rapeseed subject to terminal drought showing that at at 1 0 5 2 1 and 4 l ha 1 2 increased seed yield by 14 14 and 21 respectively when at applied at the flowering stage although with no significant differences between concentrations this strong relationship with at concentrations was also reported by fahey and rogiers 2019 on grape bunches dipped in 0 1 2 and 3 vg solutions showing a linear and positive relationship between the bunch mass loss and at concentrations for water stressed rapeseed therefore we can improve seed yield by increasing concentrations of film at based on the current price of rapeseed and the average cost of spraying an at product vapor gard the improvement from 1 2 l ha 1 and 3 2 l ha 1 at flowering of rapeseed under drought would approximately result in an economic benefit of 29 36 ha and 555 88 ha respectively more details available in table a1 higher concentrations however would increase the cost of products and reduce economic profits which is less cost effective and practical since rapeseed stomata are unequally distributed between the surfaces with 44 of total stomata on the adaxial and 56 on the abaxial surface table a2 an alternative to increasing the concentration is to optimise the spraying method to achieve higher leaf coverage i e stomatal blockage of both adaxial and abaxial surface results from a preliminary study showed that leaf coverage was approximately 20 and 30 at the concentration of 1 and 3 at respectively fig a4 on the other hand only one genotype was used in our study further work is recommended on different genotypes at more than one location year when water supply and demand vary to verify the response of water stressed rapeseed to film at at different concentrations 5 conclusion in the present study drought caused yield losses as compared to well watered benchmark although benchmark was not included in the statistical test after film at was applied at the flowering stage leaf temperature increased as expected due to blocked stomata accompanied by the inhibition of gas exchange but improved intrinsic water use efficiency a linear and positive relationship was found in seed yield aboveground biomass pod number and oil yield with at concentrations this at involved yield improvement was predominantly determined by increased pod number and it was shown that pod number was closely correlated to leaf water status i e relative water content therefore we conclude that rapeseed yield can be improved by increasing at concentrations when plants are under terminal drought the yield benefit from at application appeared to be mediated by improving leaf water status future research on the root shoot water relations and osmotic responses to film at would be worthwhile for understanding the relationship of at with plant water status and the role of aba involved in the mode of action of film at merits further investigation improving leaf coverage considering both sides of leaf surfaces would also help lower the cost and extend the commercial use of film at credit authorship contribution statement jie xiang was involved in methodology formal analysis investigation

farm profitability the cc treatments were cereal rye secale cereale l hairy vetch vicia villosa r wheat triticum aestivum l radish raphanus sativus l turnip brassica rapa l mix and no cc the irrigation thresholds used for irrigation scheduling were a wet threshold 40 kpa a dry threshold 90 kpa and no irrigation soybean yield was highest 6021 kg ha 1 following hairy vetch cc under the wet irrigation threshold in 2020 but no differences were observed in 2021 water productivity was lower under the wet irrigation threshold than all other treatments in 2020 and at least 23 lower in wet threshold treatments than dry threshold treatments in 2021 irrigation water use efficiency was higher under the dry irrigation threshold than the wet irrigation threshold in 2020 when averaged over two years cc s reduced economic returns than no cc under all irrigation treatments except for wheat radish turnip mix under the dry threshold treatments our results suggest that long term evaluation

aquifer keywords furrow irrigation cereal rye hairy vetch water productivity irrigation water use efficiency data availability the authors have permission to share data on request 1 introduction soybean is a major row crop produced throughout the state of mississippi in 2019 approximately 664 000 ha of soybean were produced in mississippi while 79 of the production was in the mississippi delta region usda nass 2021 soybean in this region is planted to a maturity group mg iv variety and irrigated through furrow irrigation via polyethylene tubing bryant et al 2017 the mississippi delta region receives around 1370 mm of rainfall each year however irrigation to soybean is necessary due to historically frequent droughts that occur during the summer season heatherly 1999 additionally intensive tillage operations every year are necessary to prepare fields in this region which have led to soil compaction and sealing of the soil surface roth et al 1988 as the soils become compacted the ability to retain and hold moisture is hindered which requires additional irrigation to fulfill crop water demands vories and evett 2014 the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa serves as the primary source of groundwater for soybean irrigation in the mid southern united states which comprises the delta regions of arkansas louisiana mississippi tennessee and missouri irrigation for agricultural production is the primary use of this aquifer as it takes up 98 of total aquifer withdrawal with arkansas and mississippi being the first and second largest users of the aquifer barlow and clark 2011 maupin and barber 2005 lower precipitation in summers with higher air temperatures 30 c leads to excessive groundwater pumping to meet crop water demands this has caused the mrvaa to decline substantially over time and has placed significant importance on finding ways to improve aquifer replenishment or reduce the rate of water withdrawals from aquifer to allow its use over a longer period one of the best management practices that can be utilized for soil water conservation and potential reduction in irrigation application is the use of winter ccs into the soybean production systems cover crops have been shown to improve soil and water use dynamics over time clark 2007 initially ccs can cause soil water depletion early in the season during active growth blanco canqui et al 2013 however they serve as a mulch and decomposed cc residues can subsequently slow surface water loss and increase soil water holding capacity irmak 2020 due to the associated risks of ccs as well as the unavailability of economic information the adoption of ccs in commodity crop production systems has been minimal in 2017 ccs were planted on 3 9 of total cropland in the united states which was 1 2 higher than 2012 however the net change in acres of ccs during this time frame was 2 000 000 ha anderson 2019 sawadgo and plastina 2022 usda nass 2019 another management strategy that can be utilized to mitigate over pumping of groundwater from the mrvaa is the adoption of sensor based irrigation scheduling techniques traditionally producers in the mid southern united states initiate irrigation to soybean at the r1 r2 growth stage and use a continuous flow delivery system on a 7 or 10 day cycle until soybean reaches the r7 growth stage bryant et al 2017 however krutz et al 2014 found that sensor based irrigation scheduling reduced irrigation water applied to soybean by 50 compared to conventional methods while previous research has been documented on the independent effects of ccs and sensor based irrigation scheduling on soybean production limited information is available on the combined effects of these management strategies therefore the objective of this study was to determine the effect of winter ccs and irrigation scheduling sensor threshold on soybean yield iwue wp and economic returns in the sub humid climate of the mississippi delta region our hypothesis is that the use of cover crops will improve soil properties resulting in better water infiltration and storage in soil and thus reducing the irrigation water application 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment a field experiment was conducted from 2019 to 2021 at the national center for alluvial aquifer research mississippi state university delta research and extension center

in each plot of the second replication at depths of 15 30 and 61 cm irrigation events were triggered when the weighted average of all three sensors reached 40 kpa for the wet threshold and 90 kpa for the dry threshold this irrigation protocol was used for the entire growing season regardless of rooting depth or crop growth stage irrigation was applied through furrow irrigation via polyethylene tubing and irrigation was terminated at the r6 5 growth stage as recommended by the mississippi state university extension a flowmeter m0310 mccrometer inc hemet california usa was used to estimate the total water applied dates for field operations and irrigation events are provided in table 1 2 4 data collection aboveground cc biomass samples were collected in the spring prior to cc termination by tossing an 1830 cm2 quadrat into each plot and cutting all above ground biomass from the area within the quadrat with electric shears sun joe cordless grass shear carlstadt new jersey usa the samples were oven dried at 60 c until a constant weight was achieved weighed and ground using a wiley mill thomas scientific swedesboro new jersey usa with a 0 5 mm sieve the samples were then shipped

carbon and nitrogen content using the methods described in mcgeehan and naylor 1988 soybean was harvested using a kinkaid 8xp plot combine haven kansas usa from the center two rows in each plot soybean seed yield test weight and harvest moisture content was collected from the plot combine using the mirus software and h2 graingage juniper systems harvestmaster inc logan utah usa soybean seed yield was adjusted to 130 g kg 1 13 moisture content prior to analysis seed samples were collected from each plot at the time of harvest for analysis of oil and protein content using a foss infratec grain analyzer eden prairie minnesota usa seed samples were sieved and shattered seeds were removed to ensure clean and whole seeds were used for the seed quality analysis two 100 count seed weights were averaged to determine the seed index irrigation water use efficiency and wp were calculated after soybean harvest to determine soybean crop productivity in terms of water use rainfall data for wp was collected from soybean planting to harvest using the national weather service s cooperative observing station located in leland mississippi fig 1 gregory 2004 started using the terms water use efficiency and wp interchangeably for the same measure but we make a more precise distinction in this study by calculating iwue and wp following vories et al 2005 and kijne et al 2003 respectively 1 irrigation water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 total seed yield kg ha 1 irrigation water supplied mm 2 water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 total seed yield kg ha 1 total water irrigation rainfall mm 2 5 economic analysis planning budgets from mississippi state university s department of agricultural economics msudae 2019 2020 were used to calculate specified expenses and returns for each treatment for both years of the study these budgets are determined for soybean production in 76 cm rows therefore a space factor 0 7576 was created and related input costs were adjusted for 101 6 cm row spacing cover crop seed was broadcast applied using a hand seeder to each plot to simulate an aerial seeding therefore the cost for the aerial application of ccs was obtained from a local licensed

irrigation pipe not included in dryland treatments diesel fuel for irrigation repairs and maintenance and interest were the only parameters that made differences in estimated costs and returns per treatment and were dependent on the amount of water applied or the number of irrigation events a budget was generated to supply 229 mm ha 1 of water across three irrigation events to adjust for irrigation labor a factor of 0 6274 hr 1 ha 1 event 1 was adjusted from the original budget depending on the number of irrigation events applied an irrigation cost factor was calculated by taking actual water applied in excess of 229 mm this cost factor was multiplied by the price of diesel fuel for irrigation repairs and maintenance and interest to give us adjusted cost per hectare costs for cc seeds for both years were 0 19 kg 1 for cereal rye 1 31 kg 1 for hairy vetch 0 16 kg 1 for wheat 1 27 kg 1 for radish and 0 9 kg 1 for turnip diesel price for 2020 and 2021 was 0 40 l 1 and 0 62 l

was 0 40 kg 1 and 0 46 kg 1 for 2020 and 2021 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed using the glimmix procedure in sas 9 4 v sas software cary nc and the least square differences among treatment means were calculated at alpha 0 05 prior to the analysis all variables were tested for normality using the univariate procedure in sas all variables were normally distributed and the residuals from the models also generally conformed to normality irrigation thresholds and ccs were treated as fixed effects while each replication was treated as a random effect data were analyzed separately for each year due to significant effect of year in the initial analysis the mean values as well as the p values associated with the sources of variation for the individual analyzed parameters are provided in tables 2 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 cover crops biomass production c and n content cn ratio and n uptake cover crop biomass production c and n content cn ratio and n uptake was significantly affected by the main effects of ccs in both years of this study table 2 cover crop biomass production in 2020 was affected by the interaction between irrigation thresholds and ccs while n uptake in 2020 was also impacted by the main effect of irrigation thresholds wheat radish turnip mix under the wet irrigation threshold produced at least 1258 kg ha 1 more cc biomass than all other treatment combinations in 2020 table 2 after overseeding ccs in 2019 minimal precipitation 10 2 mm was received during september which affected cc stand establishment fig 1 it has been reported that ccs should be overseeded when precipitation is in the near forecast to ensure proper stand establishment rieck hinz and anderson 2017 when data were averaged over irrigation thresholds all cc treatments produced at least 1370 kg ha 1 more biomass than the no cc control in 2020 the biomass in the no cc plots included weeds in 2021 hairy vetch produced at least 2942 kg ha 1 more biomass than all other cc treatments when data were averaged over irrigation treatments table 2 in february of 2021 a significant snow and ice event proved to be detrimental to all cc treatments the aboveground biomass of all cover crops was not able to recover and showed no significant growth after the snowfall event except for hairy vetch during the event the study site received 48 mm of snowfall and 40 mm of rainfall with a low temperature of 12 c and a high temperature of 0 c nws 2021 hairy vetch has been reported to withstand temperatures as low as 15 c clark 2007 which allowed it to produce significantly more biomass no differences were observed for the cc biomass between the cereal rye wheat turnip radish mix and no cc treatments in 2021 in the no cc treatments the plots contained winter annual weeds which were predominately italian ryegrass lolium multiflorum l chickweed stellaria media l and henbit lamium amplexicaule l cover crop biomass carbon concentration was similar across ccs species but it was at least 40 higher than the no cc control in 2020 in 2021 cereal rye and hairy vetch treatments were at least 4 and 8 higher in carbon concentration than the wheat radish turnip mix and no cc treatments respectively table 2 reports have shown that c and n concentration in cc biomass is directly correlated to the amount of biomass produced finney et al 2016 hairy vetch treatments had significantly higher biomass in 2021 which would explain its higher carbon concentration as for cereal rye it has been documented that increased lignin content in cereal and grass ccs cause an increase in carbon concentration mubvumba 2018 in both years of this study hairy vetch treatments contained the highest nitrogen concentration among cc treatments hairy vetch had at least 62 and 101 more nitrogen concentration than other cc treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 2 hairy vetch is a legume cc that fixes atmospheric nitrogen nitrogen accumulation in hairy vetch has been reported to be dependent on the amount of biomass produced unkovich et al 2010 and has been documented to reach up to 217 kg n ha 1 in biomass in warmer climates parr et al 2011 in both years hairy vetch had the lowest cn ratio among all treatments due to higher nitrogen concentration in hairy vetch treatments weidhuner et al 2019 described that nitrogen content is the foremost factor determining cn ratio in 2020 cereal rye and wheat radish turnip mix contained at least 37 and 75 higher cn ratio than no cc and hairy vetch respectively in 2021 cereal rye had at least 24 higher cn ratio than all other cc treatments while wheat radish turnip mix contained 37 and 153 higher cn ratio than no cc and hairy vetch respectively table 2 lower cn ratio of hairy vetch facilitates in higher decomposition rate and quicker n release which can be used for a subsequent cash crop sievers and cook 2018 singh et al 2020 cover crop biomass n was highest in hairy vetch treatments for both years of this study due to higher biomass production and n concentration hairy vetch contained at least 25 7 and 149 kg ha 1 more n than all other cc treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively wheat radish turnip mixture had 25 8 and 50 5 kg ha 1 greater biomass n than cereal rye and no cc by respectively 3 2 soybean 3 2 1 biomass production and c and n concentration no statistical differences were observed for soybean biomass production carbon concentration and n uptake in both years of this study table 3 in 2020 soybean biomass nitrogen concentration showed no statistical difference between the wet and dry irrigation threshold treatments however the wet irrigation treatments had 8 more nitrogen concentration than the non irrigated control in 2020 the cn ratio showed no statistical difference between the no irrigation control and the dry irrigation threshold however the no irrigation control had a 9 higher cn ratio than the wet irrigation threshold table 3 the greater n concentration in soybean biomass in the wet irrigation threshold lowered the cn ratio of that treatment overall soybean vegetative growth was not affected by ccs or irrigation threshold in the two years of this research indicating the resiliency of this crop 3 2 2 seed yield soybean seed test weight was affected by the main effects of irrigation thresholds in 2020 while soybean seed moisture showed no significant differences in 2020 soybean seed test weight was 0 5 and 0 8 kg hl 1 higher in the no irrigation control treatment than the dry and wet irrigation threshold treatments respectively table 4 soybean seed yield was affected by the interaction of irrigation thresholds and ccs in 2020 but no differences were observed in 2021 table 4 in 2020 soybean seed yield was at least 314 kg ha 1 greater following hairy vetch under the wet irrigation threshold than all other treatment combinations except for cereal rye under the wet irrigation threshold soybean following hairy vetch treatments had in higher seed yield compared to the no cc treatment under the wet irrigation threshold all cc treatments had greater yields than the no cc treatments under the dry irrigation threshold under the dry irrigation threshold soybean following hairy vetch had at least 394 kg ha 1 greater seed yield than the other cc treatments under no irrigation soybean following the wheat radish turnip mix was at least 113 kg ha 1 greater yield than no cc but it was similar to soybean following hairy vetch table 4 bryant et al 2017 reported that sensor based irrigation scheduling did not adversely impact soybean seed yield in mississippi when data were averaged over irrigation treatments ccs increased soybean yield by 238 599 kg ha compared to no cc control in 2020 but there was no difference in 2021 also irrigation application to soybean following hairy vetch and cereal rye treatments increased soybean yield by 496 976 kg ha 1 compared to the non irrigated treatments when data was averaged over cover crops in 2020 under no cc treatments irrigation scheduling for the wet sensor threshold had greater yield than the dry and no irrigation treatments in 2020 however only wet sensor threshold treatments had 509 kg ha 1 higher yield than the no irrigation treatment for the wheat radish turnip mix in 2020 in year two no statistical differences were observed in soybean yield suggesting dryland production can be opted to maintain soybean yields and for water conservation 3 2 3 water productivity soybean wp was by affected the interaction between irrigation thresholds and ccs in 2020 and the main effect of irrigation thresholds in 2021 table 4 rainfall totals throughout the growing seasons were 589 and 677 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 1 in 2020 wp was highest following the wheat radish turnip mix under no irrigation compared to all other treatments except for cereal rye and no cc under the dry irrigation threshold and hairy vetch under no irrigation cover crop treatments under the wet irrigation threshold had at least 10 lower wp than all other treatment combinations in 2020 table 4 similar results were reported by alfonso et al 2020 indicating that wp in soybean was improved 4 10 with the inclusion of a cc in this case wheat radish turnip mix and cereal rye under a more conservative irrigation threshold or no irrigation maintained enough residual soil moisture to eliminate a need for irrigation in 2021 the dry irrigation threshold had 4 and 30 higher water productivity than no irrigation and wet irrigation threshold treatments respectively table 4 3 2 3 1 irrigation water use efficiency all irrigated treatments received irrigation in 2020 except for no cc under the dry irrigation threshold the amount of irrigation water applied and number of irrigation events is provided in table 1 in 2020 iwue for cereal rye under the dry irrigation threshold was at least 175 higher than all other irrigated treatments this treatment only reached the threshold once resulting in much less irrigation water applied than the other irrigated treatments and greater iwue all dry irrigation threshold treatments had significantly higher iwue than the wet irrigation threshold treatments table 4 under the wet irrigation threshold soybean following hairy vetch had the highest iwue followed by no cc and cereal rye whereas the wheat radish turnip mix had the lowest iwue in 2020 in 2021 only the wet irrigation threshold treatments reached the threshold and received irrigation soybean following cereal rye had 9 higher iwue than the other ccs table 4 wood et al 2020 reported similar results and noted that maintaining a sensor threshold of 85 kpa throughout the growing season optimized soybean yield and iwue compared to 50 kpa and 125 kpa thresholds in our study the dry threshold did not maximize yield with ccs as much as the wet threshold treatments in 2020 except for the wheat radish turnip mix however iwue was higher for the dry threshold additionally not having to irrigate the dry irrigation threshold treatments while maintaining a similar yield would suggest that the dry irrigation threshold would be recommended to improve iwue however the final decision can be made based on economic returns furthermore cereal rye under the wet and dry irrigation threshold seemed to be the best cc treatment to improve iwue in contrast bryant et al 2021 reporting that cereal rye decreased iwue in soybean up to 10 in a conservation tillage system based on these results the evaluation of iwue on soybean with irrigation thresholds and ccs particularly cereal rye should be continued to determine the extent of its effectiveness 3 2 4 seed quality soybean seed oil content was affected by the main effect of irrigation threshold in 2020 while no statistical differences were observed in 2021 table 5 in 2020 oil content was at least 1 higher under no irrigation than the wet and dry irrigation thresholds differences were observed for soybean protein content from the main effect of irrigation threshold in both years of this study as well as from the main effect of ccs for seed index in 2021 protein content was 2 and 1 higher in wet irrigation threshold treatments than in the dry irrigation threshold treatments and no irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 our results are consistent with the findings of foroud et al 1993 and kirnak et al 2010 both studies examined the impacts of soybean grain composition under different irrigation regimes and they found that protein content in soybean was higher with more irrigation while oil content was higher under the drier regimes seed index in 2021 was highest following the wheat radish turnip mix which was 3 higher than the other cc treatments table 5 3 3 economic returns yields were high and selling prices were fair 0 40 kg 1 for soybean in 2020 which resulted in good returns above specified expenses in 2020 the most profitable treatment combination was the no cc control under the wet irrigation threshold however this treatment combination was only 1 ha 1 higher than hairy vetch under the wet irrigation threshold table 6 the lowest profiting treatment under the wet irrigation threshold was wheat radish turnip mix which was higher than all other treatment combinations under the dry irrigation threshold and no irrigation except for hairy vetch under the dry irrigation threshold and wheat radish turnip mix under no irrigation table 6 in 2020 wet irrigation threshold had higher economic returns for all cc treatments except wheat radish turnip mix when compared to no irrigation treatments in 2021 soybean selling price was 15 higher 0 46 kg 1 but soybean yield was lower resulting in lower overall returns above specified expenses the most profitable treatment combination in the second year of the study was the no cc control under no irrigation which returned at least 42 ha 1 more than all other treatment combinations table 6 similarly reddy 2001 found that no cc treatments had higher net returns than the cc treatments for soybean production system on a dundee silt loam soil in stoneville mississippi these results explain why producers are abandoning ccs by the second year of adoption sawadgo and plastina 2022 this is an indication that more incentives are needed to compensate producers for the losses associated with the establishment of ccs averaged over two years planting ccs reduced economic returns compared to no cc treatments under each irrigation treatment except for wheat radish turnip mix under the dry irrigation threshold treatments fig 2 4 conclusion the objective of this research was to determine which combination of winter cc and irrigation threshold would maximize soybean yield iwue wp and farm profitability in the first year of cc establishment the wet irrigation threshold produced the highest soybean yield when combined with hairy vetch or cereal rye water productivity and iwue increased under cereal rye with the dry irrigation threshold in year two similar yields were observed among all treatments furthermore wp was highest under the dry irrigation threshold while iwue was highest when soybean followed cereal rye under the wet irrigation threshold the dry irrigation threshold treatments did not require irrigation in year two making iwue calculations not applicable although most treatment combinations were similar in economic value the most profitable treatment combination was no cc under the wet irrigation threshold when averaged over both years based on these results continued evaluation is needed to determine if ccs with conservative irrigation thresholds can be used to maximize soybean productivity and profitability in the mid southern usa additional payment rates may need to be included in the government programs to make ccs more economically viable for

soybean is a major row crop produced throughout the state of mississippi in 2019 approximately 664 000 ha of soybean were produced in mississippi while 79 of the production was in the mississippi delta region usda nass 2021 soybean in this region is planted to a maturity group mg iv variety and irrigated through furrow irrigation via polyethylene tubing bryant et al 2017 the mississippi delta region receives around 1370 mm of rainfall each year however irrigation to soybean is necessary due to historically frequent droughts that occur during the summer season heatherly 1999 additionally intensive tillage operations every year are necessary to prepare fields in this region which have led to soil compaction and sealing of the soil surface roth et al 1988 as the soils become compacted the ability to retain and hold moisture is hindered which requires additional irrigation to fulfill crop water demands vories and evett 2014 the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa serves as the primary source of groundwater for soybean irrigation in the mid southern united states which comprises the delta regions of arkansas louisiana mississippi tennessee and missouri irrigation for agricultural production is the primary use of this aquifer as it takes up 98 of total aquifer withdrawal with arkansas and mississippi being the first and second largest users of the aquifer barlow and clark 2011 maupin and barber 2005 lower precipitation in summers with higher air temperatures 30 c leads to excessive groundwater pumping to meet crop water demands this has caused the mrvaa to decline substantially over time and has placed significant importance on finding ways to improve aquifer replenishment or reduce the rate of water withdrawals from aquifer to allow its use over a longer period one of the best management practices that can be utilized for soil water conservation and potential reduction in irrigation application is the use of winter ccs into the soybean production systems cover crops have been shown to improve soil and water use dynamics over time clark 2007 initially ccs can cause soil water depletion early in the season during active growth blanco canqui et al 2013 however they serve as a mulch and decomposed cc residues can subsequently slow surface water loss and increase soil water holding capacity irmak 2020 due to the associated risks of ccs as well as the unavailability of economic information the adoption of ccs in commodity crop production systems has been minimal in 2017 ccs were planted on 3 9 of total cropland in the united states which was 1 2 higher than 2012 however the net change in acres of ccs during this time frame was 2 000 000 ha anderson 2019 sawadgo and plastina 2022 usda nass 2019 another management strategy that can be utilized to mitigate over pumping of groundwater from the mrvaa is the adoption of sensor based irrigation scheduling techniques traditionally producers in the mid southern united states initiate irrigation to soybean at the r1 r2 growth stage and use a continuous flow delivery system on a 7 or 10 day cycle until soybean reaches the r7 growth stage bryant et al 2017 however krutz et al 2014 found that sensor based irrigation scheduling reduced irrigation water applied to soybean by 50 compared to conventional methods while previous research has been documented on the independent effects of ccs and sensor based irrigation scheduling on soybean production limited information is available on the combined effects of these management strategies therefore the objective of this study was to determine the effect of winter ccs and irrigation scheduling sensor threshold on soybean yield iwue wp and economic returns in the sub humid climate of the mississippi delta region our hypothesis is that the use of cover crops will improve soil properties resulting in better water infiltration and storage in soil and thus reducing the irrigation water application 2 materials and

north carolina usa when soybean reached the v3 to v4 growth stage 2 3 irrigation after soybean establishment watermark soil moisture sensors 200ss irrometer co riverside california usa were installed in each plot of the second replication at depths of 15 30 and 61 cm irrigation events were triggered when the weighted average of all three sensors reached 40 kpa for the wet threshold and 90 kpa for the dry threshold this irrigation protocol was used for the entire growing season regardless of rooting depth or crop growth stage irrigation was applied through furrow irrigation via polyethylene tubing and irrigation was terminated at the r6 5 growth stage as recommended by the mississippi state university extension a flowmeter m0310 mccrometer inc hemet california usa was used to estimate the total water applied dates for field operations and irrigation events are provided in table 1 2 4 data collection aboveground cc biomass samples were collected in the spring prior to cc termination by tossing an 1830 cm2 quadrat into each plot and cutting all above ground biomass from the area within the quadrat with electric shears sun joe cordless grass shear carlstadt new jersey usa the samples were oven dried at 60 c until a constant weight was achieved weighed and ground using a wiley mill thomas scientific swedesboro new jersey usa with a 0 5 mm sieve the samples were then shipped

carbon and nitrogen content using the methods described in mcgeehan and naylor 1988 soybean was harvested using a kinkaid 8xp plot combine haven kansas usa from the center two rows in each plot soybean seed yield test weight and harvest moisture content was collected from the plot combine using the mirus software and h2 graingage juniper systems harvestmaster inc logan utah usa soybean seed yield was adjusted to 130 g kg 1 13 moisture content prior to analysis seed samples were collected from each plot at the time of harvest for analysis of oil and protein content using a foss infratec grain analyzer eden prairie minnesota usa seed samples were sieved and shattered seeds were removed to ensure clean and whole seeds were used for the seed quality analysis two 100 count seed weights were averaged to determine the seed index irrigation water use efficiency and wp were calculated after soybean harvest to determine soybean crop productivity in terms of water use rainfall data for wp was collected from soybean planting to harvest using the national weather service s cooperative observing station located in leland mississippi fig 1 gregory 2004 started using the terms water use efficiency and wp interchangeably for the same measure but we make a more precise distinction in this study by calculating iwue and wp following vories et al 2005 and kijne et al 2003 respectively 1

economic analysis planning budgets from mississippi state university s department of agricultural economics msudae 2019 2020 were used to calculate specified expenses and returns for each treatment for both years of the study these budgets are determined for soybean production in 76 cm rows therefore a space factor 0 7576 was created and related input costs were adjusted for 101 6 cm row spacing cover crop seed was broadcast applied using a hand seeder to each plot to simulate an aerial seeding therefore the cost for the aerial application of ccs was obtained from a local licensed agricultural pilot tyler arnold personal communication 2021 specified expenses used in the analysis include soybean and cc seed costs aerial application fertilizers herbicides cc burndown pre emerge for soybean post emerge for soybean irrigation pipe seed hauling operator labor irrigation labor hand labor diesel fuel repair and maintenance cover crop seed cost seed yield irrigation labor irrigation pipe not included in dryland treatments diesel fuel for irrigation repairs and maintenance and interest were the only parameters that made differences in estimated costs and returns per treatment and were dependent on the amount of water applied or the number of irrigation events a budget was generated to supply 229 mm ha 1 of water across three irrigation events to adjust for irrigation labor a factor of 0 6274 hr 1 ha 1 event 1 was adjusted from the original budget depending on the number of irrigation events applied an irrigation cost factor was calculated by taking actual water applied in excess of 229 mm this cost factor was multiplied by the price of diesel fuel for irrigation repairs and maintenance and interest to give us adjusted cost per hectare costs for cc seeds for both years were 0 19 kg 1 for cereal rye 1 31 kg 1 for hairy vetch 0 16 kg 1 for wheat 1 27 kg 1 for radish and 0 9 kg 1 for turnip diesel price for 2020 and 2021 was 0 40 l 1 and 0 62 l 1 respectively soybean selling price reflects an average from the mississippi daily grain bids in greenville mississippi from 23 oct to 1 nov for 2020 and 2021 soybean selling price during this time was 0 40 kg 1 and 0 46 kg 1 for 2020 and 2021 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed using the glimmix procedure in sas 9 4 v sas software cary nc and the least square differences among treatment means were calculated at alpha 0 05 prior to the analysis all variables were tested for normality using the univariate procedure in sas all variables were normally distributed and the residuals from the models also generally conformed to normality irrigation thresholds and ccs were treated as fixed effects while each replication was treated as a random effect data were analyzed separately for each year due to significant effect of year in the initial analysis the mean values as well as the p values associated with the sources of variation for the individual analyzed parameters are provided in tables 2 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 cover crops biomass production c and n content cn ratio and n uptake cover crop biomass production c and n content cn ratio and n uptake was significantly affected by the main effects of ccs in both years of this study table 2 cover crop biomass production in 2020 was affected by the interaction between irrigation thresholds and ccs while n uptake in 2020 was also impacted by the main effect of irrigation thresholds wheat radish turnip mix under the wet irrigation threshold produced at least 1258 kg ha 1 more cc biomass than all other treatment combinations in 2020 table 2 after overseeding ccs in 2019 minimal precipitation 10 2 mm was received during september which affected cc stand establishment fig 1 it has been reported that ccs should be overseeded when precipitation is in the near forecast to ensure proper stand establishment rieck hinz and anderson 2017 when data were averaged over irrigation thresholds all cc treatments produced at least 1370 kg ha 1 more biomass than the no cc control in 2020 the biomass in the no cc plots included weeds in 2021 hairy vetch produced at least 2942 kg ha 1 more biomass than all other cc treatments when data were averaged over irrigation treatments table 2 in february of 2021 a significant snow and ice event proved to be detrimental to all cc treatments the aboveground biomass of all cover crops was not able to recover and showed no significant growth after the snowfall event except for hairy vetch during the event the study site received 48 mm of snowfall and 40 mm of rainfall with a low temperature of 12 c and a high temperature of 0 c nws 2021 hairy vetch has been reported to withstand temperatures as low as 15 c clark 2007 which allowed it to produce significantly more biomass no differences were observed for the cc biomass between the cereal rye wheat turnip radish mix and no cc treatments in 2021 in the no cc treatments the plots contained winter annual weeds which were predominately italian ryegrass lolium multiflorum l chickweed stellaria media l and henbit lamium amplexicaule l cover crop biomass carbon concentration was similar across ccs species but it was at least 40 higher than the no cc control in 2020 in 2021 cereal rye and hairy vetch treatments were at least 4 and 8 higher in carbon concentration than the wheat radish turnip mix and no cc treatments respectively table 2 reports have shown that c and n concentration in cc biomass is directly correlated to the amount of biomass produced finney et al 2016 hairy vetch treatments had significantly higher biomass in 2021 which would explain its higher carbon concentration as for cereal rye it has been documented that increased lignin content in cereal and grass ccs cause an increase in carbon concentration mubvumba 2018 in both years of this study hairy vetch treatments contained the highest nitrogen concentration among cc treatments hairy vetch had at least 62 and 101 more nitrogen concentration than other cc treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 2 hairy vetch is a legume cc that fixes atmospheric nitrogen nitrogen accumulation in hairy vetch has been reported to be dependent on the amount of biomass produced unkovich et al 2010 and has been documented to reach up to 217 kg n ha 1 in biomass in warmer climates parr et al 2011 in both years hairy vetch had the lowest cn ratio among all treatments due to higher nitrogen concentration in hairy vetch treatments weidhuner et al 2019 described that nitrogen content is the foremost factor determining cn ratio in 2020 cereal rye and wheat radish turnip mix contained at least 37 and 75 higher cn ratio than no cc and hairy vetch respectively in 2021 cereal rye had at least 24 higher cn ratio than all other cc treatments while wheat radish turnip mix contained 37 and 153 higher cn ratio than no cc and hairy vetch respectively table 2 lower cn ratio of hairy vetch facilitates in higher decomposition rate and quicker n release which can be used for a subsequent cash crop sievers and cook 2018 singh et al 2020 cover crop biomass n was highest in hairy vetch treatments for both years of this study due to higher biomass production and n concentration hairy vetch contained at least 25 7 and 149 kg ha 1 more n than all other cc treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively wheat radish turnip mixture had 25 8 and 50 5 kg ha 1 greater biomass n than cereal rye and no cc by respectively 3 2 soybean 3 2 1 biomass production and c and n concentration no statistical differences were observed for soybean biomass production carbon concentration and n uptake in both years of this study table 3 in 2020 soybean biomass nitrogen concentration showed no statistical difference between the wet and dry irrigation threshold treatments however the wet irrigation treatments had 8 more nitrogen concentration than the non irrigated control in 2020 the cn ratio showed no statistical difference between the no irrigation control and the dry irrigation threshold however the no irrigation control had a 9 higher cn ratio than the wet irrigation threshold table 3 the greater n concentration in soybean biomass in the wet irrigation threshold lowered the cn ratio of that treatment overall soybean vegetative growth was not affected by ccs or irrigation threshold in the two years of this research indicating the resiliency of this crop 3 2 2 seed yield soybean seed test weight was affected by the main effects of irrigation thresholds in 2020 while soybean seed moisture showed no significant differences in 2020 soybean seed test weight was 0 5 and 0 8 kg hl 1 higher in the no irrigation control treatment than the dry and wet irrigation threshold treatments respectively table 4 soybean seed yield was affected by the interaction of irrigation thresholds and ccs in 2020 but no differences were observed in 2021 table 4 in 2020 soybean seed yield was at least 314 kg ha 1 greater following hairy vetch under the wet irrigation threshold than all other treatment combinations except for cereal rye under the wet irrigation threshold soybean following hairy vetch treatments had in higher seed yield compared to the no cc treatment under the wet irrigation threshold all cc treatments had greater yields than the no cc treatments under the dry irrigation threshold under the dry irrigation threshold soybean following hairy vetch had at least 394 kg ha 1 greater seed yield than the other cc treatments under no irrigation soybean following the wheat radish turnip mix was at least 113 kg ha 1 greater yield than no cc but it was similar to soybean following hairy vetch table 4 bryant et al 2017 reported that sensor based irrigation scheduling did not adversely impact soybean seed yield in mississippi when data were averaged over irrigation treatments ccs increased soybean yield by 238 599 kg ha compared to no cc control in 2020 but there was no difference in 2021 also irrigation application to soybean following hairy vetch and cereal rye treatments increased soybean yield by 496 976 kg ha 1 compared to the non irrigated treatments when data was averaged over cover crops in 2020 under no cc treatments irrigation scheduling for the wet sensor threshold had greater yield than the dry and no irrigation treatments in 2020 however only wet sensor threshold treatments had 509 kg ha 1 higher yield than the no irrigation treatment for the wheat radish turnip mix in 2020 in year two no statistical differences were observed in soybean yield suggesting dryland production can be opted to maintain soybean yields and for water conservation 3 2 3 water productivity soybean wp was by affected the interaction between irrigation thresholds and ccs in 2020 and the main effect of irrigation thresholds in 2021 table 4 rainfall totals throughout the growing seasons were 589 and 677 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 1 in 2020 wp was highest following the wheat radish turnip mix under no irrigation compared to all other treatments except for cereal rye and no cc under the dry irrigation threshold and hairy vetch under no irrigation cover crop treatments under the wet irrigation threshold had at least 10 lower wp than all other treatment combinations in 2020 table 4 similar results were reported by alfonso et al 2020 indicating that wp in soybean was improved 4 10 with the inclusion of a cc in this case wheat radish turnip mix and cereal rye under a more conservative irrigation threshold or no irrigation maintained enough residual soil moisture to eliminate a need for irrigation in 2021 the dry irrigation threshold had 4 and 30 higher water productivity than no irrigation and wet irrigation threshold treatments respectively table 4 3 2 3 1 irrigation water use efficiency all irrigated treatments received irrigation in 2020 except for no cc under the dry irrigation threshold the amount of irrigation water applied and number of irrigation events is provided in table 1 in 2020 iwue for cereal rye under the dry irrigation threshold was at least 175 higher than all other irrigated treatments this treatment only reached the threshold once resulting in much less irrigation water applied than the other irrigated treatments and greater iwue all dry irrigation threshold treatments had significantly higher iwue than the wet irrigation threshold treatments table 4 under the wet irrigation threshold soybean following hairy vetch had the highest iwue followed by no cc and cereal rye whereas the wheat radish turnip mix had the lowest iwue in 2020 in 2021 only the wet irrigation threshold treatments reached the threshold and received irrigation soybean following cereal rye had 9 higher iwue than the other ccs table 4 wood et al 2020 reported similar results and noted that maintaining a sensor threshold of 85 kpa throughout the growing season optimized soybean yield and iwue compared to 50 kpa and 125 kpa thresholds in our study the dry threshold did not maximize yield with ccs as much as the wet threshold treatments in 2020 except for the wheat radish turnip mix however iwue was higher for the dry threshold additionally not having to irrigate the dry irrigation threshold treatments while maintaining a similar yield would suggest that the dry irrigation threshold would be recommended to improve iwue however the final decision can be made based on economic returns furthermore cereal rye under the wet and dry irrigation threshold seemed to be the best cc treatment to improve iwue in contrast bryant et al 2021 reporting that cereal rye decreased iwue in soybean up to 10 in a conservation tillage system based on these results the evaluation of iwue on soybean with irrigation thresholds and ccs particularly cereal rye should be continued to determine the extent of its effectiveness 3 2 4 seed quality soybean seed oil content was affected by the main effect of irrigation threshold in 2020 while no statistical differences were observed in 2021 table 5 in 2020 oil content was at least 1 higher under no irrigation than the wet and dry irrigation thresholds differences were observed for soybean protein content from the main effect of irrigation threshold in both years of this study as well as from the main effect of ccs for seed index in 2021 protein content was 2 and 1 higher in wet irrigation threshold treatments than in the dry irrigation threshold treatments and no irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 our results are consistent with the findings of foroud et al 1993 and kirnak et al 2010 both studies examined the impacts of soybean grain composition under different irrigation regimes and they found that protein content in soybean was higher with more irrigation while oil content was higher under the drier regimes seed index in 2021 was highest following the wheat radish turnip mix which was 3 higher than the other cc treatments table 5 3 3 economic returns yields were high and selling prices were fair 0 40 kg 1 for soybean in 2020 which resulted in good returns above specified expenses in 2020 the most profitable treatment combination was the no cc control under the wet irrigation threshold however this treatment combination was only 1 ha 1 higher than hairy vetch under the wet irrigation threshold table 6 the lowest profiting treatment under the wet irrigation threshold was wheat radish turnip mix which was higher than all other treatment combinations under the dry irrigation threshold and no irrigation except for hairy vetch under the dry irrigation threshold and wheat radish turnip mix under no irrigation table 6 in 2020 wet irrigation threshold had higher economic returns for all cc treatments except wheat radish turnip mix when compared to no irrigation treatments in 2021 soybean selling price was 15 higher 0 46 kg 1 but soybean yield was lower resulting in lower overall returns above specified expenses the most profitable treatment combination in the second year of the study was the no cc control under no irrigation which returned at least 42 ha 1 more than all other treatment combinations table 6 similarly reddy 2001 found that no cc treatments had higher net returns than the cc treatments for soybean production system on a dundee silt loam soil in stoneville mississippi these results explain why producers are abandoning ccs by the second year of adoption sawadgo and plastina 2022 this is an indication that more incentives are needed to compensate producers for the losses associated with the establishment of ccs averaged over two years planting ccs reduced economic returns compared to no cc treatments under each irrigation treatment except for wheat radish turnip mix under the dry irrigation threshold treatments fig 2 4 conclusion the objective of this research was to determine which combination of winter cc and irrigation threshold would maximize soybean yield iwue wp and farm profitability in the first year of cc establishment the wet irrigation threshold produced the highest soybean yield when combined with hairy vetch or cereal rye water productivity and iwue increased under cereal rye with the dry irrigation threshold in year two similar yields were observed among all treatments furthermore wp was highest under the dry irrigation threshold while iwue was highest when soybean followed cereal rye under the wet irrigation threshold the dry irrigation threshold treatments did not require irrigation in year two making iwue calculations not applicable although most treatment combinations were similar in economic value the most profitable treatment combination was no cc under the wet irrigation threshold when averaged over both years based on these results continued evaluation is needed to determine if ccs with conservative irrigation thresholds can be used to maximize soybean productivity and profitability in the mid southern usa additional payment rates may need to be included in the government programs to make ccs more economically viable for

8924,rice is distributed worldwide thus quantitative analyses of water and heat fluxes between the land and air in paddy fields are vital for understanding basin scale water cycles in this study eddy covariance and meteorological gradient systems on a 20 meter flux tower in the jianghan plain yangtze river basin china were used to measure turbulent and meteorological parameters in paddy fields in 2021 three micrometeorological methods namely the eddy covariance ec bowen ratio energy balance breb and aerodynamic aero methods were used to calculate the latent heat flux le and sensible heat flux h breb and aero are collectively referred to as gradient methods the effects of measurement heights growth stage and weather conditions on the consistency among them were analyzed the difference in meteorological measurement heights affected the results of gradient methods among the five height combinations the error in the 2 and 4 m combination was the smallest and the coefficients of determination of leec lebreb aero and hec hbreb aero reached 0 96 and 0 84 respectively the stratification of the near surface layer was formed due to the heterogeneous underlying surface of the experimental area and the instrument needed to be installed within the range between roughness layer and new equilibrium layer the height difference of gradient methods can be amplified within this range to avoid the influence of instrument resolution the difference among methods was affected by growth stage and weather conditions sunny cloudy rainy days and different wind speed class both factors influenced atmospheric stability and the error was the maximum in neutral stratification this study provides a reference for the selection of flux calculation methods and error analyses for paddy fields in humid areas keywords paddy fields eddy covariance bowen ratio energy balance aerodynamics latent heat flux sensible heat flux data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the process of water and heat cycling between earth and atmosphere directly affects regional climates and ecology thus it has been studied by researchers worldwide li et al 2021 mcgloin et al 2014 minseok and sungsik 2021 paddy fields are widely distributed and have large planting areas moreover rice prefers humid conditions and has high water consumption therefore quantitative analyses of water and heat fluxes in paddy fields are crucial for clarifying water and heat cycles and improving the efficiency of agricultural water resource utilization beljaars and holtslag 1991 micrometeorological methods including eddy covariance ec bowen ratio energy balance breb and aerodynamic aero methods are commonly used to calculate turbulent flux each of these three methods has advantages and disadvantages ec directly calculates fluxes has a sound theoretical basis and is regarded as a standard method baldocchi 2003 paw et al 2000 however ec systems are expensive and the instruments are complicated leaving a demand for inexpensive and easier methods simmons et al 2007 the breb and aero calculate flux via meteorological gradients and are collectively known as gradient methods these methods are inexpensive and simple to calculate however their errors are relatively large compared with ec the main reasons for breb errors are the assumption that the turbulent exchange coefficient of water and heat are equal is not always satisfied the spatial representation of each energy term in the energy balance formula is inconsistent and the bowen ratio before and after sunrise and sunset is approximately 1 barr et al 1994 liu et al 2011 unland et al 1996 the atmospheric stability function wind speed and relative humidity are sources of aero errors liu et al 1995 mahrt 2007 sorbjan and grachev 2010 hence comparing the results of fluxes calculated by ec and gradient methods is necessary to determine the degree of deviation between them under various conditions and provides a reference for obtaining a paddy field flux estimation scheme that balances accuracy and price in ecosystems worldwide some researchers have compared the water and heat fluxes calculated by ec and gradient methods which are consistent overall li et al 2008 liu et al 2009 wolf et al 2008 however differences still occur owing to the influences of crop growth stage natural environmental conditions and instrument resolution flores rojas et al 2019 pauwels and samson 2006 variations in crop growth during each growth stage can influence calculation results for example pozníková et al 2018 compared ec and breb in wheat fields in polkovice czech republic and found that differences in canopy coverage and irrigation amounts at each growth stage affected consistency of calculated results by changing the underlying surface conditions brotzge and crawford 2003 showed that the energy closure rate and bowen ratio from ec differed monthly for weeds and johnson grass in the tallgrass prairie preserve in north central oklahoma and the consistency in the le and h between ec and breb also varied additionally the relative deviation between methods is affected by meteorological parameters shi et al 2008 showed that the differences in le between ec and breb varied linearly with vapor pressure deficit in changbai mountain forest malek 1993 showed that the consistency between breb and aero increased with increasing wind speed in an alfalfa field in northern utah usa topographic conditions in the experimental area also affect the applicability of micrometeorological methods in addition irregular terrain invalidates some turbulent theoretical assumptions and increases the influence of advection baldocchi et al 2000 laubach and teichmann 1999 wilson et al 2002 li et al 2008 studied water and heat fluxes of vineyards in arid areas northwest china showing that uneven terrain increased the degree of energy non closure of ec and affected the consistency in le between ec and breb additionally the relationship between fluxes and meteorological gradients is affected by the degree of turbulence and atmospheric stratification mahrt 2007 mcnaughton and laubach 1998 barr et al 1994 examined the poplar forest to demonstrate that the changes in atmospheric stability led to the invalidity of the assumption that the water and heat turbulence exchange coefficients in breb were equal which changed its deviation from ec wolf et al 2008 analyzed the relationship between atmospheric stability and the difference between ec and breb discovering that the maximum error occurred in neutral atmospheric stratification furthermore instrument resolution is an important source of error brotzge and crawford 2003 revealed that uncertainty of measurements in net radiation and soil heat flux affected the results of ec and breb zhang et al 2011 eliminated data where the air temperature and relative humidity differences between two heights were less than the probe resolution in the study thereby avoiding the error caused by insufficient instrument resolution and improving the accuracy of breb these studies primarily examined dryland plants in arid and semiarid areas for paddy fields in humid areas currently most studies used only one single method to calculate the turbulent flux characteristics alberto et al 2011 alberto et al 2009 liu et al 2019 qiu et al 2022 timm et al 2014 thus there is not a systematic comparison between ec and gradient methods moreover the energy distribution and microclimatic characteristics are distinct among different ecosystems castellví et al 2020 cleverly et al 2020 nieberding et al 2020 von randow et al 2020 which also affects the consistency between micrometeorological methods further necessitating comparative studies in paddy fields in addition previous studies of the gradient methods have rarely considered differences in meteorological measurement heights δz under ideal conditions in the near surface layer the uniform underlying surface is a constant flux layer and the measurement heights do not affect the calculation results therefore foken 2017 suggested that increasing the ratio between two meteorological measurement heights to 4 8 would increase δz and thus magnify the air temperature water vapor pressure and wind speed gradients to reduce the measurement error caused by insufficient instrument accuracy in gradient methods however this scheme has not been widely adopted because increasing δz leads to high installation costs and inevitably weakens the uniformity of the underlying surface therefore instruments are typically installed within 0 5 2 5 m above the canopy in most flux stations castellví et al 2020 thus the impact of δz on the results remains unclear to solve these problems this study was conducted in 2021 at the irrigation experimental station of wuhan university qujialing management area jianghan plain the turbulent characteristics and meteorological parameters were measured using an ec system and a multi layer meteorological system on a 20 meter flux tower subsequently le and h were calculated using ec and gradient methods to compare their results for a paddy field in a humid area clarify the impact of δz on the applicability of gradient methods and analyze the effects of growth stage and weather conditions on the differences between micrometeorological methods 2 material and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at the qujialing irrigation experimental station of the state key

precipitation the soil type is paddy soil with a silty loam texture and its dry bulk weight is 1 36 g cm3 in 2021 the longliangyou 1534 rice variety was planted in an area of approximately 35 400 m2 within the experimental area and its growth period was 126 d from 140 to 265 days of the year doy in addition water seeding was used for planting and inundation was used for irrigation there was no standing water in the field at the end of the tillering 186 195 doy and yellow maturity 261 265 doy stages however a water depth of 10 50 mm was maintained during the other periods base fertilizer 600 kg ha was applied before sowing 139 doy and again 300 kg ha at the tillering 175 doy and booting 206 doy stages paddy fields were also present outside of the main experimental area the planting type and time of these crops were similar to those in the main experimental area however these fields were mixed with villages roads and forests 2 2 instrumentation a 20 meter flux tower was installed in the center of the paddy field and was equipped with an ec system and a multi layer meteorological gradient system additionally a soil parameter measurement system was embedded in soil underneath the tower the main instrument of the ec system was an integrated eddy measurement device integrated three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer and h2o co2 analyzer iragon li cor biosciences inc usa at an installation height of 2 5 m the system recorded data via a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa with a sampling frequency of 10 hz in the multi layer meteorological gradient system seven air temperature and humidity sensors hmp155 vaisala scientific inc finland and wind speed sensors 010 c met one scientific inc usa were installed at heights of 1 5 2 4 8 10 16 and 20 m an atmospheric pressure sensor cs106 vaisala scientific inc finland and wind direction sensor 020 c met one scientific inc usa were installed at 20 m a four component radiation meter cnr4 kipp zonen scientific inc netherlands was installed at 2 m in the soil measurement system three soil heat flux plates hfp01 campbell scientific inc usa were buried at depths of 5 10 and 20 cm and 10 soil three parameter

measured at a frequency of 10 hz and the 10 min averages were recorded in a data logger cr6 campbell scientific inc usa used for the flux calculations 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 ec method 2 3 1 1 data processing and quality control the sensible and latent heat fluxes were calculated using three dimensional ultrasonic wind speed sonic temperature and specific humidity the calculation formulae are as follows 1 h ρ d c p w t a 2 l e λ ρ d w q where h is the sensible heat flux w m2 le is the latent heat flux w m2 ρd is the dry air density kg m3 cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure 1 01 kj kg k λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2260 kj kg and w ta and q are the fluctuation values of the vertical wind speed m s sonic temperature c and specific humidity g kg respectively the eddypro7 0 6 software li cor biosciences usa was used for data processing and the outliers in the original data were eliminated via the variance test vickers and mahrt 1997 subsequently the error was corrected via double coordinate rotation wilczak et al 2001 wpl webb pearman leuning correction webb et al 1980 and frequency response correction finnigan et al 2003 moncrieff et al 1997 on rainy days the rain fell on the sensor probes of the eddy covariance system resulting in decreased signal strength therefore it was necessary to eliminate rainfall periods and 1 h of data before and after each rainfall pauwels and samson 2006 insufficient atmospheric turbulence at night led to large measurement errors therefore it was necessary to eliminate data during which the friction velocity was less than 0 2 m s paw et al 2000 short gaps 1 h of missing or discarded data were filled using linear interpolation while long gaps were filled using an program package of artificial neural network method in matlab r2020b this program package established the connection between the meteorological data air temperature water vapor pressure relative humidity wind speed and net radiation and turbulent flux in the experimental area moffat et al 2007 2 3 1 2 energy balance closure correction the energy closure ratio was used to examine the quality of flux data the linear regression analysis of leec hec and the net radiation minus the surface soil heat flux rn g during the rice growth period is shown in fig 1 g was calculated by the soil heat flux measured in 5 cm water heat storage and soil heat storage a detailed description of the method calculating g can refer to liu et al 2020 in this figure the slope was 0 61 the intercept was 15 39 and the overall energy closure ratio was 0 74 fig 1 which was within the allowable range of the international and chinese flux network standards 0 56 1 20 and 0 58 1 00 respectively li et al 2004 wilson et al 2002 the phenomenon of energy non closure is universal at all flux stations and leads to lower ec calculation results widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 mainly due to inadequate turbulence development at night laubach and teichmann 1999 differences in the spatial scales of each energy item leuning et al 2012 and uneven underlying surfaces in the source area bernhofer 1992 polonio and soler 2000 to solve these problems the bowen ratio energy forced closure method was used to allocate the residual energy to correct the flux calculation results twine et al 2000 and the corrected results are considered as standard values baldocchi 2003 paw et al 2000 2 3 2 breb method the breb method was proposed by bowen 1926 the bowen ratio br is the ratio of sensible heat flux h to latent heat flux le at the surface which is based on the surface energy balance equation and near surface gradient diffusion theory the calculation formulae are as follows 3 λ e ρ a c p k w e z 4 h ρ a c p k h t a z assuming that the water and heat turbulence exchange coefficients are equal that is kh kw 5 β h λ e γ d t a d z d e d z γ δ t a δ e where γ is the moisture meter constant γ cp p 0 622 λ cp is the specific heat at constant pressure 1 01 kj kg c

kpa the le and h are calculated as follows 6 l e r n g 1 β 7 h r n g β 1 β where rn is the net radiation w m2 and g is the surface soil heat flux w m2 in this study the results of this method were filtered when the directions between the flux and meteorological gradient were inconsistent or br ranged from 1 3 to 0 7 the data was eliminated ortega farias et al 1996 perez et al 1999 and the gap filling method was the same as that used for ec 2 3 3 aero method the aero method was first proposed by thornthwaite and holzman 1939 based on the monin obukhov similarity theory which indirectly calculates the turbulent flux through meteorological gradients according to aero the friction velocity u turbulence temperature scale θ turbulence specific humidity scale q and monin obukhov length l on the rough surface of the near surface layer are calculated as follows respectively 8 u k u z 2 u z 1 ln z 2 d z 1 d ψ m z 2 d l ψ m z 1 d l 9 θ k θ z 2 θ z 1 ln z 2 d z 1 d ψ h z 2 d l ψ h z 1 d l

q is the turbulence specific humidity scale h and le can be calculated using the following formulas respectively 13 h ρ c p u θ 14 λ e ρ λ u q where ρ is the density of dry air 1 293 kg m3 cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure 1 004 kj kg k and λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2260 kj kg in this study the initial values of u θ q and l were obtained without correcting the atmospheric stability function in eqs 8 10 subsequently new values were obtained by performing calculations again while considering the atmospheric stability function this iterative calculation was continued until the difference between two calculated l values was less than 0 1 afterwards eqs 13 and 14 were used to obtain le and h a detailed description of this method and the atmospheric stability function was presented by liu et al 2009 the accuracy of this method was limited by resolution of the sensors therefore the errors in the results were relatively large and outliers were present flores rojas et al 2019 liu et al 2009 malek 1993 thus in this study data where the le 50 w m2 le 700 w m2 h 200 w m2 h 150 w m2 during the day and le 50 w m2 le 20 w m2 h 20 w m2 and h 50 w m2 during the night were excluded based on the flux characteristics of paddy fields chatterjee et al 2019 gao et al 2003 lu et al 2007 the gap filling method was the same as that used for ec 2 3 4 lai five rice plants were sampled at the 150 167 182 210 234 251 and 263 doy to evaluate average leaf area using the scanner m126nw hewlett packard inc usa before rice harvest five plots of 1 m2 were selected by the five point sampling method in the central plot of experimental area to obtain planting density and the leaf area index lai was calculated by leaf area and planting density 3 results 3 1 comparisons among height combinations in this study breb and aero were used to calculate le and h of paddy fields using meteorological data of five measurement height combinations which were 2 and 4 m 2 and 8 m 2 and 10 m 2 and 16 m and 2 and 20 m subsequently comparisons were made with ec to analyze the influence of δz on the applicability of gradient methods fig 2 depicts the diurnal variations in le and h mean values of the entire growth period time intervals of 30 min the curve had an inverted u shape and the peak value occurred at approximately 12 00 am however there were significant differences in absolute values among height combinations during the whole day for the breb 2 and 8 m combination had the highest lebreb peak value 410 53 w m2 and the lowest hbreb peak value 1 78 w m2 in contrast 2 and 16 m combination had the lowest lebreb peak value 277 30 w m2 and the highest hbreb peak value 102 21 w m2 hence when lebreb was larger hbreb was smaller and vice versa for aero 2 and 16 m combination had the lowest leaero peak value 140 72 w m2 and the highest haero peak value 44 02 w m2 however 2 and 4 m combination had the highest leaero peak value 355 46 w m2 but 2 and 8 m combination had the lowest haero peak value 0 62 w m2 therefore the peak values of breb and aero appeared under different height combinations fig 3 shows scatter diagrams of the comparisons between ec and gradient methods at each height combination these methods were highly consistent however the slopes of regression lines differed substantially therefore the degree of deviation needed to be quantified the determination coefficient r2 regression line slope k and relative deviation rd δle leec 100 δh hec 100 between ec and gradient methods and the mean values ofthe three methods are shown in table 2 among all height combinations lebreb ranged from 82 59 w m2 to 129 65 w m2 therefore the values fluctuated approximately 50 due to the change of δz comparing leec with lebreb r2 reached 0 99 and k and rd were 0 77 1 12 and 2 16 32 88 respectively meanwhile hbreb ranged from 2 72 w m2 to 28 74 w m2 because the proportion of h in paddy fields was low the change in δz caused a larger variation in this value comparing hec with hbreb the maximum r2 was 0 91 with a slope of 0 04 1 73 and the minimum rd was 114 04 therefore these statistical data show that the consistency between breb and ec was greater for le than that for h for aero leaero was between 48 86 w m2 and 129 73 w m2 and was significantly more affected by δz than lebreb the r2 between leaero and leec was greater than 0 96 and k and rd were 0 42 1 00 and 5 43 60 29 respectively haero ranged from 1 67 w m2 to 12 82 w m2 and the amplitude of its fluctuation was smaller than that of hbreb the maximum r2 between haero and hec was 0 92 their rd was greater than 88 86 and k was 0 04 0 78 similarly le had greater consistency between aero and ec than h based on the above analysis δz affected the calculation results of breb and aero in breb it had a greater influence on h than on le however in aero le was more highly affected than h moreover the consistency between ec and gradient methods was higher for le than for h a comprehensive comparison of the statistical data for le and h among all height combinations indicated that the 2 and 4 m height combination was the most applicable for rice therefore the results of breb and aero using the 2 and 4 m height combination were used for subsequent comparisons 3 2 comparisons at different growth stages the growth state of rice at each stage is different which affects the characteristics of underlying surface properties and energy distribution in this section the consistency between ec and gradient methods was compared in each growth stage the differences between methods δle δh and their root mean square errors rmse are shown in fig 4 leec was smaller than lebreb but larger in seeding stage and early tillering stage however leaero fluctuated during all growth stages compared with hec hbreb and haero were smaller in seeding stage and early tillering stage but larger in late tillering stage to yellow maturity stage the rmse of δle and δh showed a downward trend during the whole growth stages and fluctuated between 6 14 and 17 42 w m2 except δleec aero which was relatively larger and between 22 49 and 57 41 w m2 3 3 comparisons under different weather conditions the water and heat transfer processes between land surface and atmosphere substantially impact local atmospheric circulation and micrometeorological conditions krakauer et al 2013 moreover meteorological conditions affect the growth of rice thereby altering surface water and heat transfer processes this mutual feedback mechanism leads to differences in the applicability and consistency of micrometeorological methods under various weather conditions the average variations in fluxes on sunny cloudy and rainy days for the entire growth period of paddy fields are shown in fig 5 the variation trends of le and h were similar but the peak values appeared at different time and the values of every points were also different during the whole day as illustrated in fig 5 le showed an inverted u shape and the peak values mostly appeared at approximately 12 00 except sunny days leaero its peak value appeared at 11 00 in advance compared with leec the average value of leaero was 5 98 lower on sunny days and 23 31 and 22 38 higher on cloudy and rainy days respectively the average value of lebreb was 4 41 9 64 and 24 96 lower than the average leec on sunny cloudy and rainy days respectively additionally h was an inverted u shape and peaked at approximately 11 30 however the peak values of haero and hbreb were smaller than those of hec on sunny days with slower declining rates during the afternoon on rainy days the average hbreb and haero fluctuated significantly and were both much larger than hec in all weather conditions based on the above comparisons under all three weather conditions the consistency between breb and ec was higher than that between aero and ec and the consistency among le values was higher than that among h values the error in the daily mean values between gradient methods and ec was the smallest on sunny days however the diurnal variations in gradient methods were the most consistent with ec on cloudy days and the error of h was the largest on rainy days wind speed ws varies in different weather conditions and has a significant impact on atmospheric turbulence which is theoretical basis for micrometeorological methods ws above canopy directly affects the exchange of water heat and gas between ground and air macintyre et al 2010 novick et al 2009 therefore the consistency among ec breb and aero under different ws ranges was analyzed in this study referring to the daily ws at 2 m of the flux tower it was divided into three categories weak wind wind class i ws 1 00 m s moderate wind wind class ii 1 00 ws 1 32 m s and strong wind wind class iii 1 32 m s ws respectively the diurnal variations of average le h and ws at wind class i iii during the whole growth period are depicted in fig 6 ws was low at night and higher during the day rising gradually after sunrise with an inverted u shaped distribution the peak values for wind class i iii were 1 33 m s 1 66 m s and 2 37 m s respectively but there was no uniform peak time the diurnal variations of le and h were similar with ws for le under different classes the mean values of leec lebreb and leaero were 114 73 129 12 w m2 109 25 116 79 w m2 and 118 52 148 88 w m2 respectively meanwhile δleec breb and δleec aero were between 5 48 and 15 33 w m2 19 76 and 6 65 w m2 respectively for h the mean values of hec hbreb and haero under the three wind classes are 1 23 6 72 w m2 9 90 12 24 w m2 and 7 05 10 12 w m2 respectively δleec breb and δleec aero were between 5 27 and 11 03 w m2 3 40 and 8 28 w m2 le and h not increased with ws but the errors between ec and gradient methods increased with it the absolute values of hec increased with ws at night but hbreb and haero did not show this trend 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of measurement height breb and aero methods calculate fluxes indirectly through meteorological gradients at different heights therefore the form of the meteorological profiles determines the degree of influence of δz profiles of mean water vapor pressure e air temperature ta and wind speed ws during the entire growth period are shown in fig 7 as shown e decreased between 2 and 10 m then increased abruptly at 16 m before decreasing again at 20 m in contrast ta fluctuated continuously ws increased with height and its slope remained constant between 2 m and 16 m but dropped dramatically between 16 m and 20 m the near surface layer is considered to have constant fluxes according to the monin obukhov similarity theory ta e and ws in near surface layer should increase linearly with lnz the logarithm of measurement height z during the day when the underlying surface is uniform and flat therefore δta δlnz δe δlnz and δws δlnz should not change with measurement height parameters such as u θ q and br are also constant in gradient methods and the measurement height should not affect the results hence these methods do not specify height requirements and researchers commonly install the equipment 0 5 2 5 m above the crop canopy pozníková et al 2018 qiu et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 zhang et al 2008 under ideal conditions increasing the difference in meteorological measurement heights should increase the meteorological gradient values and thus reduce the effects of insufficient instrument resolution sharan and srivastava 2016 steeneveld et al 2005 however the measurement height in this study affected the results because δta δlnz δe δlnz and δws δlnz varied with height this phenomenon may be due to the increased range of source area with increasing height differences which caused the underlying surface to be more heterogeneous thus the irregularity of the terrain was also intensified the meteorological profiles at the flux tower were affected by the land surface characteristics of upwind areas owing to advection differences in surface temperature humidity and roughness of the discontinuous surface changed the meteorological profiles of the paddy field affected the applicability of the m o similarity theory and caused errors in the gradient methods the near surface structure of the experimental area can be preliminarily divided via meteorological profile and the degree of influence of different underlying surface types and characteristics therein can be analyzed which can provide a basis for selecting appropriate meteorological measurement heights and improving the applicability of gradient methods the differences in surface roughness z0 land temperature and humidity of the discontinuous surfaces caused the formation of an internal boundary layer and a new equilibrium layer in the near surface layer foken 2017 rao et al 1974 savelyev and taylor 2001 in this study following the method proposed by savelyev and taylor 2005 the near surface layer structure and the z0 in downwind z0d and upwind z0 u directions were analyzed using ws profile which represented the average ws during the whole stage in the main wind direction north wind defined as between 315 and 45 at 12 00 am as shown in fig 8 the heights of the internal boundary layer and new equilibrium layer were approximately 16 m and 4 m respectively which was analyzed based on the height of the inflection points of ws profile z0d and z0 u were 0 07 m and 1 56 m respectively estimated by the extension of the tangent line in inflection points of ws profile fig 8 the underlying surface in source area of the flux tower was primarily composed of paddy fields but also contained woodlands roads and villages therefore z0 u was large in contrast there were only paddy fields in the downwind direction therefore z0d was small the change in z0 led to the generation of an internal boundary layer which was a discontinuous transitional layer the layer above it was influenced by the surface characteristics upwind of the measurement site whereas the layer below it was a new equilibrium layer whose properties came from the underlying surface inside the experimental area verkaik and holtslag 2006 in this study the meteorological measurements within the new equilibrium layer range above the canopy but below 4 m only showed the characteristics of the experimental area and were not affected by the heterogeneity of underlying surface therefore in this study the height combination of 2 m and 4 m in paddy fields was the most applicable for gradient methods similarly villages and roads in the footprint area were heat sources thus hot and dry air rose with turbulence and affected the ta and e profiles owing to advection however the quantification of this impact requires further study among all the combinations in this study although 2 4 m was the most suitable for rice the applicability of this combination may be affected if h is too high measurement systems are usually installed above the canopy a certain distance to avoid the influence of roughness sublayer which exists between plant canopy top and the constant flux layer it is caused by the roughness of underlying surface and monin obukhov similarity theory fails to explain the flux gradient relationships in it therefore the measurement height should exceed the upper boundary of roughness sublayer referring to existing study results it extended up to about 2 h cellier and brunet 1992 in gradient methods to ensure the sensors installed at 2 m were above the roughness sublayer the optimal maximum h was 1 m during the growth stage in 2021 the maximum h was 1 1 m exceeding the upper boundary there was no extra correction for it due to the impact of roughness sublayer in short stem crops was not significant and the maximum h exceeded the upper limit by only 10 which is acceptable garratt and pearman 2020 however for high stem crops such as corn and sorghum this combination was not applicable because their h will exceed the measurement height and further study is still needed to determine the optimal measurement heights for other high stem crops and quantify the impact of roughness sublayer according to above analysis for the micrometeorological methods referring to the stratification of near surface layer the measurement systems should be installed in the height range which reflects the underlying surface characteristics of experimental area and avoids the influence of underlying surface s roughness that is below the new equilibrium layer and above the roughness sublayer combined the estimated heights of new equilibrium layer 4 m maximum roughness sublayer 2 2 m and the maximum h of rice 1 1 m in this study the optimum measurement height range for three micrometeorological methods in paddy fields was approximately 1 1 2 9 m above the canopy however there were insufficient turbulence and meteorological measurement data above canopy below 2 m and between 4 and 8 m so the heights of new equilibrium layer and roughness sublayer were just estimated without rigorously theoretical analysis the accurate heights are still needed to be further studied through supplementary measurement data to clarify the optimal measurement heights 4 2 the influence of the growth stage there were differences in crop morphology at each growth stage that affected the microclimate and characteristics of the field energy distribution which can be quantitatively analyzed using lai and br the variations in lai br le and h during the growth period are shown in fig 9 the br which was calculated by le and h separately using all three methods first decreased and then increased with growth of the crop at seedling and early tillering stages the rice plants were sparse and short and the canopy had not formed hence the lai and evapotranspiration rate were low the proportion of h was relatively high and br reached 0 3 after the later tillering stage the rice grew vigorously andlai increased sharply simultaneously the rates of evapotranspiration and heat absorption were high therefore the temperature above the canopy decreased furthermore a temperature inversion layer occasionally formed the proportion of h decreased whereas the proportion of le increased the br was approximately 0 after the grain filling stage the leaves gradually turned yellow and lai decreased thus the br increased slightly and finally reached approximately 0 2 the brbreb was lower than the brec when lai was less than 1 resulting in an underestimation of hbreb and an overestimation of lebreb however brbreb increased owing to the rapid increase in lai thus hbreb became overestimated and lebreb became underestimated leaero and haero were calculated by meteorological gradients lacking the restrictions of energy balance as in breb as mentioned above meteorological gradients above the canopy were affected by crop morphology when lai was small the crops grew slowly and canopy had not yet formed hence rice had minimal influence on microclimate of the field leading to a small meteorological gradients therefore the error caused by the sensor resolution was large but the influence of this factor gradually weakened with the rapid growth of rice 4 3 the influence of atmospheric stability turbulence theory is the basis of micrometeorological methods and there are interactions among weather conditions crop growth stage and atmospheric stability in this study the atmospheric stability parameter z d l was used as the standard to judge atmospheric stability z d and l are defined in section 2 3 3 a positive z d l indicates a stable boundary layer whereas a negative z d l indicates an unstable boundary layer typical during the day a z d l of approximately 0 indicates neutral stratification micrometeorological methods are based on atmospheric turbulence and z d l represents the relative influences of the buoyancy and shear force that drive the vertical mixing wolf et al 2008 therefore when the atmosphere was in various states of stratification the degree of influence of buoyancy and shear also differed which reduced the applicability of some theoretical assumptions of micrometeorological methods resulting in errors the differences between ec and gradient methods under different atmospheric stability conditions are shown in fig 10 the error was the largest when atmosphere was in neutral stratification the relationship between buoyancy and shear force directly affected meteorological gradients above the canopy and indirectly changed the intermediate parameters in gradient methods thereby affecting the degree of error for aero on sunny days the peak value of leaero appeared at approximately 11 00 a m and was lower than leec at noon at that time the evapotranspiration intensity and heat absorption in the field were high which led to a reduction in temperature gradient above the canopy and the appearance of an inversion layer resulting in neutrally stratified atmosphere thus the error was large for breb in daytime z d l was usually close to or less than 0 indicating neutral stratification or unstable stratification and there was strong non similarity of water vapor and temperature profiles in the vertical direction thus kw kh which resulted in a small lebreb lang et al 1983 ws will promote the process of water and heat exchange between ground and atmosphere affecting turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability tanny et al 2006 teitel et al 2020 thus the consistency among micrometeorological methods based on turbulence theory was influenced by it the relationship between ws and z d l in experimental area is shown in fig 11 z d l was close to 0 when the ws was high meaning that atmosphere was in the neutral stratification as illustrated in fig 10 that the error was the maximum in this case therefore in this study the deviations between ec and gradient methods increased with the increase of ws 5 conclusion in this study the ec and meteorological gradient systems on a flux tower were used to calculate the turbulence characteristics and meteorological parameters of a rice paddy field and le and h were calculated using ec breb and aero respectively additionally the influences of measurement height growth stage and weather conditions on the applicability and consistency of each method were analyzed the findings revealed that changes in δz affected the applicability of gradient methods compared with ec among the five height combinations that of 2 m and 4 m was the most applicable and the r2 values between lebreb aero leec and hbreb aero hec reached 0 96 and 0 84 respectively therefore magnifying δz did not always improve the accuracy of gradient methods owing to the increase in heterogeneity of the source area the instruments should be installed in the new equilibrium layer and above roughness sublayer and δz can be magnified within this range in this study the optimum measurement height range for micrometeorological methods was approximate 1 1 2 9 m above the maximum h in paddy fields crop growth state and weather conditions affected the microclimate and atmospheric stability above the canopy and led to the change of energy distribution characteristics in paddy fields the difference between ec and gradient methods varied from seeding to yellow maturity stage and the consistency among methods was also affected by weather conditions sunny cloudy rainy days and different wind class additionally atmospheric stability changed the accuracy of gradient methods and z d l was also affected by crop growth and weather conditions when z d l was approximately 0 the atmosphere was in neutral stratification and vertical mixing was driven by shear rather than buoyancy thereby resulting in the largest error between methods this study can provide a reference for the selection of instrument installation height in gradient methods and the error

8924,rice is distributed worldwide thus quantitative analyses of water and heat fluxes between the land and air in paddy fields are vital for understanding basin scale water cycles in this study eddy covariance and meteorological gradient systems on a 20 meter flux tower in the jianghan plain yangtze river basin china were used to measure turbulent and meteorological parameters in paddy fields in 2021 three micrometeorological methods namely the eddy covariance ec bowen ratio energy balance breb and aerodynamic aero methods were used to calculate the latent heat flux le and sensible heat flux h breb and aero are collectively referred to as gradient methods the effects of measurement heights growth stage and weather conditions on the consistency among them were analyzed the difference in meteorological measurement heights affected the results of gradient methods among the five height combinations the error in the 2 and 4 m combination was the smallest and the coefficients of determination of leec lebreb aero and hec hbreb aero reached 0 96 and 0 84 respectively the stratification of the near surface layer was formed due to the heterogeneous underlying surface of the experimental area and the instrument needed to be installed within the range between roughness layer and new equilibrium layer the height difference of gradient methods can be amplified within this range to avoid the influence of instrument resolution the difference among methods was affected by growth stage and weather conditions sunny cloudy rainy days and different wind speed class both factors influenced atmospheric stability and the error was the maximum in neutral stratification this study provides a reference for the selection of flux calculation methods and error analyses for paddy fields in humid areas keywords paddy fields eddy covariance bowen ratio energy balance aerodynamics latent heat flux sensible heat flux data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the process of water and heat cycling between earth and atmosphere directly affects regional climates and ecology thus it has been studied by researchers worldwide li et al 2021 mcgloin et al 2014 minseok and sungsik 2021 paddy fields are widely distributed and have large planting areas moreover rice prefers humid conditions and has high water consumption therefore quantitative analyses of water and heat fluxes in paddy fields are crucial for clarifying water and heat cycles and improving the efficiency of agricultural water resource utilization beljaars and holtslag 1991 micrometeorological methods including eddy covariance ec bowen ratio energy balance breb and aerodynamic aero methods are commonly used to calculate turbulent flux each of these three methods has advantages and disadvantages ec directly calculates fluxes has a sound theoretical basis and is regarded as a standard method baldocchi 2003 paw et al 2000 however ec systems are expensive and the instruments are complicated leaving a demand for inexpensive and easier methods simmons et al 2007 the breb and aero calculate flux via meteorological gradients and are collectively known as gradient methods these methods are inexpensive and simple to calculate however their errors are relatively large compared with ec the main reasons for breb errors are the assumption that the turbulent exchange coefficient of water and heat are equal is not always satisfied the spatial representation of each energy term in the energy balance formula is inconsistent and the bowen ratio before and after sunrise and sunset is approximately 1 barr et al 1994 liu et al 2011 unland et al 1996 the atmospheric stability function wind speed and relative humidity are sources of aero errors liu et al 1995 mahrt 2007 sorbjan and grachev 2010 hence comparing the results of fluxes calculated by ec and gradient methods is necessary to determine the degree of deviation between them under various conditions and provides a reference for obtaining a paddy field flux estimation scheme that balances accuracy and price in ecosystems worldwide some researchers have compared the water and heat fluxes calculated by ec and gradient methods which are consistent overall li et al 2008 liu et al 2009 wolf et al 2008 however differences still occur owing to the influences of crop growth stage natural environmental conditions and instrument resolution flores rojas et al 2019 pauwels and samson 2006 variations in crop growth during each growth stage can influence calculation results for example pozníková et al 2018 compared ec and breb in wheat fields in polkovice czech republic and found that differences in canopy coverage and irrigation amounts at each growth stage affected consistency of calculated results by changing the underlying surface conditions brotzge and crawford 2003 showed that the energy closure rate and bowen ratio from ec differed monthly for weeds and johnson grass in the tallgrass prairie preserve in north central oklahoma and the consistency in the le and h between ec and breb also varied additionally the relative deviation between methods is affected by meteorological parameters shi et al 2008 showed that the differences in le between ec and breb varied linearly with vapor pressure deficit in changbai mountain forest malek 1993 showed that the consistency between breb and aero increased with increasing wind speed in an alfalfa field in northern utah usa topographic conditions in the experimental area also affect the applicability of micrometeorological methods in addition irregular terrain invalidates some turbulent theoretical assumptions and increases the influence of advection baldocchi et al 2000 laubach and teichmann 1999 wilson et al 2002 li et al 2008 studied water and heat fluxes of vineyards in arid areas northwest china showing that uneven terrain increased the degree of energy non closure of ec and affected the consistency in le between ec and breb additionally the relationship between fluxes and meteorological gradients is affected by the degree of turbulence and atmospheric stratification mahrt 2007 mcnaughton and laubach 1998 barr et al 1994 examined the poplar forest to demonstrate that the changes in atmospheric stability led to the invalidity of the assumption that the water and heat turbulence exchange coefficients in breb were equal which changed its deviation from ec wolf et al 2008 analyzed the relationship between atmospheric stability and the difference between ec and breb discovering that the maximum error occurred in neutral atmospheric stratification furthermore instrument resolution is an important source of error brotzge and crawford 2003 revealed that uncertainty of measurements in net radiation and soil heat flux affected the results of ec and breb zhang et al 2011 eliminated data where the air temperature and relative humidity differences between two heights were less than the probe resolution in the study thereby avoiding the error caused by insufficient instrument resolution and improving the accuracy of breb these studies primarily examined dryland plants in arid and semiarid areas for paddy fields in humid areas currently most studies used only one single method to calculate the turbulent flux characteristics alberto et al 2011 alberto et al 2009 liu et al 2019 qiu et al 2022 timm et al 2014 thus there is not a systematic comparison between ec and gradient methods moreover the energy distribution and microclimatic characteristics are distinct among different ecosystems castellví et al 2020 cleverly et al 2020 nieberding et al 2020 von randow et al 2020 which also affects the consistency between micrometeorological methods further necessitating comparative studies in paddy fields in addition previous studies of the gradient methods have rarely considered differences in meteorological measurement heights δz under ideal conditions in the near surface layer the uniform underlying surface is a constant flux layer and the measurement heights do not affect the calculation results therefore foken 2017 suggested that increasing the ratio between two meteorological measurement heights to 4 8 would increase δz and thus magnify the air temperature water vapor pressure and wind speed gradients to reduce the measurement error caused by insufficient instrument accuracy in gradient methods however this scheme has not been widely adopted because increasing δz leads to high installation costs and inevitably weakens the uniformity of the underlying surface therefore instruments are typically installed within 0 5 2 5 m above the canopy in most flux stations castellví et al 2020 thus the impact of δz on the results remains unclear to solve these problems this study was conducted in 2021 at the irrigation experimental station of wuhan university qujialing management area jianghan plain the turbulent characteristics and meteorological parameters were measured using an ec system and a multi layer meteorological system on a 20 meter flux tower subsequently le and h were calculated using ec and gradient methods to compare their results for a paddy field in a humid area clarify the impact of δz on the applicability of gradient methods and analyze the effects of growth stage and weather conditions on the differences between micrometeorological methods 2 material and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted at the qujialing irrigation experimental station of the state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science wuhan university in 2021 the experimental area is located within the qujialing management zone which is in the northern jianghan plain in central hubei province the site has a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual air temperature relative humidity and sunshine duration are 16 3 c 77 and 1873 2 h respectively the prevailing wind direction is southeast during summer and northwest during winter the average annual rainfall is 1112 4 mm with the rice growing season from may to august accounting for more than 70 of total precipitation the soil type is paddy soil with a silty loam texture and its dry bulk weight is 1 36 g cm3 in 2021 the longliangyou 1534 rice variety was planted in an area of approximately 35 400 m2 within the experimental area and its growth period was 126 d from 140 to 265 days of the year doy in addition water seeding was used for planting and inundation was used for irrigation there was no standing water in the field at the end of the tillering 186 195 doy and yellow maturity 261 265 doy stages however a water depth of 10 50 mm was maintained during the other periods base fertilizer 600 kg ha was applied before sowing 139 doy and again 300 kg ha at the tillering 175 doy and booting 206 doy stages paddy fields were also present outside of the main experimental area the planting type and time of these crops were similar to those in the main experimental area however these fields were mixed with villages roads and forests 2 2 instrumentation a 20 meter flux tower was installed in the center of the paddy field and was equipped with an ec system and a multi layer meteorological gradient system additionally a soil parameter measurement system was embedded in soil underneath the tower the main instrument of the ec system was an integrated eddy measurement device integrated three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer and h2o co2 analyzer iragon li cor biosciences inc usa at an installation height of 2 5 m the system recorded data via a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa with a sampling frequency of 10 hz in the multi layer meteorological gradient system seven air temperature and humidity sensors hmp155 vaisala scientific inc finland and wind speed sensors 010 c met one scientific inc usa were installed at heights of 1 5 2 4 8 10 16 and 20 m an atmospheric pressure sensor cs106 vaisala scientific inc finland and wind direction sensor 020 c met one scientific inc usa were installed at 20 m a four component radiation meter cnr4 kipp zonen scientific inc netherlands was installed at 2 m in the soil measurement system three soil heat flux plates hfp01 campbell scientific inc usa were buried at depths of 5 10 and 20 cm and 10 soil three parameter temperature moisture content and conductivity sensors hydra stevens scientific inc usa were buried at depths of 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 110 130 and 150 cm the meteorological and soil parameters were measured at a frequency of 10 hz and the 10 min averages were recorded in a data logger cr6 campbell scientific inc usa used for the flux calculations 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 ec method 2 3 1 1 data processing and quality control the sensible and latent heat fluxes were calculated using three dimensional ultrasonic wind speed sonic temperature and specific humidity the calculation formulae are as follows 1 h ρ d c p w t a 2 l e λ ρ d w q where h is the sensible heat flux w m2 le is the latent heat flux w m2 ρd is the dry air density kg m3 cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure 1 01 kj kg k λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2260 kj kg and w ta and q are the fluctuation values of the vertical wind speed m s sonic temperature c and specific humidity g kg respectively the eddypro7 0 6 software li cor biosciences usa was used for data processing and the outliers in the original data were eliminated via the variance test vickers and mahrt 1997 subsequently the error was corrected via double coordinate rotation wilczak et al 2001 wpl webb pearman leuning correction webb et al 1980 and frequency response correction finnigan et al 2003 moncrieff et al 1997 on rainy days the rain fell on the sensor probes of the eddy covariance system resulting in decreased signal strength therefore it was necessary to eliminate rainfall periods and 1 h of data before and after each rainfall pauwels and samson 2006 insufficient atmospheric turbulence at night led to large measurement errors therefore it was necessary to eliminate data during which the friction velocity was less than 0 2 m s paw et al 2000 short gaps 1 h of missing or discarded data were filled using linear interpolation while long gaps were filled using an program package of artificial neural network method in matlab r2020b this program package established the connection between the meteorological data air temperature water vapor pressure relative humidity wind speed and net radiation and turbulent flux in the experimental area moffat et al 2007 2 3 1 2 energy balance closure correction the energy closure ratio was used to examine the quality of flux data the linear regression analysis of leec hec and the net radiation minus the surface soil heat flux rn g during the rice growth period is shown in fig 1 g was calculated by the soil heat flux measured in 5 cm water heat storage and soil heat storage a detailed description of the method calculating g can refer to liu et al 2020 in this figure the slope was 0 61 the intercept was 15 39 and the overall energy closure ratio was 0 74 fig 1 which was within the allowable range of the international and chinese flux network standards 0 56 1 20 and 0 58 1 00 respectively li et al 2004 wilson et al 2002 the phenomenon of energy non closure is universal at all flux stations and leads to lower ec calculation results widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 mainly due to inadequate turbulence development at night laubach and teichmann 1999 differences in the spatial scales of each energy item leuning et al 2012 and uneven underlying surfaces in the source area bernhofer 1992 polonio and soler 2000 to solve these problems the bowen ratio energy forced closure method was used to allocate the residual energy to correct the flux calculation results twine et al 2000 and the corrected results are considered as standard values baldocchi 2003 paw et al 2000 2 3 2 breb method the breb method was proposed by bowen 1926 the bowen ratio br is the ratio of sensible heat flux h to latent heat flux le at the surface which is based on the surface energy balance equation and near surface gradient diffusion theory the calculation formulae are as follows 3 λ e ρ a c p k w e z 4 h ρ a c p k h t a z assuming that the water and heat turbulence exchange coefficients are equal that is kh kw 5 β h λ e γ d t a d z d e d z γ δ t a δ e where γ is the moisture meter constant γ cp p 0 622 λ cp is the specific heat at constant pressure 1 01 kj kg c p is atmospheric pressure kpa λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2260 kj kg δta is the difference in temperatures between two heights c and δe is the difference in water pressure between two heights kpa the le and h are calculated as follows 6 l e r n g 1 β 7 h r n g β 1 β where rn is the net radiation w m2 and g is the surface soil heat flux w m2 in this study the results of this method were filtered when the directions between the flux and meteorological gradient were inconsistent or br ranged from 1 3 to 0 7 the data was eliminated ortega farias et al 1996 perez et al 1999 and the gap filling method was the same as that used for ec 2 3 3 aero method the aero method was first proposed by thornthwaite and holzman 1939 based on the monin obukhov similarity theory which indirectly calculates the turbulent flux through meteorological gradients according to aero the friction velocity u turbulence temperature scale θ turbulence specific humidity scale q and monin obukhov length l on the rough surface of the near surface layer are calculated as follows respectively 8 u k u z 2 u z 1 ln z 2 d z 1 d ψ m z 2 d l ψ m z 1 d l 9 θ k θ z 2 θ z 1 ln z 2 d z 1 d ψ h z 2 d l ψ h z 1 d l 10 q k q z 2 q z 1 ln z 2 d z 1 d ψ λ e z 2 d l ψ λ e z 1 d l 11 l u 3 k g θ w θ u 2 θ k g θ 12 θ θ z 2 θ z 1 2 where k is the kalman constant 0 4 d is the displacement height of the zero plane m d 2 3 h h is crop height ψm x ψh x and ψλe x are the stability functions of momentum sensible heat and latent heat fluxes respectively z is the height of measurement height above the ground m θ is the temperature at z k q is the specific humidity at z g kg and l is the monin obukhov length z d l is the atmospheric stability parameter u is the friction velocity θ is the turbulence temperature scale q is the turbulence specific humidity scale h and le can be calculated using the following formulas respectively 13 h ρ c p u θ 14 λ e ρ λ u q where ρ is the density of dry air 1 293 kg m3 cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure 1 004 kj kg k and λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2260 kj kg in this study the initial values of u θ q and l were obtained without correcting the atmospheric stability function in eqs 8 10 subsequently new values were obtained by performing calculations again while considering the atmospheric stability function this iterative calculation was continued until the difference between two calculated l values was less than 0 1 afterwards eqs 13 and 14 were used to obtain le and h a detailed description of this method and the atmospheric stability function was presented by liu et al 2009 the accuracy of this method was limited by resolution of the sensors therefore the errors in the results were relatively large and outliers were present flores rojas et al 2019 liu et al 2009 malek 1993 thus in this study data where the le 50 w m2 le 700 w m2 h 200 w m2 h 150 w m2 during the day and le 50 w m2 le 20 w m2 h 20 w m2 and h 50 w m2 during the night were excluded based on the flux characteristics of paddy fields chatterjee et al 2019 gao et al 2003 lu et al 2007 the gap filling method was the same as that used for ec 2 3 4 lai five rice plants were sampled at the 150 167 182 210 234 251 and 263 doy to evaluate average leaf area using the scanner m126nw hewlett packard inc usa before rice harvest five plots of 1 m2 were selected by the five point sampling method in the central plot of experimental area to obtain planting density and the leaf area index lai was calculated by leaf area and planting density 3 results 3 1 comparisons among height combinations in this study breb and aero were used to calculate le and h of paddy fields using meteorological data of five measurement height combinations which were 2 and 4 m 2 and 8 m 2 and 10 m 2 and 16 m and 2 and 20 m subsequently comparisons were made with ec to analyze the influence of δz on the applicability of gradient methods fig 2 depicts the diurnal variations in le and h mean values of the entire growth period time intervals of 30 min the curve had an inverted u shape and the peak value occurred at approximately 12 00 am however there were significant differences in absolute values among height combinations during the whole day for the breb 2 and 8 m combination had the highest lebreb peak value 410 53 w m2 and the lowest hbreb peak value 1 78 w m2 in contrast 2 and 16 m combination had the lowest lebreb peak value 277 30 w m2 and the highest hbreb peak value 102 21 w m2 hence when lebreb was larger hbreb was smaller and vice versa for aero 2 and 16 m combination had the lowest leaero peak value 140 72 w m2 and the highest haero peak value 44 02 w m2 however 2 and 4 m combination had the highest leaero peak value 355 46 w m2 but 2 and 8 m combination had the lowest haero peak value 0 62 w m2 therefore the peak values of breb and aero appeared under different height combinations fig 3 shows scatter diagrams of the comparisons between ec and gradient methods at each height combination these methods were highly consistent however the slopes of regression lines differed substantially therefore the degree of deviation needed to be quantified the determination coefficient r2 regression line slope k and relative deviation rd δle leec 100 δh hec 100 between ec and gradient methods and the mean values ofthe three methods are shown in table 2 among all height combinations lebreb ranged from 82 59 w m2 to 129 65 w m2 therefore the values fluctuated approximately 50 due to the change of δz comparing leec with lebreb r2 reached 0 99 and k and rd were 0 77 1 12 and 2 16 32 88 respectively meanwhile hbreb ranged from 2 72 w m2 to 28 74 w m2 because the proportion of h in paddy fields was low the change in δz caused a larger variation in this value comparing hec with hbreb the maximum r2 was 0 91 with a slope of 0 04 1 73 and the minimum rd was 114 04 therefore these statistical data show that the consistency between breb and ec was greater for le than that for h for aero leaero was between 48 86 w m2 and 129 73 w m2 and was significantly more affected by δz than lebreb the r2 between leaero and leec was greater than 0 96 and k and rd were 0 42 1 00 and 5 43 60 29 respectively haero ranged from 1 67 w m2 to 12 82 w m2 and the amplitude of its fluctuation was smaller than that of hbreb the maximum r2 between haero and hec was 0 92 their rd was greater than 88 86 and k was 0 04 0 78 similarly le had greater consistency between aero and ec than h based on the above analysis δz affected the calculation results of breb and aero in breb it had a greater influence on h than on le however in aero le was more highly affected than h moreover the consistency between ec and gradient methods was higher for le than for h a comprehensive comparison of the statistical data for le and h among all height combinations indicated that the 2 and 4 m height combination was the most applicable for rice therefore the results of breb and aero using the 2 and 4 m height combination were used for subsequent comparisons 3 2 comparisons at different growth stages the growth state of rice at each stage is different which affects the characteristics of underlying surface properties and energy distribution in this section the consistency between ec and gradient methods was compared in each growth stage the differences between methods δle δh and their root mean square errors rmse are shown in fig 4 leec was smaller than lebreb but larger in seeding stage and early tillering stage however leaero fluctuated during all growth stages compared with hec hbreb and haero were smaller in seeding stage and early tillering stage but larger in late tillering stage to yellow maturity stage the rmse of δle and δh showed a downward trend during the whole growth stages and fluctuated between 6 14 and 17 42 w m2 except δleec aero which was relatively larger and between 22 49 and 57 41 w m2 3 3 comparisons under different weather conditions the water and heat transfer processes between land surface and atmosphere substantially impact local atmospheric circulation and micrometeorological conditions krakauer et al 2013 moreover meteorological conditions affect the growth of rice thereby altering surface water and heat transfer processes this mutual feedback mechanism leads to differences in the applicability and consistency of micrometeorological methods under various weather conditions the average variations in fluxes on sunny cloudy and rainy days for the entire growth period of paddy fields are shown in fig 5 the variation trends of le and h were similar but the peak values appeared at different time and the values of every points were also different during the whole day as illustrated in fig 5 le showed an inverted u shape and the peak values mostly appeared at approximately 12 00 except sunny days leaero its peak value appeared at 11 00 in advance compared with leec the average value of leaero was 5 98 lower on sunny days and 23 31 and 22 38 higher on cloudy and rainy days respectively the average value of lebreb was 4 41 9 64 and 24 96 lower than the average leec on sunny cloudy and rainy days respectively additionally h was an inverted u shape and peaked at approximately 11 30 however the peak values of haero and hbreb were smaller than those of hec on sunny days with slower declining rates during the afternoon on rainy days the average hbreb and haero fluctuated significantly and were both much larger than hec in all weather conditions based on the above comparisons under all three weather conditions the consistency between breb and ec was higher than that between aero and ec and the consistency among le values was higher than that among h values the error in the daily mean values between gradient methods and ec was the smallest on sunny days however the diurnal variations in gradient methods were the most consistent with ec on cloudy days and the error of h was the largest on rainy days wind speed ws varies in different weather conditions and has a significant impact on atmospheric turbulence which is theoretical basis for micrometeorological methods ws above canopy directly affects the exchange of water heat and gas between ground and air macintyre et al 2010 novick et al 2009 therefore the consistency among ec breb and aero under different ws ranges was analyzed in this study referring to the daily ws at 2 m of the flux tower it was divided into three categories weak wind wind class i ws 1 00 m s moderate wind wind class ii 1 00 ws 1 32 m s and strong wind wind class iii 1 32 m s ws respectively the diurnal variations of average le h and ws at wind class i iii during the whole growth period are depicted in fig 6 ws was low at night and higher during the day rising gradually after sunrise with an inverted u shaped distribution the peak values for wind class i iii were 1 33 m s 1 66 m s and 2 37 m s respectively but there was no uniform peak time the diurnal variations of le and h were similar with ws for le under different classes the mean values of leec lebreb and leaero were 114 73 129 12 w m2 109 25 116 79 w m2 and 118 52 148 88 w m2 respectively meanwhile δleec breb and δleec aero were between 5 48 and 15 33 w m2 19 76 and 6 65 w m2 respectively for h the mean values of hec hbreb and haero under the three wind classes are 1 23 6 72 w m2 9 90 12 24 w m2 and 7 05 10 12 w m2 respectively δleec breb and δleec aero were between 5 27 and 11 03 w m2 3 40 and 8 28 w m2 le and h not increased with ws but the errors between ec and gradient methods increased with it the absolute values of hec increased with ws at night but hbreb and haero did not show this trend 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of measurement height breb and aero methods calculate fluxes indirectly through meteorological gradients at different heights therefore the form of the meteorological profiles determines the degree of influence of δz profiles of mean water vapor pressure e air temperature ta and wind speed ws during the entire growth period are shown in fig 7 as shown e decreased between 2 and 10 m then increased abruptly at 16 m before decreasing again at 20 m in contrast ta fluctuated continuously ws increased with height and its slope remained constant between 2 m and 16 m but dropped dramatically between 16 m and 20 m the near surface layer is considered to have constant fluxes according to the monin obukhov similarity theory ta e and ws in near surface layer should increase linearly with lnz the logarithm of measurement height z during the day when the underlying surface is uniform and flat therefore δta δlnz δe δlnz and δws δlnz should not change with measurement height parameters such as u θ q and br are also constant in gradient methods and the measurement height should not affect the results hence these methods do not specify height requirements and researchers commonly install the equipment 0 5 2 5 m above the crop canopy pozníková et al 2018 qiu et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 zhang et al 2008 under ideal conditions increasing the difference in meteorological measurement heights should increase the meteorological gradient values and thus reduce the effects of insufficient instrument resolution sharan and srivastava 2016 steeneveld et al 2005 however the measurement height in this study affected the results because δta δlnz δe δlnz and δws δlnz varied with height this phenomenon may be due to the increased range of source area with increasing height differences which caused the underlying surface to be more heterogeneous thus the irregularity of the terrain was also intensified the meteorological profiles at the flux tower were affected by the land surface characteristics of upwind areas owing to advection differences in surface temperature humidity and roughness of the discontinuous surface changed the meteorological profiles of the paddy field affected the applicability of the m o similarity theory and caused errors in the gradient methods the near surface structure of the experimental area can be preliminarily divided via meteorological profile and the degree of influence of different underlying surface types and characteristics therein can be analyzed which can provide a basis for selecting appropriate meteorological measurement heights and improving the applicability of gradient methods the differences in surface roughness z0 land temperature and humidity of the discontinuous surfaces caused the formation of an internal boundary layer and a new equilibrium layer in the near surface layer foken 2017 rao et al 1974 savelyev and taylor 2001 in this study following the method proposed by savelyev and taylor 2005 the near surface layer structure and the z0 in downwind z0d and upwind z0 u directions were analyzed using ws profile which represented the average ws during the whole stage in the main wind direction north wind defined as between 315 and 45 at 12 00 am as shown in fig 8 the heights of the internal boundary layer and new equilibrium layer were approximately 16 m and 4 m respectively which was analyzed based on the height of the inflection points of ws profile z0d and z0 u were 0 07 m and 1 56 m respectively estimated by the extension of the tangent line in inflection points of ws profile fig 8 the underlying surface in source area of the flux tower was primarily composed of paddy fields but also contained woodlands roads and villages therefore z0 u was large in contrast there were only paddy fields in the downwind direction therefore z0d was small the change in z0 led to the generation of an internal boundary layer which was a discontinuous transitional layer the layer above it was influenced by the surface characteristics upwind of the measurement site whereas the layer below it was a new equilibrium layer whose properties came from the underlying surface inside the experimental area verkaik and holtslag 2006 in this study the meteorological measurements within the new equilibrium layer range above the canopy but below 4 m only showed the characteristics of the experimental area and were not affected by the heterogeneity of underlying surface therefore in this study the height combination of 2 m and 4 m in paddy fields was the most applicable for gradient methods similarly villages and roads in the footprint area were heat sources thus hot and dry air rose with turbulence and affected the ta and e profiles owing to advection however the quantification of this impact requires further study among all the combinations in this study although 2 4 m was the most suitable for rice the applicability of this combination may be affected if h is too high measurement systems are usually installed above the canopy a certain distance to avoid the influence of roughness sublayer which exists between plant canopy top and the constant flux layer it is caused by the roughness of underlying surface and monin obukhov similarity theory fails to explain the flux gradient relationships in it therefore the measurement height should exceed the upper boundary of roughness sublayer referring to existing study results it extended up to about 2 h cellier and brunet 1992 in gradient methods to ensure the sensors installed at 2 m were above the roughness sublayer the optimal maximum h was 1 m during the growth stage in 2021 the maximum h was 1 1 m exceeding the upper boundary there was no extra correction for it due to the impact of roughness sublayer in short stem crops was not significant and the maximum h exceeded the upper limit by only 10 which is acceptable garratt and pearman 2020 however for high stem crops such as corn and sorghum this combination was not applicable because their h will exceed the measurement height and further study is still needed to determine the optimal measurement heights for other high stem crops and quantify the impact of roughness sublayer according to above analysis for the micrometeorological methods referring to the stratification of near surface layer the measurement systems should be installed in the height range which reflects the underlying surface characteristics of experimental area and avoids the influence of underlying surface s roughness that is below the new equilibrium layer and above the roughness sublayer combined the estimated heights of new equilibrium layer 4 m maximum roughness sublayer 2 2 m and the maximum h of rice 1 1 m in this study the optimum measurement height range for three micrometeorological methods in paddy fields was approximately 1 1 2 9 m above the canopy however there were insufficient turbulence and meteorological measurement data above canopy below 2 m and between 4 and 8 m so the heights of new equilibrium layer and roughness sublayer were just estimated without rigorously theoretical analysis the accurate heights are still needed to be further studied through supplementary measurement data to clarify the optimal measurement heights 4 2 the influence of the growth stage there were differences in crop morphology at each growth stage that affected the microclimate and characteristics of the field energy distribution which can be quantitatively analyzed using lai and br the variations in lai br le and h during the growth period are shown in fig 9 the br which was calculated by le and h separately using all three methods first decreased and then increased with growth of the crop at seedling and early tillering stages the rice plants were sparse and short and the canopy had not formed hence the lai and evapotranspiration rate were low the proportion of h was relatively high and br reached 0 3 after the later tillering stage the rice grew vigorously andlai increased sharply simultaneously the rates of evapotranspiration and heat absorption were high therefore the temperature above the canopy decreased furthermore a temperature inversion layer occasionally formed the proportion of h decreased whereas the proportion of le increased the br was approximately 0 after the grain filling stage the leaves gradually turned yellow and lai decreased thus the br increased slightly and finally reached approximately 0 2 the brbreb was lower than the brec when lai was less than 1 resulting in an underestimation of hbreb and an overestimation of lebreb however brbreb increased owing to the rapid increase in lai thus hbreb became overestimated and lebreb became underestimated leaero and haero were calculated by meteorological gradients lacking the restrictions of energy balance as in breb as mentioned above meteorological gradients above the canopy were affected by crop morphology when lai was small the crops grew slowly and canopy had not yet formed hence rice had minimal influence on microclimate of the field leading to a small meteorological gradients therefore the error caused by the sensor resolution was large but the influence of this factor gradually weakened with the rapid growth of rice 4 3 the influence of atmospheric stability turbulence theory is the basis of micrometeorological methods and there are interactions among weather conditions crop growth stage and atmospheric stability in this study the atmospheric stability parameter z d l was used as the standard to judge atmospheric stability z d and l are defined in section 2 3 3 a positive z d l indicates a stable boundary layer whereas a negative z d l indicates an unstable boundary layer typical during the day a z d l of approximately 0 indicates neutral stratification micrometeorological methods are based on atmospheric turbulence and z d l represents the relative influences of the buoyancy and shear force that drive the vertical mixing wolf et al 2008 therefore when the atmosphere was in various states of stratification the degree of influence of buoyancy and shear also differed which reduced the applicability of some theoretical assumptions of micrometeorological methods resulting in errors the differences between ec and gradient methods under different atmospheric stability conditions are shown in fig 10 the error was the largest when atmosphere was in neutral stratification the relationship between buoyancy and shear force directly affected meteorological gradients above the canopy and indirectly changed the intermediate parameters in gradient methods thereby affecting the degree of error for aero on sunny days the peak value of leaero appeared at approximately 11 00 a m and was lower than leec at noon at that time the evapotranspiration intensity and heat absorption in the field were high which led to a reduction in temperature gradient above the canopy and the appearance of an inversion layer resulting in neutrally stratified atmosphere thus the error was large for breb in daytime z d l was usually close to or less than 0 indicating neutral stratification or unstable stratification and there was strong non similarity of water vapor and temperature profiles in the vertical direction thus kw kh which resulted in a small lebreb lang et al 1983 ws will promote the process of water and heat exchange between ground and atmosphere affecting turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability tanny et al 2006 teitel et al 2020 thus the consistency among micrometeorological methods based on turbulence theory was influenced by it the relationship between ws and z d l in experimental area is shown in fig 11 z d l was close to 0 when the ws was high meaning that atmosphere was in the neutral stratification as illustrated in fig 10 that the error was the maximum in this case therefore in this study the deviations between ec and gradient methods increased with the increase of ws 5 conclusion in this study the ec and meteorological gradient systems on a flux tower were used to calculate the turbulence characteristics and meteorological parameters of a rice paddy field and le and h were calculated using ec breb and aero respectively additionally the influences of measurement height growth stage and weather conditions on the applicability and consistency of each method were analyzed the findings revealed that changes in δz affected the applicability of gradient methods compared with ec among the five height combinations that of 2 m and 4 m was the most applicable and the r2 values between lebreb aero leec and hbreb aero hec reached 0 96 and 0 84 respectively therefore magnifying δz did not always improve the accuracy of gradient methods owing to the increase in heterogeneity of the source area the instruments should be installed in the new equilibrium layer and above roughness sublayer and δz can be magnified within this range in this study the optimum measurement height range for micrometeorological methods was approximate 1 1 2 9 m above the maximum h in paddy fields crop growth state and weather conditions affected the microclimate and atmospheric stability above the canopy and led to the change of energy distribution characteristics in paddy fields the difference between ec and gradient methods varied from seeding to yellow maturity stage and the consistency among methods was also affected by weather conditions sunny cloudy rainy days and different wind class additionally atmospheric stability changed the accuracy of gradient methods and z d l was also affected by crop growth and weather conditions when z d l was approximately 0 the atmosphere was in neutral stratification and vertical mixing was driven by shear rather than buoyancy thereby resulting in the largest error between methods this study can provide a reference for the selection of instrument installation height in gradient methods and the error analysis of the three micrometeorological methods however it is still necessary to further quantitatively analyze the relationship between the stratification of near surface layer and source area characteristics thus reducing the error of micrometeorological methods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
