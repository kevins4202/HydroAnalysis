5035,shelterbelts play an important ecological function in arid irrigation land while competing for water which otherwise supports crop growth estimation of shelterbelt water consumption from groundwater is essential to better manage shelterbelts in irrigation districts but often a challenging task due to its geometry and varying accessibility to groundwater in the study sap flow of populus popularis planted along an irrigation canal was measured during two growing seasons 2016 2017 to investigate its response to varying shallow groundwater considering the radial pattern of sap flux density js and measurement azimuthal effect corrected js was adopted to better represent transpiration the results indicate that increased soil moisture and groundwater table during irrigation periods with water flowing in the canal enhance relative js of shelterbelt by 5 5 25 8 from the non irrigation intervals the threshold of groundwater depth 3 6 m is identified beyond which transpiration of the seven year old shelterbelt becomes very low greenbelt transpiration strongly depends on groundwater within the threshold and can be estimated through an exponential function of the ratio of atmospheric demand and groundwater depth besides with the decrease of reference evapotranspiration from june to september the sensitivity of shelterbelt transpiration response to groundwater table depth was increased this study provides necessary information to evaluate farmland shelterbelt transpiration for rational water resource allocation to meet the ecological water requirement in arid areas with shallow groundwater keywords shelterbelt transpiration relative sap flux density canal irrigation water groundwater depth 1 introduction in arid areas limited water resources are one of the key constraints on crop production and ecosystem functioning as the barrier of farmland ecosystem shelterbelts play an indispensable ecological role and their water consumption has always been focused for agriculture and ecological sustainable development chang et al 2006 shen et al 2015a 2015b furthermore shelterbelts are widely planted around the world such as the great plains shelterbelt project in the usa the great dam engineering project in north africa countries and the three north shelterbelt program in china wu et al 2019 the global shelterbelt forests cover 330 million ha in 2010 accounting for 8 of all forest areas shelterbelt forests in asia have the largest share of 26 and cover about 60 million ha in china fao 2010 through changing the adjust farmland micrometeorological environment such as reducing wind speed and changing air temperature atmospheric turbulence mcnaughton 1988 ryszkowski and kędziora 2007 shelterbelts have a positive effect on agricultural productivity nuberg 1998 shelterbelts potentially suppress pest numbers and partly redress the loss of biodiversity of beneficial organisms due to agricultural practices tsitsilas et al 2006 moreover shelterbelts help to mitigate greenhouse gases by enhancing carbon storage and reducing n2o emission amadi et al 2016 considering hydrological processes and plant water use an experiment carried out in the uk indicated that saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity were increased significantly in the shelterbelts comparing to pasture which reduced runoff and flood hazard carroll et al 2004 whereas the competition for water and nutrient resources between shelterbelts and farmlands should not be negligible qiao et al 2016 it is prone to reduce crop yield next to shelterbelts kowalchuk and de jong 1995 higher microbial biomass and nitrogen mineralization rates are found in the shelterbelt soil wojewoda and russel 2003 and nitrate concentrations decreases with the distance from tree belt qiao et al 2016 in addition estimates of heat balances in the agricultural landscape have shown that intercepted energy by shelterbelts is more than cultivated fields during the growing season it s partly attributed to a reflection of lower albedo in shelterbelts than other ecosystems due to difference in plant cover ryszkowski and kędziora 1987 shelterbelts water use could be 40 more than cultivated fields partly because of heat advection processes transferred from farmlands to shelterbelts ryszkowski 1989 ryszkowski and kędziora 2007 a certain amount of water is needed to support shelterbelts growth depending on specific situations pine transpiration in humid temperate region is no more than 1 85 mm d 1 and only reached a total of 176 4 mm from may to november vincke and thiry 2008 the transpiration of tree belts that comprises of four eucalyptus species in western australia is 440 mm over a 12 month period white et al 2002 populus gansuensis shelter belt transpiration ranges from 1 7 to 5 6 mm d 1 in the heihe river basin of northwest china chang et al 2006 similar result suggests the average value of shelterbelts stand transpiration is about 4 8 mm d 1 and total stand transpiration exceeds 590 mm for two years in arid inland region shen et al 2015a in arid areas with shallow groundwater understanding the contribution to shelterbelt transpiration from the saturated and unsaturated zones is complex due to the hydraulic connection land covers and subsurface characteristics shah et al 2007 the increasing proportion of groundwater consumption is found to meet trees water demand during the drought periods miller et al 2010 pinto et al 2014 shen et al 2015 vincke and thiry 2008 yin et al 2015 the phenomenon is verified by two partial root zone drying treatments in pear orchard that capillary contribution from groundwater significantly increased kang et al 2003 stable isotope measurements report that groundwater is the main water resource for tree survival when soil water is low song et al 2016 simulations found that increased groundwater table depth results in the decrease of tree transpiration largely in ejina basin of northwest china zhu et al 2009 whereas it is also found tree transpiration increases with the increasing water table depth at the perennial stream site gazal et al 2006 the heavy precipitation can weaken the dependence of shelterbelt transpiration on groundwater shen et al 2015a in arid environments trees growth response to groundwater variation can be fitted by different function forms huang et al 2019 for a linear response stand condition tree mortality rate increases in floodplain ecosystem and stand transpiration decreases in arid oasis desert ecotone with increasing groundwater depth gonzález et al 2012 shen et al 2015 the curvilinear response is reported in tree ring width index that declines as groundwater depth increases ling et al 2015 canopy dieback in relation to groundwater depth can be described as a sigmoidal function that is a stepwise negative response horton et al 2001a 2001b the influences of groundwater depth on species diversity indices and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi follow the bell shaped response hao et al 2009 jin et al 2011 in these studies according to the responses between vegetation metrics and groundwater depths groundwater depth thresholds or optimal ranges are obtained for ensuring the vegetation restoration or survival hao et al 2009 2010 horton et al 2001a 2001b jin et al 2011 ling et al 2015 therefore groundwater availability and its variations for tree water use or survival exist differences due to species specifics and local site conditions about 5 2 billion m3 per year 1980 2015 water from the yellow river is allocated to agricultural irrigation for hetao plain of china chen et al 2018 however the yellow river water conservancy commission plans to reduce irrigation water division to 4 0 billion m3 each year in future on this basis shelterbelt water consumption is becoming more and more prominent in study area furthermore the previous researches are seldom concerned about the quantitative relationship between groundwater depth and tree transpiration as groundwater contribution could not be measured easily therefore there are still uncertainties about shelterbelt water use especially when canal periodically transports irrigation water resulting in groundwater depth fluctuations significantly in the study populus popularis sap flow was measured in the shelterbelt along an irrigated canal in 2016 and 2017 the specific objectives are to 1 analyze the response of shelterbelt transpiration to groundwater variations caused by irrigation canal water conveyance 2 quantify the possible threshold of groundwater depth for shelterbelt transpiration 3 examine the relationship between shelterbelt transpiration and shallow groundwater under the condition of high potential evapotranspiration demand in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description hetao irrigation district located in the upper reaches of the yellow river in inner mongolia china is an alluvial plain this area is characterized by a typical temperate continental arid climate with small precipitation and high evaporation average annual precipitation is 170 mm and annual pan evaporation 20 cm pan is 2300 mm in the period 2000 2014 average annual temperature is 8 8 c while the maximum and minimum are 23 8 c in july and 12 3 c in january respectively chen et al 2018 usually farmland shelterbelt is arranged along the canal with small grid and narrow belt construction pattern the dominate varieties are populus popularis and populus alba l var pyramidalis the experiment site situated specifically at a typical irrigation canal in yongji sub district hetao irrigation district 41 09ʹ n 107 39ʹ e elevation 1032 m fig 1 the unlined irrigation canal exhibits a trapezoid shape with about 1 5 m of bottom width and 3 m of top width there is one row of tree belt on either side of the canal with the plant spacing of about 2 m the observed tree populus popularis is a deciduous species with sparse canopy slender branches and grey green bark it s characterized of drought resistance and saline tolerance tree belt were measured in 2016 2017 and understory vegetation was sparse the age of the trees was about seven year old and the height was above 10 m 2 2 meteorology soil water and groundwater measurements meteorological conditions such as solar radiation relative humidity air temperature atmospheric pressure and precipitation were monitored through the micrometeorological station which was installed about 500 m away from the experiment site data were collected every 30 min daily reference crop evapotranspiration eto was calculated by penman monteith equation in fao 56 allen et al 1998 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t

depth of 150 cm the measured soil volumetric moisture was calibrated by the gravimetric method undisturbed soil samples were taken from the soil profile in 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm depths with three replications using 100 cm3 cutting ring respectively soil samples were collected to measure soil physical properties of different soil layers i e soil bulk density oven drying method soil moisture constants saturated water content and filed capacity cutting ring method soil mechanical composition mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd england and soil texture the usda texture classification as shown in table 1 groundwater table depth gtd was monitored every 30 min using hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp ma usa gtd was compensated by atmospheric pressure obtained from micrometeorological station the third groundwater well was used to record groundwater fluctuation adjacent to tree belt others were mainly used to monitor canal leakage that was not mentioned in this paper 2 3 sap flow measurement sap flux density js cm3 cm 2 s 1 was measured by thermal dissipation probe sensor tdp30 dynamax inc usa the sensor consists of a special heating wire and two copper constantan thermocouple t type probes with the length of 3 cm and the diameter of 0 12 cm the thermal signal corresponds to temperature difference between the heated probe and unheated probe granier 1985 1987 probes were inserted to the xylem of tree about 1 3 m above the ground the observed part of the tree and probes were wrapped using tinfoil as a shield to prevent solar radiation interference precipitation and other factors disturbance moreover because wounding effect for tree is seldom taken into consideration in calculating js by thermal dissipation method chen et al 2014 pinto et al 2014 shen et al 2015a 2015b steppe et al 2010 wounding effect for probe tree contact was not considered in our study four trees with different diameter at breast height dbh cm were chosen to measure js that was calculated by an empirical equation given in granier 1985 sample trees were in state of rapid growing in two years that dbhs of sampling trees increased linearly with time fig s1 tree sapwood is the passage through which water up taken from roots was transported to leaves as a key parameter and technical problem sapwood area as cm2 was used to calculate individual tree and stand transpiration by js phillips et al 1996 based on the distinction of colors between sapwood and heartwood sapwood width ws cm and as were measured through increment borer haglof inc sweden samplings the relationships between ws vs dbh and as vs dbh through samplings were linearly significant in the shelterbelt p 0 05 fig s2 with the increase of ws in the observation periods of 2016 2017 the relative location of sensing point copper constantan thermocouple to detect temperature in the middle of the probe granier 1987 also changed because of single point measurement fig s3 showed lower values of x ws corresponded to lower js values in a significant way x represents the length of copper constantan thermocouple 1 5 cm that its junction locates in the middle of probe considering the influence of ws change and probe insert direction on the actual js the detailed corrections was given in correction a and b of supplementary material based on the aforementioned correction results of js daily mean sap flux density jm mm3 mm 2 d 1 that represented the average volume of water transporting along sapwood radial profile per unit as per day was finally adopted to use this parameter was different from daily transpiration per unit ground area which was to reduce the calculation error of sap flow i e transpiration caused by the product of js and as in the rapid growth state of trees furthermore in order to exclude as and meteorological factors influences the ratio of jm to eto mm d 1 could be seen as relative sap flux density value jm eto a dimensionless parameter by the unit conversion at the daily scale which was used in the following sections without special explanation 2 4 sensitive index sensitive index λn mm 1 defined as the indicator to describe the response of the difference of jm eto to that of gtd is further applied to evaluate the sensitivity of sap flow to the change in groundwater depth jm eto and gtd during canal non irrigation periods nips of two years were selected to calculate λn as followed 2 λ n δ j m et o n j m et o 1 δ gtd n gtd 1 n 1 where jm eto 1 is the value of relative sap flux density corresponding to minimum groundwater table depth gtd1 in the initial day jm eto n is the value of relative sap flux density corresponding to increasing groundwater table depth gtdn in the next n day 3 results 3 1 variations of environmental factors and jm eto environmental factors including eto precipitation swc and gtd were analyzed over two consecutive growing seasons and 3 day running average results were depicted in fig 2 except precipitation based on the dynamics of gtd and canal flow records we divided the whole observation time into canal irrigation periods ips and nips totally there were four nips and five ips in two years experiments during the observation periods the maximum and minimum of daily eto were 5 45 and 2 36 mm in 2016 6 60 and 2 46 mm in 2017 respectively mean value of eto was 3 87 mm in 2016 and 4 43 mm in 2017 total precipitation was 20 0 and 60 0 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2a the fluctuations of swc and gtd were significantly affected by canal irrigations fig 2b in ips both swc and gtd increased correspondingly and then had a downward trend after ips comparing swc in ips and nips the average increased ratios of swc at 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm depths were 1 92 5 32 8 40 10 24 and 2 47 respectively the temporal variation of swc at each layer for both years was similar swc was almost below field capacity at 0 90 cm soil layer in two years swc at 150 cm depth was close to or greater than field capacity 0 375 m3 m 3 when canal was ponded with irrigation water before september in two years fig 2b canal irrigation leakage led to the gtd rise by about 0 23 0 72 m in two years corresponding to the minimum gtd of 3 19 and 2 74 m in 2016 and 2017 respectively as the water consumption of shelterbelt transpiration gtd had a clear decline trend during the observation periods in the end gtd was downed to about 4 22 m and 4 52 m in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2b besides calculated results indicated that average decrease rate of gtd was about 2 30 cm and 2 26 cm per day during nips for 2016 and 2017 the variation of jm eto in two years was shown in fig 2c for the monitoring periods jm was about 2414 37 and 3392 66 mm3 mm 2 d 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the values of jm in two years seemed to be large which represent the average volume of water transported along sapwood radial profile per unit as per day jm eto of all observed trees had similar variation trend and intensive fluctuation generally jm eto in 2017 average 780 59 was higher than that in 2016 average 638 63 3 2 response of jm eto to gtd under intermittent canal irrigations condition we used data without a 3 day running average to illustrate situ situation in the following text and sections the average results for each nip and ip condition were also listed in table 2 because of the short monitoring period in 2016 there were two ips and one nip for the first ip jul 14 to aug 1 the increase ratio of jm eto was about 15 6 compared with the following nip aug 2 to aug 7 comparing the other four nip ip groups it indicated that jm eto increased by 5 5 25 8 in ips table 2 only the increase ratio for the fourth ip was not significant by independent sample t test at the significance level of 0 05 compared with the other three ips the minimum increase ratio of 5 5 occurred in the fourth nip ip group from jul 4 to jul 28 in 2017 due to several previous rainfall events fig 2a moreover the increment the difference of jm eto or gtd between ip and nip the same below of jm eto didn t vary synchronously with that of gtd table 2 the maximum increment of jm eto and gtd occurred in the fifth and first nip ip groups respectively an exponential decay response for young trees between λn and gtd under canal non irrigations condition was delineated in fig 3 r2 0 37 p 0 001 which meant that we could use λn to deduce the suitable gtd in addition according to the mann kendall monotony trend test when gtd varied between 3 1 and 4 6 m during nips in two years the test statistics showed a decreased trend at the 0 01 test level zc 3 08 z c z 0 01 2 58 at the 99 level this showed that populus popularis transpiration was sensitive to variation in gtd it was attempted to find an abrupt point to elucidate the most sensitive degree of gtd to tree transpiration according to the variation of λn under different gtds by the mann kendall monotony trend test the statistical analysis also showed that 3 6 m depth mark divided the plot into two parts λn first decreased sharply gtd 3 6 m and then was generally stable gtd 3 6 m specifically the independent sample t test suggested significant difference between two parts p 0 001 therefore a threshold of gtd about 3 6 m was identified beyond which λn was averaged about 0 14 mm 1 and relatively steady when gtd fluctuated up and down at 3 6 m due to canal intermittent irrigations comparing with other ips jm eto increased more in the second and fifth ip by 25 8 and 23 0 respectively table 2 therefore the threshold value of gtd clearly distinguished the dependence of shelterbelt transpiration capacity on the increasing of groundwater depth 3 3 relationship between jm with eto and gtd to quantify this connection between shelterbelt transpiration meteorological condition and water availability a simple equation for the relationship between jm with eto and gtd was developed fig 4 eto gtd is a dimensional parameter mm d 1 mm 1 representing the combination effect of the integrated meteorological and water conditions a further explanation for eto gtd is given in the discussion section with shallower groundwater table and larger evaporation demand the increase rate of shelterbelt transpiration became more and more slow the fitted curve illustrated the close relationship between them p 0 001 and the equation explained exponentially 64 of the total variation in shelterbelt transpiration of two years fig 4 the remaining variance may be attributed to the uncertainty in the physiological characteristics such as leaf area index stomata behaviors and individual differences for example in late august and september when gtd was relatively large and eto was small fig 2a and b shelterbelt transpiration declined gradually at late growth stage in order to further explain the variation of shelterbelt transpiration with varying gtd under different potential evapotranspiration demands we calculated monthly mean eto based on the meteorological data of past 10 years fig 5 from june to september the corresponding eto mean 99 confidence interval was 6 21 0 20 6 10 0 20 4 97 0 16 and 3 37 0 14 mm d 1 respectively given the monthly mean eto shelterbelt transpiration was estimated by the fitted equation under the assumed gtd from 1 0 to 5 0 m at a 0 1 m interval it was in common that simulated daily mean sap flux density jsm decreased remarkably with the increase of gtd for every month the jsm had a similar decrease in june average 3895 31 mm3 mm 2 d 1 and july average 3879 61 mm3 mm 2 d 1 due to the very similar eto while the decrease of jsm was more significant in august average 3668 82 mm3 mm 2 d 1 and september average 3155 07 mm3 mm 2 d 1 according to the slope of curves it could be concluded that the smaller eto was more obvious this variation was 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of tree transpiration to groundwater the sensitivity of sap flow to groundwater change differs from tree species and climate conditions which has been investigated in many areas gazal et al 2006 shen et al 2015a 2015b vincke and thiry 2008 in our study the threshold of groundwater was about 3 6 m beyond which the sensitivity of sap flow to the variation of groundwater table was no longer significant fig 3 similar result was found that vegetation status characterized by the seasonal average ndvi responded to groundwater fluctuations apparently when gtd varied between 1 8 and 3 5 m while this phenomenon was not obvious after gtd was deeper than 5 m in the lower heihe river basin characterized by a typical arid inland environment wang et al 2011 based on the physiological response of cellular water potential moderator including proline content superoxide dismutase activity and peroxidase activity to groundwater change in the lower reaches of tarim river the stress depth of groundwater table for phragmites communis tamarix spp and populus euphratica was identified as 3 5 5 and 4 5 m respectively chen et al 2004 through analyzing the quantitative relationships between gtds and tree ring width indices in the same basin the minimum gtd for near mature populus euphratica trees with dbhs 10 20 cm was suggested to be 5 m ling et al 2015 the identified gtd threshold is larger than that of studied populus popularis tree belt with dbhs 12 20 cm within the same dbh scope it s potentially attributed to intermittent canal irrigation activities and tree species characteristics for the semiarid riparian cottonwood forests in southeastern arizona the ratio of tree transpiration to eto declined when gtd was beyond 3 5 m gazal et al 2006 results of distinct non linear responses for e camaldulensis and e populnea canopy condition foliage index to gtd from 118 sites in eastern australia reported that thresholds of gtd ranged from 12 1 to 22 6 m and from 12 6 to 26 7 m respectively kath et al 2014 due to gtd varied greatly and declined steadily over time across the catchment the suitable gtd for tree growth were relatively deeper than our study area where seasonal irrigation activities caused water tables to fluctuate above and below threshold over time however if gtd was 1 m flooded roots may hinder plant growth due to anaerobic condition naumburg et al 2005 li et al 2017 the quantification of the optimal range or threshold of gtd is vital to better understand trees transpiration maintain well growth and conserve groundwater dependent biodiversity 4 2 effect of groundwater on tree transpiration the relationship between tree transpiration and groundwater was emphasized in our study gtd in the hetao area is mainly affected by irrigation water recharge and groundwater evapotranspiration etg direct evaporation and uptake by vegetation roots due to capillary rise and canal leakage accounts for 48 of the annual groundwater recharge in the growth period xu et al 2010 shelterbelt water use is mainly dependent on recharge of groundwater and soil water from canal leakage jm was positively correlated with swc of each layer data were not shown besides the reliance of trees on groundwater increases as soil water decreases lubczynski 2009 canal irrigation water leakage might give a chance for populus popularis roots to easily absorb shallow groundwater in the study the increase ratio of jm eto ranged from 5 5 to 25 8 comparing nips and ips table 2 this could be attributed to the enhanced contribution of shallow groundwater after irrigations furthermore it was found that rainfall increased tree transpiration comparing to its value pre rainfall wang et al 2017 zhao and liu 2010 and decreased the dependence of tree sap flow on groundwater but groundwater and irrigation are still the critical water resources for shelterbelt trees shen et al 2015a similarly some literatures have reported that deeper groundwater depth could weaken tree s transpiration gazal et al 2006 shen et al 2015a 2015b xi et al 2017 groundwater depth condition increased from 2 to 6 m and decreased the ratio of groundwater subsidy to root water uptake for populus euphratica from 60 3 to 47 5 li et al 2017 the root water uptake by populus euphratica under the increase of gtd condition from 2 to 3 m caused a 74 reduction of tree transpiration according to simulation settings zhu et al 2009 the decline of groundwater table caused by anthropogenic activities such as over pumping would significantly decrease groundwater contribution on tree water use yin et al 2015 a related study found that fine root distribution of shelterbelt adjacent to irrigation channel was mainly in the 1 4 2 0 m and 0 0 4 m soil layer xiao and huang 2016 the maximum rooting depth of tree belt could reach about 3 2 m deep shen et al 2014 in our study the minimum gtd was 3 19 m in 2016 and 2 74 m in 2017 correspondingly fig 2b it possibly provides evidence that tree roots are capable of meeting its water demand by directly extracting groundwater furthermore at least 22 of tree water use is directly from groundwater via root clump it should be subordinated to taproot system and if additional roots have accessed water table the percentage of groundwater contribution will be greater doody and benyon 2011 however groundwater decline may decouple tree roots from accessible water resources naumburg et al 2005 these results suggest that trees transpiration is vulnerable to groundwater fluctuation the contribution of saturated zone to trees evapotranspiration is estimated by etg the magnitude of etg depended upon gtd and atmospheric conditions in water limited environments lubczynski 2009 etg is generally suggested to decay with increasing gtd gonzález et al 2012 kath et al 2014 shah et al 2007 shen et al 2015 when actual evapotranspiration and etg are difficult to be obtained in the shelterbelt the ratio of eto characterizing potential evapotranspiration demand to gtd is a suitable parameter which can reflect how tree transpiration responses to the integrated microclimatic and water supply conditions in this study an exponential relationship existed between shelterbelt transpiration and the ratio of eto to gtd fig 4 similarly ryszkowski and kędziora 2007 also got an exponential relationship between the share of water uptake from saturated zone in total real evapotranspiration and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to gtd in the shelterbelts of poland the results indicate that the warmer weather and shallower gtd more water is absorbed from saturated zone for forest land the exponential decay function explained the decline of potential evapotranspiration and etg with increasing gtd which was verified well by field data shah et al 2007 without stable isotopes measurements and numerical model simulations the fitted function could be used to directly evaluate the connection between shallow groundwater and tree transpiration in the paper it suggested shelterbelt would absorb groundwater to meet transpiration demand as much as possible but how much the contribution of groundwater exists uncertainty due to the complicated hydraulic connection in unsaturated and saturated zones especially in riparian zones and water limited areas lubczynski 2009 besides the horizontal leakage loss from canal irrigation increases the complexity of water migration to some extent canal leakage water alleviates the water consumption of shelterbelt from originally stored groundwater and avoids excessive decline of groundwater depth 5 conclusions in this study we modified the calculation method of js considering the radial distribution pattern and insertion directions from two years field observation experiments then the calculated shelterbelt transpiration and its response to gtd variation were analyzed the increased shallow groundwater table and soil water resulting from canal leakage during ips increased shelterbelt transpiration by 5 5 25 8 and shelterbelt transpiration could be estimated exponentially under the influence of gtd and eto r2 0 64 according to this relationship a further simulation result indicated that when eto became smaller from june to september the decline rate of jsm with gtd increased in addition the threshold of gtd for shelterbelt transpiration was identified as 3 6 m beyond which the sensitivity of the response of jm to gtd was weaken and became steady in arid areas where agriculture production relies on irrigation canal leakage resulting in shallow groundwater table is beneficial to tree transpiration especially for young trees at rapid growth stage the results will be useful to better understand the interaction between tree transpiration and groundwater depth without biometric measurement although the corrections of sap flow proved valid for young trees in this study it should also be determined if they are applicable for other species specifically the method and qualitative summaries will provide important information and guidance for young tree transpiration in similar area with shallow groundwater however our analyses were mainly focused on individual tree scale and based on current available data on the basis of present experimental study the threshold of gtd was found with statistical difference it s essential to further confirm the phenomenon by collecting more samples moreover the future research on the response of shelterbelt transpiration to gtd still need to combine with biological indexes and scale up to stand scale or regional scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5035,shelterbelts play an important ecological function in arid irrigation land while competing for water which otherwise supports crop growth estimation of shelterbelt water consumption from groundwater is essential to better manage shelterbelts in irrigation districts but often a challenging task due to its geometry and varying accessibility to groundwater in the study sap flow of populus popularis planted along an irrigation canal was measured during two growing seasons 2016 2017 to investigate its response to varying shallow groundwater considering the radial pattern of sap flux density js and measurement azimuthal effect corrected js was adopted to better represent transpiration the results indicate that increased soil moisture and groundwater table during irrigation periods with water flowing in the canal enhance relative js of shelterbelt by 5 5 25 8 from the non irrigation intervals the threshold of groundwater depth 3 6 m is identified beyond which transpiration of the seven year old shelterbelt becomes very low greenbelt transpiration strongly depends on groundwater within the threshold and can be estimated through an exponential function of the ratio of atmospheric demand and groundwater depth besides with the decrease of reference evapotranspiration from june to september the sensitivity of shelterbelt transpiration response to groundwater table depth was increased this study provides necessary information to evaluate farmland shelterbelt transpiration for rational water resource allocation to meet the ecological water requirement in arid areas with shallow groundwater keywords shelterbelt transpiration relative sap flux density canal irrigation water groundwater depth 1 introduction in arid areas limited water

consumption has always been focused for agriculture and ecological sustainable development chang et al 2006 shen et al 2015a 2015b furthermore shelterbelts are widely planted around the world such as the great plains shelterbelt project in the usa the great dam engineering project in north africa countries and the three north shelterbelt program in china wu et al 2019 the global shelterbelt

plant water use an experiment carried out in the uk indicated that saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity were increased significantly in the shelterbelts comparing to pasture which reduced runoff and flood hazard carroll et al 2004 whereas the competition for water and nutrient resources between shelterbelts and farmlands should not be negligible qiao et al 2016 it is prone to reduce crop yield next to shelterbelts kowalchuk and de jong 1995 higher microbial biomass and nitrogen mineralization rates are found in the shelterbelt soil wojewoda and russel 2003 and nitrate concentrations decreases with the distance from tree belt qiao et al 2016 in addition estimates of heat balances in the agricultural landscape have shown that intercepted energy by shelterbelts is more than cultivated fields during the growing season it s partly attributed to a reflection of lower albedo in shelterbelts than other ecosystems due to difference in plant cover ryszkowski and kędziora 1987 shelterbelts water use could be 40 more than cultivated fields partly because of heat advection processes transferred from farmlands to shelterbelts ryszkowski 1989 ryszkowski and kędziora 2007 a certain amount of water is needed to support shelterbelts growth depending on specific situations pine transpiration in humid temperate region is no more than 1 85 mm d 1 and only reached a total of 176 4 mm from may to november vincke and thiry 2008 the transpiration of tree belts that comprises of four eucalyptus species in western australia is 440 mm over a 12 month period white et al 2002 populus gansuensis shelter belt transpiration ranges from 1 7 to 5 6 mm d 1 in the heihe river basin of northwest china chang et al 2006 similar result suggests the average value of shelterbelts stand transpiration is about 4 8 mm d 1 and total stand transpiration exceeds 590 mm for two years in arid inland region shen et al 2015a in arid areas with shallow groundwater understanding the contribution to shelterbelt transpiration from the saturated and unsaturated zones is complex due to the hydraulic connection land covers and subsurface characteristics shah et al 2007 the increasing proportion of groundwater consumption is found to meet trees water demand during the drought periods miller et al 2010 pinto et al 2014 shen et al 2015 vincke and thiry 2008 yin et al 2015 the phenomenon is verified by two partial root zone drying treatments in pear orchard that capillary contribution from groundwater significantly increased kang et al 2003 stable isotope measurements report that groundwater is the main water resource for tree survival when soil water is low song et al 2016 simulations found that increased groundwater table depth results in the decrease of tree transpiration largely in ejina basin of northwest china zhu et al 2009 whereas it is also found tree transpiration increases with the increasing water table depth at the perennial stream site gazal et al 2006 the heavy precipitation can weaken the dependence of shelterbelt transpiration on groundwater shen et al 2015a in arid environments trees growth response to groundwater variation can be fitted by different function forms huang et al 2019 for a linear response stand condition tree mortality rate increases in floodplain ecosystem and stand transpiration decreases in arid oasis desert ecotone with increasing groundwater depth gonzález et al 2012 shen et al 2015 the curvilinear response is reported in tree ring width index that declines as groundwater depth increases ling et al 2015 canopy dieback in relation to groundwater depth can be described as a sigmoidal function that is a stepwise negative response horton et al 2001a 2001b the influences of groundwater depth on species diversity indices and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi follow the bell shaped response hao et al 2009 jin et al 2011 in these studies according to the responses between vegetation metrics and groundwater depths groundwater depth thresholds or optimal ranges are obtained for ensuring the vegetation restoration or survival hao et al 2009 2010 horton et al 2001a 2001b jin et al 2011 ling et al 2015 therefore groundwater availability and its variations for tree water use or survival exist differences due to species specifics and local site conditions about 5 2 billion m3 per year 1980 2015 water from the yellow river is allocated to agricultural irrigation for hetao plain of china chen et al 2018 however the yellow river water conservancy commission plans to reduce irrigation water division to 4 0 billion m3 each year in future on this basis shelterbelt water consumption is becoming more and more prominent in study area furthermore the previous researches are seldom concerned about the quantitative relationship between groundwater depth and tree transpiration as groundwater contribution could not be measured easily therefore there are still uncertainties about shelterbelt water use especially when canal periodically transports irrigation water resulting in groundwater depth fluctuations significantly in the study populus popularis sap flow was measured in the shelterbelt along an irrigated canal in 2016 and 2017 the specific objectives are to 1 analyze the response of shelterbelt transpiration to groundwater variations caused by irrigation canal water conveyance 2 quantify the possible threshold of groundwater depth for shelterbelt transpiration 3 examine the relationship between shelterbelt transpiration and shallow groundwater under the condition of high potential evapotranspiration demand in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description hetao irrigation district located in the upper reaches of the yellow river in inner mongolia china is an alluvial plain this area is characterized by a typical temperate continental arid climate with small precipitation and high evaporation average annual precipitation is 170 mm and annual pan evaporation 20 cm pan is 2300 mm in the period 2000 2014 average annual temperature is 8 8 c while the maximum and minimum are 23 8 c in july and 12 3 c in january respectively chen et al 2018 usually farmland shelterbelt is arranged along the canal with small grid and narrow belt construction pattern the dominate varieties are populus popularis and populus alba l var pyramidalis the experiment site situated specifically at a typical irrigation canal in yongji sub district hetao irrigation district 41 09ʹ n 107 39ʹ e elevation 1032 m fig 1 the unlined irrigation canal exhibits a trapezoid shape with about 1 5 m of bottom width and 3 m of top width there is one row of tree belt on either side of the canal with the plant spacing of about 2 m the observed tree populus popularis is a deciduous species with sparse canopy slender branches and grey green bark it s characterized of drought resistance and saline tolerance tree belt were measured in 2016 2017 and understory vegetation was sparse the age of the trees was about seven year old and the height was above 10 m 2 2 meteorology soil water and groundwater measurements meteorological conditions such as solar radiation relative humidity air temperature atmospheric pressure and precipitation were monitored through the micrometeorological station which was installed about 500 m away from the experiment site data were collected every 30 min daily reference crop evapotranspiration eto was calculated by penman monteith equation in fao 56 allen et al 1998 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t

depth of 150 cm the measured soil volumetric moisture was calibrated by the gravimetric method undisturbed soil samples were taken from the soil profile in 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm depths with three replications using 100 cm3 cutting ring respectively soil samples were collected to measure soil physical properties of different soil layers i e soil bulk density oven drying method soil moisture

as shown in table 1 groundwater table depth gtd was monitored every 30 min using hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp ma usa gtd was compensated by atmospheric pressure obtained from micrometeorological station the third groundwater well was used to record groundwater fluctuation adjacent to tree belt others were mainly used to monitor canal leakage that was not mentioned in this paper 2 3 sap flow measurement sap flux density js cm3 cm 2 s 1 was measured by thermal dissipation probe sensor tdp30 dynamax inc usa the sensor consists of a special heating wire and two copper constantan thermocouple t type probes with the length of 3 cm and the diameter of 0 12 cm the thermal signal corresponds to temperature difference between the heated probe and unheated probe granier 1985 1987 probes were inserted to the xylem of tree about 1 3 m above the ground the observed part of the tree and probes were wrapped using tinfoil as a shield to prevent solar radiation interference precipitation and other factors disturbance moreover because wounding effect for tree is seldom taken into consideration in calculating js by thermal dissipation method chen et al 2014 pinto et al 2014 shen et al 2015a 2015b steppe et al 2010 wounding effect for probe tree contact was not considered in our study four trees with different diameter at breast height dbh cm were chosen to measure js that was calculated by an empirical equation given in granier 1985 sample trees were in state of rapid growing in two years that dbhs of sampling trees increased linearly with time fig s1 tree sapwood is the passage through which water up taken from roots was transported to leaves as a key parameter and technical problem sapwood area as cm2 was used to calculate individual tree and stand transpiration by js phillips et al 1996 based on the distinction of colors between sapwood and heartwood sapwood width ws cm and as were measured through increment borer haglof inc sweden samplings the relationships between ws vs dbh and as vs dbh through samplings were linearly significant in the shelterbelt p 0 05 fig s2 with the increase of ws in the observation periods of 2016 2017 the relative location of sensing point copper constantan thermocouple to detect temperature in the middle of the probe granier 1987 also changed because of single point measurement fig s3 showed lower values of x ws corresponded to lower js values in a significant way x represents the length of copper constantan thermocouple 1 5 cm that its junction locates in the middle of probe considering the influence of ws change and probe insert direction on the actual js the detailed corrections was given in correction a and b of supplementary material based on the aforementioned correction results of js daily mean sap flux density jm mm3 mm 2 d 1 that represented the average volume of water transporting along sapwood radial profile per unit as per day was finally adopted to use this parameter was different from daily transpiration per unit ground area which was to reduce the calculation error of sap flow i e transpiration caused by the product of js and as in the rapid growth state of trees furthermore in order to exclude as and meteorological factors influences the ratio of jm to eto mm d 1 could be seen as relative sap flux density value jm eto a dimensionless parameter by the unit conversion at the daily scale which was used in the following sections without special explanation 2 4 sensitive index sensitive index λn mm 1 defined as the indicator to describe the response of the difference of jm eto to that of gtd is further applied to evaluate the sensitivity of sap flow to the change in groundwater depth jm eto and gtd during canal non irrigation periods nips of two years were selected to calculate λn as followed 2 λ n δ j m et o n j m et o 1 δ gtd n gtd 1 n 1 where jm eto 1 is the value of relative sap flux density corresponding to minimum groundwater table depth gtd1 in the initial day jm eto n is the value of relative sap flux density corresponding to increasing groundwater table depth gtdn in the next n day 3 results 3 1 variations of environmental factors and jm eto environmental factors including eto precipitation swc and gtd were analyzed over two consecutive growing seasons and 3 day running average results were depicted in fig 2 except precipitation based on the dynamics of gtd and canal flow records we divided the whole observation time into canal irrigation periods ips and nips totally there were four nips and five ips in two years experiments during the observation periods the maximum and minimum of daily eto were 5 45 and 2 36 mm in 2016 6 60 and 2 46 mm in 2017 respectively mean value of eto was 3 87 mm in 2016 and 4 43 mm in 2017 total precipitation was 20 0 and 60 0 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2a the fluctuations of swc and gtd were significantly affected by canal irrigations fig 2b in ips both swc and gtd increased correspondingly and then had a downward trend after ips comparing swc in ips and nips the average increased ratios of swc at 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm depths were 1 92 5 32 8 40 10 24 and 2 47 respectively the temporal variation of swc at each layer for both years was similar swc was almost below field capacity at 0 90 cm soil layer in two years swc at 150 cm depth was close to or greater than field capacity 0 375 m3 m 3 when canal was ponded with irrigation water before september in two years fig 2b canal irrigation leakage led to the gtd rise by about 0 23 0 72 m in two years corresponding to the minimum gtd of 3 19 and 2 74 m in 2016 and 2017 respectively as the water consumption of shelterbelt transpiration gtd had a clear decline trend during the observation periods in the end gtd was downed to about 4 22 m and 4 52 m in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2b besides calculated results indicated that average decrease rate of gtd was about 2 30 cm and 2 26 cm per day during nips for 2016 and 2017 the variation of jm eto in two years was shown in fig 2c for the monitoring periods jm was about 2414 37 and 3392 66 mm3 mm 2 d 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the values of jm in two years seemed to be large which represent the average volume of water transported along sapwood radial profile per unit as per day jm eto of all observed trees had similar variation trend and intensive fluctuation generally jm eto in 2017 average 780 59 was higher than that in 2016 average 638 63 3 2 response of jm eto to gtd under intermittent canal irrigations condition we used data without a 3 day running average to illustrate situ situation in the following text and sections the average results for each nip and ip condition were also listed in table 2 because of the short monitoring period in 2016 there were two ips and one nip for the first ip jul 14 to aug 1 the increase ratio of jm eto was about 15 6 compared with the following nip aug 2 to aug 7 comparing the other four nip ip groups it indicated that jm eto increased by 5 5 25 8 in ips table 2 only the increase ratio for the fourth ip was not significant by independent sample t test at the significance level of 0 05 compared with the other three ips the minimum increase ratio of 5 5 occurred in the fourth nip ip group from jul 4 to jul 28 in 2017 due to several previous rainfall events fig 2a moreover the increment the difference of jm eto or gtd between ip and nip the same below of jm eto didn t vary synchronously with that of gtd table 2 the maximum increment of jm eto and gtd occurred in the fifth and first nip ip groups respectively an exponential decay response for young trees between λn and gtd under canal non irrigations condition was delineated in fig 3 r2 0 37 p 0 001 which meant that we could use λn to deduce the suitable gtd in addition according to the mann kendall monotony trend test when gtd varied between 3 1 and 4 6 m during nips in two years the test statistics showed a decreased trend at the 0 01 test level zc 3 08 z c z 0 01 2 58 at the 99 level this showed that populus popularis transpiration was sensitive to variation in gtd it was attempted to find an abrupt point to elucidate the most sensitive degree of gtd to tree transpiration according to the variation of λn under different gtds by the mann kendall monotony trend test the statistical analysis also showed that 3 6 m depth mark divided the plot into two parts λn first decreased sharply gtd 3 6 m and then was generally stable gtd 3 6 m specifically the independent sample t test suggested significant difference between two parts p 0 001 therefore a threshold of gtd about 3 6 m was identified beyond which λn was averaged about 0 14 mm 1 and relatively steady when gtd fluctuated up and down at 3 6 m due to canal intermittent irrigations comparing with other ips jm eto increased more in the second and fifth ip by 25 8 and 23 0 respectively table 2 therefore the threshold value of gtd clearly distinguished the dependence of shelterbelt transpiration capacity on the increasing of groundwater depth 3 3 relationship between jm with eto and gtd to quantify this connection between shelterbelt transpiration meteorological condition and water availability a simple equation for the relationship between jm with eto and gtd was developed fig 4 eto gtd is a dimensional parameter mm d 1 mm 1 representing the combination effect of the integrated meteorological and water conditions a further explanation for eto gtd is given in the discussion section with shallower groundwater table and larger evaporation demand the increase rate of shelterbelt transpiration became more and more slow the fitted curve illustrated the close relationship between them p 0 001 and the equation explained exponentially 64 of the total variation in shelterbelt transpiration of two years fig 4 the remaining variance may be attributed to the uncertainty in the physiological characteristics such as leaf area index stomata behaviors and individual differences for example in late august and september when gtd was relatively large and eto was small fig 2a and b shelterbelt transpiration declined gradually at late growth stage in order to further explain the variation of shelterbelt transpiration with varying gtd under different potential evapotranspiration demands we calculated monthly mean eto based on the meteorological data of past 10 years fig 5 from june to september the corresponding eto mean 99 confidence interval was 6 21 0 20 6 10 0 20 4 97 0 16 and 3 37 0 14 mm d 1 respectively given the monthly mean eto shelterbelt transpiration was estimated by the fitted equation under the assumed gtd from 1 0 to 5 0 m at a 0 1 m interval it was in common that simulated daily mean sap flux density jsm decreased remarkably with the increase of gtd for every month the jsm had a similar decrease in june average 3895 31 mm3 mm 2 d 1 and july average 3879 61 mm3 mm 2 d 1 due to the very similar eto while the decrease of jsm was more significant in august average 3668 82 mm3 mm 2 d 1 and september average 3155 07 mm3 mm 2 d 1 according to the slope of curves it could be concluded that the smaller eto was more obvious this variation was 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of tree transpiration to groundwater the sensitivity of sap flow to groundwater change differs from tree species and climate conditions which has been investigated in many areas gazal et al 2006 shen et al 2015a 2015b vincke and thiry 2008 in our study the threshold of groundwater was about 3 6 m beyond which the sensitivity of sap flow to the variation of groundwater table was no longer significant fig 3 similar result was found that vegetation status characterized by the seasonal average ndvi responded to groundwater fluctuations apparently when gtd varied between 1 8 and 3 5 m while this phenomenon was not obvious after gtd was deeper than 5 m in the lower heihe river basin characterized by a typical arid inland environment wang et al 2011 based on the physiological response of cellular water potential moderator including proline content superoxide dismutase activity and peroxidase activity to groundwater change in the lower reaches of tarim river the stress depth of groundwater table for phragmites communis tamarix spp and populus euphratica was identified as 3 5 5 and 4 5 m respectively chen et al 2004 through analyzing the quantitative relationships between gtds and tree ring width indices in the same basin the minimum gtd for near mature populus euphratica trees with dbhs 10 20 cm was suggested to be 5 m ling et al 2015 the identified gtd threshold is larger than that of studied populus popularis tree belt with dbhs 12 20 cm within the same dbh scope it s potentially attributed to intermittent canal irrigation activities and tree species characteristics for the semiarid riparian cottonwood forests in southeastern arizona the ratio of tree transpiration to eto declined when gtd was beyond 3 5 m gazal et al 2006 results of distinct non linear responses for e camaldulensis and e populnea canopy condition foliage index to gtd from 118 sites in eastern australia reported that thresholds of gtd ranged from 12 1 to 22 6 m and from 12 6 to 26 7 m respectively kath et al 2014 due to gtd varied greatly and declined steadily over time across the catchment the suitable gtd for tree growth were relatively deeper than our study area where seasonal irrigation activities caused water tables to fluctuate above and below threshold over time however if gtd was 1 m flooded roots may hinder plant growth due to anaerobic condition naumburg et al 2005 li et al 2017 the quantification of the optimal range or threshold of gtd is vital to better understand trees transpiration maintain well growth and conserve groundwater dependent biodiversity 4 2 effect of groundwater on tree transpiration the relationship between tree transpiration and groundwater was emphasized in our study gtd in the hetao area is mainly affected by irrigation water recharge and groundwater evapotranspiration etg direct evaporation and uptake by vegetation roots due to capillary rise and canal leakage accounts for 48 of the annual groundwater recharge in the growth period xu et al 2010 shelterbelt water use is mainly dependent on recharge of groundwater and soil water from canal leakage jm was positively correlated with swc of each layer data were not shown besides the reliance of trees on groundwater increases as soil water decreases lubczynski 2009 canal irrigation water leakage might give a chance for populus popularis roots to easily absorb shallow groundwater in the study the increase ratio of jm eto ranged from 5 5 to 25 8 comparing nips and ips table 2 this could be attributed to the enhanced contribution of shallow groundwater after irrigations furthermore it was found that rainfall increased tree transpiration comparing to its value pre rainfall wang et al 2017 zhao and liu 2010 and decreased the dependence of tree sap flow on groundwater but groundwater and irrigation are still the critical water resources for shelterbelt trees shen et al 2015a similarly some literatures have reported that deeper groundwater depth could weaken tree s transpiration gazal et al 2006 shen et al 2015a 2015b xi et al 2017 groundwater depth condition increased from 2 to 6 m and decreased the ratio of groundwater subsidy to root water uptake for populus euphratica from 60 3 to 47 5 li et al 2017 the root water uptake by populus euphratica under the increase of gtd condition from 2 to 3 m caused a 74 reduction of tree transpiration according to simulation settings zhu et al 2009 the decline of groundwater table caused by anthropogenic activities such as over pumping would significantly decrease groundwater contribution on tree water use yin et al 2015 a related study found that fine root distribution of shelterbelt adjacent to irrigation channel was mainly in the 1 4 2 0 m and 0 0 4 m soil layer xiao and huang 2016 the maximum rooting depth of tree belt could reach about 3 2 m deep shen et al 2014 in our study the minimum gtd was 3 19 m in 2016 and 2 74 m in 2017 correspondingly fig 2b it possibly provides evidence that tree roots are capable of meeting its water demand by directly extracting groundwater furthermore at least 22 of tree water use is directly from groundwater via root clump it should be subordinated to taproot system and if additional roots have accessed water table the percentage of groundwater contribution will be greater doody and benyon 2011 however groundwater decline may decouple tree roots from accessible water resources naumburg et al 2005 these results suggest that trees transpiration is vulnerable to groundwater fluctuation the contribution of saturated zone to trees evapotranspiration is estimated by etg the magnitude of etg depended upon gtd and atmospheric conditions in water limited environments lubczynski 2009 etg is generally suggested to decay with increasing gtd gonzález et al 2012 kath et al 2014 shah et al 2007 shen et al 2015 when actual evapotranspiration and etg are difficult to be obtained in the shelterbelt the ratio of eto characterizing potential evapotranspiration demand to gtd is a suitable parameter which can reflect how tree transpiration responses to the integrated microclimatic and water supply conditions in this study an exponential relationship existed between shelterbelt transpiration and the ratio of eto to gtd fig 4 similarly ryszkowski and kędziora 2007 also got an exponential relationship between the share of water uptake from saturated zone in total real evapotranspiration and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to gtd in the shelterbelts of poland the results indicate that the warmer weather and shallower gtd more water is absorbed from saturated zone for forest land the exponential decay function explained the decline of potential evapotranspiration and etg with increasing gtd which was verified well by field data shah et al 2007 without stable isotopes measurements and numerical model simulations the fitted function could be used to directly evaluate the connection between shallow groundwater and tree transpiration in the paper it suggested shelterbelt would absorb groundwater to meet transpiration demand as much as possible but how much the contribution of groundwater exists uncertainty due to the complicated hydraulic connection in unsaturated and saturated zones especially in riparian zones and water limited areas lubczynski 2009 besides the horizontal leakage loss from canal irrigation increases the complexity of water migration to some extent canal leakage water alleviates the water consumption of shelterbelt from originally stored groundwater and avoids excessive decline of groundwater depth 5 conclusions in this study we modified the calculation method of js considering the radial distribution pattern and insertion directions from two years field observation experiments then the calculated shelterbelt transpiration and its response to gtd variation were analyzed the increased shallow groundwater table and soil water resulting from canal leakage during ips increased shelterbelt transpiration by 5 5 25 8 and shelterbelt transpiration could be estimated exponentially under the influence of gtd and eto r2 0 64 according to this relationship a further simulation result indicated that when eto became smaller from june to september the decline rate of jsm with gtd increased in addition the threshold of gtd for shelterbelt transpiration was identified as 3 6 m beyond which the sensitivity of the response of jm to gtd was weaken and became steady in arid areas where agriculture production relies on irrigation canal leakage resulting in shallow groundwater table is beneficial to tree transpiration especially for young trees at rapid growth stage the results will be useful to better understand the interaction between tree transpiration and groundwater depth without biometric measurement although the corrections of sap flow proved valid for young trees in this study it should also be determined if they are applicable for other species specifically the method and qualitative summaries will provide important information and guidance for young tree transpiration in similar area with shallow groundwater however our analyses were mainly focused on individual tree scale and based on current available data on the basis of present experimental study the threshold of gtd was found with statistical difference it s essential to further confirm the phenomenon by collecting more samples moreover the future research on the response of shelterbelt transpiration to gtd still need to combine with biological indexes and scale up to stand scale or regional scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5036,canopy conductance g c is a crucial variable in accurately estimating latent heat flux and evapotranspiration et over vegetated surfaces g c is highly dependent on the plant species and the surrounding environment consequently it is difficult to accurately simulate g c using a simplified universal model a number of empirical parameters and functional forms have been introduced to appropriately account for various plant species this study examines the efficacy of a widely adopted g c model and penman monteith pm approach over a selection of vegetated sites in arid and semi arid regions of china to investigate the factors that influence the accuracy of the model comprehensive micrometeorological and land surface monitoring datasets from eight eddy covariance ec stations in the hei and hai river basins were used for our analysis e t calculated from a widely used surface conductance and pm method was compared with ec measurements and the residuals of the comparison were analyzed with factors potentially influencing the residuals using their correlations and regression coefficients to identify factors accounting for the errors caused via g c the results showed that the vapor pressure deficit and the maximum stomatal conductance g s m are most significantly correlated with uncertainties in g c for all plant species the g c error vs vapor pressure deficit exhibited distinctive sensitivities among the c3 crop grass c4 crop and c3 tree groups the maximum stomatal conductance showed variation with the leaf age reaching the maximum level in the mid growth stage for most types of plant species except for coniferous trees the residuals increased with radiation levels for sites covered with trees which appeared to be caused by the decreasing trend of the stomatal conductance vs radiation at high radiation levels for trees finally we propose potential methods of improving canopy conductance models based on our error analysis keywords canopy conductance influencing factors vapor pressure deficit maximum stomatal conductance 1 introduction accurate evapotranspiration e t estimates are required in water resource management irrigation management and hydrological studies ershadi et al 2015 to date a range of models have been developed to estimate e t across different spatial and temporal scales which include empirical models glenn et al 2008a 2008b jung et al 2010 and physically based models utilizing the residual of surface energy balance allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 kustas and anderson 2009 su 2002 wu et al 2020 or the penman monteith pm method cleugh et al 2007 monteith 1965 penman 1948 xu et al 2018a for most of these models surface conductance g s is an important parameter that directly influences the estimating accuracy of e t canopy conductance g c as an upscaled parameter from the stomatal conductance g s of a leaf functions effectively as g s when vegetation covers most of the underlying surface thus soil evaporation can be neglected an accurate estimation of g c is highly important in understanding the water and carbon cycles of terrestrial ecosystems bai et al 2018 several g c or g s models have been implemented for e t estimation jarvis 1976 and other researchers considered the g s of illuminated leaves as a function of the current levels of quantum flux density temperature vapor pressure deficit v p d leaf water potential and ambient carbon dioxide c o 2 concentration a conceptual model was then proposed based on field measurements to link g s to all these variables many researchers cleugh et al 2007 li et al 2014 2016 mu et al 2007 2011 noilhan and planton 1989 song et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 have modified the functional forms of influencing factors and added additional factors to a jarvis type model the model is relatively simple and useful in practical applications to interpret the response of stomata to environmental factors radiation v p d air temperature and soil moisture however the jarvis type model is developed empirically based on field observations without considering the physiological mechanisms of plants thus limiting its applications with various plant types potential environmental factor interactions and their effects on stomata are excluded bai et al 2018 based on the concept that carbon and water fluxes are inherently linked ball et al 1987 found a linear correlation between g s and net photosynthesis rate p n when the photosynthetic capacity of leaves was altered by growing conditions the relationship is more similar to that of an empirical model and comes with errors during application leuning 1995 then tried to improve the model by substituting humidity with a hyperbolic function of v p d and by adding a c o 2 compensation point to account for the influence of varying air humidity and low concentration values of c o 2 on et the carbon water coupling model was applied and various aspects have been improved by a large number of researchers cox et al 1998 gimeno et al 2019 liu et al 2017 medlyn et al 2011 for example kelliher et al 1995 regarded g c as an integration of all leaves of a canopy based on the understanding that radiation attenuates gradually within the canopy and thus leaves in different positions absorb different amounts of radiation resulting in different g s values the model takes the canopy structure into consideration while consisting of fewer factors of influence than the jarvis type model leuning et al 2008 calibrated the parameters of the model and applied it to the pm method for g s estimation in addition the maximum stomatal conductance g s m is a hypothetical variable needed when plants are under conditions of sufficient sunlight and soil moisture as well as an appropriate humidity and air temperature wang et al 2020 proposed to substitute the prescribed maximum transpiration rate e m a x similar to the definition of g s m with potential et that allows for a dynamic potential rate to be deducted for actual transpiration estimations at every time step murray et al 2019 carried out g s measurements for c3 woody angiosperm in 19 sites across 7 bioclimatic zones and found a general convergence of g s m across species at the understory subcanopy habitat while a significant difference in g s m between species at the open canopy habitat most previous studies however assumed the g s m to be a constant for each type of vegetation during its whole growing stage which can be problematic in a realistic estimation of canopy conductance and e t most models estimate g c or g s based on a simple principle that consists of environmental factors with appropriate formulas according to the climatic condition and underlying surface that they are concerned about parameters and functions associated with specific areas and land uses are fitted with field measurements or are referred to others however the functions of the factors in these models were described in different forms even though a similar theoretical basis was used and only a few studies displayed the relationship of several factors to g c or g s with simple scatter plots at the specific site stomatal character varies with different plants and their different growth stages in different climatic areas which results in application errors of these models to different degrees tie et al 2017 discussed the physiological controls on sap flow based plant transpiration using satellite derived leaf area index lai liu et al 2018 showed that stomatal characteristics were associated with plant functional groups and climate at a regional scale for forests using measured stomatal traits for 737 plant species from nine forests ranging from tropical to cold temperature forests in china this finding demonstrates a need for incorporating more detailed plant information climate conditions and land use types into g c or g s for quantitative modeling the errors in existing models need to be further examined and possibly reduced by modifying the functional forms of influencing factors or by incorporating additional information this study aims to investigate factors that influence the uncertainty of g c for different types of plants when some widely adopted models are used we use field observations over eight eddy covariance ec stations which are distributed in arid and semi arid areas and include six typical plant types in northern china the following section describes the data source and methods used for analysis based on the analyses above the objectives are to i identify the factors that accounting for the uncertainty of the existing g c model ii analyze the relationship between influencing factors and canopy conductance and quantify the contribution of these factors in the uncertainty iii explore the parameterization of g s m using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi for various plant species and iv propose potential methods of improving existing g c models based on error analysis 2 materials and methods in this study g s estimates were first calculated based on daily ec measurements by rearranging the pm method crop phenological periods were extracted from a satellite based ndvi time series to approximately identify g c and further conduct data analysis e t was calculated from a widely used surface conductance model and pm method and are then compared to the ec measurements the residual was calculated as the absolute distance between the observed and estimated e t spearman s rank correlation coefficient and regression analysis were then carried out to identify the contribution of influencing factors to model residuals individual analyses between influencing factors and residuals were carried out for each site to further clarify the variation in residuals with the factors the data and methods used in the analysis above will be described in detail in later sections 2 1 flux and meteorological sites in this study five experimental sites located in the hei river basin and three sites located in the hai river basin were selected for analysis fig 1 shows the location of the experimental sites and a summary of the details is provided in table 1 the hai river basin is located in the north china plain and has a typical semi humid and semi arid climate with an apparent cycle of four seasons the guantao gt huailai hl and miyun my sites are located from south to north of the basin the gt site is cultivated with winter wheat gt w and summer maize gt m hl and my are cultivated with spring maize and orchards respectively the hei river basin is located in northwest china and represents a typical arid area surrounded by deserts with little precipitation the arou ar and guantan sites are located upstream of the basin and covered by alpine grass and spruce the daman dm and zhangye zy sites are located in the middle oasis of the basin and covered by spring maize and reeds the sidaoqiao sdq site is located downstream of the basin and covered with tamarix sites in the hei river basin have higher altitudes and lower temperatures than sites in the hai river basin the land cover maps of the two basins displayed in fig 1 are derived from chinacover wu et al 2017a for each site a tower equipped with ec and an automatic weather station aws was installed the ec tower heights for all crop grass sites range from 3 5 to 5 2 m except for the gt site which is 15 6 m as for sites covered by tree ec was equipped at 8 m height at the sdq site and at more than 20 m height at the both guantan and my sites a time series of energy flux and meteorological variable observations at a half hourly scale were obtained for further analysis including net radiation r n w m 2 soil heat flux g w m 2 latent heat flux l e w m 2 sensible heat flux h w m 2 wind speed w s m s 1 air temperature t a c relative humidity r h pressure kpa and soil moisture θ m3 m 3 the data corrupted by sensor malfunction or precipitation were discarded via a quality control process data gaps were filled with the mean diurnal variations method for flux data falge et al 2001 and with interpolation for other meteorological data the processed 30 min interval data were then averaged to daily data for latter simulation and analysis the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux tended to be underestimated due to the imbalance of ec caused by advection effects which was manifested as h l e r n g as shown in fig 2 the selected sites for this study suffer from energy imbalance to different degrees the gt dm and sdq sites exhibited preferable conditions with an energy balance ratio ebr defined as h l e r n g above 0 7 the hl my and guantan sites were relatively poor in energy balance with ebr values below 0 6 for further analysis with reasonable energy fluxes we applied the bowen ratio h l e closure method to correct h and l e twine et al 2000 by assuming that the bowen ratio is correct the principle of the method was used to divide the available energy r n g into h and l e according to the bowen ratio 2 2 vegetation index in this study the plant growth stage significantly affected the g c and g s m therefore the ndvi values were acquired to quantify plant growth and to identify different growth stages for each site the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis provides a daily overpass at approximately the same local time and can provide a time series of multispectral surface reflectance the mod09ga product covers daily surface reflectance with a 500 meter spatial resolution from visible to thermal infrared bands that are preprocessed including radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and geometric correction we selected reflectance in the red and near infrared bands bands 1 and 2 to calculate a time series n d v i and extracted values of the pixel that included the flux tower at each site poor quality n d v i data filtered by the cloud mask included in the product were discarded and filled by a linear temporal interpolation method all n d v i time series data after quality control were smoothed by a modified savitzky golay sg filter which is widely used for filtering a time series of remote sensing data chen et al 2004 fig 3 shows the filtered n d v i data and smoothed n d v i time series for each site which is highly correlated to plant growth 2 3 soil texture and property soil moisture is the source of plant transpiration and affects the water stress condition of plants hence their stomata behavior for a given soil moisture content the actual water volume available for plant growth varies widely depending on the soil therefore we use the available water content a w c to quantify the soil water content in this study a w c is calculated using the difference between the soil moisture θ and wilting point θ w divided by the difference between field capacity θ c and wilting point θ w as follows 1 awc θ θ w θ c θ w where θ c m3 m 3 and θ w m3 m 3 are determined by soil texture in this study we collected soil texture data from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn the sandy silt and clay fractions were extracted from the soil texture data for each site and then their soil types were determined according to the international system of soil texture classification peng et al 2015 the soil property values are described in chen and dudhia 2001 2 4 derived surface conductance by rearranging the pm method half hourly and daily g s can be derived using measured energy fluxes and meteorological variables from the ec and aws the rearrangement of the pm method is as follows 2 g s g a γ l e δ a ρ c p v p d g a l e δ γ where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of the curve that relates the saturation water vapor pressure to temperature kpa c 1 a is the available energy absorbed by the surface net absorbed radiation r n g w m 2 ρ is the density of air kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure j kg 1 k 1 vpd is vapor pressure deficit kpa and g a is the aerodynamic conductance mm s 1 in this study g a was calculated regardless of the stability conditions of the surface layer where u is the ws z is the height of the wind m k is von karman s constant 0 41 d is the zero plane displacement height m and z o m and z o v are the roughness lengths governing the transfer of momentum and water vapor m respectively following the fao 56 methodology d z o m and z o v were estimated through d 2 h 3 z o m 0 123 h z o v 0 1 z o m respectively where h is plant height allen et al 1998 3 g a k 2 u ln z d z om ln z d z ov 2 5 surface conductance model leuning et al 2008 regarded the total surface e t as the sum of transpiration from the plant canopy e t c and the bare soil evaporation e t s using separate versions of the pm method for e t and e t c respectively and the assumption that e t s occurs at some fraction f s of the equilibrium rate the equation can be written as 4 δ a ρ c p v p d g a δ γ 1 g a g s δ a c ρ c p v p d g a δ γ 1 g a g c f s δ a s δ γ the fraction of the total available energy absorbed by the canopy a c and by the soil a s are given by a c a 1 τ and a s a τ respectively where τ e x p k a l a i and k a is an extinction coefficient for available energy and l a i is the leaf area index m2 m 2 with these definitions a framework of g

developed an expression for canopy conductance in terms of maximum stomatal conductance l a i and absorbed shortwave radiation the expression was modified by adding the stomatal conductance response to the humidity deficit thus canopy conductance can be modeled as follows 6 g c gsm k q l n q h q 50 q h exp k q l a i q 50 1 1 v p d d 50 where k q is the extinction coefficient for shortwave radiation q h is the visible radiation flux at the top of the canopy w m 2 q 50 is the visible radiation flux when stomatal conductance is half its maximum value w m 2 and d 50 is the humidity deficit at which the stomatal conductance is half of its maximum value kpa a surface conductance model was acquired by coupling eqs 5 and 6 and was named the l model this model is used for further analyses 2 6 analytical methods to assess the performance of the surface conductance model the model was applied to nine phenological periods at eight sites a portion of the in situ measurements within each period was selected randomly for model calibration and the rest were selected for validation e t was estimated by combining the surface conductance model and pm method and was compared to the ec measurements note that the derived g s was calculated by rearranging the pm method eq 2 thus the discrepancy between the estimated e t and ec measurements was assumed to represent the deficiency of the surface conductance model in practical applications on the basis of the existing surface conductance model this study analyses the model error residual against factors that may influence g c to find the cause of uncertainty in the g c model e t was calculated from combined l model and pm method and then residuals were calculated as the absolute distance between the estimated e t and ec measurements the residuals were induced by the difference between the derived g s and simulated g s a series of methods were adopted in the analyses including plant phenology extractions correlation coefficients regression analyses and evaluation indices parameters should be calibrated within each site before applying models in this study the g s m and f s were optimized by minimizing the cost function f as shown in the following equation the generalized pattern search algorithm in matlab the mathworks inc was used for optimization e c j and e t j are the j t h ec measurement and estimated e t calculated from the l model e c is the arithmetic mean of ec measurements and n is the number of samples the other parameters that embedded in the l model also matter the model performance including k a k q q 50 and d 50 however leuning et al 2008 found that g s is relatively insensitive to these four parameters and the model performance showed only minor degradation when these four parameters were hold constant moreover the optimized values for d 50 were almost identical across different sites in their study therefore we referred to the constant values according to their study for these four parameters in the l model 7 f j n ec j et j 2 j n ec j ec 2 during the plant phenological period vegetation accounts more than soil especially in the peak of growth the trend of g c is similar to that of g s during the period due to a small fraction of soil conductance moreover g s can be regarded as g c during the peak of growth resulting from highly covered vegetation therefore g s during the plant phenological period is treated as g c for further analysis in this study the plant phenological period for species within each experimental site was extracted using the n d v i r a t i o wu et al 2017b the n d v i r a t i o is calculated as equation 8 the n d v i m a x and n d v i m i n are the seasonal maximum and minimum n d v i values respectively a threshold of 0 5 that is referred to wu et al 2017b is used to determine the start and end of the plant phenological period fig 4 shows the extracted phenological periods for each site 8 ndvi ratio ndvi ndvi min ndvi max n d v i min correlation coefficients can be used to directly assess the relationship between two variables spearman s rank correlation coefficient assesses monotonic relationships and is more suitable for variables with nonlinear functions compared to the pearson correlation coefficient accompanied by significance testing variables with significant correlation can be identified as the target variable regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables linear regression is the most common form of regression analysis in which a linear function is found to fit the data according to a specific mathematical criterion regression analysis can be used to infer the relationship between independent and dependent variables the significance test is applied to identify significantly correlated factors meteorological factors including the net radiation air temperature ws pressure and v p d the n d v i and the a w c were selected for correlation and regression analyses to demonstrate the role of variable g s m in improving the model performance for g c simulation the parameterization of g s m with ndvi was carried out based on their relationship in latter analyses this study firstly explored the potential of parameterized methods of variable g s m by plotting the relationship between calibrated g s m and ndvi in latter sections subsequently the non linear relationships between g s m and ndvi were established for different plant species according to the results in g s m ndvi plots two types of fitting functions related to exponential function were adopted for the relationships between g s m and ndvi the description of the functions is presented as follows where a b and c are empirical parameters that needed to be calibrated in the fitting process 9 gsm 1 a e x p b n d v i c 10 gsm a e x p b n d v i for the quantitative analysis of model performance two evaluation indices were selected the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to provide a measure of consistency between the estimation and observation a root mean square error r m s e is usually used to measure the average difference between estimation and observation 3 results 3 1 model performance fig 5 shows the validation of the e t results that are estimated from the l model coupled with the pm method the performance of the l model coupled with the pm method varies across the sites the model shows the best performance at the ar site according to r 2 and r m s e while the model shows considerable error between the estimated results and measurements at the guantan site for the gt w hl dm zy and sdq sites the model performs well with an r 2 above 0 8 and an r m s e below 0 9 mm d 1 the gt m site model performs slightly worse than the models of the above sites regarding the site in my the model performs poorly with e t l vs e t m e a s featuring wider scatters than those for other sites the poor model performance for this site may be partly due to the obvious energy imbalance as shown in fig 2 in addition relatively complicated advection effects at this site limit the applicability of the model and magnify the deficiencies of model construction the residuals between the estimated results and measurements reflect the deficiency in the surface conductance model including the incorrect functional structure of influencing factors or the absence of necessary factors for the guantan and sdq sites however the transpiration from the understory canopy and soil evaporation play certain roles in the total et even during the growing season since the derivation of the framework of g s considers the contribution from vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation the neglect of understory et can lead to underestimated estimates of the total et on the other hand the models in this study were calibrated with the measured et based on all sources the optimized values of parameters ensure the best consistency between estimated et and measured et therefore the residuals at the guantan and sdq sites can be largely attributed to the uncertainty of the g c model and partly due to the neglect of the understory et in the framework of g s as demonstrated in leuning et al 2008 the g s m and f s are two key parameters that greatly influence the model results and cannot be set to constant values across species or sites fig 6 shows the values of the g s m and f s from both models for each site fig 6a shows that the maximum stomatal conductance ranges between 4 and 16 mm s 1 for various vegetation types with the l model the guantan and sdq sites show low g s m values for the coniferous tree grass at the ar site and wheat at the gt site have high g s m values for maize sites in the hai river basin including gt m and hl the g s m values are very similar ranging between 4 and 8 mm s 1 while another maize site dm in the hei river basin shows a higher g s m value the soil evaporation parameter f s reflects the water availability of each site to reduce soil evaporation below the equilibrium rate the f s values of both models are similar and reasonable with values lower than 0 3 for dry climate in the guantan and sdq sites fig 6b 3 2 correlation between the potential influencing factors and model residuals in further analysis the residuals between ec measurements and estimated results calculated from the l model and pm method were analyzed against potential influencing factors to indicate the source of error and the accurate response of influencing factors to g s spearman s rank correlation coefficients between residuals and potential influencing factors during the plant phenological period were determined results with a correlation significance at the 0 05 level p 0 05 are regarded as the main influencing factors of residuals and are displayed in fig 7 the directions of correlation are indicated in different colors red indicates a positive correlation while blue indicates a negative correlation as shown in the figure the ar site shows no significant correlation between residuals and factors because of the high consistency between the estimated e t and ec measurements the v p d is significantly and positively correlated to residuals for all sites except at the ar and zy sites while the n d v i is significantly and negatively correlated to residuals for all sites except at the ar and guantan sites net radiation shows a significant positive correlation with residuals at the my guantan and sdq sites awc is significantly negatively correlated with residuals at the hl my and sdq sites in addition air temperature also shows a significant correlation with residuals at some sites however regarding the high correlation between the air temperature and v p d the influence of air temperature may repeat that of v p d thus in reality the air temperature may not have a great influence to further analyze the relationship between residuals and potential influencing factors and identify the dominant factors in influencing residuals we fit the residuals vs observations to a multiple linear regression model of standardized factors the z score of each and evaluated the influence of individual factors by analyzing the regression coefficients standard coefficients or beta coefficients the use of z scores for the potential influencing factors ensures that the regression coefficients represent the sensitivity of residuals to each of the factors while remaining unaffected by their units and dynamic ranges table 2 shows the beta coefficients of each factor for each site and the significant values are indicated the v p d and n d v i coefficients are significant for more than half of the sites which is a similar phenomenon compared with that observed for the spearman s coefficients specifically the beta coefficients of v p d are positive and significant for all sites except at the ar and sdq sites while the beta coefficients of n d v i are significant at the gt m dm zy and sdq sites with negative values the beta coefficient of net radiation is significant at the my and sdq sites moreover the awc values at the guantan dm and sdq sites also play a role in influencing residuals as shown by their beta coefficients in terms of the comparison between coefficients the value of the vpd coefficient is larger than the other coefficient values at 5 sites including the gt w hl my guantan and dm sites however the n d v i dominates the variation in residuals at the gt m and zy sites therefore the v p d and n d v i are the most important factors that influence residuals which also suggests that the application of the l model has a deficiency in expressing the influence of these two factors the accurate responses of the v p d and n d v i to canopy conductance remain unclear when applying the l model across various types of species furthermore the net radiation air temperature and awc also contribute to residuals at some sites 3 3 analysis between the dominant influencing factors and canopy conductance fig 8 shows the correlation between the residuals and standardized v p d during the plant phenological period additionally the growth stage is indicated by a cumulative n d v i linear regression and significance tests were carried out to quantify the variation in residuals with increasing v p d except at the ar and zy sites most sites display positive trends between the residuals and v p d suggesting that the model has an apparent error when applied under high vpd conditions gt w is cultivated with winter crops and shows high residuals when the v p d is high in the harvesting stage furthermore high residuals of summer plants tend to occur at the initial or mid growth stage rather than the harvesting stage according to the cumulative n d v i when the v p d is high fig 9 shows the correlation between the canopy conductance and v p d in this study at each site the canopy conductance at different sites generally follows a decreasing trend with increasing v p d however the canopy conductance vs vpd presents fairly distinctive clusters when viewed site by site the gt w site is cultivated with winter wheat and the canopy conductance rapidly decreases in a linear form with an increase in v p d the gt m and hl sites have a similar relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d while the my site is similar to a combination of the gt w and gt m or hl sites the ar site is located in a high altitude more than 3000 m mountain region with low air temperature showing a similar distribution as the gt w site in terms of the relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d the v p d is higher at the zy site than the ar site and the relationship is more dispersed the canopy conductance at dm site ranges from 0 to 20 mm s 1 and vpd ranges from 0 to 2 kpa the relationships at the guantan and sdq sites are entirely different from any other site the canopy conductance at the guantan site decreases from approximately 12 mm s 1 at a low v p d to almost 0 mm s 1 at a vpd of 1 3 kpa for the sdq site the canopy conductance is near constant when the v p d varies from 1 to 3 kpa the residuals are below 2 mm d 1 at most sites except at the my and guantan sites to show differences between species we grouped the sites into three categories c3 crop grass c4 maize and c3 tree as shown in fig 10 c3 crop grass generally has higher canopy conductance than those of the others c4 maize and c3 tree are similar in terms of the response shape between the canopy conductance and v p d while c4 maize has more dispersed points the residual distribution of c3 tree is clearly higher than those of other plants the n d v i is another important factor that is correlated with residuals and influences canopy conductance fig 11 shows the correlation between the residuals and n d v i z score and accompanied with linear regression and a significance test in general residuals remain high when the n d v i is relatively low which is the period before or after the mid growth stage however the relationship between the residuals and standardized n d v i is insignificant at the hl my and ar sites the variation in residuals is heteroscedastic at some sites n d v i can generally represent plant growth conditions and the variation in leaf area in the l model the l a i is derived from the n d v i and serves as the scale parameter between stomatal conductance and canopy conductance the g s m value represents the maximum stomatal conductance and is greatly correlated to plant growth conditions and stages considering the g s m to be constant for the entire growing period in the l model may result in error in the estimation in this study we acquired the daily g s m for each site by calibrating the l model once a day using continuous 30 min interval data the results were plotted against the n d v i and the plots were colored using the cumulative n d v i to represent growth stages fig 12 the analysis of the relationship between the g s m and n d v i shows different results from that in zhang et al 2010 which calculated maximum canopy conductance from a simple canopy conductance model and treated it as a sigmoid function for various types of species with several empirical parameters for most species across sites in this study the g s m generally follows an increased response with an increasing n d v i however the relationship between the derived g s m and n d v i for various plant species shows distinct differences among each other these differences reflect variations in plant traits and environmental conditions among different plant species the relationship between the g s m and n d v i at the gt w ar and zy sites displays similar forms of variation and the highest gsm levels during the mid growth stages the g s m value increases rapidly at low n d v i values and levels off when the n d v i is high suggesting the g s m changes quickly in the initial and harvesting stages while tending to be stable in the mid growth stage for sites with the same crop such as at the gt m and hl sites the same functional form of the relationship is expressed which shows slow increases in the g s m during the initial and harvesting stages the dm site has the same crop type and a similar functional form of the relationship as those at the gt m and hl sites but shows differences in the maximum level of g s m sites with trees show an entirely different relationship between the g s m and n d v i compared with the relationships from other sites especially for coniferous trees in the guantan and sdq sites the value of g s m at the sdq site reaches an optimized level in the initial stage and then decreases before remaining nearly constant for the rest of the phenological period the value of g s m at the guantan site shows a similar relationship to that at the sdq site but has a difference in the harvesting stage the g s m value at the guantan site displays an increase in the harvesting stage 3 4 analysis between the radiation and awc and the canopy conductance net radiation displays positive beta coefficients in the regression of residuals for most sites and shows a significant correlation with residuals at the my guantan and sdq sites in fig 7 and table 2 suggesting that the model produces more error with increasing net radiation we plotted the residuals against the net radiation z score to further analyze the relationship between the net radiation and residuals as fig 13 reveals the my guantan and sdq sites show significant correlations between the residuals and net radiation with residuals generally following an increasing trend as the net radiation increases the residuals reach the highest level when plants receive high net radiation in addition residuals at other sites show little correlation with net radiation which means the net radiation contributes little to the residuals at these sites fig 14 shows the distribution of derived g s g s m with the net radiation during the mid growth stage indicated by the cumulative n d v i at a half hourly scale at each site accompanied by the distribution of the estimated g s g s m with the net radiation during the mid growth stage plants reach their optimum and stable growth conditions plant growth has little influence on transpiration and canopy conductance radiation serves as the most dominant factor driving other meteorological variables and plant physiological conditions including the canopy conductance and stomatal conductance in the derivation of the l model the stomatal conductance is a nonlinear function of radiation and is upscaled to the canopy conductance based on the extinction of radiation within the canopy kelliher et al 1995 however fig 14 shows that the canopy conductance at the my guantan and sdq sites is proportional to the net radiation in the beginning but tends to be stable or even decrease slightly at high net radiation levels which differs from the estimated performance results from the l model and may cause error for other sites the canopy conductance generally increases with increasing net radiation and the response shapes are almost identical suggesting the response of canopy conductance to radiation generally follows the similar trend for herbaceous plant the relationships of canopy conductance vs net radiation for these sites also show difference from the estimated performance to varying degrees furthermore the relationship between the canopy conductance and radiation is closer to being linear than nonlinear at the gt w site soil water is the source of the transpiration of plants and may influence the stomatal behavior and canopy conductance many studies treat soil water as a linearly correlated factor in modeling canopy conductance while the l model does not couple it into estimation we plotted the residuals against the awc z score to analyze the potential of the awc factor in improving the l model the zy site is a wetland and has no soil moisture measurements as shown in fig 15 the linear coefficients between the residuals and awc z score show significance at the gt w hl my guantan and sdq sites in addition the residuals all follow a decreasing trend with increasing awc suggesting that error tends to occur under dry conditions at these sites we plotted the observed g s against awc for each site and the cumulative n d v i was used to indicate growth stages fig 16 for most sites the awc remains high during the initial and mid growth stages and generally declines in the harvesting stage the canopy conductance varies with awc at several sites based on a specific functional form including at the gt w gt m hl guantan dm and sdq sites the relationship shows that canopy conductance increases rapidly at the beginning of the increase in awc and levels off when the awc exceeds a specific threshold the relationship is somewhat similar to the relationship between the evaporative fraction and awc however the relationship can be better explained by the growth of plants than by the variation in awc the awc always remains high in the initial stage while the canopy conductance is low due to the limitation of the growth stage 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the response of canopy conductance between plant types the relationships between residuals and influencing factors vary for different plant types resulting in different canopy conductance responses to the factors that influence them plant traits and climate conditions may be responsible for these differences the winter crop at the gt site experiences different meteorological conditions during the growing season compared with the meteorological conditions of other summer plants previous studies have reported that stomatal conductance or canopy conductance tends to decrease with increasing v p d baker et al 2007 conaty et al 2014 duursma et al 2013 the l model also adopts the above conclusion and expresses the vpd response with a hyperbolic form leuning 1995 lohammar et al 1980 furthermore the parameter d 50 in a hyperbolic form is insensitive to estimated results and can be set as a constant for various types of species leuning et al 2008 nevertheless the v p d is one of the factors highly correlated to the residuals analyzed in this study as fig 7 and table 2 show the residuals of a winter crop gt w exhibit significant correlation with the vpd and the error mainly occurs in the harvest stage when the crop is fully mature and the vpd is high unlike summer crops the vpd in winter remains low and increases gradually when crops revive in spring fig 17 the canopy conductance decreases rapidly with the v p d and follows a linear pattern rather than a hyperbolic trend fig 9 as a result of the high altitude and relatively low air temperature and v p d the ar site displays a similar relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d as the winter crop the growth period of the winter crop is in late winter and early spring with a relatively low and stable v p d while the crop is ready for harvesting in late spring or early summer with an increased v p d therefore the influence of the growth stage on the canopy conductance generally coincides with the influence of the v p d on the canopy conductance for winter crops however summer plants experience a high v p d level during the initial and mid growth stages and a low v p d level in the harvesting stage these two factors the growth stage and v p d have the opposite influence on the canopy conductance and will compete with each other on the other hand high vpd ranges represent high atmospheric water demand and will cause stomata closure to save water this stomatal behavior increases the uncertainty of simulation and larger residuals as well nemani et al 2003 found that water availability strongly limits vegetation growth and reductions in vpd are indicative of increased water availability that is to say the variation in vpd can largely reflect or influence the condition of plant growth consequently within the construction of canopy conductance model the stress functions of vpd and the parameters that embedded in the functions are very sensitive and could cause large uncertainties fig 10 shows that the relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d differs between c3 and c4 plants as well as between crop grass and tree the different response shapes could be due to the data ranges of different plant species under a similar variation in environmental factors plant traits dominate the difference in the relationship the hyperbolic function of the v p d in the l model is acquired from the analysis of field measurements and is generally appropriate for most plant species for accurate simulation of canopy conductance across different plant species the data in fig 10b can be fitted by the hyperbolic function of vpd but with different values for parameter d 50 however the relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d based on field measurements is influenced to a certain degree by other factors such as radiation growth stage and soil water the fitted hyperbolic function reflects the response of canopy conductance to vpd under a part influence of other factors the application of different values of parameter d 50 for different plant species can help to improve the applicability of canopy conductance model and avoid the calibration for the parameter at each land cover type or location the relationship between the g s m and n d v i represents that g s m should vary with the variation of plant physiological condition and ndvi could be a good indicator to simulate its variation fig 6a shows the optimized gsm values at each site during the whole plant phenological period which are close to the values when plants are in the mid growth stage fig 12 wang et al 2020 discussed that the prescribed e m a x like the definition of g s m will likely to fail to work beyond the measurement period due to its variability moreover model with prescribed e m a x usually could not simulate the full range of plant transpiration because the stress functions are rarely equal to 1 at the same time therefore the application of fixed g s m values can cause errors especially in the initial and harvesting stages when the n d v i value is low the leaf age influences the net leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to different degrees for various types of plant species according to previous studies gucci et al 1997 and kositsup et al 2010 reported a general increase in the net leaf photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance with an increased leaf age for olive and rubber trees while vos and oyarzun 1987 revealed an opposite trend for potato leaves in addition the analysis also demonstrated that trees experienced a marked increase in photosynthetic activity and gas exchange during the first one to two weeks after the full expansion of leaves gucci et al 1997 xie and luo 2003 the stomatal conductance can be influenced by plant traits and environmental factors and the above studies did not analyze the variation in the maximum stomatal conductance in this study the canopy conductance for various types of plant species increases with increasing leaf age and leaf area however the g s m may not show with the same trend as the canopy conductance because it is one of the plant traits in determining the stomatal conductance as demonstrated by other studies above the physiology of trees increases rapidly during a short period in the initial stage which contributes to the high initial g s m levels of coniferous trees at the guantan and sdq sites as the leaf becomes dark green the thickness of the boundary layer increases and hinders gas exchange making the g s m decrease gradually to a stable level however the canopy conductance in the initial growing stage remains low level due to the limitation of environmental restrictive functions that reduce g s m to the near real level and the relatively small leaf area that upscales stomata to canopy according to the comparison between types of plant species trees have the lowest g s m values c3 crop grass has the highest level of g s m to support their gas exchange c4 crop maize can survive with less co2 thus stomata can be closed to reduce water loss thus leading to a lower g s m than that of c3 crop grass in addition the relationship between the g s m and n d v i leaf age of c3 crop grass and c4 crop differs from each other different types of environmental factors stress functions in the canopy conductance models are likely to affect the performance of the whole model in simulating canopy conductance and transpiration liu et al 2019 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2018b the selections of stress functions are usually based on the analysis of model errors whitley et al 2013 proposed a new vpd stress function for the jarvis type model and the results showed good applicability of the modified model according to relatively low model errors which supports the selection of the new vpd stress function in our study we found some deficiencies in the l model based on the analysis of residuals for further validation and exploration the analysis between observed g s and environmental factors was also conducted across different sites therefore although the selection of stress functions in the l model may partly affect the analysis of residuals the overall results that quantify the contribution of factors in uncertainty of modeling canopy conductance will not be affected largely 4 2 potential improvement in the functional form of influencing factors within the l model the g s m value is one of the plant physiological attributes that varies with plant growth many surface conductance models consider the g s m as a constant for each plant species over the whole growing period including the l model therefore the relationship between the g s m and leaf age which is usually indicated by the n d v i should be established and applied to improve the accuracy of a model estimation it is worth noting that the coniferous tree has a unique gsm distribution with leaf age to assess the improvement of the model that is introduced with a variable g s m we simulated the g s m with the n d v i for c3 crop grass and c4 crop using eqs 9 and 10 fig 18 and estimated e t with a modified l model and pm method the result was compared to the ec measurements and assessed based on the r 2 and r m s e table 3 and fig 19 show improvements in the accuracy of the e t estimation by adding a variable g s m into the l model for both c3 crop grass and c4 crop the variable g s m based on the n d v i produces less error in simulating canopy conductance than the error with a fixed g s m thus estimating e t more accurately the l model took radiation as the dominant factor influencing the leaf stomatal conductance with a nonlinear function and combined the radiation extinction within a canopy and the leaf area using an integration method this method fits most sites well except for the my guantan and sdq sites which are all covered with trees as shown in fig 14 the response of the canopy conductance to the net radiation is nonlinear in general and performs almost identical trends across non tree sites in addition the response shapes for non tree sites also show a few differences from the estimated performance under the condition of stable plant growth and little influence from other meteorological variables the canopy conductance tends to increase slowly at high net radiation levels and even experiences a slight decrease for trees the trend differs from the existing functional form of radiation in the l model at high net radiation levels and thus may cause error a new relationship between the radiation and stomatal conductance needs to be established to accurately describe the actual response especially for sites covered with trees the canopy conductance is negatively correlated with the vpd as reported by many studies and is demonstrated in this study the l model adopts a hyperbolic function of v p d in simulating the canopy conductance the results show that the function can generally ensure the accuracy of estimation but different degrees of errors still occur for various types of plant species the relationship between the residuals and v p d shows a deficiency in the function and can provide guidance for modifying the function the difference among the c3 crop grass c4 crop and c3 tree groups influences the functional form of the v p d and should be taken into consideration within the jarvis type model the air temperature and awc are regarded as two influencing factors of the canopy conductance whereas few analyses are carried out to clarify the sensitivity or influencing mechanism of these two factors considering that the air temperature is mainly driven by radiation and in turn drives the v p d these two factors cover the influence of air temperature to a large extent and result in air temperature having little influence on the canopy conductance the awc does not show a significant universal relationship with residuals in this study konings et al 2017 analyzed the aridity sensitivity of the v p d and precipitation to the productivity of grasslands and found that the precipitation contributes less than the v p d xue et al 2004 and conaty et al 2014 revealed that the response of stomatal conductance to the v p d is influenced by the soil water potential indeed soil moisture can sometimes be neglected for g c modeling such as in riparian sites or places where groundwater can be accessed by plant roots eamus and froend 2006 o grady et al 2006 wang et al 2016 rigorously tested the role of air temperature and stem water potential on controls on tree water use as far as their site is concerned they demonstrated that soil water availability function is important for transpiration and conductance simulations at different temporal scales while the influence of an air temperature function on model performance varies with season and model structure based on the results above residuals display scattered variations in most sites and have no explicit functional form of the relationship with factors that influence the canopy conductance however the general variation tendency of residuals with significance can identify deficiencies in the model structure and provide guidance for improving the model variable g s m values fitted from the n d v i and the modified nonlinear relationship between the stomatal conductance and radiation should be first introduced into the existing canopy conductance models additional analyses between the model errors and other factors including the v p d and awc can then be conducted to support functional form improvements within the original canopy conductance models furthermore compared to crop grass sites understory canopy et could be a large portion in total et in forest sites montes et al 2014 regarded the total et of sparse vineyards as the sum of three sources including main foliage vegetated soil and bare soil the three components were considered separately because they have different physical and geometrical features the similar scheme should be further considered in the derivation of g s framework for forest sites the realization or simplification of physical processes using the right mathematical equations and the accuracy of parameter values jointly determine the applicability of a model the soil evaporation parameter f s plays a critical role in model performance since soil evaporation is a considerable component of the total et especially for sparse vegetation and forest sites or regions fig 6 shows the distribution of optimized values of f s across different sites which can be explained by the wet dry status of surface soil and is considered to vary with soil moisture near surface previous studies attempted to calculated soil evaporation by parameterizing f s based on different theories including the complementary relationship hypothesis and the measured soil moisture near surface ding et al 2013 fisher et al 2008 therefore accurately parameterizing f s with temporally and spatially continuous data is beneficial for the applicability of the model satellite based soil moisture products with high temporal and spatial resolution combined with the parameterized method for f s could be an available way for improving simulation surface conductance and et in the future the values of parameter d 50 in vpd stress function may largely affect the model performance which is opposite to the results found in leuning et al 2008 the results in figs 9 and 10 show that the difference in response shapes could be mainly due to the data ranges and hence the different values of d 50 are needed for different sites or plant species considering that the calibration of d 50 for each site brings extra work and hinders the applicability of the model the unity of the parameter within the same species could be a compromise to balance both the accuracy and applicability of the model similarly as shown in fig 14 the application of constant value for q 50 across different sites may cause larger errors than previous analysis nevertheless the model errors are more likely to result from the deficiency in structure of radiation stress function due to the distinct differences between the observed response and simulated performance especially for forest sites 5 conclusions the dominant influencing factors and their relationship with the canopy conductance for various plant species were clarified based on the application and analysis of an l model the v p d and g s m are the two most important factors influencing the canopy conductance the radiation and leaf area are also correlated the v p d is generally negatively correlated with the canopy conductance and its hyperbolic function in the l model exhibits some error when simulating the canopy conductance response the differences between the estimated results and measurements indicate that modification of the function differs among plant species including the c3 crop grass c4 crop and c3 tree groups the g s m value depends on the leaf age and should not be set as a constant for specific plant species during the whole growing period the n d v i can be an indicator for the leaf age and coniferous trees show remarkable differences from other plant types the variation in the gsm also shows differences between c3 crop grass and c4 crop the application of a variable g s m can effectively improve the accuracy of the g s and e t estimation for crop grass as analyzed in this study the stomatal conductance tends to increase slowly or be stable at high radiation levels especially for trees a modified nonlinear relationship between the stomatal conductance and radiation should be adopted furthermore the air temperature has little influence on the canopy conductance based on the analysis exhibited in this study the awc has a certain contribution to residuals and the canopy conductance while the specific relationship remains unclear and more analysis is needed in the future the analyses and results in this study provide a clear description of the influencing factors on the canopy conductance and their functional deficiency in the existing model which may be useful for improving the accuracy of

5036,canopy conductance g c is a crucial variable in accurately estimating latent heat flux and evapotranspiration et over vegetated surfaces g c is highly dependent on the plant species and the surrounding environment consequently it is difficult to accurately simulate g c using a simplified universal model a number of empirical parameters and functional forms have been introduced to appropriately account for various plant species this study examines the efficacy of a widely adopted g c model and penman monteith pm approach over a selection of vegetated sites in arid and semi arid regions of china to investigate the factors that influence the accuracy of the model comprehensive micrometeorological and land surface monitoring datasets from eight eddy covariance ec stations in the hei and hai river basins were used for our analysis e t calculated from a widely used surface conductance and pm method was compared with ec measurements and the residuals of the comparison were analyzed with factors potentially influencing the residuals using their correlations and regression coefficients to identify factors accounting for the errors caused via g c the results showed that the vapor pressure deficit and the maximum stomatal conductance g s m are most significantly correlated with uncertainties in g c for all plant species the g c error vs vapor pressure deficit exhibited distinctive sensitivities among the c3 crop grass c4 crop and c3 tree groups the maximum stomatal conductance showed variation with the leaf age reaching the maximum level in the mid growth stage for most types of plant species except for coniferous trees the residuals increased with radiation levels for sites covered with trees which appeared to be caused by the decreasing trend of the stomatal conductance vs radiation at high radiation levels for trees finally we propose potential methods of improving canopy conductance models based on our error analysis keywords canopy conductance influencing factors vapor pressure deficit maximum stomatal conductance 1 introduction accurate evapotranspiration e t estimates are required in water resource management irrigation management and hydrological studies ershadi et al 2015 to date a range of models have been developed to estimate e t across different spatial and temporal scales which include empirical models glenn et al 2008a 2008b jung et al 2010 and physically based models utilizing the residual of surface energy balance allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 kustas and anderson 2009 su 2002 wu et al 2020 or the penman monteith pm method cleugh et al 2007 monteith 1965 penman 1948 xu et al 2018a for most of these models surface conductance g s is an important parameter that directly influences the estimating accuracy of e t canopy conductance g c as an upscaled parameter from the stomatal conductance g s of a leaf functions effectively as g s when vegetation covers most of the underlying surface thus soil evaporation can be neglected an accurate estimation of g c is highly important in understanding the water and carbon cycles of terrestrial ecosystems bai et al 2018 several g c or g s models have been implemented for e t estimation jarvis 1976 and other researchers considered the g s of illuminated leaves as a function of the current levels of quantum flux density temperature vapor pressure deficit v p d leaf water potential and ambient carbon dioxide c o 2 concentration a conceptual model was then proposed based on field measurements to link g s to all these variables many researchers cleugh et al 2007 li et al 2014 2016 mu et al 2007 2011 noilhan and planton 1989 song et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 have modified the functional forms of influencing factors and added additional factors to a jarvis type model the model is relatively simple and useful in practical applications to interpret the response of stomata to environmental factors radiation v p d air temperature and soil moisture however the jarvis type model is developed empirically based on field observations without considering the physiological mechanisms of plants thus limiting its applications with various plant types potential environmental factor interactions and their effects on stomata are excluded bai et al 2018 based on the concept that carbon and water fluxes are inherently linked ball et al 1987 found a linear correlation between g s and net photosynthesis rate p n when the photosynthetic capacity of leaves was altered by growing conditions the relationship is more similar to that of an empirical model and comes with errors during application leuning 1995 then tried to improve the model by substituting humidity with a hyperbolic function of v p d and by adding a c o 2 compensation point to account for the influence of varying air humidity and low concentration values of c o 2 on et the carbon water coupling model was applied and various aspects have been improved by a large number of researchers cox et al 1998 gimeno et al 2019 liu et al 2017 medlyn et al 2011 for example kelliher et al 1995 regarded g c as an integration of all leaves of a canopy based on the understanding that radiation attenuates gradually within the canopy and thus leaves in different positions absorb different amounts of radiation resulting in different g s values the model takes the canopy structure into consideration while consisting of fewer factors of influence than the jarvis type model leuning et al 2008 calibrated the parameters of the model and applied it to the pm method for g s estimation in addition the maximum stomatal conductance g s m is a hypothetical variable needed when plants are under conditions of sufficient sunlight and soil moisture as well as an appropriate humidity and air temperature wang et al 2020 proposed to substitute the prescribed maximum transpiration rate e m a x similar to the definition of g s m with potential et that allows for a dynamic potential rate to be deducted for actual transpiration estimations at every time step murray et al 2019 carried out g s measurements for c3 woody angiosperm in 19 sites across 7 bioclimatic zones and found a general convergence of g s m across species at the understory subcanopy habitat while a significant difference in g s m between species at the open canopy habitat most previous studies however assumed the g s m to be a constant for each type of vegetation during its whole growing stage which can be problematic in a realistic estimation of canopy conductance and e t most models estimate g c or g s based on a simple principle that consists of environmental factors with appropriate formulas according to the climatic condition and underlying surface that they are concerned about parameters and functions associated with specific areas and land uses are fitted with field measurements or are referred to others however the functions of the factors in these models were described in different forms even though a similar theoretical basis was used and only a few studies displayed the relationship of several factors to g c or g s with simple scatter plots at the specific site stomatal character varies with different plants and their different growth stages in different climatic areas which results in application errors of these models to different degrees tie et al 2017 discussed the physiological controls on sap flow based plant transpiration using satellite derived leaf area index lai liu et al 2018 showed that stomatal characteristics were associated with plant functional groups and climate at a regional scale for forests using measured stomatal traits for 737 plant species from nine forests ranging from tropical to cold temperature forests in china this finding demonstrates a need for incorporating more detailed plant information climate conditions and land use types into g c or g s for quantitative modeling the errors in existing models need to be further examined and possibly reduced by modifying the functional forms of influencing factors or by incorporating additional information this study aims to investigate factors that influence the uncertainty of g c for different types of plants when some widely adopted models are used we use field observations over eight eddy covariance ec stations which are distributed in arid and semi arid areas and include six typical plant types in northern china the following section describes the data source and methods used for analysis based on the analyses above the objectives are to i identify the factors that accounting for the uncertainty of the existing g c model ii analyze the relationship between influencing factors and canopy conductance and quantify the contribution of these factors in the uncertainty iii explore the parameterization of g s m using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi for various plant species and iv propose potential methods of improving existing g c models based on error analysis 2 materials and methods in this study g s estimates were first calculated based on daily ec measurements by rearranging the pm method crop phenological periods were extracted from a satellite based ndvi time series to approximately identify g c and further conduct data analysis e t was calculated from a widely used surface conductance model and pm method and are then compared to the ec measurements the residual was calculated as the absolute distance between the observed and estimated e t spearman s rank correlation coefficient and regression analysis were then carried out to identify the contribution of influencing factors to model residuals individual analyses between influencing factors and residuals were carried out for each site to further clarify the variation in residuals with the factors the data and methods used in the analysis above will be described in detail in later sections 2 1 flux and meteorological sites in this study five experimental sites located in the hei river basin and three sites located in the hai river basin were selected for analysis fig 1 shows the location of the experimental sites and a summary of the details is provided in table 1 the hai river basin is located in the north china plain and has a typical semi humid and semi arid climate with an apparent cycle of four seasons the guantao gt huailai hl and miyun my sites are located from south to north of the basin the gt site is cultivated with winter wheat gt w and summer maize gt m hl and my are cultivated with spring maize and orchards respectively the hei river basin is located in northwest china and represents a typical arid area surrounded by deserts with little precipitation the arou ar and guantan sites are located upstream of the basin and covered by alpine grass and spruce the daman dm and zhangye zy sites are located in the middle oasis of the basin and covered by spring maize and reeds the sidaoqiao sdq site is located downstream of the basin and covered with tamarix sites in the hei river basin have higher altitudes and lower temperatures than sites in the hai river basin the land cover maps of the two basins displayed in fig 1 are derived from chinacover wu et al 2017a for each site a tower equipped with ec and an automatic weather station aws was installed the ec tower heights for all crop grass sites range from 3 5 to 5 2 m except for the gt site which is 15 6 m as for sites covered by tree ec was equipped at 8 m height at the sdq site and at more than 20 m height at the both guantan and my sites a time series of energy flux and meteorological variable observations at a half hourly scale were obtained for further analysis including net radiation r n w m 2 soil heat flux g w m 2 latent heat flux l e w m 2 sensible heat flux h w m 2 wind speed w s m s 1 air temperature t a c relative humidity r h pressure kpa and soil moisture θ m3 m 3 the data corrupted by sensor malfunction or precipitation were discarded via a quality control process data gaps were filled with the mean diurnal variations method for flux data falge et al 2001 and with interpolation for other meteorological data the processed 30 min interval data were then averaged to daily data for latter simulation and analysis the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux tended to be underestimated due to the imbalance of ec caused by advection effects which was manifested as h l e r n g as shown in fig 2 the selected sites for this study suffer from energy imbalance to different degrees the gt dm and sdq sites exhibited preferable conditions with an energy balance ratio ebr defined as h l e r n g above 0 7 the hl my and guantan sites were relatively poor in energy balance with ebr values below 0 6 for further analysis with reasonable energy fluxes we applied the bowen ratio h l e closure method to correct h and l e twine et al 2000 by assuming that the bowen ratio is correct the principle of the method was used to divide the available energy r n g into h and l e according to the bowen ratio 2 2 vegetation index in this study the plant growth stage significantly affected the g c and g s m therefore the ndvi values were acquired to quantify plant growth and to identify different growth stages for each site the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis provides a daily overpass at approximately the same local time and can provide a time series of multispectral surface reflectance the mod09ga product covers daily surface reflectance with a 500 meter spatial resolution from visible to thermal infrared bands that are preprocessed including radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and geometric correction we selected reflectance in the red and near infrared bands bands 1 and 2 to calculate a time series n d v i and extracted values of the pixel that included the flux tower at each site poor quality n d v i data filtered by the cloud mask included in the product were discarded and filled by a linear temporal interpolation method all n d v i time series data after quality control were smoothed by a modified savitzky golay sg filter which is widely used for filtering a time series of remote sensing data chen et al 2004 fig 3 shows the filtered n d v i data and smoothed n d v i time series for each site which is highly correlated to plant growth 2 3 soil texture and property soil moisture is the source of plant transpiration and affects the water stress condition of plants hence their stomata behavior for a given soil moisture content the actual water volume available for plant growth varies widely depending on the soil therefore we use the available water content a w c to quantify the soil water content in this study a w c is calculated using the difference between the soil moisture θ and wilting point θ w divided by the difference between field capacity θ c and wilting point θ w as follows 1 awc θ θ w θ c θ w where θ c m3 m 3 and θ w m3 m 3 are determined by soil texture in this study we collected soil texture data from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn the sandy silt and clay fractions were extracted from the soil texture data for each site and then their soil types were determined according to the international system of soil texture classification peng et al 2015 the soil property values are described in chen and dudhia 2001 2 4 derived surface conductance by rearranging the pm method half hourly and daily g s can be derived using measured energy fluxes and meteorological variables from the ec and aws the rearrangement of the pm method is as follows 2 g s g a γ l e δ a ρ c p v p d g a l e δ γ where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of the curve that relates the saturation water vapor pressure to temperature kpa c 1 a is the available energy absorbed by the surface net absorbed radiation r n g w m 2 ρ is the density of air kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure j kg 1 k 1 vpd is vapor pressure deficit kpa and g a is the aerodynamic conductance mm s 1 in this study g a was calculated regardless of the stability conditions of the surface layer where u is the ws z is the height of the wind m k is von karman s constant 0 41 d is the zero plane displacement height m and z o m and z o v are the roughness lengths governing the transfer of momentum and water vapor m respectively following the fao 56 methodology d z o m and z o v were estimated through d 2 h 3 z o m 0 123 h z o v 0 1 z o m respectively where h is plant height allen et al 1998 3 g a k 2 u ln z d z om ln z d z ov 2 5 surface conductance model leuning et al 2008 regarded the total surface e t as the sum of transpiration from the plant canopy e t c and the bare soil evaporation e t s using separate versions of the pm method for e t and e t c respectively and the assumption that e t s occurs at some fraction f s of the equilibrium rate the equation can be written as 4 δ a ρ c p v p d g a δ γ 1 g a g s δ a c ρ c p v p d g a δ γ 1 g a g c f s δ a s δ γ the fraction of the total available energy absorbed by the canopy a c and by the soil a s are given by a c a 1 τ and a s a τ respectively where τ e x p k a l a i and k a is an extinction coefficient for available energy and l a i is the leaf area index m2 m 2 with these definitions a framework of g s can be obtained by rearranging eq 4 and is presented as eq 5 5 g s g c 1 τ g a δ γ 1 g c f δ γ 1 1 f g c g a ρ c p d a g a δ r n 1 τ f δ γ 1 1 f g c g a ρ c p d a g a δ r n kelliher et al 1995 developed an expression for canopy conductance in terms of maximum stomatal conductance l a i and absorbed shortwave radiation the expression was modified by adding the stomatal conductance response to the humidity deficit thus canopy conductance can be modeled as follows 6 g c gsm k q l n q h q 50 q h exp k q l a i q 50 1 1 v p d d 50 where k q is the extinction coefficient for shortwave radiation q h is the visible radiation flux at the top of the canopy w m 2 q 50 is the visible radiation flux when stomatal conductance is half its maximum value w m 2 and d 50 is the humidity deficit at which the stomatal conductance is half of its maximum value kpa a surface conductance model was acquired by coupling eqs 5 and 6 and was named the l model this model is used for further analyses 2 6 analytical methods to assess the performance of the surface conductance model the model was applied to nine phenological periods at eight sites a portion of the in situ measurements within each period was selected randomly for model calibration and the rest were selected for validation e t was estimated by combining the surface conductance model and pm method and was compared to the ec measurements note that the derived g s was calculated by rearranging the pm method eq 2 thus the discrepancy between the estimated e t and ec measurements was assumed to represent the deficiency of the surface conductance model in practical applications on the basis of the existing surface conductance model this study analyses the model error residual against factors that may influence g c to find the cause of uncertainty in the g c model e t was calculated from combined l model and pm method and then residuals were calculated as the absolute distance between the estimated e t and ec measurements the residuals were induced by the difference between the derived g s and simulated g s a series of methods were adopted in the analyses including plant phenology extractions correlation coefficients regression analyses and evaluation indices parameters should be calibrated within each site before applying models in this study the g s m and f s were optimized by minimizing the cost function f as shown in the following equation the generalized pattern search algorithm in matlab the mathworks inc was used for optimization e c j and e t j are the j t h ec measurement and estimated e t calculated from the l model e c is the arithmetic mean of ec measurements and n is the number of samples the other parameters that embedded in the l model also matter the model performance including k a k q q 50 and d 50 however leuning et al 2008 found that g s is relatively insensitive to these four parameters and the model performance showed only minor degradation when these four parameters were hold constant moreover the optimized values for d 50 were almost identical across different sites in their study therefore we referred to the constant values according to their study for these four parameters in the l model 7 f j n ec j et j 2 j n ec j ec 2 during the plant phenological period vegetation accounts more than soil especially in the peak of growth the trend of g c is similar to that of g s during the period due to a small fraction of soil conductance moreover g s can be regarded as g c during the peak of growth resulting from highly covered vegetation therefore g s during the plant phenological period is treated as g c for further analysis in this study the plant phenological period for species within each experimental site was extracted using the n d v i r a t i o wu et al 2017b the n d v i r a t i o is calculated as equation 8 the n d v i m a x and n d v i m i n are the seasonal maximum and minimum n d v i values respectively a threshold of 0 5 that is referred to wu et al 2017b is used to determine the start and end of the plant phenological period fig 4 shows the extracted phenological periods for each site 8 ndvi ratio ndvi ndvi min ndvi max n d v i min correlation coefficients can be used to directly assess the relationship between two variables spearman s rank correlation coefficient assesses monotonic relationships and is more suitable for variables with nonlinear functions compared to the pearson correlation coefficient accompanied by significance testing variables with significant correlation can be identified as the target variable regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables linear regression is the most common form of regression analysis in which a linear function is found to fit the data according to a specific mathematical criterion regression analysis can be used to infer the relationship between independent and dependent variables the significance test is applied to identify significantly correlated factors meteorological factors including the net radiation air temperature ws pressure and v p d the n d v i and the a w c were selected for correlation and regression analyses to demonstrate the role of variable g s m in improving the model performance for g c simulation the parameterization of g s m with ndvi was carried out based on their relationship in latter analyses this study firstly explored the potential of parameterized methods of variable g s m by plotting the relationship between calibrated g s m and ndvi in latter sections subsequently the non linear relationships between g s m and ndvi were established for different plant species according to the results in g s m ndvi plots two types of fitting functions related to exponential function were adopted for the relationships between g s m and ndvi the description of the functions is presented as follows where a b and c are empirical parameters that needed to be calibrated in the fitting process 9 gsm 1 a e x p b n d v i c 10 gsm a e x p b n d v i for the quantitative analysis of model performance two evaluation indices were selected the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to provide a measure of consistency between the estimation and observation a root mean square error r m s e is usually used to measure the average difference between estimation and observation 3 results 3 1 model performance fig 5 shows the validation of the e t results that are estimated from the l model coupled with the pm method the performance of the l model coupled with the pm method varies across the sites the model shows the best performance at the ar site according to r 2 and r m s e while the model shows considerable error between the estimated results and measurements at the guantan site for the gt w hl dm zy and sdq sites the model performs well with an r 2 above 0 8 and an r m s e below 0 9 mm d 1 the gt m site model performs slightly worse than the models of the above sites regarding the site in my the model performs poorly with e t l vs e t m e a s featuring wider scatters than those for other sites the poor model performance for this site may be partly due to the obvious energy imbalance as shown in fig 2 in addition relatively complicated advection effects at this site limit the applicability of the model and magnify the deficiencies of model construction the residuals between the estimated results and measurements reflect the deficiency in the surface conductance model including the incorrect functional structure of influencing factors or the absence of necessary factors for the guantan and sdq sites however the transpiration from the understory canopy and soil evaporation play certain roles in the total et even during the growing season since the derivation of the framework of g s considers the contribution from vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation the neglect of understory et can lead to underestimated estimates of the total et on the other hand the models in this study were calibrated with the measured et based on all sources the optimized values of parameters ensure the best consistency between estimated et and measured et therefore the residuals at the guantan and sdq sites can be largely attributed to the uncertainty of the g c model and partly due to the neglect of the understory et in the framework of g s as demonstrated in leuning et al 2008 the g s m and f s are two key parameters that greatly influence the model results and cannot be set to constant values across species or sites fig 6 shows the values of the g s m and f s from both models for each site fig 6a shows that the maximum stomatal conductance ranges between 4 and 16 mm s 1 for various vegetation types with the l model the guantan and sdq sites show low g s m values for the coniferous tree grass at the ar site and wheat at the gt site have high g s m values for maize sites in the hai river basin including gt m and hl the g s m values are very similar ranging between 4 and 8 mm s 1 while another maize site dm in the hei river basin shows a higher g s m value the soil evaporation parameter f s reflects the water availability of each site to reduce soil evaporation below the equilibrium rate the f s values of both models are similar and reasonable with values lower than 0 3 for dry climate in the guantan and sdq sites fig 6b 3 2 correlation between the potential influencing factors and model residuals in further analysis the residuals between ec measurements and estimated results calculated from the l model and pm method were analyzed against potential influencing factors to indicate the source of error and the accurate response of influencing factors to g s spearman s rank correlation coefficients between residuals and potential influencing factors during the plant phenological period were determined results with a correlation significance at the 0 05 level p 0 05 are regarded as the main influencing factors of residuals and are displayed in fig 7 the directions of correlation are indicated in different colors red indicates a positive correlation while blue indicates a negative correlation as shown in the figure the ar site shows no significant correlation between residuals and factors because of the high consistency between the estimated e t and ec measurements the v p d is significantly and positively correlated to residuals for all sites except at the ar and zy sites while the n d v i is significantly and negatively correlated to residuals for all sites except at the ar and guantan sites net radiation shows a significant positive correlation with residuals at the my guantan and sdq sites awc is significantly negatively correlated with residuals at the hl my and sdq sites in addition air temperature also shows a significant correlation with residuals at some sites however regarding the high correlation between the air temperature and v p d the influence of air temperature may repeat that of v p d thus in reality the air temperature may not have a great influence to further analyze the relationship between residuals and potential influencing factors and identify the dominant factors in influencing residuals we fit the residuals vs observations to a multiple linear regression model of standardized factors the z score of each and evaluated the influence of individual factors by analyzing the regression coefficients standard coefficients or beta coefficients the use of z scores for the potential influencing factors ensures that the regression coefficients represent the sensitivity of residuals to each of the factors while remaining unaffected by their units and dynamic ranges table 2 shows the beta coefficients of each factor for each site and the significant values are indicated the v p d and n d v i coefficients are significant for more than half of the sites which is a similar phenomenon compared with that observed for the spearman s coefficients specifically the beta coefficients of v p d are positive and significant for all sites except at the ar and sdq sites while the beta coefficients of n d v i are significant at the gt m dm zy and sdq sites with negative values the beta coefficient of net radiation is significant at the my and sdq sites moreover the awc values at the guantan dm and sdq sites also play a role in influencing residuals as shown by their beta coefficients in terms of the comparison between coefficients the value of the vpd coefficient is larger than the other coefficient values at 5 sites including the gt w hl my guantan and dm sites however the n d v i dominates the variation in residuals at the gt m and zy sites therefore the v p d and n d v i are the most important factors that influence residuals which also suggests that the application of the l model has a deficiency in expressing the influence of these two factors the accurate responses of the v p d and n d v i to canopy conductance remain unclear when applying the l model across various types of species furthermore the net radiation air temperature and awc also contribute to residuals at some sites 3 3 analysis between the dominant influencing factors and canopy conductance fig 8 shows the correlation between the residuals and standardized v p d during the plant phenological period additionally the growth stage is indicated by a cumulative n d v i linear regression and significance tests were carried out to quantify the variation in residuals with increasing v p d except at the ar and zy sites most sites display positive trends between the residuals and v p d suggesting that the model has an apparent error when applied under high vpd conditions gt w is cultivated with winter crops and shows high residuals when the v p d is high in the harvesting stage furthermore high residuals of summer plants tend to occur at the initial or mid growth stage rather than the harvesting stage according to the cumulative n d v i when the v p d is high fig 9 shows the correlation between the canopy conductance and v p d in this study at each site the canopy conductance at different sites generally follows a decreasing trend with increasing v p d however the canopy conductance vs vpd presents fairly distinctive clusters when viewed site by site the gt w site is cultivated with winter wheat and the canopy conductance rapidly decreases in a linear form with an increase in v p d the gt m and hl sites have a similar relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d while the my site is similar to a combination of the gt w and gt m or hl sites the ar site is located in a high altitude more than 3000 m mountain region with low air temperature showing a similar distribution as the gt w site in terms of the relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d the v p d is higher at the zy site than the ar site and the relationship is more dispersed the canopy conductance at dm site ranges from 0 to 20 mm s 1 and vpd ranges from 0 to 2 kpa the relationships at the guantan and sdq sites are entirely different from any other site the canopy conductance at the guantan site decreases from approximately 12 mm s 1 at a low v p d to almost 0 mm s 1 at a vpd of 1 3 kpa for the sdq site the canopy conductance is near constant when the v p d varies from 1 to 3 kpa the residuals are below 2 mm d 1 at most sites except at the my and guantan sites to show differences between species we grouped the sites into three categories c3 crop grass c4 maize and c3 tree as shown in fig 10 c3 crop grass generally has higher canopy conductance than those of the others c4 maize and c3 tree are similar in terms of the response shape between the canopy conductance and v p d while c4 maize has more dispersed points the residual distribution of c3 tree is clearly higher than those of other plants the n d v i is another important factor that is correlated with residuals and influences canopy conductance fig 11 shows the correlation between the residuals and n d v i z score and accompanied with linear regression and a significance test in general residuals remain high when the n d v i is relatively low which is the period before or after the mid growth stage however the relationship between the residuals and standardized n d v i is insignificant at the hl my and ar sites the variation in residuals is heteroscedastic at some sites n d v i can generally represent plant growth conditions and the variation in leaf area in the l model the l a i is derived from the n d v i and serves as the scale parameter between stomatal conductance and canopy conductance the g s m value represents the maximum stomatal conductance and is greatly correlated to plant growth conditions and stages considering the g s m to be constant for the entire growing period in the l model may result in error in the estimation in this study we acquired the daily g s m for each site by calibrating the l model once a day using continuous 30 min interval data the results were plotted against the n d v i and the plots were colored using the cumulative n d v i to represent growth stages fig 12 the analysis of the relationship between the g s m and n d v i shows different results from that in zhang et al 2010 which calculated maximum canopy conductance from a simple canopy conductance model and treated it as a sigmoid function for various types of species with several empirical parameters for most species across sites in this study the g s m generally follows an increased response with an increasing n d v i however the relationship between the derived g s m and n d v i for various plant species shows distinct differences among each other these differences reflect variations in plant traits and environmental conditions among different plant species the relationship between the g s m and n d v i at the gt w ar and zy sites displays similar forms of variation and the highest gsm levels during the mid growth stages the g s m value increases rapidly at low n d v i values and levels off when the n d v i is high suggesting the g s m changes quickly in the initial and harvesting stages while tending to be stable in the mid growth stage for sites with the same crop such as at the gt m and hl sites the same functional form of the relationship is expressed which shows slow increases in the g s m during the initial and harvesting stages the dm site has the same crop type and a similar functional form of the relationship as those at the gt m and hl sites but shows differences in the maximum level of g s m sites with trees show an entirely different relationship between the g s m and n d v i compared with the relationships from other sites especially for coniferous trees in the guantan and sdq sites the value of g s m at the sdq site reaches an optimized level in the initial stage and then decreases before remaining nearly constant for the rest of the phenological period the value of g s m at the guantan site shows a similar relationship to that at the sdq site but has a difference in the harvesting stage the g s m value at the guantan site displays an increase in the harvesting stage 3 4 analysis between the radiation and awc and the canopy conductance net radiation displays positive beta coefficients in the regression of residuals for most sites and shows a significant correlation with residuals at the my guantan and sdq sites in fig 7 and table 2 suggesting that the model produces more error with increasing net radiation we plotted the residuals against the net radiation z score to further analyze the relationship between the net radiation and residuals as fig 13 reveals the my guantan and sdq sites show significant correlations between the residuals and net radiation with residuals generally following an increasing trend as the net radiation increases the residuals reach the highest level when plants receive high net radiation in addition residuals at other sites show little correlation with net radiation which means the net radiation contributes little to the residuals at these sites fig 14 shows the distribution of derived g s g s m with the net radiation during the mid growth stage indicated by the cumulative n d v i at a half hourly scale at each site accompanied by the distribution of the estimated g s g s m with the net radiation during the mid growth stage plants reach their optimum and stable growth conditions plant growth has little influence on transpiration and canopy conductance radiation serves as the most dominant factor driving other meteorological variables and plant physiological conditions including the canopy conductance and stomatal conductance in the derivation of the l model the stomatal conductance is a nonlinear function of radiation and is upscaled to the canopy conductance based on the extinction of radiation within the canopy kelliher et al 1995 however fig 14 shows that the canopy conductance at the my guantan and sdq sites is proportional to the net radiation in the beginning but tends to be stable or even decrease slightly at high net radiation levels which differs from the estimated performance results from the l model and may cause error for other sites the canopy conductance generally increases with increasing net radiation and the response shapes are almost identical suggesting the response of canopy conductance to radiation generally follows the similar trend for herbaceous plant the relationships of canopy conductance vs net radiation for these sites also show difference from the estimated performance to varying degrees furthermore the relationship between the canopy conductance and radiation is closer to being linear than nonlinear at the gt w site soil water is the source of the transpiration of plants and may influence the stomatal behavior and canopy conductance many studies treat soil water as a linearly correlated factor in modeling canopy conductance while the l model does not couple it into estimation we plotted the residuals against the awc z score to analyze the potential of the awc factor in improving the l model the zy site is a wetland and has no soil moisture measurements as shown in fig 15 the linear coefficients between the residuals and awc z score show significance at the gt w hl my guantan and sdq sites in addition the residuals all follow a decreasing trend with increasing awc suggesting that error tends to occur under dry conditions at these sites we plotted the observed g s against awc for each site and the cumulative n d v i was used to indicate growth stages fig 16 for most sites the awc remains high during the initial and mid growth stages and generally declines in the harvesting stage the canopy conductance varies with awc at several sites based on a specific functional form including at the gt w gt m hl guantan dm and sdq sites the relationship shows that canopy conductance increases rapidly at the beginning of the increase in awc and levels off when the awc exceeds a specific threshold the relationship is somewhat similar to the relationship between the evaporative fraction and awc however the relationship can be better explained by the growth of plants than by the variation in awc the awc always remains high in the initial stage while the canopy conductance is low due to the limitation of the growth stage 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the response of canopy conductance between plant types the relationships between residuals and influencing factors vary for different plant types resulting in different canopy conductance responses to the factors that influence them plant traits and climate conditions may be responsible for these differences the winter crop at the gt site experiences different meteorological conditions during the growing season compared with the meteorological conditions of other summer plants previous studies have reported that stomatal conductance or canopy conductance tends to decrease with increasing v p d baker et al 2007 conaty et al 2014 duursma et al 2013 the l model also adopts the above conclusion and expresses the vpd response with a hyperbolic form leuning 1995 lohammar et al 1980 furthermore the parameter d 50 in a hyperbolic form is insensitive to estimated results and can be set as a constant for various types of species leuning et al 2008 nevertheless the v p d is one of the factors highly correlated to the residuals analyzed in this study as fig 7 and table 2 show the residuals of a winter crop gt w exhibit significant correlation with the vpd and the error mainly occurs in the harvest stage when the crop is fully mature and the vpd is high unlike summer crops the vpd in winter remains low and increases gradually when crops revive in spring fig 17 the canopy conductance decreases rapidly with the v p d and follows a linear pattern rather than a hyperbolic trend fig 9 as a result of the high altitude and relatively low air temperature and v p d the ar site displays a similar relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d as the winter crop the growth period of the winter crop is in late winter and early spring with a relatively low and stable v p d while the crop is ready for harvesting in late spring or early summer with an increased v p d therefore the influence of the growth stage on the canopy conductance generally coincides with the influence of the v p d on the canopy conductance for winter crops however summer plants experience a high v p d level during the initial and mid growth stages and a low v p d level in the harvesting stage these two factors the growth stage and v p d have the opposite influence on the canopy conductance and will compete with each other on the other hand high vpd ranges represent high atmospheric water demand and will cause stomata closure to save water this stomatal behavior increases the uncertainty of simulation and larger residuals as well nemani et al 2003 found that water availability strongly limits vegetation growth and reductions in vpd are indicative of increased water availability that is to say the variation in vpd can largely reflect or influence the condition of plant growth consequently within the construction of canopy conductance model the stress functions of vpd and the parameters that embedded in the functions are very sensitive and could cause large uncertainties fig 10 shows that the relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d differs between c3 and c4 plants as well as between crop grass and tree the different response shapes could be due to the data ranges of different plant species under a similar variation in environmental factors plant traits dominate the difference in the relationship the hyperbolic function of the v p d in the l model is acquired from the analysis of field measurements and is generally appropriate for most plant species for accurate simulation of canopy conductance across different plant species the data in fig 10b can be fitted by the hyperbolic function of vpd but with different values for parameter d 50 however the relationship between the canopy conductance and v p d based on field measurements is influenced to a certain degree by other factors such as radiation growth stage and soil water the fitted hyperbolic function reflects the response of canopy conductance to vpd under a part influence of other factors the application of different values of parameter d 50 for different plant species can help to improve the applicability of canopy conductance model and avoid the calibration for the parameter at each land cover type or location the relationship between the g s m and n d v i represents that g s m should vary with the variation of plant physiological condition and ndvi could be a good indicator to simulate its variation fig 6a shows the optimized gsm values at each site during the whole plant phenological period which are close to the values when plants are in the mid growth stage fig 12 wang et al 2020 discussed that the prescribed e m a x like the definition of g s m will likely to fail to work beyond the measurement period due to its variability moreover model with prescribed e m a x usually could not simulate the full range of plant transpiration because the stress functions are rarely equal to 1 at the same time therefore the application of fixed g s m values can cause errors especially in the initial and harvesting stages when the n d v i value is low the leaf age influences the net leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to different degrees for various types of plant species according to previous studies gucci et al 1997 and kositsup et al 2010 reported a general increase in the net leaf photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance with an increased leaf age for olive and rubber trees while vos and oyarzun 1987 revealed an opposite trend for potato leaves in addition the analysis also demonstrated that trees experienced a marked increase in photosynthetic activity and gas exchange during the first one to two weeks after the full expansion of leaves gucci et al 1997 xie and luo 2003 the stomatal conductance can be influenced by plant traits and environmental factors and the above studies did not analyze the variation in the maximum stomatal conductance in this study the canopy conductance for various types of plant species increases with increasing leaf age and leaf area however the g s m may not show with the same trend as the canopy conductance because it is one of the plant traits in determining the stomatal conductance as demonstrated by other studies above the physiology of trees increases rapidly during a short period in the initial stage which contributes to the high initial g s m levels of coniferous trees at the guantan and sdq sites as the leaf becomes dark green the thickness of the boundary layer increases and hinders gas exchange making the g s m decrease gradually to a stable level however the canopy conductance in the initial growing stage remains low level due to the limitation of environmental restrictive functions that reduce g s m to the near real level and the relatively small leaf area that upscales stomata to canopy according to the comparison between types of plant species trees have the lowest g s m values c3 crop grass has the highest level of g s m to support their gas exchange c4 crop maize can survive with less co2 thus stomata can be closed to reduce water loss thus leading to a lower g s m than that of c3 crop grass in addition the relationship between the g s m and n d v i leaf age of c3 crop grass and c4 crop differs from each other different types of environmental factors stress functions in the canopy conductance models are likely to affect the performance of the whole model in simulating canopy conductance and transpiration liu et al 2019 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2018b the selections of stress functions are usually based on the analysis of model errors whitley et al 2013 proposed a new vpd stress function for the jarvis type model and the results showed good applicability of the modified model according to relatively low model errors which supports the selection of the new vpd stress function in our study we found some deficiencies in the l model based on the analysis of residuals for further validation and exploration the analysis between observed g s and environmental factors was also conducted across different sites therefore although the selection of stress functions in the l model may partly affect the analysis of residuals the overall results that quantify the contribution of factors in uncertainty of modeling canopy conductance will not be affected largely 4 2 potential improvement in the functional form of influencing factors within the l model the g s m value is one of the plant physiological attributes that varies with plant growth many surface conductance models consider the g s m as a constant for each plant species over the whole growing period including the l model therefore the relationship between the g s m and leaf age which is usually indicated by the n d v i should be established and applied to improve the accuracy of a model estimation it is worth noting that the coniferous tree has a unique gsm distribution with leaf age to assess the improvement of the model that is introduced with a variable g s m we simulated the g s m with the n d v i for c3 crop grass and c4 crop using eqs 9 and 10 fig 18 and estimated e t with a modified l model and pm method the result was compared to the ec measurements and assessed based on the r 2 and r m s e table 3 and fig 19 show improvements in the accuracy of the e t estimation by adding a variable g s m into the l model for both c3 crop grass and c4 crop the variable g s m based on the n d v i produces less error in simulating canopy conductance than the error with a fixed g s m thus estimating e t more accurately the l model took radiation as the dominant factor influencing the leaf stomatal conductance with a nonlinear function and combined the radiation extinction within a canopy and the leaf area using an integration method this method fits most sites well except for the my guantan and sdq sites which are all covered with trees as shown in fig 14 the response of the canopy conductance to the net radiation is nonlinear in general and performs almost identical trends across non tree sites in addition the response shapes for non tree sites also show a few differences from the estimated performance under the condition of stable plant growth and little influence from other meteorological variables the canopy conductance tends to increase slowly at high net radiation levels and even experiences a slight decrease for trees the trend differs from the existing functional form of radiation in the l model at high net radiation levels and thus may cause error a new relationship between the radiation and stomatal conductance needs to be established to accurately describe the actual response especially for sites covered with trees the canopy conductance is negatively correlated with the vpd as reported by many studies and is demonstrated in this study the l model adopts a hyperbolic function of v p d in simulating the canopy conductance the results show that the function can generally ensure the accuracy of estimation but different degrees of errors still occur for various types of plant species the relationship between the residuals and v p d shows a deficiency in the function and can provide guidance for modifying the function the difference among the c3 crop grass c4 crop and c3 tree groups influences the functional form of the v p d and should be taken into consideration within the jarvis type model the air temperature and awc are regarded as two influencing factors of the canopy conductance whereas few analyses are carried out to clarify the sensitivity or influencing mechanism of these two factors considering that the air temperature is mainly driven by radiation and in turn drives the v p d these two factors cover the influence of air temperature to a large extent and result in air temperature having little influence on the canopy conductance the awc does not show a significant universal relationship with residuals in this study konings et al 2017 analyzed the aridity sensitivity of the v p d and precipitation to the productivity of grasslands and found that the precipitation contributes less than the v p d xue et al 2004 and conaty et al 2014 revealed that the response of stomatal conductance to the v p d is influenced by the soil water potential indeed soil moisture can sometimes be neglected for g c modeling such as in riparian sites or places where groundwater can be accessed by plant roots eamus and froend 2006 o grady et al 2006 wang et al 2016 rigorously tested the role of air temperature and stem water potential on controls on tree water use as far as their site is concerned they demonstrated that soil water availability function is important for transpiration and conductance simulations at different temporal scales while the influence of an air temperature function on model performance varies with season and model structure based on the results above residuals display scattered variations in most sites and have no explicit functional form of the relationship with factors that influence the canopy conductance however the general variation tendency of residuals with significance can identify deficiencies in the model structure and provide guidance for improving the model variable g s m values fitted from the n d v i and the modified nonlinear relationship between the stomatal conductance and radiation should be first introduced into the existing canopy conductance models additional analyses between the model errors and other factors including the v p d and awc can then be conducted to support functional form improvements within the original canopy conductance models furthermore compared to crop grass sites understory canopy et could be a large portion in total et in forest sites montes et al 2014 regarded the total et of sparse vineyards as the sum of three sources including main foliage vegetated soil and bare soil the three components were considered separately because they have different physical and geometrical features the similar scheme should be further considered in the derivation of g s framework for forest sites the realization or simplification of physical processes using the right mathematical equations and the accuracy of parameter values jointly determine the applicability of a model the soil evaporation parameter f s plays a critical role in model performance since soil evaporation is a considerable component of the total et especially for sparse vegetation and forest sites or regions fig 6 shows the distribution of optimized values of f s across different sites which can be explained by the wet dry status of surface soil and is considered to vary with soil moisture near surface previous studies attempted to calculated soil evaporation by parameterizing f s based on different theories including the complementary relationship hypothesis and the measured soil moisture near surface ding et al 2013 fisher et al 2008 therefore accurately parameterizing f s with temporally and spatially continuous data is beneficial for the applicability of the model satellite based soil moisture products with high temporal and spatial resolution combined with the parameterized method for f s could be an available way for improving simulation surface conductance and et in the future the values of parameter d 50 in vpd stress function may largely affect the model performance which is opposite to the results found in leuning et al 2008 the results in figs 9 and 10 show that the difference in response shapes could be mainly due to the data ranges and hence the different values of d 50 are needed for different sites or plant species considering that the calibration of d 50 for each site brings extra work and hinders the applicability of the model the unity of the parameter within the same species could be a compromise to balance both the accuracy and applicability of the model similarly as shown in fig 14 the application of constant value for q 50 across different sites may cause larger errors than previous analysis nevertheless the model errors are more likely to result from the deficiency in structure of radiation stress function due to the distinct differences between the observed response and simulated performance especially for forest sites 5 conclusions the dominant influencing factors and their relationship with the canopy conductance for various plant species were clarified based on the application and analysis of an l model the v p d and g s m are the two most important factors influencing the canopy conductance the radiation and leaf area are also correlated the v p d is generally negatively correlated with the canopy conductance and its hyperbolic function in the l model exhibits some error when simulating the canopy conductance response the differences between the estimated results and measurements indicate that modification of the function differs among plant species including the c3 crop grass c4 crop and c3 tree groups the g s m value depends on the leaf age and should not be set as a constant for specific plant species during the whole growing period the n d v i can be an indicator for the leaf age and coniferous trees show remarkable differences from other plant types the variation in the gsm also shows differences between c3 crop grass and c4 crop the application of a variable g s m can effectively improve the accuracy of the g s and e t estimation for crop grass as analyzed in this study the stomatal conductance tends to increase slowly or be stable at high radiation levels especially for trees a modified nonlinear relationship between the stomatal conductance and radiation should be adopted furthermore the air temperature has little influence on the canopy conductance based on the analysis exhibited in this study the awc has a certain contribution to residuals and the canopy conductance while the specific relationship remains unclear and more analysis is needed in the future the analyses and results in this study provide a clear description of the influencing factors on the canopy conductance and their functional deficiency in the existing model which may be useful for improving the accuracy of

5037,the robustness of groundwater vulnerability assessment using the conventional drastic framework is highly dependent on the quality of the input data the current study investigates the vulnerability of the western part of the coastal aquifer of the gaza strip part of the palestinian southern western coastal aquifer the study intends to re introduce the recharge factor r in drastic framework through the application of swat model and investigates its impact on the quality of vulnerability assessment compared with the conventional drastic framework no swat not only a higher recharge resolution map was generated when applying the swat model but also an improved vulnerability index by 52 due to the incorporation of the local zonal operation vulnerability concept was achieved while the conventional drastic framework no swat resulted in 74 of the study area has either extreme high or extreme low vulnerability classes swat model was able to smoothen the vulnerability identification by capturing the slight gradual vulnerability variation over the study area with more precise vulnerability assessment the resulted vulnerability assessment was validated using real field nitratedata no 3 of water samples collected from the entire study area the vulnerability assessment using the swat model was in good agreement with the nitrate levels in the area compared with the conventional drastic where the residual error encountered in the case of swat application 20 was less than in the conventional drastic 77 the results were also validated using receiver operator classification roc and the area under curve auc confirming the improved assessment due to swat model application the current new approach is sought to support the decision making process and water managers to better manage the proposed aquifer recharge scheme in the study area as well as to better manage the limited water resources keywords aquifer management drastic gis vulnerability assessment decision support 1 introduction water scarcity has increased globally and meeting water demands has and will continue to be a challenge baalousha 2010 jang et al 2017 söderqvist et al 2015 vaux 2011 water scarcity is likely to be magnified by the deterioration of the currently available water resources particularly in arid and semi arid areas and due to the increased contamination events al adamat et al 2003 jang et al 2017 nobre et al 2007 the coastal aquifer in the gaza strip palestine has been under high stress imposed by groundwater over abstraction point source contamination wastewater discharge as well as seawater intrusion alslaibi et al 2017b degradation of groundwater quality along with the increasing water demandhas developed the need for restoration actions to protect the groundwater aquifer nitrate contamination of groundwater aquifer in the gaza strip is pandemic and the remediation of groundwater contamination is complex and at a high cost therefore effective protection measures as well as proper management options to prohibit further deterioration of the aquifer are needed the developing interest in protecting the coastal aquifer stems from the ongoing poor practices that negatively impact the quality of the groundwater particularly the high nitrate and chloride levels 150 ppm and 800 ppm respectively abunada and nassar 2015 alslaibi et al 2017a groundwater monitoring and sampling are among the most common techniques to evaluate the quality of groundwater however sampling and monitoring are costly and time consuming jang et al 2017 the groundwater vulnerability concept assumes that the physical environment can sustain a certain level of aquifer protection against contaminants leaching down to the groundwater leone et al 2009 groundwater vulnerability modelling provides a valid quick and fairly simple tool to effectively assess the vulnerability of groundwater aquifer with a reasonable understanding of potential pollution events as well as contaminants extent and delineation although groundwater vulnerability models use similar factors these models employ various approaches for data integration and analysis generally data is deployed into three categories index methods statistical procedures process based methods and or a combination of these methods li and merchant 2013 neukum and azzam 2009 oh et al 2011 yu et al 2010 among the groundwater vulnerability models drastic index is a widely used model used to assess the vulnerability of groundwater aquifer and to investigate the potential groundwater contamination under various events li and merchant 2013 saatsaz et al 2011 drastic encompasses a group of vulnerability factors that uses seven environmental parameters depth to water net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity to characterize the hydrogeological setting and evaluate aquifer vulnerability per the procedure of the u s environmental protection agency epa usepa 1985 it evaluates for the weighted sum of the hydrologic factors controlling the contaminant s leaching to aquifers through the vadose zone the model s simple formulation and the ease of integration with geographic information systems gis in addition to its flexibility to incorporate other factors have favoured its use over many other models lima et al 2011 many papers applied gis techniques in environmental modelling in gaza strip salem et al 2017 drastic approach provides a numerical ranking of various geological and hydrogeological factors that affect the contaminant transport from the surface to groundwater the recharge factor is among seven factors that control the transport of a pollutant to groundwater through a leaching process the recharge factor in drastic is a function of different parameters influenced by the surface hydrological conditions and climatic factors that affect aquifer vulnerability a study by aller et al 1987 acknowledged the limitations of assigning reasonable and accurate recharge values within drastic aller et al 1987 various applications of drastic have suggested the development of new recharge values that can provide better integration of these factors for better vulnerability assessment jang et al 2017 magesh et al 2012 oni et al 2017 unlike the other drastic factors the recharge factors is more vulnerable and subject to seasonal changes depending on the climatic conditions and surface hydrology estimated recharge values are normally generalized across the whole area regardless of the spatial and temporal variations due to the difficulty in measuring the recharge factor across the whole area effectively the authors are aware of the need to improve other drastic factors with higher weights including the vadose zone and the water depth however the current study is limited to investigate the impact of improving the recharge factor on the vulnerability assessment by introducing the soil water assessment tool swat gis model moreover the other drastic parameters are relatively less controllable and experience minimum variation within short time periods compared to the recharge factor swat is a comprehensive watershed scale model that incorporates several watershed characteristics such as land use and land cover soil type surface slope and climatic conditions to investigate the hydrological parameters of the study area estimating the groundwater recharge represents a challenge in many cases and prone to various errors due to poor data accuracy and availability there are various methods for groundwater recharge estimation including numerical approach tracer methods hydrologic budget method and multiple methods singh et al 2019 the water table fluctuation method wtf is one of the most common estimation methods based on measuring groundwater level over time and space through monitoring the water table level to evaluate the aquifer healy 2010 this method is applicable in areas with high aquifer fluctuation it requires intensive field measurements and is prone to some errors another method including the recession curve displacement is used when a series of groundwater recharge events occur consistently where the recession curve is moved upward due to a recharge event the meyboom method is another method used to estimate the average of groundwater recharge for a limited period normally 5 years yet the method is unsuitable in case of negative numbers szilagyi and jozsa 2013 discussed the use of remote sensing data from modis to estimate net groundwater recharge in nebraska usa the method utilizes a simplified water balance equation based on evapotranspiration maps obtained by linear transformation of satellite images with monthly precipitation drastic another simple direct and widely used framework for groundwater quality vulnerability assessment it has been applied by many researchers to study the vulnerability level of various groundwater aquifer aller et al 1987 although the few limitations of using drastic holden et al 1992 drastic has been widely used to assess the vulnerability level of aquifer whilst considering various evaluation criteria and hydrological parameters drastic is a simple low cost tool and requires low data input that provides sufficient accuracy to evaluate aquifer vulnerability in areas with complex geological formations mclay et al 2001 moreover drastic is a reconnaissance tool but has proven to work well in screening the aquifer vulnerability particularly in areas with interrupted data measurements it can be concluded that depending on the data availability and the objective of the research different methods for estimating groundwater recharge can be utilised the inconsistent and the poor quality data records available within the entire study area in the gaza strip made it convenient to endorse drastic for evaluating the aquifer vulnerability in the study area and estimating the recharge values swat model has been applied to estimate the recharge values by many researchers al dousari et al 2010 bailey et al 2016 gyamfi et al 2017 the current study aimed to 1 investigate the impact of applying swat gis model in estimating the recharge factor within the study area to the north of the gaza strip palestine 2 investigate the variation in vulnerability levels using both recharge maps resulted from the conventional interpolation method and the one resulted from the swat model application results from this study will support the decision makers in understanding the aquifer vulnerability within this area for further aquifer management measures it also intends to serve as a robust and valid tool for general groundwater vulnerability assessment where the recharge factors can be better estimated using swat model 2 study area the gaza strip occupying around 363 square km along the mediterranean sea just southwest of palestine and bordered by egypt in the south negev desert in the east and the green line in the north alslaibi et al 2017a fig 1 gaza strip the world s most densely populated area 1 8 million inhabitants in 364 km2 is facing an irreversible water and environmental crise with an unprecedented human disaster seems imminent alslaibi et al 2017a the coastal aquifer the sole water source in the gaza strip suffers from groundwater over abstraction 160 mcm yr associated with low annual precipitation 55 60 mcm yr this has resulted in a water deficit of about 120 mcm yr abu alnaeem et al 2018 pwa 2014 moreover the groundwater quality is undergoing severe deterioration including both groundwater salinization and nitrate build up due to the seawater intrusion and the unplanned disposal of the partially treated wastewater to the open areas respectively abu alnaeem et al 2018 moreover the northern area of the gaza strip is well known for its agricultural activities and the intensive use of fertilizers that increase the risk of contaminating the vulnerable aquifer in the area recent reports indicated that around 97 of the coastal aquifer in the gaza strip is unsuitable for human use and does not comply with the international drinking water standards united nations 2012 nitrate and chloride levels in some wells exceed 150 mg l and 800 mg l respectively al naeem et al 2019 this necessitates the need for unconventional water resources including wastewater reuse and recharge to mitigate the deterioration of the water resources and to release the stress from the groundwater aquifer abu alnaeem et al 2018 abunada and nassar 2015 this has also created the need for an aquifer vulnerability assessment to better design the recharging schemes proposed by the water authorities there and to manage the groundwater aquifer the current study evaluates the groundwater vulnerability in the northern gaza strip governorate applying drastic framework two recharge maps were obtained through the use of the conventional interpolation method and the swat model the two generated vulnerability maps were compared against the nitrate map in the study area the study area was selected for the following reasons i location of a newly constructed wastewater treatment plant 2018 with the plans to recharge the wastewater effluent annual 13 mcm into the groundwater aquifer ii a hot spot for unplanned agricultural activities with intensive use of fertilizers associated with direct disposal of partially treated wastewater to the open areas the random lake in the northern part of the study area and 111 the high levels of nitrate across the study area the coastal aquifer is one of the four main aquifers in the vicinity of the study area fig 2 this aquifer extends from haifa city in the north down to al arish in egypt towards the south west of the gaza strip escwa 2013 the pleistocene formations of the marine kurkar a at 50 m and continental kurkar b at 100 m depths qahman et al 2009 a cross section of part of the coastal aquifer is presented in fig 3 the study area lies towards the western part of the coastal aquifer where sub aquifers a b1 b2 and c underlies the targeted area in this paper thus this part of the coastal aquifer is considered an unconfined aquifer since the mentioned sub aquifers are not extending rather they act as lenses for specific parts qahman et al 2009 escwa 2013 and unesco 2015 the coastal aquifer reported to have an average transmissivity of 2 2 102 m2 sec and an estimated average hydraulic conductivity of 55 m day based on 24 wells pumping test the specific yield is estimated to be 15 30 escwa 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 setting up drastic various groundwater vulnerability models using either statistical methods or index methods have been in practice to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability against contaminants leaching koycegiz and buyukyildiz 2019 generally spatial models for groundwater assessment consist of three different types cartographic simple spatial and spatiotemporal drastic a simple spatial model is one of the most widely used models to assess groundwater vulnerability with valid applications in addressing the vulnerability levels in many areas douglas et al 2018 wu et al 2016 as a conceptual model drastic accounts for the most important hydrological and geological parameters that affect the potential leaching of contaminants down to the groundwater aquifer the adopted drastic parameters weights were according to aller et al 1987 drastic yields a numerical index map of groundwater vulnerability that is derived from the weights assigned to the seven parameters eq 1 1 drastic m a p d r w r r w a r w s r w t r w i r w c r w where the parameters mentioned are the rating multiplied by the weight corresponding to d the depth of the groundwater r the net recharge a the aquifer media s soil media t topography i the impact of the vadose zone and c the hydraulic conductivity drastic was used to evaluate the vulnerability of the groundwater aquifer in the northern part of the gaza strip 9 km north of gaza city the model boundaries were determined using the digital elevation model dem and the sub basins delineated within the study area as shown in fig 3 drastic uses weights rates and ranges to determine the impact of individual parameters and estimates its contribution to the vulnerability assessment shivhare et al 2018 thapa et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 the weight of each drastic factor refers to its relative importance as indicated by aller et al 1987 3 1 1 depth of water d the classification of the groundwater depth was grouped into six classes ranging from 3 to 67 m depth based on the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area the rates assigned for these groups ranged from 1 to 10 aller et al 1987 where high rating refers to high vulnerability as in the case of the shallow aquifer group 0 3 m fig 5 a the water levels were determined using well data records from 2010 to 2016 with average depths ranging from 30 m to 67 m weighted values from 5 to 45 were assigned across the study area as shown in table 1 and fig 5 a 3 1 2 aquifer media a the aquifer media at the water table depth influences the development of the groundwater plume the aquifer media was estimated using lithological datasets from 342 lithology logs for the entire gaza strip showing the soil type at various depths since the soil type was presented as discrete points hydraulic conductivity values were generated accordingly and the hydraulic conductivity map was estimated for the whole area at the groundwater average level once the aquifer media allows plume development then the area was viewed as highly vulnerable the aquifer media was grouped into four classes table 1 with each class was rated as per aller et al 1987 the rate was then multiplied by a factor of three to account for the weight of the aquifer media fig 5 b 3 1 3 soil media s soil media refers to the upper soil cover of the unsaturated zone which controls the amount of recharge and pollutants dispersion into the aquifer as well as its degradation the spread of the movement of a contaminant into the groundwater is controlled by several soil characteristics these include soil thickness which affects the time the contaminants reside within the media and soil texture and structure which influence the rate at which the contaminants percolate through the soil profile the soil media was obtained from the existing soil cover map for the surrounding area the soil media was grouped into five classes based on its leaching capacity so that the higher the soil leaching capacity the more vulnerable the area table 1 the soil media classes were then multiplied by a factor of two to account for the weight of the soil media factor as per aller et al 1987 as shown in fig 5 c 3 1 4 topography t the topography is expressed in terms of the slope of the land surface and influences the run off rate this in turn influences the quantity of water and contaminants percolation the steeper the slope the more runoff is expected and therefore the less vulnerable the area kisaka and lema 2016 the slope of the study area was calculated using a 30 meter digital elevation model dem and arcmap 10 2 the surface slope of the study area was grouped into five categories table 1 the topography rated classes were then multiplied by a factor of one to account for the weight of the topography factor aller et al 1987 as shown in fig 5 d 3 1 5 impact of vadose zone i the vadose zone the unsaturated zone between the topsoil and the groundwater table influences the potential leaching pathway of the contaminants from the topsoil down to the aquifer the higher the attenuation capacity of the vadose zone the less vulnerable the area kisaka and lema 2016 the characteristics of the vadose zone were identified from the soil lithology using existing water wells in the entire study area the lithology map was estimated using the thickness of the soil layers the soil within the study area was sandy with occasional clay lenses the soil type within the vadose zone was grouped into two categories with each group having an index number referring to the soil type this index number was then factored by five to account for the weight of the vadose zone factor as per drastic aller et al 1987 as shown in fig 5 e 3 1 6 conductivity c hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer the measure of its capacity to transmit water under certain hydraulic gradients influences the rate of the contaminant s movement within the aquifer alwathaf and mansouri 2011 an aquifer with high conductivity is more vulnerable to contamination as it increases the transport rate of the contaminated plume through the aquifer alwathaf and mansouri 2011 according to drastic the average conductivity values for the aquifer media were obtained from the soil lithology in the study area the values were grouped into five classes where each class represented a conductivity range aller et al 1987 the level of conductivity was then multiplied by a factor of three to account for the conductivity weight on the vulnerability of the area as shown in fig 5 f 3 2 the recharge factor in drastic framework 3 2 1 the conventional drastic framework recharge is one of the important factors for vulnerability assessment using drastic framework it is defined as the amount of water infiltrating from top soil down to the groundwater table through the vadose zone and measured in mm per year kisaka and lema 2016 the idea of improving the recharge factor stems from aller et al 1987 where they claimed that the estimate of net recharge in drastic framework is impractical and associated with vague estimates since the values of recharge are often calculated for specific local areas aller et al 1987 therefore an extrapolation is required to obtain recharge values for the remaining study area moreover the recharge estimate using drastic does not account for the average annual amount of infiltration without considering rainfall intensity distribution and duration although the water depth and the vadose zone have higher weight 5 than the recharge factors yet there is a slim opportunity to control and improve these parameters the impact of applying improved recharge factor estimate using the application of the swat gis tool within the conventional drastic framework has been thoroughly investigated within the current study the recharge factor was calculated first using the conventional method by extrapolating the available discrete surface recharge values for specific points within the study area to assign the general recharge values over the entire area pwa 2014 the index number was determined based on five recharge values and a weight of four was assigned to reflect the importance of the recharge factor aller et al 1987 second the recharge values were then calculated by incorporating the local zonal operation vulnerability using the hydrological response unit hru concept the significance of improving the recharge factor is related to the phreatic nature of the aquifer in the study area as well as the potential lateral contaminants transport with the groundwater plume lima et al 2011 fig 5 summarizes drastic frameworks maps 3 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat analysis swat gis tool was used to improve the accuracy of the recharge factor that represents an input of drastic the estimation of recharge values using swat model incorporates specific parameters within the study area these parameters included soil climatic conditions surface slope as well as land use land cover lulc datasets the application of the swat tool includes the introduction of the hrus where each hru has a distinct slope lulc and soil type hence swat model views the study area in terms of hru units regardless of their spatial locations an hru is the smallest spatial unit in the swat model that defines the specific spatial locations after the identification of the various recharge values using the swat model the swat designed to calculate the groundwater recharge on the hru level based on an exponential decay weighting function adopted from swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 hrus were then joined using the gis tool to the corresponding hru shapefile the recharge values were rated and weighted according to the rates and weights aller et al 1987 the hru shapefile with the recharge values was rasterized and the size of each hru cell was determined to be 60 m2 to match the selection of the cell size of drastic base maps fig 6 the swat model simulation period was from 2008 to 2013 due to data availability the simulation period 2008 to 2009 was used for model warm the generated results were considered baseline data for the model function model validation was processed using the nitrate concentration of water samples collected from water wells in the entire study area model results on the other hand were found to agree with the recharge estimates by mushtaha et al 2019 the receiver operating characteristic roc is a plot showing the true positive rate tpr known as sensitivity versus the false positive rate fpr and known as 1 specificity and is used to validate the level of data fitting in a specific model in various threshold settings nadiri et al 2019 the area under curve and the receiver operating characteristic roc auc ratio tool was used to validate the perfection of the two approaches the swat and the no swat approach nadiri et al 2019 the area under the roc curve ranges between 0 5 and 1 where 0 5 indicates zero correlation and 1 refers to a complete correlation nadiri et al 2019 2018 this curve of tpr versus fpr was used to validate the quality of the model performance in relation to occurrence or non occurrence of the results occurrence referred that the measured vulnerability classes conditioned vulnerability index cvi calculated as shown in eq 2 matches the modelled vulnerability index for both swat and no swat model 2 cvi vi max n o 3 max n o 3 i 4 results and discussion the current work intended to improve the input data of drastic within the study area by improving the recharge factor r using the swat model while the traditional method no swat uses a bulk resolution that does not account for the local characteristics of each cell within the study area including soil type surface slope climatic factors as well as land use and land cover lulc the newly developed approach using the swat model has incorporated these parameters using the hru concept 4 1 model verification various methods have been used to estimate recharge in the gaza strip on different occasions unfortunately these estimates have resulted in a variety of recharge values for multiple reasons these include the insufficient number of rainfall gauges around the gaza strip the nonuniform rainfall data used to estimate the water budget parameters such as runoff and evaporation and the discrepancies among the methods used a recent study quantified the recharge and runoff from the rainfall in the gaza strip using real historical field data mushtaha et al 2019 the estimated recharge 24 5 106 m3 year across the gaza strip area was in agreement with our current work which confirms the significance of applying the hru approach within the current study this includes the consideration of land use hydrological soil map and digital elevation map moreover the conventional no swat method does not account for the zonal operation and hence the recharge values tend to be more generalized over large areas due to the extrapolation on the other hand the application of the swat tool has carefully considered the gradual change of the vulnerability levels across the study area this is mainly due to the capacity of the swat tool to capture the spatial and temporal discretization through the introduction of hru concept kalcic et al 2015 indicated that the hru is a unique method to discretize large watersheds resulting in better identification of the local variation kalcic et al 2015 the use of the hru concept verified the gradual variation of the vulnerability levels over the study area by assigning local vulnerability variation regardless of the spatio temporal locations it has also resulted in smoothing the heterogeneity of the vulnerability distribution simulated from the conventional no swat method fig 7 a fig 7 b the results showed that the eastern part of the study area was less vulnerable compared to the western part fig 8 a however the vulnerability levels in the western part varied significantly from north to south the occasional very high vulnerability was noticed over the western part indicating the sensitivity of the swat tool to estimate local vulnerability changes fig 8 b this variation in vulnerability level was due to the hydrogeological nature of the study area the eastern part of the study area has deeper water table 67 m leading to higher groundwater protection since the water table factor is highly rated 5 the soil type in the eastern part was clayey loamy soil while sandy soil was encountered in the western parts pwa 2014 the topography of the study area has a general slight gentle slope 0 2 with occasional steep slopes 6 18 in the central region due to the sandy hills extending across the study area in a north south direction this varied slope resulted in varied vulnerability levels across the study area the greater the slope within the area the lower the vulnerability of the area where contaminants percolation is unlikely to happen li and merchant 2013 this slope distribution allowed stream formation and surface water flow in the north direction nevertheless the results generated from the conventional no swat method were dominated by two sets of extreme classifications with either very highly or very low vulnerable areas this is mainly due to the conventional method limitations where it lacks the discretization of the local hydrogeological parameters this poor classification makes it difficult to advise on any management plans and gives less adequacy towards the decision making process on the contrary results generated from swat presented a more precise vulnerability map with more representative vulnerability scales associated with a better representation of the study area the gradual capturing of the vulnerability variation over the study area was utilized through the hru application managed to capture the very slight vulnerability variation across the study area moreover the use of swat allowed for vulnerability normalization across the area by considering the local zonal function vulnerability of the local areas regardless of its spatial temporal characteristics chenini and ben mammou 2010 lathamani et al 2015 this seems to positively impact the vulnerability assessment where the improvement in detecting the vulnerability levels using the swat model was evident vulnerability assessment enhanced by approximately 52 table 2 as the difference between the summation of vulnerability classification in swat and no swat scenario it was indicated that two extreme vulnerability levels with either very low or very high vulnerability levels were resulted from the conventional method and accounted for 74 of the total study area this doesn t properly address the nature of the study area and doesn t highlight the slight variation in the hydrogeological condition across the study area meanwhile the use of the swat model resulted in a more accurate presentation of the study area by accounting for the local hydrogeological conditions the two extreme vulnerability categories calculated by the conventional method were moderate towards high moderate and low vulnerability assessment with 78 of the area within this range of vulnerability levels thus leaving only 22 of the area as either very high or very low this 52 of smoothed improvement identified various levels of vulnerability which allow for a better understanding of the local spatial conditions 4 2 model validation the groundwater aquifer in the gaza strip suffers high nitrate levels in general 150 mg l due to the random disposal of partially treated wastewater to the open areas as well as the extensive use of fertilizers particularly in northern gaza strip dawoud et al 2020 the swat model was validated using the nitrate concentration in the water wells within the study area the distribution of nitrate data from the records of the 64 water wells over the study area fig 9 between 2010 and 2016 was used to compare the model results where high nitrate level was assumed to overlay the high vulnerability areas however little shift of nitrate level was expected due to the lateral flow in the deep aquifer towards the western part as suggested by vengosh et al 2005 therefore the study area was segmented into two main segments where the delineation map shows two main reaches table 3 presents the nitrate classes corresponding to the nitrate concentrations while the conventional drastic no swat method resulted in the area being categorized with only two extreme vulnerability classes 36 very low vulnerability and 38 very high vulnerability the swat analysis has resulted in wider range of vulnerability levels accounting for the local vulnerability variation over the study area due to the introduction of the hru concept swat model shows a wider range of nitrate levels extends over five classes 1 4 accounting for the nitrate levels across the study area and simulated the actual nitrate values fig 10 presents the nitrate levels classes in the area versus the nitrate classes produced by swat and no swat analysis the results revealed that minimum residual error was encountered in the case of the swat model application for recharge estimations while nitrate first class 0 50 ppm has shown a maximum error residue of 20 in the case of swat application an error residue of 77 was noticed in the case of the conventional no swat application for the same nitrate class the same was noticed over all the remaining nitrate classes where swat application has proved closer and more valid nitrate estimate across the whole area compared to the no swat this indicates the adequacy of using the swat tool to account for the recharge factor and therefore for the vulnerability estimate where the vulnerability classes overplayed the nitrate classes fig 10 indicates that not only a high correlation between the swat and the nitrate measurements was observed but also the trend of nitrate development over the study area was highly interpreted by the swat classes unlike the very high residual error between the nitrate and the conventional no swat scenario particularly in the deep aquifer area a minimum residual error was observed in the case of the swat application in the areas with a deep aquifer class 1 and 2 this may highlight the significance of introducing the swat tool in the case of the deep groundwater aquifer fig 10 presents the vulnerability classes from the two methods swat and conventional no swat method the nitrate concentration was similarly grouped into five classes 1 5 based on the concentration level the vulnerability classes in both scenarios were compared against the nitrate levels and the results indicated a higher correlation between the distribution of nitrate classes and the swat vulnerability classes moreover swat method indicated lower error bars compared with the conventional method in all the classes which indicates that the vulnerability assessment is less dispersed around the mean with consistent vulnerability estimate this suggested an enhanced vulnerability assessment in case of swat method with greater match with the nitrate map based on the number of cells of each vulnerability category the area under curve representing the vulnerability distribution of the total study area was calculated results indicated that while 79 of area lies within extreme classes 1 and 5 in the case of the conventional method using no swat framework only 45 of the same area lies within these categories in the case of swat method this suggests an improvement in representing the vulnerability assessment with proper representation to the homogeneous aquifer in the area where no faults or physical barriers as shown in fig 11 swat framework has resulted in a better distribution for the vulnerability classes than the conventional no swat additionally although the analysis of both frameworks showed similar average mean value of the number of the cells within the same class yet a lower value of the standard deviation in the case of swat 316 compared to 448 in the case of the conventional no swat fig 12 illustrates the representation of the tp sensitivity versus the fp 1 specificity for both swat and no swat frameworks while the roc auc performance metrics for no swat was 0 79 it has increased to 0 96 in the case of swat referring to the model improvement in the case of the swat model 5 conclusions drastic is a valid method for the assessment of groundwater vulnerability wachniew et al 2016 this model depends on seven hydrogeological factors including the net recharge the current study has improved the estimation of one of the inputs for drastic specifically the recharging coefficient using the swat model which resulted in significant normalization of the vulnerability level over the study area swat model utilized the concept of hydrological recharge units hru where cells with similar hydrological parameters slope land use and land cover soil type and climatic conditions are grouped due to their identical recharging factor the study revealed that the produced recharge map using conventional no swat approach depending solely on the topsoil composition has resulted in a narrow vulnerability classification levels and were dominated by the extremes of either very low or very high vulnerability unfortunately this poorly represents the real situation where it lacks the consideration of the slight and smooth vulnerability transition over these two extremes the use of the swat model has provided more reliable vulnerability representation by considering the hru concept regardless of the spatial distribution of these units this has resulted in a higher resolution vulnerability map these findings are believed to support the decision making process since it utilizes the swat model results to decide on the locations for stormwater recharging lagoons in very higher vulnerability areas and infiltrating treated wastewater in very lower vulnerability areas to protect the aquifer there is a need for improving the baseline data to build better drastic maps for better final results such as higher dem maps accurate land use soil maps and weather data credit authorship contribution statement ziyad abunada conceptualization data

5037,the robustness of groundwater vulnerability assessment using the conventional drastic framework is highly dependent on the quality of the input data the current study investigates the vulnerability of the western part of the coastal aquifer of the gaza strip part of the palestinian southern western coastal aquifer the study intends to re introduce the recharge factor r in drastic framework through the application of swat model and investigates its impact on the quality of vulnerability assessment compared with the conventional drastic framework no swat not only a higher recharge resolution map was generated when applying the swat model but also an improved vulnerability index by 52 due to the incorporation of the local zonal operation vulnerability concept was achieved while the conventional drastic framework no swat resulted in 74 of the study area has either extreme high or extreme low vulnerability classes swat model was able to smoothen the vulnerability identification by capturing the slight gradual vulnerability variation over the study area with more precise vulnerability assessment the resulted vulnerability assessment was validated using real field nitratedata no 3 of water samples collected from the entire study area the vulnerability assessment using the swat model was in good agreement with the nitrate levels in the area compared with the conventional drastic where the residual error encountered in the case of swat application 20 was less than in the conventional drastic 77 the results were also validated using receiver operator classification roc and the area under curve auc confirming the improved assessment due to swat model application the current new approach is sought to support the decision making process and water managers to better manage the proposed aquifer recharge scheme in the study area as well as to better manage the limited water resources keywords aquifer management drastic gis vulnerability assessment decision support 1 introduction water scarcity has increased globally and meeting water demands has and will continue to be a challenge baalousha 2010 jang et al 2017 söderqvist et al 2015 vaux 2011 water scarcity is likely to be magnified by the deterioration of the currently available water resources particularly in arid and semi arid areas and due to the increased contamination events al adamat et al 2003 jang et al 2017 nobre et al 2007 the coastal aquifer in the gaza strip palestine has been under high stress imposed by groundwater over abstraction point source contamination wastewater discharge as well as seawater intrusion alslaibi et al 2017b degradation of groundwater quality along with the increasing water demandhas developed the need for restoration actions to protect the groundwater aquifer nitrate contamination of groundwater aquifer in the gaza strip is pandemic and the remediation of groundwater contamination is complex and at a high cost therefore effective protection measures as well as proper management options to prohibit further deterioration of the aquifer are needed the developing interest in protecting the coastal aquifer stems from the ongoing poor practices that negatively impact the quality of the groundwater particularly the high nitrate and chloride levels 150 ppm and 800 ppm respectively abunada and nassar 2015 alslaibi et al 2017a groundwater monitoring and sampling are among the most common techniques to evaluate the quality of groundwater however sampling and monitoring are costly and time consuming jang et al 2017 the groundwater vulnerability concept assumes that the physical environment can sustain a certain level of aquifer protection against contaminants leaching down to the groundwater leone et al 2009 groundwater vulnerability modelling provides a valid quick and fairly simple tool to effectively assess the vulnerability of groundwater aquifer with a reasonable understanding of potential pollution events as well as contaminants extent and delineation although groundwater vulnerability models use similar factors these models employ various approaches for data integration and analysis generally data is deployed into three categories index methods statistical procedures process based methods and or a combination of these methods li and merchant 2013 neukum and azzam 2009 oh et al 2011 yu et al 2010 among the groundwater vulnerability models drastic index is a widely used model used to assess the vulnerability of groundwater aquifer and to investigate the potential groundwater contamination under various events li and merchant 2013 saatsaz et al 2011 drastic encompasses a group of vulnerability factors that uses seven environmental parameters depth to water net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity to characterize the hydrogeological setting and evaluate aquifer vulnerability per the procedure of the u s environmental protection agency epa usepa 1985 it evaluates for the weighted sum of the hydrologic factors controlling the contaminant s leaching to aquifers through the vadose zone the model s simple formulation and the ease of integration with geographic information systems gis in addition to its flexibility to incorporate other factors have favoured its use over many other models lima et al 2011 many papers applied gis techniques in environmental modelling in gaza strip salem et al 2017 drastic approach provides a numerical ranking of various geological and hydrogeological factors that affect the contaminant transport from the surface to groundwater the recharge factor is among seven factors that control the transport of a pollutant to groundwater through a leaching process the recharge factor in drastic is a function of different parameters influenced by the surface hydrological conditions and climatic factors that affect aquifer vulnerability a study by aller et al 1987 acknowledged the limitations of assigning reasonable and accurate recharge values within drastic aller et al 1987 various applications of drastic have suggested the development of new recharge values that can provide better integration of these factors for better vulnerability assessment jang et al 2017 magesh et al 2012 oni et al 2017 unlike the other drastic factors the recharge factors is more vulnerable and subject to seasonal changes depending on the climatic conditions and surface hydrology estimated recharge values are normally generalized across the whole area regardless of the spatial and temporal variations due to the difficulty in measuring the recharge factor across the whole area effectively the authors are aware of the need to improve other drastic factors with higher weights including the vadose zone and the water depth however the current study is limited to investigate the impact of improving the recharge factor on the vulnerability assessment by introducing the soil water assessment tool swat gis model moreover the other drastic parameters are relatively less controllable and experience minimum variation within short time periods compared to the recharge factor swat is a comprehensive watershed scale model that incorporates several watershed characteristics such as land use and land cover soil type surface slope and climatic conditions to investigate the hydrological parameters of the study area estimating the groundwater recharge represents a challenge in many cases and prone to various errors due to poor data

water table fluctuation method wtf is one of the most common estimation methods based on measuring groundwater level over time and space through monitoring the water table level to evaluate the aquifer healy 2010 this method is applicable in areas with high aquifer fluctuation it requires intensive field measurements and is prone to some errors another method including the recession curve displacement is used when a series of groundwater recharge events occur consistently where the recession curve is moved upward due to a recharge event the meyboom method is another method used to estimate the average of groundwater recharge for a limited period normally 5 years yet the method is unsuitable in case of negative numbers szilagyi and jozsa 2013 discussed the use of remote sensing data from modis to estimate net groundwater recharge in nebraska usa the method utilizes a simplified water balance equation based on evapotranspiration maps obtained by linear transformation of satellite images with monthly precipitation drastic another simple direct and widely used framework for groundwater quality vulnerability assessment it has been applied by many researchers to study the vulnerability level of various groundwater aquifer aller et al 1987 although the few limitations of using drastic holden et al 1992 drastic has been widely used to assess the vulnerability level of aquifer whilst considering various evaluation criteria and hydrological parameters drastic is a simple low cost tool and requires low data input that provides sufficient accuracy to evaluate aquifer vulnerability in areas with complex geological formations mclay et al 2001 moreover drastic is a reconnaissance tool but has proven to work well in screening the aquifer vulnerability particularly in areas with interrupted data measurements it can be concluded that depending on the data availability and the objective of the research different methods for estimating groundwater recharge can be utilised the inconsistent and the poor quality data records available within the entire study area in the gaza strip made it convenient to endorse drastic for evaluating the aquifer vulnerability in the study area and estimating the recharge values swat model has been applied to estimate the recharge values by many researchers al dousari et al 2010 bailey et al 2016 gyamfi et al 2017 the current study aimed to 1 investigate the impact of applying swat gis model in estimating the recharge factor within the study area to the north of the gaza strip palestine 2 investigate the variation in vulnerability levels using both recharge maps resulted from the conventional interpolation method and the one resulted from the swat model application results from this study will support the decision makers in understanding the aquifer vulnerability within this area for further aquifer management measures it also intends to serve as a robust and valid tool for general groundwater vulnerability assessment where the recharge factors can be better estimated using swat model 2 study area the gaza strip occupying around 363 square km along the mediterranean sea just southwest of palestine and bordered by egypt in the south negev desert in the east and the green line in the north alslaibi et al 2017a fig 1 gaza strip the world s most densely populated area 1 8 million inhabitants in 364 km2 is facing an irreversible water and environmental crise with an unprecedented human disaster seems imminent alslaibi et al 2017a the coastal aquifer the sole water source in the gaza strip suffers from groundwater over abstraction 160 mcm yr associated with low annual precipitation 55 60 mcm yr this has resulted in a water deficit of about 120 mcm yr abu alnaeem et al 2018 pwa 2014 moreover the groundwater quality is undergoing severe deterioration including both groundwater salinization and nitrate build up due to the seawater intrusion and the unplanned disposal of the partially treated wastewater to the open areas respectively abu alnaeem et al 2018 moreover the northern area of the gaza strip is well known for its agricultural activities and the intensive use of fertilizers that increase the risk of contaminating the vulnerable aquifer in the area recent reports indicated that around 97 of the coastal aquifer in the gaza strip is unsuitable for human use and does not comply with the international drinking water standards united nations 2012 nitrate and chloride levels in some wells exceed 150 mg l and 800 mg l respectively al naeem et al 2019 this necessitates the need for unconventional water resources including wastewater reuse and recharge to mitigate the deterioration of the water resources and to release the stress from the groundwater aquifer abu alnaeem et al 2018 abunada and nassar 2015 this has also created the need for an aquifer vulnerability assessment to better design the recharging schemes proposed by the water authorities there and to manage the groundwater aquifer the current study evaluates the groundwater vulnerability in the northern gaza strip governorate applying drastic framework two recharge maps were obtained through the use of the conventional interpolation method and the swat model the two generated vulnerability maps were compared against the nitrate map in the study area the study area was selected for the following reasons i location of a newly constructed wastewater treatment plant 2018 with the plans to recharge the wastewater effluent annual 13 mcm into the groundwater aquifer ii a hot spot for unplanned agricultural activities with intensive use of fertilizers associated with direct disposal of partially treated wastewater to the open areas the random lake in the northern part of the study area and 111 the high levels of nitrate across the study area the coastal aquifer is one of the four main aquifers in the vicinity of the study area fig 2 this aquifer extends from haifa city in the north down to al arish in egypt towards the south west of the gaza strip escwa 2013 the pleistocene formations of the marine kurkar a at 50 m and continental kurkar b at 100 m depths qahman et al 2009 a cross section of part of the coastal aquifer is presented in fig 3 the study area lies towards the western part of the coastal aquifer where sub aquifers a b1 b2 and c underlies the targeted area in this paper thus this part of the coastal aquifer is considered an unconfined aquifer since the mentioned sub aquifers are not extending rather they act as lenses for specific parts qahman et al 2009 escwa 2013 and unesco 2015 the coastal aquifer reported to have an average transmissivity of 2 2 102 m2 sec and an estimated average hydraulic conductivity of 55 m day based on 24 wells pumping test the specific yield is estimated to be 15 30 escwa 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 setting up drastic various groundwater vulnerability models using either statistical methods or index methods have been in practice to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability against contaminants leaching koycegiz and buyukyildiz 2019 generally spatial models for groundwater assessment consist of three different types cartographic simple spatial and spatiotemporal drastic a simple spatial model is one of the most widely used models to assess groundwater vulnerability with valid applications in addressing the vulnerability levels in many areas douglas et al 2018 wu et al 2016 as a conceptual model drastic accounts for the most important hydrological and geological parameters that affect the potential leaching of contaminants down to the groundwater aquifer the adopted drastic parameters weights were according to aller et al 1987 drastic yields a numerical index map of groundwater vulnerability that is derived from the weights assigned to the seven parameters eq 1 1 drastic m a p d r w r r w a r w s r w t r w i r w c r w where the parameters mentioned are the rating multiplied by the weight corresponding to d the depth of the groundwater r the net recharge a the aquifer media s soil media t topography i the impact of the vadose zone and c the hydraulic conductivity drastic was used to evaluate the vulnerability of the groundwater aquifer in the northern part of the gaza strip 9 km north of gaza city the model boundaries were determined using the digital elevation model dem and the sub basins delineated within the study area as shown in fig 3 drastic uses weights rates and ranges to determine the impact of individual parameters and estimates its contribution to the vulnerability assessment shivhare et al 2018 thapa et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 the weight of each drastic factor refers to its relative importance as indicated by aller et al 1987 3 1 1 depth of water d the classification of the groundwater depth was grouped into six classes ranging from 3 to 67 m depth based on the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area the rates assigned for these groups ranged from 1 to 10 aller et al 1987 where high rating refers to high vulnerability as in the case of the shallow aquifer group 0 3 m fig 5 a the water levels were determined using well data records from 2010 to 2016 with average depths ranging from 30 m to 67 m weighted values from 5 to 45 were assigned across the study area as shown in table 1 and fig 5 a 3 1 2 aquifer media a the aquifer media at the water table depth influences the development of the groundwater plume the aquifer media was estimated using lithological datasets from 342 lithology logs for the entire gaza strip showing the soil type at various depths since the soil type was presented as discrete points hydraulic conductivity values were generated accordingly and the hydraulic conductivity map was estimated for the whole area at the groundwater average level once the aquifer media allows plume development then the area was viewed as highly vulnerable the aquifer media was grouped into four classes table 1 with each class was rated as per aller et al 1987 the rate was then multiplied by a factor of three to account for the weight of the aquifer media fig 5 b 3 1 3 soil media s soil media refers to the upper soil cover of the unsaturated zone which controls the amount of recharge and pollutants dispersion into the aquifer as well as its degradation the spread of the movement of a contaminant into the groundwater is controlled by several soil characteristics these include soil thickness which affects the time the contaminants reside within the media and soil texture and structure which influence the rate at which the contaminants percolate through the soil profile the soil media was obtained from the existing soil cover map for the surrounding area the soil media was grouped into five classes based on its leaching capacity so that the higher the soil leaching capacity the more vulnerable the area table 1 the soil media classes were then multiplied by a factor of two to account for the weight of the soil media factor as per aller et al 1987 as shown in fig 5 c 3 1 4 topography t the topography is expressed in terms of the slope of the land surface and influences the run off rate this in turn influences the quantity of water and contaminants percolation the steeper the slope the more runoff is expected and therefore the less vulnerable the area kisaka and lema 2016 the slope of the study area was calculated using a 30 meter digital elevation model dem and arcmap 10 2 the surface slope of the study area was grouped into five categories table 1 the topography rated classes were then multiplied by a factor of one to account for the weight of the topography factor aller et al 1987 as shown in fig 5 d 3 1 5 impact of vadose zone i the vadose zone the unsaturated zone between the topsoil and the groundwater table influences the potential leaching pathway of the contaminants from the topsoil down to the aquifer the higher the attenuation capacity of the vadose zone the less vulnerable the area kisaka and lema 2016 the characteristics of the vadose zone were identified from the soil lithology using existing water wells in the entire study area the lithology map was estimated using the thickness of the soil layers the soil within the study area was sandy with occasional clay lenses the soil type within the vadose zone was grouped into two categories with each group having an index number referring to the soil type this index number was then factored by five to account for the weight of the vadose zone factor as per drastic aller et al 1987 as shown in fig 5 e 3 1 6 conductivity c hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer the measure of its capacity to transmit water under certain hydraulic gradients influences the rate of the contaminant s movement within the aquifer alwathaf and mansouri 2011 an aquifer with high conductivity is more vulnerable to contamination as it increases the transport rate of the contaminated plume through the aquifer alwathaf and mansouri 2011 according to drastic the average conductivity values for the aquifer media were obtained from the soil lithology in the study area the values were grouped into five classes where each class represented a conductivity range aller et al 1987 the level of conductivity was then multiplied by a factor of three to account for the conductivity weight on the vulnerability of the area as shown in fig 5 f 3 2 the recharge factor in drastic framework 3 2 1 the conventional drastic framework recharge is one of the important factors for vulnerability assessment using drastic framework it is defined as the amount of water infiltrating from top soil down to the groundwater table through the vadose zone and measured in mm per year kisaka and lema 2016 the idea of improving the recharge factor stems from aller et al 1987 where they claimed that the estimate of net recharge in drastic framework is impractical and associated with vague estimates since the values of recharge are often calculated for specific local areas aller et al 1987 therefore an extrapolation is required to obtain recharge values for the remaining study area moreover the recharge estimate using drastic does not account for the average annual amount of infiltration without considering rainfall intensity distribution and duration although the water depth and the vadose zone have higher weight 5 than the recharge factors yet there is a slim opportunity to control and improve these parameters the impact of applying improved recharge factor estimate using the application of the swat gis tool within the conventional drastic framework has been thoroughly investigated within the current study the recharge factor was calculated first using the conventional method by extrapolating the available discrete surface recharge values for specific points within the study area to assign the general recharge values over the entire area pwa 2014 the index number was determined based on five recharge values and a weight of four was assigned to reflect the importance of the recharge factor aller et al 1987 second the recharge values were then calculated by incorporating the local zonal operation vulnerability using the hydrological response unit hru concept the significance of improving the recharge factor is related to the phreatic nature of the aquifer in the study area as well as the potential lateral contaminants transport with the groundwater plume lima et al 2011 fig 5 summarizes drastic frameworks maps 3 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat analysis swat gis tool was used to improve the accuracy of the recharge factor that represents an input of drastic the estimation of recharge values using swat model incorporates specific parameters within the study area these parameters included soil climatic conditions surface slope as well as land use land cover lulc datasets the application of the swat tool includes the introduction of the hrus where each hru has a distinct slope lulc and soil type hence swat model views the study area in terms of hru units regardless of their spatial locations an hru is the smallest spatial unit in the swat model that defines the specific spatial locations after the identification of the various recharge values using the swat model the swat designed to calculate the groundwater recharge on the hru level based on an exponential decay weighting function adopted from swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 hrus were then joined using the gis tool to the corresponding hru shapefile the recharge values were rated and weighted according to the rates and weights aller et al 1987 the hru shapefile with the recharge values was rasterized and the size of each hru cell was determined to be 60 m2 to match the selection of the cell size of drastic base maps fig 6 the swat model simulation period was from 2008 to 2013 due to data availability the simulation period 2008 to 2009 was used for model warm the generated results were considered baseline data for the model function model validation was processed using the nitrate concentration of water samples collected from water wells in the entire study area model results on the other hand were found to agree with the recharge estimates by mushtaha et al 2019 the receiver operating characteristic roc is a plot showing the true positive rate tpr known as sensitivity versus the false positive rate fpr and known as 1 specificity and is used to validate the level of data fitting in a specific model in various threshold settings nadiri et al 2019 the area under curve and the receiver operating characteristic roc auc ratio tool was used to validate the perfection of the two approaches the swat and the no swat approach nadiri et al 2019 the area under the roc curve ranges between 0 5 and 1 where 0 5 indicates zero correlation and 1 refers to a complete correlation nadiri et al 2019 2018 this curve of tpr versus fpr was used to validate the quality of the model performance in relation to occurrence or non occurrence of the results occurrence referred that the measured vulnerability classes conditioned vulnerability index cvi calculated as shown in eq 2 matches the modelled vulnerability index for both swat and no swat model 2 cvi vi max n o 3 max n o 3 i 4 results and discussion the current work intended to improve the input data of drastic within the study area by improving the recharge factor r using the swat model while the traditional method no swat uses a bulk resolution that does not account for the local characteristics of each cell within the study area including soil type surface slope climatic factors as well as land use and land cover lulc the newly developed approach using the swat model has incorporated these parameters using the hru concept 4 1 model verification various methods have been used to estimate recharge in the gaza strip on different occasions unfortunately these estimates have resulted in a variety of recharge values for multiple reasons these include the insufficient number of rainfall gauges around the gaza strip the nonuniform rainfall data used to estimate the water budget parameters such as runoff and evaporation and the discrepancies among the methods used a recent study quantified the recharge and runoff from the rainfall in the gaza strip using real historical field data mushtaha et al 2019 the estimated recharge 24 5 106 m3 year across the gaza strip area was in agreement with our current work which confirms the significance of applying the hru approach within the current study this includes the consideration of land use hydrological soil map and digital elevation map moreover the conventional no swat method does not account for the zonal operation and hence the recharge values tend to be more generalized over large areas due to the extrapolation on the other hand the application of the swat tool has carefully considered the gradual change of the vulnerability levels across the study area this is mainly due to the capacity of the swat tool to capture the spatial and temporal discretization through the introduction of hru concept kalcic et al 2015 indicated that the hru is a unique method to discretize large watersheds resulting in better identification of the local variation kalcic et al 2015 the use of the hru concept verified the gradual variation of the vulnerability levels over the study area by assigning local vulnerability variation regardless of the spatio temporal locations it has also resulted in smoothing the heterogeneity of the vulnerability distribution simulated from the conventional no swat method fig 7 a fig 7 b the results showed that the eastern part of the study area was less vulnerable compared to the western part fig 8 a however the vulnerability levels in the western part varied significantly from north to south the occasional very high vulnerability was noticed over the western part indicating the sensitivity of the swat tool to estimate local vulnerability changes fig 8 b this variation in vulnerability level was due to the hydrogeological nature of the study area the eastern part of the study area has deeper water table 67 m leading to higher groundwater protection since the water table factor is highly rated 5 the soil type in the eastern part was clayey loamy soil while sandy soil was encountered in the western parts pwa 2014 the topography of the study area has a general slight gentle slope 0 2 with occasional steep slopes 6 18 in the central region due to the sandy hills extending across the study area in a north south direction this varied slope resulted in varied vulnerability levels across the study area the greater the slope within the area the lower the vulnerability of the area where contaminants percolation is unlikely to happen li and merchant 2013 this slope distribution allowed stream formation and surface water flow in the north direction nevertheless the results generated from the conventional no swat method were dominated by two sets of extreme classifications with either very highly or very low vulnerable areas this is mainly due to the conventional method limitations where it lacks the discretization of the local hydrogeological parameters this poor classification makes it difficult to advise on any management plans and gives less adequacy towards the decision making process on the contrary results generated from swat presented a more precise vulnerability map with more representative vulnerability scales associated with a better representation of the study area the gradual capturing of the vulnerability variation over the study area was utilized through the hru application managed to capture the very slight vulnerability variation across the study area moreover the use of swat allowed for vulnerability normalization across the area by considering the local zonal function vulnerability of the local areas regardless of its spatial temporal characteristics chenini and ben mammou 2010 lathamani et al 2015 this seems to positively impact the vulnerability assessment where the improvement in detecting the vulnerability levels using the swat model was evident vulnerability assessment enhanced by approximately 52 table 2 as the difference between the summation of vulnerability classification in swat and no swat scenario it was indicated that two extreme vulnerability levels with either very low or very high vulnerability levels were resulted from the conventional method and accounted for 74 of the total study area this doesn t properly address the nature of the study area and doesn t highlight the slight variation in the hydrogeological condition across the study area meanwhile the use of the swat model resulted in a more accurate presentation of the study area by accounting for the local hydrogeological conditions the two extreme vulnerability categories calculated by the conventional method were moderate towards high moderate and low vulnerability assessment with 78 of the area within this range of vulnerability levels thus leaving only 22 of the area as either very high or very low this 52 of smoothed improvement identified various levels of vulnerability which allow for a better understanding of the local spatial conditions 4 2 model validation the groundwater aquifer in the gaza strip suffers high nitrate levels in general 150 mg l due to the random disposal of partially treated wastewater to the open areas as well as the extensive use of fertilizers particularly in northern gaza strip dawoud et al 2020 the swat model was validated using the nitrate concentration in the water wells within the study area the distribution of nitrate data from the records of the 64 water wells over the study area fig 9 between 2010 and 2016 was used to compare the model results where high nitrate level was assumed to overlay the high vulnerability areas however little shift of nitrate level was expected due to the lateral flow in the deep aquifer towards the western part as suggested by vengosh et al 2005 therefore the study area was segmented into two main segments where the delineation map shows two main reaches table 3 presents the nitrate classes corresponding to the nitrate concentrations while the conventional drastic no swat method resulted in the area being categorized with only two extreme vulnerability classes 36 very low vulnerability and 38 very high vulnerability the swat analysis has resulted in wider range of vulnerability levels accounting for the local vulnerability variation over the study area due to the introduction of the hru concept swat model shows a wider range of nitrate levels extends over five classes 1 4 accounting for the nitrate levels across the study area and simulated the actual nitrate values fig 10 presents the nitrate levels classes in the area versus the nitrate classes produced by swat and no swat analysis the results revealed that minimum residual error was encountered in the case of the swat model application for recharge estimations while nitrate first class 0 50 ppm has shown a maximum error residue of 20 in the case of swat application an error residue of 77 was noticed in the case of the conventional no swat application for the same nitrate class the same was noticed over all the remaining nitrate classes where swat application has proved closer and more valid nitrate estimate across the whole area compared to the no swat this indicates the adequacy of using the swat tool to account for the recharge factor and therefore for the vulnerability estimate where the vulnerability classes overplayed the nitrate classes fig 10 indicates that not only a high correlation between the swat and the nitrate measurements was observed but also the trend of nitrate development over the study area was highly interpreted by the swat classes unlike the very high residual error between the nitrate and the conventional no swat scenario particularly in the deep aquifer area a minimum residual error was observed in the case of the swat application in the areas with a deep aquifer class 1 and 2 this may highlight the significance of introducing the swat tool in the case of the deep groundwater aquifer fig 10 presents the vulnerability classes from the two methods swat and conventional no swat method the nitrate concentration was similarly grouped into five classes 1 5 based on the concentration level the vulnerability classes in both scenarios were compared against the nitrate levels and the results indicated a higher correlation between the distribution of nitrate classes and the swat vulnerability classes moreover swat method indicated lower error bars compared with the conventional method in all the classes which indicates that the vulnerability assessment is less dispersed around the mean with consistent vulnerability estimate this suggested an enhanced vulnerability assessment in case of swat method with greater match with the nitrate map based on the number of cells of each vulnerability category the area under curve representing the vulnerability distribution of the total study area was calculated results indicated that while 79 of area lies within extreme classes 1 and 5 in the case of the conventional method using no swat framework only 45 of the same area lies within these categories in the case of swat method this suggests an improvement in representing the vulnerability assessment with proper representation to the homogeneous aquifer in the area where no faults or physical barriers as shown in fig 11 swat framework has resulted in a better distribution for the vulnerability classes than the conventional no swat additionally although the analysis of both frameworks showed similar average mean value of the number of the cells within the same class yet a lower value of the standard deviation in the case of swat 316 compared to 448 in the case of the conventional no swat fig 12 illustrates the representation of the tp sensitivity versus the fp 1 specificity for both swat and no swat frameworks while the roc auc performance metrics for no swat was 0 79 it has increased to 0 96 in the case of swat referring to the model improvement in the case of the swat model 5 conclusions drastic is a valid method for the assessment of groundwater vulnerability wachniew et al 2016 this model depends on seven hydrogeological factors including the net recharge the current study has improved the estimation of one of the inputs for drastic specifically the recharging coefficient using the swat model which resulted in significant normalization of the vulnerability level over the study area swat model utilized the concept of hydrological recharge units hru where cells with similar hydrological parameters slope land use and land cover soil type and climatic conditions are grouped due to their identical recharging factor the study revealed that the produced recharge map using conventional no swat approach depending solely on the topsoil composition has resulted in a narrow vulnerability classification levels and were dominated by the extremes of either very low or very high vulnerability unfortunately this poorly represents the real situation where it lacks the consideration of the slight and smooth vulnerability transition over these two extremes the use of the swat model has provided more reliable vulnerability representation by considering the hru concept regardless of the spatial distribution of these units this has resulted in a higher resolution vulnerability map these findings are believed to support the decision making process since it utilizes the swat model results to decide on the locations for stormwater recharging lagoons in very higher vulnerability areas and infiltrating treated wastewater in very lower vulnerability areas to protect the aquifer there is a need for improving the baseline data to build better drastic maps for better final results such as higher dem maps accurate land use soil maps and weather data credit authorship contribution statement ziyad abunada conceptualization data

5038,this study assesses the impact of climate change on water resources in the upper blue nile abay river basin using a regional climate model rcm cosmo climate limited area model cclm coupled with a hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat the swat model was calibrated and validated using measured streamflow data from four gauging stations climate change projections showed increases in mean annual temperature and decrease in precipitation in most parts of the basin such changes are expected to affect the hydrologic regime of the basin these were assessed by running the swat model with the past 1981 2010 and future 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 climate scenarios the results show an increase of potential evapotranspiration pet by up to 27 by the end of the 21st century under rcp8 5 compared to the baseline period surface runoff is projected to increase by up to 14 however the increase in surface runoff could not increase the total water yield of the basin instead the total water yield of the basin is estimated to decrease by 1 7 to 6 5 and 10 7 to 22 7 for simulations forced by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively by the end of the 21st century the contribution of baseflow to the total water yield of the basin is also projected to decline to 11 4 from 41 3 during the baseline period the decrease in baseflow partly explains the decline in the total water yield of the basin such changes in the hydrologic balance will have significant implications for water management in the basin keywords climate change water resources swat rcm upper blue

resources through its impact on hydrological variables such as precipitation and temperature which in turn affect the hydrological cycle huntington 2006 the intensity timing and frequency of e g runoff floods and droughts are strongly linked with climate variability and change ipcc 2007 with projected global warming these effects will be particularly severe over areas such as ethiopia that have already been affected by climate variability in the past conway and schipper 2011 however large uncertainties remain over the projected precipitation change for large areas of africa monerie et al 2017 dosio et al 2019 2020 where the majority of climate models project a statistically significant change in mean precipitation but they do not agree on its sign the ethiopian part of the blue nile abay river basin is one of the areas of the country most sensitive to climate change conway 2005 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 beyene et al 2010 over the next decades it is expected to experience

2009 beyene et al 2010 girma 2012 cherie 2013 the basin s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change is enhanced by the dependence of the basin s economy about 85 of the basin s population on rain fed agriculture coupled with poor land management and low adaptive capacity entro 2006 the limited water availability and the increasing demand for water from different sectors could also contribute to the vulnerability of the basin to water stress as the climate changes bates et al 2008 di baldassarre et al 2011 mccartney and girma 2012 in fact under the current climate as well the water resource of the blue nile basin which provides an invaluable source of livelihood to over 300 million people in ethiopia and the downstream countries of sudan and egypt is strongly affected by and sensitive to variability in climatic conditions because of its geopolitical and socio economic importance several studies using different climate and hydrologic models have analyzed impacts of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the blue nile river basin e g conway and hulme 1996 yates and strzepek 1998 soliman et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 beyene et al

however they reported contrasting results regarding the likely impacts of climate change on water resources of the basin the discrepancy in the results of these studies is related to several factors including e g the different typology and often limited number of climate and hydrological models used the time period and emission scenario considered and the availability and quality of observational data necessary to calibrate and validate the hydrological model setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2015 for instance conway and hulme 1996 used three global circulation models gcms and estimated the flow in the blue nile in 2025 to range from an increase of 15 to a decrease of 9 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 used six gcms and projected an average increase of 4 in the annual flow of the blue nile by 2050 with the change over the basin ranging between 32 and 80 similarly soliman et al 2009 using a regional climate model rcm reported an increase of about 1 5 per annum 740 106 m3 yr 1 in the flow of the blue nile aich et al 2014 who used bias corrected data from five gcms under rcp2 6 rcp8 5 also projected a longer and more intense rainy season and frequent flooding in the future for the blue nile basin on the other hand elshamy et al 2009 analyzed 17 bias corrected statistically downscaled gcms and reported an average reduction of 15 ranging from 60 to 45 in the flow of the blue nile by the end of the 21st century cherie 2013 used three statistically downscaled gcms and projected a reduction of 10 to 61 in the flow of the blue nile by the end of the 21st century haile et al 2017 used six dynamically downscaled gcms to understand the implications of global warming under 2 c for blue nile basin hydrology and projected a decrease of water yield for the basin a study by beyene et al 2010 using 11 bias corrected statistically downscaled gcms estimated a change in flow at the high aswan dam had ranging from a decrease of 32 to an increase of 15 girma 2012 who used the cosmo climate limited area model cclm and the regional atmosphere model remo rcms forced by echam5 gcm found widely divergent results ranging from an increase of 9 to a decrease of 10 from the cclm and consistent increases of 103 and 141 for remo rcms by mid and end of the 21st century respectively likewise studies in the sub basins of the blue nile also reported contrasting results abdo et al 2009 dile et al 2013 and adem et al 2016 using a single statistically downscaled gcm hadcm3 projected an increase of streamflow for gilgel abay sub basin worqlul et al 2018 also using a single statistically downscaled gcm projected an increase of streamflow for gilgel beles and main beles sub basins by up to 64 in dry seasons and a decrease by 19 in wet seasons wagena et al 2016 analyzed the impact of climate change for two future periods 2041 2065 and 2075 2099 using six downscaled and bias corrected coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 gcms and predicted an increase in the streamflow between 22 and 27 for tana and beles sub basins in contrast setegn et al 2011 who analyzed the impact of climate change on streamflow of tana sub basin using data from nine climate models for two time periods 2046 2065 and 2080 2100 reported a statistically significant decline in annual streamflow for four of the nine gcms investigated for the 2080 2100 period the above studies reporting large variations in both magnitude and sign of the projected change in the flow of the blue nile river highlights our limited understanding of the underlying uncertainties in impact assessments the uncertainties related to the hydrological modelling chain include e g the climate model results sensitive to e g horizontal resolution physical parameterizations etc the availability and quality of observational data used to calibrate the hydrological model the calibration procedure and differences in downscaling techniques in the simulation of hydrological impacts of climate change etc these uncertainties may complicate the planning for sustainable development of water resources in the basin and downstream countries of sudan and egypt thus there is a need for further studies to better understand the likely impacts of climate change on water resources of the basin with a view to shed light on effective adaptation strategies and sustainable management of water resources in the basin in this study to assess the impact of projected climate change on water resources in the upper blue nile river basin we used the results of a state of the art rcm forced by an ensemble of cmip5 gcms and a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model calibrated and validated by using multiple spatially distributed gauge stations the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the data and methodologies used section 3 presents results and discussion and section 4 is conclusions derived from the findings of the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the upper blue nile river basin is located in the northwestern part of ethiopia between 7045 to 12045 n and 34005 to 39045 e fig 1 it drains an area of about 176 000 km2 that covers about 17 of ethiopia the blue nile leaves lake tana and flows through a series of deep valleys and canyons and joins the white nile at khartoum the sudan several tributaries join the blue nile abay river between lake tana and the sudanese border it is the largest unit of the nile basin in terms of the volume of discharge with a mean annual discharge of 48 5 billion m3 1536 m3 s 1 conway 2000 it also contributes more than 60 of the annual flow of the nile river conway 2000 the topography of the basin is rugged elevation ranges from 490 m asl near the ethio sudan border to 4260 m asl around the central part of the basin the geology of the highland parts of the basin is mainly volcanic rocks and precambrian basement complex rocks with small areas of sedimentary rocks while the lowlands are mainly basement complex and metamorphic rocks conway 2000 awulachew et al 2009 the main soil types in the basin include leptosols nitisols vertisols and cambisols which account for 21 16 15 and 9 of the basin area respectively betrie et al 2011 soils are generally deeper in the lowland part of the basin and very shallow on steep slopes the basin is dominated by agricultural land use about 60 with woodlands and grasslands shrublands covering 25 and 7 of the basin area respectively kim et al 2008 the climate of the basin varies from humid in the highland to semiarid in the lowland parts of the basin rainfall varies significantly with altitude and it is to a large extent controlled by the seasonal movement of air masses associated with the inter tropical convergence zone itcz most of the rain occurs in the summer season locally called kiremt june to september with a peak in july or august conway 2000 thus over 80 of its annual streamflow occurs from july to october kim et al 2008 the annual rainfall of the basin varies from 1000 mm yr 1 in the northeast to above 2000 mm yr 1 in the southwest of the basin with an average of 1420 mm yr 1 conway 2000 kim et al 2008 the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated to range from 1000 mm to 1800 mm yr 1 conway 2000 the mean annual temperature of the basin is 18 5 c and it shows temporal and spatial variation the average temperature of the basin is 17 7 c during the summer kiremt season and it rises to 20 1 c in the winter season locally known as bega kim et al 2008 the basin is endowed with rich biodiversity which supports the lives and livelihoods of millions of people through the provision of ecosystem services and products gauging stations used for the calibration and validation purposes were gummera gilgel abay near merawi kessie and blue nile at el diem a short description of these gauging stations is provided below the gummera and gilgel abay near merawi gauging stations are located in the lake tana sub basin at the outlet of gummera and gilgel abay watersheds respectively the gummera watershed is situated in the southeast of lake tana and covers a drainage area of about 1 464 km2 with elevations ranging from 1 780 to 3 678 m asl it is a predominantly agricultural area the topography of the gummera watershed is characterized by mountainous highly rugged and dissected terrain with steep slopes in the upper and middle parts and valley floors with flat to gentle slopes in the lower part of the watershed gilgel abay watershed is situated in the southern part of lake tana sub basin it covers a drainage area of about 1 600 km2 elevations in the watershed range from 1 780 to 3 678 m asl agriculture is the dominant land use in the watershed the southeastern part of the watershed is characterized by high mountains while the remaining area i e around 70 is characterized by flat to gentle slopes kessie covers a drainage area of approximately 65 000 km2 and incorporates the gummera ribb gilgel abay and jemma sub basins the kessie station is located on the main stem of the blue nile river the land use is predominately agriculture and elevations range from 1 000 to 4 300 m asl 2 2 the swat model description among the available hydrological models the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 version 2012 was selected for this study the swat model has been extensively and successfully used in assessing climate change impacts on water resources e g jha et al 2004 marshal and randhir 2008 abbaspour et al 2009 ficklin et al 2009 franczyk and chang 2009 setegn et al 2011 dile et al 2013 adem et al 2016 wagena et al 2016 tegegne et al 2017 its computational efficiency to operate on a large scale in a reasonable time ability to predict long term impacts as a continuous model and ability to use readily available datasets gassman et al 2007 are the reasons for its widespread use it is a physically based semi distributed basin scale continuous time hydrological and agricultural management practice simulation model that operates on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2005 gassman et al 2007 in swat the spatial heterogeneity of the basin is represented by dividing the basin into multiple sub basins connected by a stream network the sub basins are further subdivided into homogeneous hydrological response units hrus based on unique combinations of soil land cover and slope characteristics subdividing the main basin into hrus allows the model to reflect differences in evapotranspiration and other hydrological conditions fitzhugh and mackay 2000 and simulate a high level of spatial details neitsch et al 2005 swat simulates hydrologic processes based on the water balance equation eq 1 neitsch et al 2005 swt swo ri qi eti pi qri where swt and swo are the final and initial soil water content mm r daily rainfall mm q daily surface runoff mm et daily evapotranspiration mm p daily percolation mm and qr daily lateral flow mm the hydrology component of the swat model computes the water balance based on daily amounts of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff percolation and base flow simulations are performed at the hru level and summed up in each sub basin each sub basin guides the loads towards the basin outlet swat estimates surface runoff from daily rainfall using the modified soil conservation service scs curve number cn method scs cn usda 1972 and the green ampt infiltration method green and ampt 1911 the scs cn method was used in this study as well the scs cn estimates surface runoff based on local land use soil type and antecedent moisture conditions the swat model computes evaporation from soils and plants separately potential evapotranspiration pet is calculated with the hargreaves method which is appropriate given the limited availability of climate variables from the model output however the swat model has been calibrated and validated over the reference period using both the hargreaves and the penman monteith methods forced by observed meteorological variables showing consistent results potential soil water evaporation is estimated as a function of pet and leaf area index area of plant leaves relative to the soil surface area actual soil water evaporation is estimated using an exponential function of soil depth and water content plant water evaporation is simulated as a linear function of pet leaf area index and root depth and can be limited by soil water content the soil layer is subdivided into multiple layers to support soil water processes such as infiltration evaporation plant uptake lateral flow and percolation to lower layers downward flow occurs when the field capacity of a soil layer is exceeded and the layer below is not saturated percolation from the bottom of the soil profile recharges the shallow aquifer lateral sub surface flow in the soil profile is calculated simultaneously with percolation groundwater flow contribution to total streamflow is simulated by routing the shallow aquifer storage component to the stream channel runoff routing is simulated using the variable storage routing method neitsch et al 2005 2 3 model set up the swat model requires a digital elevation model dem soil and land use land cover data for delineation of sub basins and hru the dem which was generated from a 30 30 m shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data obtained from nasa s website http srtm csi cgiar org was used to generate stream networks on the basis of the generated stream networks 31 sub basins were delineated fig 1 about 586 hrus were then created considering dominant soil and land use land cover types within each sub basin for this study a 10 threshold values for land use land cover soil and slope layers were considered i e land units below the threshold size were not considered the land use land cover scale 1 250 000 and soil scale 1 250 000 data that were obtained from the ministry of water and energy mowe were reclassified to match the swat database requirement the slope data derived from the dem was also reclassified to correspond with the swat database requirement the swat model requires meteorological i e daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation data as the driving data in the present study for calibration and validation purposes we used observation data from 54 weather stations in the basin for the period 1981 2010 daily records were obtained from the national meteorological agency nma missing values were filled in using the swat weather generator i e wxgen model swat considers one set of weather information for each sub basin thus in this study at least 31 sets of weather information were required to force the model when more than one observation station falls within a sub basin swat chooses the one nearest to the sub basin centroid then the daily average values of the stations that fall in each sub basin were calculated and used to force the model 2 4 model calibration validation and uncertainty analysis observed daily discharge data from four spatially representative gauging stations were used for model calibration and validation purposes fig 1 nineteen years of data 1984 2003 were used for model calibration and five years of data 2003 2008 for model validation a warm up period of four years was employed so that the initial conditions would not affect the model calibration sensitive parameters used for model calibration were identified through sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out using a swat sensitivity analysis tool that uses the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat van griensven et al 2006 based on the initial sensitivity analysis and results of previous studies in the basin e g easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 girma 2012 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 cherie 2013 gebremicael et al 2013 tegegne et al 2017 roth et al 2018 a set of 12 parameters were chosen for calibration of the swat model the description and range of parameters used in the swat calibration are given in table 1 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 of the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was used to calibrate the model sufi 2 is a multi site semi automated inverse modeling technique that uses the latin hypercube sampling scheme thus efficient in calculating optimal results compared to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue parameter solution parasol and bayesian inference techniques yang et al 2008 sufi 2 uses p factor to measure uncertainties that emanate from the uncertainties in driving variables e g daily rainfall and temperature conceptual model parameters and observed discharge data the p factor is the percentage of data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band abbaspour et al 2007 the maximum value for the p factor is 100 in this method uncertainties are mapped onto the parameter ranges which are calibrated to bracket most of the measured data in the 95ppu abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 also uses r factor to measure the strength of a calibration and uncertainty analysis the r factors were calculated as the ratio between the average thickness of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured data it represents the width of the uncertainty interval and should be as small as possible i e close to or smaller than 1 abbaspour 2007 the nash sutcliff ns coefficient between observed and simulated discharges was used as an objective function for model optimization the model was iterated by adjusting the parameters within the acceptable range until the model simulation results reached an acceptable level as per the model performance measures since flow data at el diem was available at the monthly time step the model was run for a monthly time step the model validation was done by running the model for different simulation periods with input parameters calibrated earlier using a validation dataset as input 2 5 model performance evaluation the performance of the swat model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r2 defined according to eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 nse 1 i 1 n x i obs x i sim i 1 n x i obs x obs 3 r 2 i 1 n x i obs x obs x i obs x sim i 1 n x i obs x obs 2 0 5 i 1 n x i sim x sim 2 0 5 where nse is the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency r2 is the coefficient of determination x i obs is the observed flow data in m3s 1 x obs is the mean value of the observed data x i sim is the simulated flow data in m3s 1 and x sim is the mean value of simulated data r2 describes the correlation between observed and simulated values it is an indicator of the strength of the relationship between the observed and simulated values r2 ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no correlation and 1 represents a perfect correlation and values greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable van liew et al 2003 the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is the ratio of the residual variance to the measured data variance it indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line it ranges between and 1 0 with nse of 1 indicating a perfect fit values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally considered acceptable levels of performance whereas values 0 0 are not acceptable and indicate that the mean of the measured values is a better predictor than the simulated value model performances were classified as excellent for r2 or nse 0 90 very good for r2 or nse 0 75 0 89 good for r2 or nse 0 50 0 74 fair for r2 or nse 0 25 0 49 poor for r2 or nse 0 0 24 and unsatisfactory for r2 or nse 0 moriasi et al 2007 in addition to nse and r2 a graphical comparison of the simulated and observed data was used to evaluate the model performance 2 6 modelling of climate induced hydrologic changes to analyze climate induced hydrologic changes climate forcings from baseline 1980 2010 and future periods 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s were used as inputs to the calibrated swat model climate forcings for the simulation of climate induced hydrologic changes were derived from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa project these sets of climate data were generated using the cosmo clm cclm rcm forced by three gcms i e cnrm cm5 ec earth and mpi esm lr under two representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 cclm is a three dimensional non hydrostatic rcm schättler et al 2009 it was developed from the local model lm of the german weather service baldauf et al 2011 the equations are solved on an arakawa c grid arakawa and lambs 1977 using a hybrid terrain following coordinate on a rotated geographical coordinate system the rcm runs are available at a spatial resolution of 50 km following the cordex protocol details about the domain and implementation of boundary conditions for the regional model including an analysis of cclm performances over africa are extensively described in panitz et al 2014 dosio et al 2015 and dosio and panitz 2016 recent studies e g graham et al 2007 leander and buishand 2007 akhtar et al 2008 have also used rcm outputs directly to force hydrological models changes in the simulated discharge in the basin were then compared between the baseline 1981 2010 and the future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat calibration and validation sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the parameters that have the highest sensitivity the results showed that among the selected parameters curve number cn2 soil evaporation compensation factor esco and available soil water capacity sol awc from the surface runoff parameters and groundwater revap coefficient gw revap threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer gwqmn groundwater delay gw delay baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and recharge to deep aquifer rchrg dp from the subsurface response parameters were found to be the most sensitive parameters i e p value 0 05 for streamflow simulation in the basin this result suggests that parameters representing the processes of surface and subsurface runoff generation play key roles in the hydrological process of the blue nile basin in other words accurate estimation of these parameters is important for streamflow simulation in the basin unlike most studies in the basin e g betrie et al 2011 girma 2012 cherie 2013 gebremicael et al 2013 the swat model was calibrated and validated using monthly measured streamflow data from four gauging stations in the basin over the 1984 2003 and 2004 2008 periods respectively calibrating the model at the sub basin outlets improved model parameterization compared to calibrating the model only at the outlet of the basin the streamflow data from el diem gauging station only covers the period from 2000 to 2008 from these the data from 2000 to 2003 were used for model calibration and data from 2004 to 2008 for model validation table 2 illustrates the estimated model calibration and validation efficiency values for monthly streamflow for the four gauging stations the calibrated swat model for the four spatially distributed gauging stations within the blue nile basin showed good to very good performance for mean monthly streamflow prediction r2 from 0 64 to 0 88 and nse from 0 61 to 0 86 between mean monthly measured and mean monthly predicted streamflow values table 2 during the model validation period the swat model demonstrated good to very good performance r2 from 0 58 to 0 84 and nse from 0 57 to 0 80 table 2 fig 2 the performance of the model was satisfactory and comparable with previous studies in the basin such as easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 and gebremicael et al 2013 who reported nse values of 0 53 to 0 92 and r2 of 0 73 to 0 92 nse value of 0 68 and nse value of 0 80 and r2 of 0 89 respectively for calibration of daily flow at el diem station these results indicate a reasonable ability of the swat model to capture the hydrological processes in the blue nile basin using the given set of parameters the model predicted both baseflow and peak flow reasonably well fig 2 overall since the statistical results are satisfactory the swat model can be applied to understand the dynamic water balance processes and to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow in the basin the applicability of the swat model in the basin was also confirmed by previous researchers e g easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 setegn et al 2011 girma 2012 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 cherie 2013 dile et al 2013 gebremicael et al 2013 adem et al 2016 wagena et al 2016 tegegne et al 2017 roth et al 2018 the p factor which is the percentage of observations bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu brackets 63 of the observation and r factor equals 0 6 for calibration at the outlet of the blue nile basin el diem showed that the model captured the observations very well 3 2 changes in temperature and precipitation table 3 shows changes in the mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures and mean annual precipitation in the basin by the end of the 21st century relative to the 1981 2010 baseline period the results show substantial differences across rcm runs and between rcp scenarios the mean annual maximum temperatures in the basin are projected to increase by up to 2 48 c under rcp4 5 and 4 89 c under rcp8 5 by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 similar warming trends are projected for the mean annual minimum temperature which is expected to increase by 2 22 c to 4 74 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively warming trends of mean annual temperature over the basin was also reported by other studies e g kim et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 beyene et al 2010 girma 2012 cherie 2013 aich et al 2014 wagena et al 2016 dosio 2017 roth et al 2018 worqlul et al 2018 model results also reveal large seasonal and spatial variations in warming which is more severe during the spring season of the basin decreases in annual total precipitation of up to 10 8 under rcp4 5 and 19 0 under rcp8 5 are projected by the end of the century table 3 similar declining trends of mean annual precipitation over the basin was reported by cherie 2013 the decrease is larger during the spring season haile et al 2017 as mentioned above however precipitation projections can be very uncertain e g mengistu 2015 dosio et al 2019 for instance in contrast to our result roth et al 2018 reported an increase in mean annual rainfall of up to 27 worqlul et al 2018 reported seasonality in the rainfall pattern such that dry season rainfall amounts are likely to increase and wet season rainfall to decrease in contrast with the findings of worqlul et al 2018 aich et al 2014 reported an increase during the rainy season while no significant trend during the dry season the rise in temperature and the decrease in precipitation projected for the basin has adverse impacts on the hydrological regime of the basin 3 3 impact of climate change on potential evapotranspiration pet the results of climate change impacts on the water balance components of the basin are summarized in table 4 pet of the basin shows an increasing trend for most of the rcm runs except the ec earth driven one table 4 and fig 3 the changes in pet in the basin range from 3 2 for ec earth driven rcm run under rcp4 5 to 27 1 for cnrm cm5 driven rcm run under rcp8 5 table 4 similar increasing trends of pet over the basin were found by cherie 2013 who reported increases of 0 6 2 7 for the mid century and 0 9 to 4 63 by the end of the 21st century relative to the 1971 2000 baseline period kim et al 2008 also reported an increasing trend of pet ranging from 9 to 19 with an average range of 16 by the mid century an increasing trend of pet from 2 to 14 and 0 9 to 8 6 was also reported by elshamy et al 2009 and haile et al 2017 respectively worqlul et al 2018 also reported anincreasingtrend ofpetby2 inthe2030 s 4 7 inthe2060 sand7 8 at the end of the century the increasing trend in pet is associated with the projected temperature rise in the basin conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 beyene et al 2010 setegn et al 2011 haile et al 2017 woldesenbet et al 2017 worqlul et al 2018 conway and hulme 1996 estimated a 4 increase in pet per 1 c increase in temperature elshamy et al 2009 also assumed a 3 75 and 5 60 increase in pet for 1 c temperature increase annually and during the wet season respectively the future pet increase in the basin is not uniform throughout the year fig 3 shows that pet is lower during the summer season june to september due to the increase of cloud cover and humidity associated with the wet condition elshamy et al 2009 in contrast pet is higher during the dry season december to april because of the driest and warmest conditions in the basin fig 3 this result is in agreement with earlier studies in the basin such as kim et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 and cherie 2013 this result is also following the seasonal temperature and precipitation trends observed in the basin however it contradicts with haile et al 2017 who reported an increase during the wet season 3 4 impacts of climate change on surface runoff table 4 and fig 4 show trends in surface runoff in the basin for the three future periods surface runoff simulations forced by two of the rcm runs show increasing trends whereas runoff calculated using the ec earth driven run shows a slightly decreasing trend by the mid and end of the 21st century under rcp8 5 in general surface runoff in the basin is estimated to increase from 3 for ec earth driven rcm run by the near term up to 14 6 for cnrm cm5 driven run by the end of the 21st century compared to the 1981 2010 baseline period table 4 the increasing trend observed in this study is consistent with previous studies in the basin e g conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 cherie 2013 conway and hulme 1996 projected mean annual runoff change between 9 and 15 with an average increase of 1 for simulations forced by different gcms similarly kim et al 2008 reported a 4 increase in surface runoff by the mid century in the basin previous studies in the basin e g conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 cherie 2013 linked the change in surface runoff with changes in precipitation temperature and pet conway and hulme 1996 indicated that a 10 increase in precipitation could produce a 34 increase in runoff mengistu and sorteberg 2012 also found a 19 runoff change for a 10 change in precipitation over the basin however the impact of the change in pet on runoff is not as large as the effect of the change in precipitation conway and hulme 1996 reported an 8 increase in runoff for a 4 decrease in pet which is smaller than the one they reported for the impact of changes in precipitation similarly elshamy et al 2009 observed a 14 change in runoff for a 10 change in pet the impact of changes in precipitation and pet on runoff over the basin is estimated to be amplified by a factor of 3 and 1 4 respectively elshamy et al 2009 thus changes in precipitation cause greater changes in runoff than changes in pet runoff production is also affected by changes in temperature the temperature of the basin is projected to increase in the future table 3 the rise in temperature will decrease runoff through the increase in pet rate 4 per 1 c conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 precipitation projections from the three rcm runs for future periods show slight decreases across the basin table 3 however precipitation projections show an inter model difference in the magnitude of change and seasonal pattern figs 3 and 4 which is concurrent with elshamy et al 2009 the projected decrease in precipitation is accompanied by a consistent warming trend regardless of changes in precipitation and temperature projections for the mean annual runoff show an increasing trend table 4 and fig 4 by the end of the 21st century the runoff coefficient of the basin is expected to increase by up to 20 9 from the 13 4 calculated for the baseline period this increasing trend in runoff coefficient could be attributed to the increase in runoff production regardless of the decrease in precipitation this result is in contradiction with elshamy et al 2009 who reported a reduction in runoff coefficient by about 3 5 this discrepancy may be due to the difference in runoff projection in fact elshamy et al 2009 projected a reduction in runoff while this study estimated increases in future runoff production differences in climate models and type of hydrological models used could also explain part of the discrepancy between these two studies 3 5 impacts of climate change on water yield the hydrologic simulation results forced by the rcm runs showed mixed results about the total water yield in the basin table 4 despite the increase in surface runoff most of the rcm driven simulations show a decline in the projected trend in the total water yield by the end of the 21st century the total water yield in the basin is projected to decrease by 10 7 by mpi esm lr driven run to 22 7 by cnrm cm5 driven run compared to the 1981 2010 baseline period table 4 the decrease in water yield projected for the basin is concurrent with elshamy et al 2009 and cherie 2013 who reported a decrease of 15 and 10 to 61 respectively compared to their baseline periods haile et al 2017 also reported a decrease in water yield of up to 10 for the basin the decrease in water yield in the basin is caused by the decrease in precipitation increased evapotranspiration losses due to temperature rise table 3 and the subsequent reduction in groundwater recharge due to the decrease in lateral and baseflow table 4 elshamy et al 2009 and haile et al 2017 attributed the water yield reduction observed in the basin to the increase in pet beyene et al 2010 reported mixed results i e an increase in the near term and a decrease at the end of the 21st century and attributed the results to the increase in precipitation and temperature respectively however the declining trend observed in this study contradicts with girma 2012 who reported an increase of 13 by the mid century and 116 by the end of the 21st century from hydrologic simulations forced by cclm and remo rcms driven by echam5 gcm respectively the result of this study also contradicts with aich et al 2014 adem et al 2016 wagena et al 2016 and roth et al 2018 who reported future increases in streamflow in the basin these contrasting results underline the persistence of considerable uncertainty regarding climate projections and associated hydrological impacts for future upper blue nile river basin conditions mengistu and sorteberg 2012 taye et al 2015 haile et al 2017 dile et al 2018 and worqlul et al 2018 confirmed the uncertainty of projecting future climate change impacts on streamflow of the basin and its dependency on the choice of a climate model in their climate change sensitivity study the contributions of surface runoff lateral and baseflow to the total water yield of the basin is shown in table 4 the contribution of surface runoff is projected to increase from 48 3 for the baseline period under cnrm cm5 up to 77 6 by the end of the 21st century under mpi esm lr driven simulations this result is in agreement with cherie 2013 who reported up to a 71 increase in surface runoff contribution to the total water yield of the basin by the end of the 21stcentury similarly gebremicael et al 2013 reported a 75 increase of surface runoff contribution to the total water yield of the basin over four decades i e 1971 2009 however the contribution of baseflow is projected to decrease from 41 3 for cnrm cm5 rcm run during the baseline period to 11 4 for mpi esm lr driven simulations at the end of the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario this result is in accord with cherie 2013 who reported the deterioration of baseflow contribution to 10 by the end of the century compared to its contribution of about 35 during the baseline period gebremicael et al 2013 also reported a 50 reduction of the contribution of baseflow over the previous four decades i e 1971 2009 in the basin setegn et al 2011 and cherie 2013 attributed the decline in baseflow to the increase in temperature induced evapotranspiration and its subsequent effect on soil moisture content which leads to a considerable reduction of baseflow the contribution of lateral flow to the total water yield was also projected to decrease through time table 4 however the reduction of the contribution of lateral flow was not as significant as the baseflow 4 conclusions this study assesses impacts of climate change on the hydrologic regime of the upper blue nile abay river basin using the soil and water assessment tool swat calibrated and validated using measured streamflow data from four gauging stations in the basin simulations were conducted for a baseline 1981 2010 and three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 climate scenarios by forcing the swat model with outputs from three rcm simulations the key findings of the study are the following by the end of the 21st century annual precipitation in the basin is projected to decrease by up to 10 8 under rcp4 5 and 19 0 under rcp8 5 scenarios relative to the 1981 2010 baseline period this projected change is likely to strongly affect the hydrologic regime of the basin including changes in pet surface runoff lateral flow baseflow and water yield by the end of the 21st century pet is estimated to increase by up to 27 1 compared to the 1981 2010 baseline period mainly due to the projected temperature increase see e g mengistu 2015 dosio 2017 in contrast surface runoff is expected to increase from 7 to 14 6 and from 0 4 to 14 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively despite a decrease in precipitation amount regardless of the increase in surface runoff the total water yield of the basin is projected to decrease by 1 7 to 6 5 and 10 7 to 22 7 for simulations forced by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively this decreasing trend in total water yield is attributable to the increase in pet and the decrease in precipitation amount and groundwater recharge the contribution of baseflow to the overall water yield of the basin is projected to drop to 11 4 by the end of the 21st century from its 41 3 contribution during the baseline period the projected increase in surface runoff despite the projected decrease in precipitation and increase in pet appears contradictory but it is likely due to increase in rainfall intensity other studies have reported increases in rainfall intensity for instance mengistu 2015 projected an increase of very wet days r95p from 6 5 6 3 6 8 in the near term under rcp4 5 to 7 5 6 2 10 1 by the end of the 21st century for rcp8 5 over the upper blue nile basin the increasing tendency of the contribution of extreme precipitation events to total precipitation for east africa was reported by funk et al 2008 williams and funk 2011 and sillmann et al 2013 dosio et al 2019 and dosio et al 2020 also reported that precipitation over africa is expected to become more intense even over regions where mean precipitation may not change or even decrease zhang et al 2012 also attributed such increases in runoff to the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events on the other hand previous studies gebremicael et al 2013 woldesenbet et al 2017 gashaw et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 have shown that land conversion from forest bush and grass lands to cultivated land reduced infiltration capacity of the soil due to compaction and reduction of humus as a result surface runoff showed an increasing trend while groundwater and total water yield of the basin showed a decreasing trend in our study we used cclm which was extensively evaluated over africa amongst others panitz et al 2014 dosio et al 2015 and showed satisfactory performances in simulating african climatology of mean and extreme precipitation and added value when compared to the driving boundary conditions either reanalysis of gcms although cclm has a tendency to underestimate present day precipitation over the region e g dibaba et al 2019 this is not a peculiarity of this particular model only haile and tom 2015 dosio et al 2019 in addition several works show that models performances in the past are not necessarily linked to projected precipitation trends see discussion in e g dosio et al 2019 the climate simulations that we used to force the hydrological model assumed land use to be invariant which is the standard protocol of all cordex runs and that we followed for consistency reasons we therefore believe that the projected increased runoff highlighted in this study is a consequence of the increased precipitation intensity however due to the observed impact of past land use changes it is possible that lulc change in the future combined with the effect of increased precipitation intensity due to climate change may affect even more negatively the water balance of the basin the increase in surface runoff will intensify erosion risks and sedimentation problems in the basin and downstream countries of sudan and egypt the decreasing trend in water yield on the other hand may jeopardize the sustainability of irrigation and hydropower projects in the basin and the downstream countries therefore there is an urgent need for a coordinated and basin wide water resources management framework to effectively tackle the negative impacts of the changing climate finally we suggest future research to address limitations of our approach such as the assumption of constant land use that we adopted as the standard protocol of all cordex runs also it will be interesting to further analyze future scenarios of hydrological components precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff etc for the corresponding hydrological response units hru to get insights into the spatial variation of each variable credit authorship contribution statement daniel mengistu conceptualization methodology data curation software validation visualization writing

5038,this study assesses the impact of climate change on water resources in the upper blue nile abay river basin using a regional climate model rcm cosmo climate limited area model cclm coupled with a hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat the swat model was calibrated and validated using measured streamflow data from four gauging stations climate change projections showed increases in mean annual temperature and decrease in precipitation in most parts of the basin such changes are expected to affect the hydrologic regime of the basin these were assessed by running the swat model with the past 1981 2010 and future 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 climate scenarios the results show an increase of potential evapotranspiration pet by up to 27 by the end of the 21st century under rcp8 5 compared to the baseline period surface runoff is projected to increase by up to 14 however the increase in surface runoff could not increase the total water yield of the basin instead the total water yield of the basin is estimated to decrease by 1 7 to 6 5 and 10 7 to 22 7 for simulations forced by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively by the end of the 21st century the contribution of baseflow to the total water yield of the basin is also projected to decline to 11 4 from 41 3 during the baseline period the decrease in baseflow partly explains the decline in the total water yield of the basin such changes in the hydrologic balance will have significant implications for water management in the basin keywords climate change water resources swat rcm upper blue nile basin ethiopia 1 introduction climate change is one of the greatest challenges the world is facing today changes in average climatic conditions and extreme events are likely to have major impacts on human and ecological systems aerts and droogers 2004 ipcc 2013 water resources are amongst those severely affected by the changing climate liu woo 1996 climate change is expected to affect water resources through its impact on hydrological variables such as precipitation and temperature which in turn affect the hydrological cycle huntington 2006 the intensity timing and frequency of e g runoff floods and droughts are strongly linked with climate variability and change ipcc 2007 with projected global warming these effects will be particularly severe over areas such as ethiopia that have already been affected by climate variability in the past conway and schipper 2011 however large uncertainties remain over the projected precipitation change for large areas of africa monerie et al 2017 dosio et al 2019 2020 where the majority of climate models project a statistically significant change in mean precipitation but they do not agree on its sign the ethiopian part of the blue nile abay river basin is one of the areas of the country most sensitive to climate change conway 2005 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 beyene et al 2010 over the next decades it is expected to experience significant warming and changes to the temporal and spatial patterns of precipitation conway and hulme 1996 yates and strzepek 1998 conway 2005 kim et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 beyene et al 2010 girma 2012 cherie 2013 the basin s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change is enhanced by the dependence of the basin s economy about 85 of the basin s population on rain fed agriculture coupled with poor land management and low adaptive capacity entro 2006 the limited water availability and the increasing demand for water from different sectors could also contribute to the vulnerability of the basin to water stress as the climate changes bates et al 2008 di baldassarre et al 2011 mccartney and girma 2012 in fact under the current climate as well the water resource of the blue nile basin which provides an invaluable source of livelihood to over 300 million people in ethiopia and the downstream countries of sudan and egypt is strongly affected by and sensitive to variability in climatic conditions because of its geopolitical and socio economic importance several studies using different climate and hydrologic models have analyzed impacts of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the blue nile river basin e g conway and hulme 1996 yates and strzepek 1998 soliman et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 beyene et al

however they reported contrasting results regarding the likely impacts of climate change on water resources of the basin the discrepancy in the results of these studies is related to several factors including e g the different typology and often limited number of climate and hydrological models used the time period and emission scenario considered and the availability and quality of observational data necessary to calibrate and validate the hydrological model setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2015 for instance conway and hulme 1996 used three global circulation models gcms and estimated the flow in the blue nile in 2025 to range from an increase of 15 to a decrease of 9 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 used six gcms and projected an average increase of 4 in the annual flow of the blue nile by 2050 with the change over the basin ranging between 32 and 80 similarly soliman et al 2009 using a regional climate model rcm reported an increase of about 1 5 per annum 740 106 m3 yr 1 in the flow of the blue nile aich et al 2014 who used bias corrected data from five gcms under rcp2 6 rcp8 5 also projected a longer and more intense rainy season and frequent flooding in the future for the blue nile basin on the other hand elshamy et al 2009 analyzed 17 bias corrected statistically downscaled gcms and reported an average reduction of 15 ranging from 60 to 45 in the flow of the blue nile by the end of the 21st century cherie 2013 used three statistically downscaled gcms and projected a reduction of 10 to 61 in the flow of the blue nile by the end of the 21st century haile et al 2017 used six dynamically downscaled gcms to understand the implications of global warming under 2 c for blue nile basin hydrology and projected a decrease of water yield for the basin a study by beyene et al 2010 using 11 bias corrected statistically downscaled gcms estimated a change in flow at the high aswan dam had ranging from a decrease of 32 to an increase of 15 girma 2012 who used the cosmo climate limited area model cclm and the regional atmosphere model remo rcms forced by echam5 gcm found widely divergent results ranging from an increase of 9 to a decrease of 10 from the cclm and consistent increases of 103 and 141 for remo rcms by mid and end of the 21st century respectively likewise studies in the sub basins of the blue nile also reported contrasting results abdo et al 2009 dile et al 2013 and adem et al 2016 using a single statistically downscaled gcm hadcm3 projected an increase of streamflow for gilgel abay sub basin worqlul et al 2018 also using a single statistically downscaled gcm projected an increase of streamflow for gilgel beles and main beles sub basins by up to 64 in dry seasons and a decrease by 19 in wet seasons wagena et al 2016 analyzed the impact of climate change for two future periods 2041 2065 and 2075 2099 using six downscaled and bias corrected coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 gcms and predicted an increase in the streamflow between 22 and 27 for tana and beles sub basins in contrast setegn et al 2011 who analyzed the impact of climate change on streamflow of tana sub basin using data from nine climate models for two time periods 2046 2065 and 2080 2100 reported a statistically significant decline in annual streamflow for four of the nine gcms investigated for the 2080 2100 period the above studies reporting large variations in both magnitude and sign of the projected change in the flow of the blue nile river highlights our limited understanding of the underlying uncertainties in impact assessments the uncertainties related to the hydrological modelling chain include e g the climate model results sensitive to e g horizontal resolution physical parameterizations etc the availability and quality of observational data used to calibrate the hydrological model the calibration procedure and differences in downscaling techniques in the simulation of hydrological impacts of climate change etc these uncertainties may complicate the planning for sustainable development of water resources in the basin and downstream countries of sudan and egypt thus there is a need for further studies to better understand the likely impacts of climate change on water resources of the basin with a view to shed light on effective adaptation strategies and sustainable management of water resources in the basin in this study to assess the impact of projected climate change on water resources in the upper blue nile river basin we used the results of a state of the art rcm forced by an ensemble of cmip5 gcms and a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model calibrated and validated by using multiple spatially distributed gauge stations the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the data and methodologies used section 3 presents results and discussion and section 4 is conclusions derived from the findings of the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the upper blue nile river basin is located in the northwestern part of ethiopia between 7045 to 12045 n and 34005 to 39045 e fig 1 it drains an area of about 176 000 km2 that covers about 17 of ethiopia the blue nile leaves lake tana and flows through a series of deep valleys and canyons and joins the white nile at khartoum the sudan several tributaries join the blue nile abay river between lake tana and the sudanese border it is the largest unit of the nile basin in terms of the volume of discharge with a mean annual discharge of 48 5 billion m3 1536 m3 s 1 conway 2000 it also contributes more than 60 of the annual flow of the nile river conway 2000 the topography of the basin is rugged elevation ranges from 490 m asl near the ethio sudan border to 4260 m asl around the central part of the basin the geology of the highland parts of the basin is mainly volcanic rocks and precambrian basement complex rocks with small areas of sedimentary rocks while the lowlands are mainly basement complex and metamorphic rocks conway 2000 awulachew et al 2009 the main soil types in the basin include leptosols nitisols vertisols and cambisols which account for 21 16 15 and 9 of the basin area respectively betrie et al 2011 soils are generally deeper in the lowland part of the basin and very shallow on steep slopes the basin is dominated by agricultural land use about 60 with woodlands and grasslands shrublands covering 25 and 7 of the basin area respectively kim et al 2008 the climate of the basin varies from humid in the highland to semiarid in the lowland parts of the basin rainfall varies significantly with altitude and it is to a large extent controlled by the seasonal movement of air masses associated with the inter tropical convergence zone itcz most of the rain occurs in the summer season locally called kiremt june to september with a peak in july or august conway 2000 thus over 80 of its annual streamflow occurs from july to october kim et al 2008 the annual rainfall of the basin varies from 1000 mm yr 1 in the northeast to above 2000 mm yr 1 in the southwest of the basin with an average of 1420 mm yr 1 conway 2000 kim et al 2008 the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated to range from 1000 mm to 1800 mm yr 1 conway 2000 the mean annual temperature of the basin is 18 5 c and it shows temporal and spatial variation the average temperature of the basin is 17 7 c during the summer kiremt season and it rises to 20 1 c in the winter season locally known as bega kim et al 2008 the basin is endowed with rich biodiversity which supports the lives and livelihoods of millions of people through the provision of ecosystem services and products gauging stations used for the calibration and validation purposes were gummera gilgel abay near merawi kessie and blue nile at el diem a short description of these gauging stations is provided below the gummera and gilgel abay near merawi gauging stations are located in the lake tana sub basin at the outlet of gummera and gilgel abay watersheds respectively the gummera watershed is situated in the southeast of lake tana and covers a drainage area of about 1 464 km2 with elevations ranging from 1 780 to 3 678 m asl it is a predominantly agricultural area the topography of the gummera watershed is characterized by mountainous highly rugged and dissected terrain with steep slopes in the upper and middle parts and valley floors with flat to gentle slopes in the lower part of the watershed gilgel abay watershed is situated in the southern part of lake tana sub basin it covers a drainage area of about 1 600 km2 elevations in the watershed range from 1 780 to 3 678 m asl agriculture is the dominant land use in the watershed the southeastern part of the watershed is characterized by high mountains while the remaining area i e around 70 is characterized by flat to gentle slopes kessie covers a drainage area of approximately 65 000 km2 and incorporates the gummera ribb gilgel abay and jemma sub basins the kessie station is located on the main stem of the blue nile river the land use is predominately agriculture and elevations range from 1 000 to 4 300 m asl 2 2 the swat model description among the available hydrological models the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 version 2012 was selected for this study the swat model has been extensively and successfully used in assessing climate change impacts on water resources e g jha et al 2004 marshal and randhir 2008 abbaspour et al 2009 ficklin et al 2009 franczyk and chang 2009 setegn et al 2011 dile et al 2013 adem et al 2016 wagena et al 2016 tegegne et al 2017 its computational efficiency to operate on a large scale in a reasonable time ability to predict long term impacts as a continuous model and ability to use readily available datasets gassman et al 2007 are the reasons for its widespread use it is a physically based semi distributed basin scale continuous time hydrological and agricultural management practice simulation model that operates on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2005 gassman et al 2007 in swat the spatial heterogeneity of the basin is represented by dividing the basin into multiple sub basins connected by a stream network the sub basins are further subdivided into homogeneous hydrological response units hrus based on unique combinations of soil land cover and slope characteristics subdividing the main basin into hrus allows the model to reflect differences in evapotranspiration and other hydrological conditions fitzhugh and mackay 2000 and simulate a high level of spatial details neitsch et al 2005 swat simulates hydrologic processes based on the water balance equation eq 1 neitsch et al 2005 swt swo ri qi eti pi qri where swt and swo are the final and initial soil water content mm r daily rainfall mm q daily surface runoff mm et daily evapotranspiration mm p daily percolation mm and qr daily lateral flow mm the hydrology component of the swat model computes the water balance based on daily amounts of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff percolation and base flow simulations are performed at the hru level and summed up in each sub basin each sub basin guides the loads towards the basin outlet swat estimates surface runoff from daily rainfall using the modified soil conservation service scs curve number cn method scs cn usda 1972 and the green ampt infiltration method green and ampt 1911 the scs cn method was used in this study as well the scs cn estimates surface runoff based on local land use soil type and antecedent moisture conditions the swat model computes evaporation from soils and plants separately potential evapotranspiration pet is calculated with the hargreaves method which is appropriate given the limited availability of climate variables from the model output however the swat model has been calibrated and validated over the reference period using both the hargreaves and the penman monteith methods forced by observed meteorological variables showing consistent results potential soil water evaporation is estimated as a function of pet and leaf area index area of plant leaves relative to the soil surface area actual soil water evaporation is estimated using an exponential function of soil depth and water content plant water evaporation is simulated as a linear function of pet leaf area index and root depth and can be limited by soil water content the soil layer is subdivided into multiple layers to support soil water processes such as infiltration evaporation plant uptake lateral flow and percolation to lower layers downward flow occurs when the field capacity of a soil layer is exceeded and the layer below is not saturated percolation from the bottom of the soil profile recharges the shallow aquifer lateral sub surface flow in the soil profile is calculated simultaneously with percolation groundwater flow contribution to total streamflow is simulated by routing the shallow aquifer storage component to the stream channel runoff routing is simulated using the variable storage routing method neitsch et al 2005 2 3 model set up the swat model requires a digital elevation model dem soil and land use land cover data for delineation of sub basins and hru the dem which was generated from a 30 30 m shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data obtained from nasa s website http srtm csi cgiar org was used to generate stream networks on the basis of the generated stream networks 31 sub basins were delineated fig 1 about 586 hrus were then created considering dominant soil and land use land cover types within each sub basin for this study a 10 threshold values for land use land cover soil and slope layers were considered i e land units below the threshold size were not considered the land use land cover scale 1 250 000 and soil scale 1 250 000 data that were obtained from the ministry of water and energy mowe were reclassified to match the swat database requirement the slope data derived from the dem was also reclassified to correspond with the swat database requirement the swat model requires meteorological i e daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation data as the driving data in the present study for calibration and validation purposes we used observation data from 54 weather stations in the basin for the period 1981 2010 daily records were obtained from the national meteorological agency nma missing values were filled in using the swat weather generator i e wxgen model swat considers one set of weather information for each sub basin thus in this study at least 31 sets of weather information were required to force the model when more than one observation station falls within a sub basin swat chooses the one nearest to the sub basin centroid then the daily average values of the stations that fall in each sub basin were calculated and used to force the model 2 4 model calibration validation and uncertainty analysis observed daily discharge data from four spatially representative gauging stations were used for model calibration and validation purposes fig 1 nineteen years of data 1984 2003 were used for model calibration and five years of data 2003 2008 for model validation a warm up period of four years was employed so that the initial conditions would not affect the model calibration sensitive parameters used for model calibration were identified through sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out using a swat sensitivity analysis tool that uses the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat van griensven et al 2006 based on the initial sensitivity analysis and results of previous studies in the basin e g easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 girma 2012 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 cherie 2013 gebremicael et al 2013 tegegne et al 2017 roth et al 2018 a set of 12 parameters were chosen for calibration of the swat model the description and range of parameters used in the swat calibration are given in table 1 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 of the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup was used to calibrate the model sufi 2 is a multi site semi automated inverse modeling technique that uses the latin hypercube sampling scheme thus efficient in calculating optimal results compared to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue parameter solution parasol and bayesian inference techniques yang et al 2008 sufi 2 uses p factor to measure uncertainties that emanate from the uncertainties in driving variables e g daily rainfall and temperature conceptual model parameters and observed discharge data the p factor is the percentage of data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band abbaspour et al 2007 the maximum value for the p factor is 100 in this method uncertainties are mapped onto the parameter ranges which are calibrated to bracket most of the measured data in the 95ppu abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 also uses r factor to measure the strength of a calibration and uncertainty analysis the r factors were calculated as the ratio between the average thickness of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured data it represents the width of the uncertainty interval and should be as small as possible i e close to or smaller than 1 abbaspour 2007 the nash sutcliff ns coefficient between observed and simulated discharges was used as an objective function for model optimization the model was iterated by adjusting the parameters within the acceptable range until the model simulation results reached an acceptable level as per the model performance measures since flow data at el diem was available at the monthly time step the model was run for a monthly time step the model validation was done by running the model for different simulation periods with input parameters calibrated earlier using a validation dataset as input 2 5 model performance evaluation the performance of the swat model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r2 defined according to eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 nse 1 i 1 n x i obs x i sim i 1 n x i obs x obs 3 r 2 i 1 n x i obs x obs x i obs x sim i 1 n x i obs x obs 2 0 5 i 1 n x i sim x sim 2 0 5 where nse is the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency r2 is the coefficient of determination x i obs is the observed flow data in m3s 1 x obs is the mean value of the observed data x i sim is the simulated flow data in m3s 1 and x sim is the mean value of simulated data r2 describes the correlation between observed and simulated values it is an indicator of the strength of the relationship between the observed and simulated values r2 ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no correlation and 1 represents a perfect correlation and values greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable van liew et al 2003 the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is the ratio of the residual variance to the measured data variance it indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line it ranges between and 1 0 with nse of 1 indicating a perfect fit values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally considered acceptable levels of performance whereas values 0 0 are not acceptable and indicate that the mean of the measured values is a better predictor than the simulated value model performances were classified as excellent for r2 or nse 0 90 very good for r2 or nse 0 75 0 89 good for r2 or nse 0 50 0 74 fair for r2 or nse 0 25 0 49 poor for r2 or nse 0 0 24 and unsatisfactory for r2 or nse 0 moriasi et al 2007 in addition to nse and r2 a graphical comparison of the simulated and observed data was used to evaluate the model performance 2 6 modelling of climate induced hydrologic changes to analyze climate induced hydrologic changes climate forcings from baseline 1980 2010 and future periods 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s were used as inputs to the calibrated swat model climate forcings for the simulation of climate induced hydrologic changes were derived from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa project these sets of climate data were generated using the cosmo clm cclm rcm forced by three gcms i e cnrm cm5 ec earth and mpi esm lr under two representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 cclm is a three dimensional non hydrostatic rcm schättler et al 2009 it was developed from the local model lm of the german weather service baldauf et al 2011 the equations are solved on an arakawa c grid arakawa and lambs 1977 using a hybrid terrain following coordinate on a rotated geographical coordinate system the rcm runs are available at a spatial resolution of 50 km following the cordex protocol details about the domain and implementation of boundary conditions for the regional model including an analysis of cclm performances over africa are extensively described in panitz et al 2014 dosio et al 2015 and dosio and panitz 2016 recent studies e g graham et al 2007 leander and buishand 2007 akhtar et al 2008 have also used rcm outputs directly to force hydrological models changes in the simulated discharge in the basin were then compared between the baseline 1981 2010 and the future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat calibration and validation sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the parameters that have the highest sensitivity the results showed that among the selected parameters curve number cn2 soil evaporation compensation factor esco and available soil water capacity sol awc from the surface runoff parameters and groundwater revap coefficient gw revap threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer gwqmn groundwater delay gw delay baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and recharge to deep aquifer rchrg dp from the subsurface response parameters were found to be the most sensitive parameters i e p value 0 05 for streamflow simulation in the basin this result suggests that parameters representing the processes of surface and subsurface runoff generation play key roles in the hydrological process of the blue nile basin in other words accurate estimation of these parameters is important for streamflow simulation in the basin unlike most studies in the basin e g betrie et al 2011 girma 2012 cherie 2013 gebremicael et al 2013 the swat model was calibrated and validated using monthly measured streamflow data from four gauging stations in the basin over the 1984 2003 and 2004 2008 periods respectively calibrating the model at the sub basin outlets improved model parameterization compared to calibrating the model only at the outlet of the basin the streamflow data from el diem gauging station only covers the period from 2000 to 2008 from these the data from 2000 to 2003 were used for model calibration and data from 2004 to 2008 for model validation table 2 illustrates the estimated model calibration and validation efficiency values for monthly streamflow for the four gauging stations the calibrated swat model for the four spatially distributed gauging stations within the blue nile basin showed good to very good performance for mean monthly streamflow prediction r2 from 0 64 to 0 88 and nse from 0 61 to 0 86 between mean monthly measured and mean monthly predicted streamflow values table 2 during the model validation period the swat model demonstrated good to very good performance r2 from 0 58 to 0 84 and nse from 0 57 to 0 80 table 2 fig 2 the performance of the model was satisfactory and comparable with previous studies in the basin such as easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 and gebremicael et al 2013 who reported nse values of 0 53 to 0 92 and r2 of 0 73 to 0 92 nse value of 0 68 and nse value of 0 80 and r2 of 0 89 respectively for calibration of daily flow at el diem station these results indicate a reasonable ability of the swat model to capture the hydrological processes in the blue nile basin using the given set of parameters the model predicted both baseflow and peak flow reasonably well fig 2 overall since the statistical results are satisfactory the swat model can be applied to understand the dynamic water balance processes and to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow in the basin the applicability of the swat model in the basin was also confirmed by previous researchers e g easton et al 2010 betrie et al 2011 setegn et al 2011 girma 2012 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 cherie 2013 dile et al 2013 gebremicael et al 2013 adem et al 2016 wagena et al 2016 tegegne et al 2017 roth et al 2018 the p factor which is the percentage of observations bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu brackets 63 of the observation and r factor equals 0 6 for calibration at the outlet of the blue nile basin el diem showed that the model captured the observations very well 3 2 changes in temperature and precipitation table 3 shows changes in the mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures and mean annual precipitation in the basin by the end of the 21st century relative to the 1981 2010 baseline period the results show substantial differences across rcm runs and between rcp scenarios the mean annual maximum temperatures in the basin are projected to increase by up to 2 48 c under rcp4 5 and 4 89 c under rcp8 5 by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 similar warming trends are projected for the mean annual minimum temperature which is expected to increase by 2 22 c to 4 74 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively warming trends of mean annual temperature over the basin was also reported by other studies e g kim et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 beyene et al 2010 girma 2012 cherie 2013 aich et al 2014 wagena et al 2016 dosio 2017 roth et al 2018 worqlul et al 2018 model results also reveal large seasonal and spatial variations in warming which is more severe during the spring season of the basin decreases in annual total precipitation of up to 10 8 under rcp4 5 and 19 0 under rcp8 5 are projected by the end of the century table 3 similar declining trends of mean annual precipitation over the basin was reported by cherie 2013 the decrease is larger during the spring season haile et al 2017 as mentioned above however precipitation projections can be very uncertain e g mengistu 2015 dosio et al 2019 for instance in contrast to our result roth et al 2018 reported an increase in mean annual rainfall of up to 27 worqlul et al 2018 reported seasonality in the rainfall pattern such that dry season rainfall amounts are likely to increase and wet season rainfall to decrease in contrast with the findings of worqlul et al 2018 aich et al 2014 reported an increase during the rainy season while no significant trend during the dry season the rise in temperature and the decrease in precipitation projected for the basin has adverse impacts on the hydrological regime of the basin 3 3 impact of climate change on potential evapotranspiration pet the results of climate change impacts on the water balance components of the basin are summarized in table 4 pet of the basin shows an increasing trend for most of the rcm runs except the ec earth driven one table 4 and fig 3 the changes in pet in the basin range from 3 2 for ec earth driven rcm run under rcp4 5 to 27 1 for cnrm cm5 driven rcm run under rcp8 5 table 4 similar increasing trends of pet over the basin were found by cherie 2013 who reported increases of 0 6 2 7 for the mid century and 0 9 to 4 63 by the end of the 21st century relative to the 1971 2000 baseline period kim et al 2008 also reported an increasing trend of pet ranging from 9 to 19 with an average range of 16 by the mid century an increasing trend of pet from 2 to 14 and 0 9 to 8 6 was also reported by elshamy et al 2009 and haile et al 2017 respectively worqlul et al 2018 also reported anincreasingtrend ofpetby2 inthe2030 s 4 7 inthe2060 sand7 8 at the end of the century the increasing trend in pet is associated with the projected temperature rise in the basin conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 beyene et al 2010 setegn et al 2011 haile et al 2017 woldesenbet et al 2017 worqlul et al 2018 conway and hulme 1996 estimated a 4 increase in pet per 1 c increase in temperature elshamy et al 2009 also assumed a 3 75 and 5 60 increase in pet for 1 c temperature increase annually and during the wet season respectively the future pet increase in the basin is not uniform throughout the year fig 3 shows that pet is lower during the summer season june to september due to the increase of cloud cover and humidity associated with the wet condition elshamy et al 2009 in contrast pet is higher during the dry season december to april because of the driest and warmest conditions in the basin fig 3 this result is in agreement with earlier studies in the basin such as kim et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 and cherie 2013 this result is also following the seasonal temperature and precipitation trends observed in the basin however it contradicts with haile et al 2017 who reported an increase during the wet season 3 4 impacts of climate change on surface runoff table 4 and fig 4 show trends in surface runoff in the basin for the three future periods surface runoff simulations forced by two of the rcm runs show increasing trends whereas runoff calculated using the ec earth driven run shows a slightly decreasing trend by the mid and end of the 21st century under rcp8 5 in general surface runoff in the basin is estimated to increase from 3 for ec earth driven rcm run by the near term up to 14 6 for cnrm cm5 driven run by the end of the 21st century compared to the 1981 2010 baseline period table 4 the increasing trend observed in this study is consistent with previous studies in the basin e g conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 cherie 2013 conway and hulme 1996 projected mean annual runoff change between 9 and 15 with an average increase of 1 for simulations forced by different gcms similarly kim et al 2008 reported a 4 increase in surface runoff by the mid century in the basin previous studies in the basin e g conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 cherie 2013 linked the change in surface runoff with changes in precipitation temperature and pet conway and hulme 1996 indicated that a 10 increase in precipitation could produce a 34 increase in runoff mengistu and sorteberg 2012 also found a 19 runoff change for a 10 change in precipitation over the basin however the impact of the change in pet on runoff is not as large as the effect of the change in precipitation conway and hulme 1996 reported an 8 increase in runoff for a 4 decrease in pet which is smaller than the one they reported for the impact of changes in precipitation similarly elshamy et al 2009 observed a 14 change in runoff for a 10 change in pet the impact of changes in precipitation and pet on runoff over the basin is estimated to be amplified by a factor of 3 and 1 4 respectively elshamy et al 2009 thus changes in precipitation cause greater changes in runoff than changes in pet runoff production is also affected by changes in temperature the temperature of the basin is projected to increase in the future table 3 the rise in temperature will decrease runoff through the increase in pet rate 4 per 1 c conway and hulme 1996 kim et al 2008 elshamy et al 2009 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 precipitation projections from the three rcm runs for future periods show slight decreases across the basin table 3 however precipitation projections show an inter model difference in the magnitude of change and seasonal pattern figs 3 and 4 which is concurrent with elshamy et al 2009 the projected decrease in precipitation is accompanied by a consistent warming trend regardless of changes in precipitation and temperature projections for the mean annual runoff show an increasing trend table 4 and fig 4 by the end of the 21st century the runoff coefficient of the basin is expected to increase by up to 20 9 from the 13 4 calculated for the baseline period this increasing trend in runoff coefficient could be attributed to the increase in runoff production regardless of the decrease in precipitation this result is in contradiction with elshamy et al 2009 who reported a reduction in runoff coefficient by about 3 5 this discrepancy may be due to the difference in runoff projection in fact elshamy et al 2009 projected a reduction in runoff while this study estimated increases in future runoff production differences in climate models and type of hydrological models used could also explain part of the discrepancy between these two studies 3 5 impacts of climate change on water yield the hydrologic simulation results forced by the rcm runs showed mixed results about the total water yield in the basin table 4 despite the increase in surface runoff most of the rcm driven simulations show a decline in the projected trend in the total water yield by the end of the 21st century the total water yield in the basin is projected to decrease by 10 7 by mpi esm lr driven run to 22 7 by cnrm cm5 driven run compared to the 1981 2010 baseline period table 4 the decrease in water yield projected for the basin is concurrent with elshamy et al 2009 and cherie 2013 who reported a decrease of 15 and 10 to 61 respectively compared to their baseline periods haile et al 2017 also reported a decrease in water yield of up to 10 for the basin the decrease in water yield in the basin is caused by the decrease in precipitation increased evapotranspiration losses due to temperature rise table 3 and the subsequent reduction in groundwater recharge due to the decrease in lateral and baseflow table 4 elshamy et al 2009 and haile et al 2017 attributed the water yield reduction observed in the basin to the increase in pet beyene et al 2010 reported mixed results i e an increase in the near term and a decrease at the end of the 21st century and attributed the results to the increase in precipitation and temperature respectively however the declining trend observed in this study contradicts with girma 2012 who reported an increase of 13 by the mid century and 116 by the end of the 21st century from hydrologic simulations forced by cclm and remo rcms driven by echam5 gcm respectively the result of this study also contradicts with aich et al 2014 adem et al 2016 wagena et al 2016 and roth et al 2018 who reported future increases in streamflow in the basin these contrasting results underline the persistence of considerable uncertainty regarding climate projections and associated hydrological impacts for future upper blue nile river basin conditions mengistu and sorteberg 2012 taye et al 2015 haile et al 2017 dile et al 2018 and worqlul et al 2018 confirmed the uncertainty of projecting future climate change impacts on streamflow of the basin and its dependency on the choice of a climate model in their climate change sensitivity study the contributions of surface runoff lateral and baseflow to the total water yield of the basin is shown in table 4 the contribution of surface runoff is projected to increase from 48 3 for the baseline period under cnrm cm5 up to 77 6 by the end of the 21st century under mpi esm lr driven simulations this result is in agreement with cherie 2013 who reported up to a 71 increase in surface runoff contribution to the total water yield of the basin by the end of the 21stcentury similarly gebremicael et al 2013 reported a 75 increase of surface runoff contribution to the total water yield of the basin over four decades i e 1971 2009 however the contribution of baseflow is projected to decrease from 41 3 for cnrm cm5 rcm run during the baseline period to 11 4 for mpi esm lr driven simulations at the end of the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario this result is in accord with cherie 2013 who reported the deterioration of baseflow contribution to 10 by the end of the century compared to its contribution of about 35 during the baseline period gebremicael et al 2013 also reported a 50 reduction of the contribution of baseflow over the previous four decades i e 1971 2009 in the basin setegn et al 2011 and cherie 2013 attributed the decline in baseflow to the increase in temperature induced evapotranspiration and its subsequent effect on soil moisture content which leads to a considerable reduction of baseflow the contribution of lateral flow to the total water yield was also projected to decrease through time table 4 however the reduction of the contribution of lateral flow was not as significant as the baseflow 4 conclusions this study assesses impacts of climate change on the hydrologic regime of the upper blue nile abay river basin using the soil and water assessment tool swat calibrated and validated using measured streamflow data from four gauging stations in the basin simulations were conducted for a baseline 1981 2010 and three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 climate scenarios by forcing the swat model with outputs from three rcm simulations the key findings of the study are the following by the end of the 21st century annual precipitation in the basin is projected to decrease by up to 10 8 under rcp4 5 and 19 0 under rcp8 5 scenarios relative to the 1981 2010 baseline period this projected change is likely to strongly affect the hydrologic regime of the basin including changes in pet surface runoff lateral flow baseflow and water yield by the end of the 21st century pet is estimated to increase by up to 27 1 compared to the 1981 2010 baseline period mainly due to the projected temperature increase see e g mengistu 2015 dosio 2017 in contrast surface runoff is expected to increase from 7 to 14 6 and from 0 4 to 14 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively despite a decrease in precipitation amount regardless of the increase in surface runoff the total water yield of the basin is projected to decrease by 1 7 to 6 5 and 10 7 to 22 7 for simulations forced by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively this decreasing trend in total water yield is attributable to the increase in pet and the decrease in precipitation amount and groundwater recharge the contribution of baseflow to the overall water yield of the basin is projected to drop to 11 4 by the end of the 21st century from its 41 3 contribution during the baseline period the projected increase in surface runoff despite the projected decrease in precipitation and increase in pet appears contradictory but it is likely due to increase in rainfall intensity other studies have reported increases in rainfall intensity for instance mengistu 2015 projected an increase of very wet days r95p from 6 5 6 3 6 8 in the near term under rcp4 5 to 7 5 6 2 10 1 by the end of the 21st century for rcp8 5 over the upper blue nile basin the increasing tendency of the contribution of extreme precipitation events to total precipitation for east africa was reported by funk et al 2008 williams and funk 2011 and sillmann et al 2013 dosio et al 2019 and dosio et al 2020 also reported that precipitation over africa is expected to become more intense even over regions where mean precipitation may not change or even decrease zhang et al 2012 also attributed such increases in runoff to the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events on the other hand previous studies gebremicael et al 2013 woldesenbet et al 2017 gashaw et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 have shown that land conversion from forest bush and grass lands to cultivated land reduced infiltration capacity of the soil due to compaction and reduction of humus as a result surface runoff showed an increasing trend while groundwater and total water yield of the basin showed a decreasing trend in our study we used cclm which was extensively evaluated over africa amongst others panitz et al 2014 dosio et al 2015 and showed satisfactory performances in simulating african climatology of mean and extreme precipitation and added value when compared to the driving boundary conditions either reanalysis of gcms although cclm has a tendency to underestimate present day precipitation over the region e g dibaba et al 2019 this is not a peculiarity of this particular model only haile and tom 2015 dosio et al 2019 in addition several works show that models performances in the past are not necessarily linked to projected precipitation trends see discussion in e g dosio et al 2019 the climate simulations that we used to force the hydrological model assumed land use to be invariant which is the standard protocol of all cordex runs and that we followed for consistency reasons we therefore believe that the projected increased runoff highlighted in this study is a consequence of the increased precipitation intensity however due to the observed impact of past land use changes it is possible that lulc change in the future combined with the effect of increased precipitation intensity due to climate change may affect even more negatively the water balance of the basin the increase in surface runoff will intensify erosion risks and sedimentation problems in the basin and downstream countries of sudan and egypt the decreasing trend in water yield on the other hand may jeopardize the sustainability of irrigation and hydropower projects in the basin and the downstream countries therefore there is an urgent need for a coordinated and basin wide water resources management framework to effectively tackle the negative impacts of the changing climate finally we suggest future research to address limitations of our approach such as the assumption of constant land use that we adopted as the standard protocol of all cordex runs also it will be interesting to further analyze future scenarios of hydrological components precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff etc for the corresponding hydrological response units hru to get insights into the spatial variation of each variable credit authorship contribution statement daniel mengistu conceptualization methodology data curation software validation visualization writing

5039,this paper introduces a new deep learning algorithm of deep belief network dbn based on an extreme learning machine elm that is structured by back propagation bn and optimized by particle swarm optimization pso algorithm named debp for flood susceptibility mapping in the vu gia thu bon watershed central vietnam we use 847 locations of floods that occurred in 2007 2009 and 2013 and 16 flood conditioning factors evaluated by an information gain ratio igr technique to construct and validate the proposed model statistical metrics including sensitivity specificity accuracy f1 measure jaccard coefficient matthews correlation coefficient mcc root mean square error rmse and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc are used to assess the goodness of fit performance and prediction accuracy of the new deep learning model we further compare the proposed model with several well known machine learning algorithms including artificial neural network based radial base

prediction accuracy auc 0 967 of all of the tested models and thus shows promise as a tool for flood susceptibility modeling we conclude that novel deep learning algorithms such as the one used in this study can improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps that are required by planners decision makers and government agencies to manage of areas vulnerable to flood induced damage keywords flood susceptibility deep belief network extreme machine learning optimization algorithm goodness of fit vietnam 1 introduction floods are a global phenomenon and are responsible for much loss life and socio economic disruption and ecosystem damage between 1995 and 2015 damaging floods impacted about 109 million people worldwide alfieri et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2013 although floods have some positive functions for example aquifer replenishment restoration of wetlands and improved soil fertility the benefits of floods are greatly outweighed by the damage they cause as a result flood researchers and authorities are constantly seeking new ways to reduce flood hazards in high risk areas almost all countries of the world are affected by floods but asian countries are particularly vulnerable due to large populations living on floodplains and their vulnerability to cyclones hens et al 2018 van thanh et al 2017 vietnam for example is a typhoon prone country with large populated alluvial plains and a tropical monsoon climate ly and thuy 2019 son and van anh 2019 thai and tri 2019 the central plains of vietnam are particularly at high risk as they experience high rainfall 1800 2500 mm yr and are densely populated van ha et al 2019 an engineered solution to this problem is difficult perhaps even impossible because of the prohibitive costs of effective dyking and other flood control measures accordingly efforts are being made to identify flood prone areas by developing accurate flood susceptibility maps wu et al 2010 flood susceptibility maps are proactive tools that allow land use managers and planners to guide development and prioritize expenditures on flood protection and recovery minh et al 2018 norbiato et al 2008 tuyet et al 2019 there are numerous challenges faced by researchers involved in flood modeling and mapping notably model complexity lack of data and the size and complexity of study areas although many lumped hydrological and distributed models have been employed these models have different goodness of fit and prediction accuracy and none of them is able to accurately simulate floods under different conditions furthermore hydrological models cannot provide reliable results for watersheds with limited data and acquisition of sufficient data in the case of large watersheds can be prohibitively expensive given these limitations data driven models offer the flexibility and power to reliably map flood prone areas even with limited data khosravi et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 they can be used in tandem with geographic information systems and remote sensing tools to better interpret and visualize flood prone terrain traditional models that have been used in the past to map flood susceptibility include bivariate statistical models bsms and multi criteria decision making mcdms methods such as frequency ratio fr analytical hierarchy process ahp and weights of evidence woe shafapour tehrany et al 2019 2017 souissi et al 2019 these traditional methods are based on linear modeling and require hard statistical assumptions that are challenged by complex natural phenomena such as floods termeh et al 2018 to overcome these limitations researchers are increasingly favoring machine learning algorithms mlas for flood susceptibility modeling these algorithms offer several advantages over traditional methods 1 they can predict complex nonlinear structures generate data and model accurately 2 they can be integrated with traditional models but are not limited by statistical assumptions 3 they can easily and effectively cope with limited data olden et al 2008 rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 and 4 they can incorporate spatial data derived from photographs and satellite images lee et al 1990 among these algorithms support vector machine svm logistic regression lr artificial neural network ann and decision tree methods pradhan 2010a tehrany et al 2015 have been used to prepare flood susceptibility maps the most widely used decision tree algorithms in flood modeling are bayesian logistic regression blr logistic models tree lmt random forest chapi et al 2017 alternating decision trees adt classification and regression trees cart reduced error pruning trees rept and naïve bayes trees nbt khosravi et al 2018 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 bui et al 2019b recently argued that limitations and barriers still exist in accurately predicting flood susceptible areas and the search for new improved machine learning ensemble models and optimization algorithms with high predictive power continues ensemble models eliminate the weakness of a single methods by combining two or more methods to achieve higher predictive power hong et al 2018a for example researchers have integrated the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with evolutionary algorithms including cultural anfis ca bees anfis ba and invasive weed optimization anfis iwo tien bui et al 2018a they also used the imperialistic competitive algorithm ica and electromagnetism based firefly algorithm efa tien bui et al 2018a artificial neural network ann and the electromagnetism based firefly algorithm efa bui et al 2019a the genetic algorithm ga and differential evolution de hong et al 2018a and the biogeography based optimization bbo and bat ba algorithms ahmadlou et al 2019 these hybrid evolutionary models are appealing for flood modeling because of their goodness of fit and prediction accuracies in recent years deep learning dl models convolutional neural networks restricted boltzmann machines rbm auto encoders and sparse coding have provided an attractive machine learning framework that has garnered attention and notable success within the machine learning modeling community dls have outperformed traditional mlas in a variety of applications they are more powerful and accurate than machine learning models when a large amount of data must be trained and they learn high level features from complex data in an incremental manner bui et al 2020a reichstein et al 2019 they have been used in geoscience classification schemes such as flood and landslide susceptibility assessment bui et al 2020a ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and have demonstrated outstanding performance in other fields such as computer vision speech recognition control systems physics chemistry and biology khan and yairi 2018 bui et al 2020a developed a new deep learning neural network dlnn algorithm for flood susceptibility mapping in vietnam and showed that this algorithm performed better than the multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn and svm models huang et al 2019 developed a new deep learning model for landslide susceptibility mapping that they named the fully connected spare auto encoder fc sae their deep learning model outperformed benchmark models including svm and back propagation neural network bpnn liu et al 2017 proposed a new deep learning model sae bpnn that integrates stacked auto encoder sae and back propagation neural networks bpnn to predict stream flow six hours into the future they compared the results of this model with the svm bpnn rbf neural network and extreme learning machine elm models and concluded that it greatly outperformed the benchmarks finally le et al 2019 used their lstm neural network model to forecast floods based on daily discharge and rainfall as input data this paper presents and tests a new deep learning model for flood susceptibility mapping that is based on a deep belief network dbn and an extreme learning machine elm structured by back propagation bp and optimized by particle swarm optimization pso we apply this model to generate flood susceptibility maps in quang nam province a flood prone area in central vietnam to the best of our knowledge this is the first use of the new model for flood modeling and prediction ronoud and asadi 2019 developed a model e t dbn elm bp for breast cancer diagnosis however the structure and application of their model are different from those of the model proposed in this paper specifically ronoud and asadi 2019 used a genetic algorithm ga to optimize the weights of the deep neural networks whereas we use particle swarm optimization pso for this purpose our new model uses the elm and bp optimized by the pso algorithm to enhance dbn weights and obtain high prediction accuracy to flood modeling elm offers several advantages over error propagation algorithms such as bp huang and chen 2007 notably better generalization performance higher scalability lower computational complexity and improved dbn weights pso as a powerful optimization algorithm bui et al 2020b that searches in large solution space to find an optimal network topology and structure and thus is well suited for flood susceptibility mapping the proposed model network is initialized in the unsupervised rbm based pre training step using unlabeled data network initialization provides a good starting point for the subsequent supervised fine tuning step via elm and bp and significantly reduces the risk of becoming trapped in local optima ronoud and asadi 2019 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 identify the most important factors for flood modeling using the information gain ration igr technique 2 develop a new robust and powerful deep learning neural network model for flood susceptibility mapping and 3 compare the goodness of fit and prediction accuracy of the proposed model with those of some well known soft computing benchmark models the paper is structured as follows following this introduction we briefly summarize the mathematical structure of dl and mla algorithms we then describe the study area and modeling database results and analysis form the fourth section of the paper we provide a ranking of flood conditioning factors and show the relations between these factors and flood locations we compare and validate the proposed model against soft computing benchmark models we then compare our results with those derived from other published flood susceptibility studies conclusions are presented in the final section of the paper 2 mathematical background of the dl and mla algorithms 2 1 deep learning model restricted boltzmann machine rbm is one of the most successful machine learning methods for pre training large datasets as they can be combined to form deep belief networks dbn hinton et al 2006 dbns have become popular in machine learning applications because of their encoding speed fast inference and higher order network structures kuremoto et al 2014 ronoud and asadi 2019 tamilselvan and wang 2013 wang et al 2016 they have a hierarchical structure based on several rbms and work using a layer by layer learning process tamilselvan and wang 2013 however there are still challenges in their use in real world applications for example how to decide the initial values of connection weights and biases and how to decide their structure in this paper we use an evolutionary hybrid algorithm to improve the power of dbn training ronoud and asadi 2019 specifically we combine dbn with the extreme learning machine elm classifier then to overcome the second challenge mentioned above we optimize the number of hidden neurons and hidden layers by using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the following subsections briefly summarize the mathematical basis of dbn elm and pso and describe our proposed model debp in detail 2 1 1 deep belief network deep belief network dbn is a graphical model consisting of several layers of hidden units hinton 2009 it can be seen as a combination of simple learning modules each of which is a rbm containing a visible layer v and a hidden layer h the first layer represents the data and the second layer extracts higher level correlations from the data there is no connection within a layer but the visible and hidden layers are connected by a symmetrically weighted connection matrix w hinton 2009 rules for updating the weights and biases of stacked rbms are given in eqs 4 5 and 6 4 d w ij e v i h j data v i h j mod e l 5 δ b i ε v i data v i model 6 δ c j ε h j data h j model where d shows the mathematical expectation according to the distribution d and ε b and c are respectively the learning rate bias of the visible layer and bias of the hidden layer to update wij parameters based on eq 4 we must calculate two values v i h j data and v i h j model several methods have been proposed to calculate these values hinton 2010 keyvanrad and homayounpour 2015 le roux and bengio 2008 tieleman 2008 tieleman and hinton 2009 one of the most popular methods is the contrastive divergence algorithm with one gibbs sampling step cd 1 hinton 2010 fig 1 shows the cd 1 pseudo code for a rbm in algorithm 1 palm 2012 training of each rbm in a dbn is independent of the others the first rbm is trained as above and then the hidden layer of first rbm is used as the second rbm s visible layer fig 2 specifically v1 is set to a training instance and converted to h1 by the first rbm cd 1 then trains the second rbm the second training step is the same as the first except that the training data are mapped via the first rbm before being used as training samples shown by the dashed arrow in fig 2 for use in classification problems the visible layer lowest level in fig 2 is initialized with a sample and converted upward until it reaches the hidden layer of the preceding rbm a common way of applying dbns in classification problems is to add a labeled layer at the end of the network and train the entire network using an error back propagation algorithm 2 1 2 extreme learning machine extreme learning machine is an efficient learning algorithm in the family of single hidden layer feed forward neural networks it does not require the hidden layer tuning process the connection weights of the elm transferred from the input layer to the hidden layer as well as the hidden bias and neurons are computed randomly without any additional adjustment however the weights are determined computationally by the least squares method huang et al 2012 the elm function for binary classification schemes is given by eq 7 qu et al 2016 7 f l x s i g m h x β where β β 1 β l t is the output weight vector between the hidden layer and l output nodes and the output vector of the hidden layer is denoted as h x h 1 x h l x if we define t y 1 y n t the output weight can be formulated by eq 8 huang et al 2012 8 β h t h t h h t 1 t where h is the moore penrose generalized inverse of matrix h huang et al 2006 2 1 3 particle swarm optimization particle swarm optimization pso is an iterative algorithm that tracks the position and velocity of each of a large set of particles the position of each particle is used to represent a candidate solution of space and the velocity of each particle is used to update the particle s position in that space eberhart and shi 2001 while searching in a d dimensional hyperspace which is equal to the number of hidden layers in the network the position vector and velocity vector of the particle i are expressed as respectively xi xi1 xi2 xid and vi vi1 vi2 vid in each iteration of modeling process the best position of each particle till current iteration xlb and the best particle of all particles xgb are determined using a fitness function the values of xlb and xgb move the particles towards the optimal solution eberhart and shi 2001 the process starts with a random family of particles and then improves their positions by repeating eqs 9 and 10 9 v i k 1 ω v i k c 1 r 1 x lb x i k c 2 r 2 x gb x i k 10 x i k 1 x i k v i k 1 where ω denotes the damping coefficient which is the resistance of the particle to its movement this coefficient is initially set to 1 and in each iteration is multiplied by the inertia weight damping ratio ω d a m p c1 and c2 are velocity coefficients their function is to better balance the contributions of xlb and xgb to particle displacement random values r1 and r2 are in 0 1 2 1 4 proposed deep learning model debp the feed forward bp network is the most common type of neural network an issue facing modelers who use bp is the possibility that it becomes trapped in poor local optima especially in networks with multiple hidden layers abdel zaher and eldeib 2016 the dbn network s pre training process is used to address this issue hinton et al 2006 typical dbn training consists of three steps first the network is pre trained in a greedy layer wise manner with a stack of rbms using unsupervised data second the output layer is added to the dbn and random weights are assigned to this layer finally the whole network is trained by the bp algorithm using supervised data network pre training prevents the network from becoming trapped in local optima the algorithm converges better and faster if after adding the output layer in the second step the elm method is used to allocate the weight of the output layer ronoud and asadi 2019 the structure of a neural network is important because it affects the learning capacity and generalizability of the network ahmadizar et al 2015 determining the structure and the numbers of layers and nodes per layer are difficult for any dbn application guo et al 2015 discovering the proper structure of a network is a search problem in which the goal is to find the optimal topology for the network evolutionary algorithms are a good option for this task kuremoto et al 2014 ronoud and asadi 2019 and pso is an evolutionary search method that can find optimal or near optimal solutions therefore for our proposed evolutionary model debp we optimize the network topology using the pso algorithm the algorithm was originally used for continuous problems thus we use continuous values in the interval 0 1 for particle encoding then before evaluating particle positions using a fitness function the position of each particle is discretized by eq 11 11 k i min 1 m x i m in which m is the maximum number of hidden neurons determined by the user and ki is the discrete value of the continuous position xi the number of position dimensions represents the number of hidden layers and the discrete amount of each position s dimension represents the hidden neurons of the dbn the classification accuracy percentage criteria that is used to calculate the fitness of each ki is given by eq 12 12 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 100 in which tp tn fp and fn are respectively the number of true positive true negative false positive and false negative values the flowchart of the pso algorithm for finding optimal network topology is shown in fig 3 2 2 soft computing machine learning benchmark models 2 2 1 logistic regression logistic regression lr which was first introduced by mcfadden 1973 is a popular multivariate statistical analysis method we use lr to evaluate conditioning factors that might affect the probability of flood occurrences shafapour tehrany et al 2017 lr offers several advantages over other statistical models 1 the dependent variable and conditioning factors do not need to be normal distributed 2 conditioning factors can be either continuous discrete or an ensembles of the two 3 the dependent variable can be expressed with a binary code mousavi et al 2011 shirzadi et al 2012 in this paper flooding is the dependent variable and is coded as flood 1 or non flood 0 in contrast the conditioning factors are continuous to prepare the flood susceptibility map based on lr we computed the weights of all conditioning factors using weka 3 9 software and then assigned those weights spatially in a gis the higher the lr coefficient of the conditioning factor the higher the likelihood that the factor is associated with flood occurrence ayalew and yamagishi 2005 additionally a positive coefficient indicates a more important role compared to a negative coefficient shirzadi et al 2012 the following formulae were used to compute the probability of flood occurrence 13 p e z 1 e z 14 z c 0 c 1 x 1 c 2 x 2 c n x n where p is the probability of flood occurrence and ranges between 0 and 1 z is a linear combination c 0 is the intercept of the model c i i 0 1 2 n denotes the lr coefficients and x i i 0 1 2 n represents the flood conditioning factors 2 2 2 artificial neural network an artificial neural network ann is a supervised machine learning algorithm that computationally makes predictions from inputs based on human perception bui et al 2019b garrett 1994 the method is commonly used when relationships among data are unknown kia et al 2012 an ann comprises a number of neurons or nodes that are used to transform input data into output classes it comprises three layers an input layer neurons or in this study flood conditioning factors a hidden layer individual neurons to obtain the flood susceptibility class labels in the output layer and an output layer flood class labels fig 4 in each layer direct links connect neurons in order to assign weights to show the strength of the outgoing signal kia et al 2012 in this study input data flood conditioning factors are used for training by ann based on the class labels flood and non flood then the trained ann model is run to classify flood and non flood occurrences ngo et al 2018 the neural network architecture in our study employs a radial basis function rbf which is a vigor classifier yilmaz and kaynar 2011 its kernel function is an alternative to the multi perceptron neural network mlp for solving complex environmental problems and is used by many researchers bishop 1995 haykin 1994 ngo et al 2018 2 2 3 logistic model tree the logistic model tree lmtree combines a c4 5 decision tree algorithm quinlan 1996a and a logistic regression function chen et al 2018 two processes are performed by the algorithm 1 tree splitting is done using the information gain technique and 2 lr fitting at a tree node is done by the logitboost algorithm landwehr et al 2005 the over fitting problem encountered in the use of lmtree has been addressed by using the classification and regression tree cart algorithm chen et al 2019b in flood susceptibility modeling by lmtree a c4 5 algorithm first splits flood conditioning factors into two binary classes flood 1 and non flood 0 according to the probability of flood occurrence in the following equations m and ci are respectively the number of flood conditioning factors and the class label flood and non flood and α i and c 0 are respectively the coefficients of each flood conditioning factor and the constant coefficient of regression if l c x is the least square fit the posterior probability p c x of each class label is formulated as follows landwehr et al 2005 15 p c x exp l c x i 1 m exp l c x 16 l c x i 1 m α i x i c 0 2 2 4 functional tree functional tree ftree is a hierarchical model that is used to create multivariate trees in both regression and classification schemes gama 2004 it can be used for prediction in three states 1 inner nodes to decrease bias 2 leaves to decrease variance and 3 combined attributes at both functional inner nodes and leaves when the dataset is very large gama 2004 the main advantage of the ftree is that it uses a logistic regression function to split the inner nodes called oblique split and also to make predictions at the leaves in traditional hierarchical models inputs are divided at a tree node by comparing the values of some input attributes with a constant value frank and hall 2011 the goodness of fit performance of a ftree model depends on the parameters used in the ft model notably the number of instances the number of bootstrap iterations and the choice of functions pham et al 2017 to obtain the best performance in this study we selected these parameters by trial and error the ftree algorithm for splitting process uses the gain ratio technique to select an input attribute on which to split then the c4 5 pruning quinlan 1996b is performed to detect any over fitting problem finally the logitboost algorithm is used at leaves to fit the logistic regression functions with least square fits in the following equations m and ci are respectively the number of flood conditioning factors and the class label flood occurrence and non flood and α i and c 0 are respectively the coefficients of flood conditioning factors and the constant coefficient of regression if l c x is the least square fit doetsch et al 2009 the posterior probabilities in the leaves p c x of each class label are formulated as follows landwehr et al 2005 17 p c x exp 2 l c x 1 i 1 m exp 2 l c x 18 l c x i 1 m α i x i c 0 2 2 5 alternating decision tree alternating decision tree adtree is a powerful data mining algorithm that is widely applied to classification and prediction problems shirzadi et al 2018 it was first introduced by buntine 1992 based on the boosting technique and further developed by kohavi et al 1997 an advantage of adtree is that has a simpler structure than other decision tree algorithms with only two components prediction nodes and decision nodes khosravi et al 2018 adtree uses a boosting algorithm to grow the tree then the weights that indicate the contribution of a node to the final prediction score are assigned to each prediction node hong et al 2015 the final prediction probability is computed from the sum of all contribution weights consider a flood pixel in the training dataset x 1 y 1 x m y m where x i r d and y i flood occurrence non flood occurrence adtree predicts the class label of flood and non flood based on the flood conditioning factors if c 1 and c 2 are respectively the precondition and base condition and α and b are two real numbers the prediction is α if c 1 c 2 or b if c 1 c 2 the values of α and b can be formulated as follows chen et al 2017 19 α 1 2 ln w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 b 1 2 ln w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 where w and w are the sum of the weights of all labelled positive and negative examples the cost function for minimizing z t c 1 c 2 to achieve the optimal values of c 1 and c 2 is calculated as follows 20 z t c 1 c 2 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 2 the flood class labels are those that have the best constant prediction and consequently cross validation khosravi et al 2019 3 study area and data acquisition 3 1 general description of the study area quang nam province in central of vietnam was selected for this study fig 5 the eastern part of the province is a densely populated plain whereas the western part is mountainous and sparsely populated in terms of flooding quang nam is the second most affected province in the country luu et al 2019 catastrophic floods such as those in 2007 2009 and 2013 occur in the rainy season from september to december and are responsible for considerable loss of life and property damage 3 2 description of the collected 3 2 1 flood inventory map our database comprises 847 historical flood marks in quang nam province derived from records of the 2007 2009 and 2013 flood events which were often occurred in rainy season from october to december flood mark data were provided by the quang nam provincial steering committee of natural disaster prevention and control and search and rescue and include a coding term location longitude and latitude flood depth and the name and address of the information provider we subdivided the flood marks into two groups one group of 678 locations 80 for the flood modeling process and a second group of 169 locations 20 for evaluation processes additionally we also randomly selected 847 non flood locations over the study area using the create random point tool in arcgis and subdivided them with the same ratio 80 20 we used matlab for modeling and validation processes that the methodology of the current study is shown in fig 6 3 2 2 flood conditioning factors we selected 16 flood conditioning factors as thematic layers for modeling slope angle elevation aspect curvature profile curvature plan curvature topographic wetness index twi stream power index sti stream power index spi distance to river river density flow direction flow accumulation rainfall lithology and land use table 1 the spatial databases were constructed in a matrix with 5493 columns and 4103 rows 22 537 779 pixels and a cell size of 30 30 m we prepared a digital elevation model dem of the study area from topographic maps provided by the vietnam department of geodesy and cartography using this dem we extracted slope angle elevation aspect curvature profile curvature plan curvature twi sti spi in an arcgis 10 3 environment to date there is no agreement among flood modelers as to the most appropriate flood conditioning factors and how to classify each factor in this study we use the natural break jenks optimization method to divide each conditioning factor into five classes table 1 the natural break method generates classes of similar values separated by breakpoints and is appropriate for values that are unevenly distributed or tend to accumulate at one end of the distribution feizizadeh and blaschke 2013 it treats factors equally during the modeling process and minimizes effects of input variability on output 3 2 2 1 slope angle in general gentle slopes are more susceptible to flooding than steeper slopes kazakis et al 2015 as rainfall rapidly runs off steep slopes and pools on plains çelik et al 2012 we grouped slope angle into five classes table 1 over 94 of the flood pixels are in the first class 0 2 66 3 2 2 2 elevation there is an inverse relationship between elevation and flooding as elevation decreases flood frequency and river discharge increase we created five elevation classes the lowest of which contained 99 of the flood pixels 3 2 2 3 aspect aspect affects soil moisture evapotranspiration infiltration solar radiation and local climate although aspect only indirectly affects flooding most researchers have included it as one of the conditioning factors in flood susceptibility mapping choubin et al 2019 aspect was mapped and placed in nine categories corresponding to cardinal directions flood pixels are relatively evenly distributed across these nine classes 3 2 2 4 curvature curvature is a slope form that contributes the heterogeneity of overland flow cardenas et al 2004 a positive curvature value represents a convex slope and a negative value indicates a concave slope while values between 0 and 1 indicate relatively planar surfaces chapi et al 2017 we group slope curvature into five classes over 98 of flood pixels are in the fourth class which is planar to slightly concave 0 2072 1 178 3 2 2 5 profile curvature runoff can accelerate or decelerate depending on the curvature of a profile parallel to the direction of the maximum slope some researchers have considered profile curvature to be an important flood conditioning factor bui et al 2020a hong et al 2018b convex slopes will accelerate overland flow and might affect infiltration soil saturation and surface runoff cao et al 2016 we divided profile curvature into five classes almost 98 of flood pixels are in the third class 0 3374 0 4787 3 2 2 6 plan curvature plan curvature similar to profile curvature is considered an important flood conditioning factor by some researchers ahmadlou et al 2019 hong et al 2018b termeh et al 2018 a convex slope will accelerate overland flow and can affect infiltration soil saturation and surface runoff cao et al 2016 we divided plan curvature into five classes nearly all the flood pixels are in the third class 0 2243 0 6094 3 2 2 7 topographic wetness index topographic wetness index twi is a metric that is based on the ratio of basin area to slope angle wilson and gallant 2000 it provides a measure of soil moisture and may be positively correlated with flood occurrence the twi can be formulated as follows 21 twi l n a s tan β where a s represents the specific catchment area m2 m and β is the slope gradient we divided twi into five classes about 83 of the flood pixels are in the fifth class 8 497 25 380 3 2 2 8 sediment transport index the sediment transport index sti can affect channel bed depth and sediment accumulation as well as structures and navigation systems naik and jay 2011 channel aggradation and erosion can increase flood frequency or magnitude and thus damage infrastructure sti is calculated as 22 sti a s 22 13 0 6 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where a s is the specific catchment area m2 m and β is the slope gradient we defined five classes of sti and found that 94 of the flood pixels are in the first class 0 5 05 3 2 2 9 sediment power index sediment power index spi is a metric that relates discharge to a specific area within a watershed and provides a measure of the erosive power of flowing water poudyal et al 2010 the higher the value of spi is the greater the power of the flood will be lower values of spi denote areas of possible flow accumulation turoğlu and dölek 2011 spi was calculated as 23 spi a s tan β where a s is the cumulative upslope area and tan β represents the slope angle in this study we divided spi into five classes so that 65 880 of flood pixels are in the first class 0 15 63 3 2 2 10 distance to river most flood prone areas are located near rivers where water overflows channel margins we defined five classes for this factor as expected the percentage of flood pixels decreases progressively with increasing distance to river 3 2 2 11 river density in general river density and flood frequency and volume are positively correlated horton 1932 the river density layer has five categories and as expected the percentage of flood pixels is greatest in the class with the highest river density values 3 2 2 12 flow direction flow direction is the characteristic of a surface that directs flow out of each pixel kia et al 2012 and is calculated using the eight flow direction algorithm fairfield and leymarie 1991 it has been considered a conditioning factor for flood susceptibility mapping jacinto et al 2015 lim and lee 2018 we generated the flow direction map using arc hydro tools in arcgis 10 3 3 2 2 13 flow accumulation flow accumulation is considered by some researchers to be an important conditioning factor for flood susceptibility mapping jacinto et al 2015 lim and lee 2018 it is derived from the flow direction variable and the number of upstream pixels each pixel is assigned a value equal to the number of pixels that drain through it kia et al 2012 like flow direction flow accumulation was calculated using the eight flow direction algorithm fairfield and leymarie 1991 and arc hydro tools in arcgis 10 3 the flow accumulation map has five categories over 97 of the flood pixels are in the first two classes 3 2 2 14 rainfall torrential rainfall over a period several hours commonly leads to major flooding chapi et al 2017 to generate a rainfall map we used a dataset from ten meteorological stations and spanning 30 years 1984 2014 interpolation is based the inverse distance weighted idw technique with a power range of 1 the rainfall map of the study area has five classes over 95 of the flood pixels are in the first class 2400 mm yr 3 2 2 15 lithology lithology can affect spatial and temporal patterns of drainage and sediment production in a watershed and thus indirectly affect flooding miller 1990 a lithology that is high erodible or that has low permeability may have an increased likelihood of flooding chapi et al 2017 we created a lithology map of the study area from a 1 50 000 scale nearly 97 of the floods are within areas of unconsolidated sediments 3 2 2 16 land use the land use map provided by department of natural resources and environment of quang nam province has 12 categories the classes with the largest areas are agricultural areas 10 345 forest 74 583 and woodland 6 080 most flood pixels are in residential areas 7 0 agricultural areas 49 7 water bodies 14 4 forests areas 4 4 and plants in residential areas 20 7 3 3 relationship between flood conditioning factors and flood occurrence we performed a frequency ratio fr analysis to check the relationship between each class of each flood conditioning factor and flood occurrences tehrany et al 2013 fr eq 24 is the ratio of the probability of an event to the probability of a non event for a given variable lee and pradhan 2007 pradhan 2010b pradhan and lee 2010 advantages of fr are that it easy to perform and its performance is easily interpreted and understood by model developers yilmaz 2007 the probability of flood occurrence is increased if the fr value in a given class of a conditioning factor is higher than 1 tehrany et al 2013 if the fr value is less than 1 the relationship is weak and the probability of flood occurrence is lower shirzadi et al 2017 we normalized the fr weights and then reclassified all conditioning factors using the normalized values for use as input for machine learning modeling and analysis we used the following equation to normalize the fr values yan et al 2019 24 nf r ij f r ij f r min i f r max i f r min i 25 f r ij n ij n taotal a ij a total where nf r ij is the normalized value of f r ij the ratio for each flood conditioning factor n ij is the number of floods in the jth subclass of factor i n taotal is the total number of floods a ij is the area of the corresponding jth subclass of factor i and a total is the total area of the study area 3 4 flood factor ranking flood conditioning factors that have little or no predictive power must be removed because they generate noise during modeling khosravi et al 2019 in this context data reduction can be accomplished using wrapper and filter methods wrapper feature selection techniques yield better results than filter methods but are computationally complex and require much processing time for large databases karegowda et al 2010 filter techniques are computationally simple fast and scalable examples of these methods include principal component analysis pca correlation based feature selection cfs chi square feature evaluation cfe gain ratio information gain ratio igr markov blanket filter mbf fast correlation based feature selection fcbf and euclidean distance abdel zaher and eldeib karegowda et al 2010 we used igr in this study in eqs 26 29 t is a training dataset with m input samples and m li l is the number of samples in the training dataset t belonging to the class label ci flood non flood occurrences to calculate igr we calculated the entropy en of the dataset with eqs 27 29 then we apply the igr determined by eq 26 to count numbers of instances per feature value and class for each conditioning factor next we computed probabilities and calculated the information gain finally we ranked flood conditioning factors based on their information gain in descending order and determined those flood conditioning factors that should remain in the filtered dataset 26 igr t s en t e n t s spliten t s 27 en t i 1 m m l i s t log 2 m l i s t 28 en t s j 1 m s j t e n t 29 spliten t s j 1 m s j t log 2 s j t where s is slope 3 5 prediction performance evaluation a broad range of metrics and tests have been used by machine learning researchers to evaluate prediction performance in this study we used statistical based metrics and inference statistical tests freidman and wilcoxon signed rank tests 3 5 1 statistical based metrics statistical metrics that we used are sensitivity specificity spe accuracy f1 measure jaccard coefficient matthews s correlation coefficient mcc root mean square error rmse and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc these metrics are calculated from data captured in a confusion matrix table 2 accordingly sensitivity eq 28 is the number of floods that are correctly classified as flood locations tien bui et al 2018a specificity eq 29 is the number of

p is the sum of all ranked floods and n p and n n are respectively the number of flood positives and non flood negative locations 3 5 2 inference statistics in this paper we compare our new model with benchmark models using the friedman test friedman 1937 and the wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon 1992 a non parametric test is appropriate because the dependent variable is binary flood and non flood the non parametric freidman test is used to compare the statistical performance of two models the null hypothesis is that the medians of two models are the same if the significance value is more than 0 05 the null hypothesis is true the performances of the flood models at a significant level of 0 05 are the same if on the other hand the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected indicating that there is a significant difference between the models chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 shirzadi et al 2019 we used the wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the significant differences between two flood models in this test if the null hypothesis is true p value 0 05 and the z value is over the critical values of z 1 96 and 1 96 there is a significant difference in performance between two susceptibility models 4 results and analysis 4 1 frequency ratio analysis of flood conditioning factors frequency ratio fr values for each flood conditioning factor are presented in fig 7 the lowest slope class 2 66 has the highest fr value 4 895 in terms of slope aspect e se s and nw facing slopes have fr values 1 but flat slopes have the highest fr value 2 575 other slope classes n ne sw and w have fr values less than 1 for elevation the lowest class 0 0253 50 739 m has the highest weight fr 5 216 elevation classes higher than 50 m do not contribute to flood occurrence in the study area the highest fr values for the curvature profile and plan curvature factors are associated with planar slope forms the twi class with the highest values 8 497 25 380 is the most susceptible to flooding fr 4 186 the lowest spi and sti classes have the highest fr values for flow direction the 1 2 and 8 32 classes have the highest fr values 1 077 and 1 070 respectively in the case of flow accumulation the 1 390 82 880 class has the highest fr weight 1 178 as might be expected one of the strongest flood condition factors is distance to river the 0 50 m class has the highest weight fr 2 400 and the 100 200 m and 200 500 m have fr values 1 the fr analysis also showed that higher values of river density are associated with higher flood susceptibility the fr value of the densest class 0 9901 2 574 is 3 795 the fr analysis of rainfall shows that the 2400 mm class is the most susceptible to flooding fr 4 915 most flood locations are located on low elevation plains where mean annual precipitation is lower than in the mountains precipitation and elevation thus are not independent variables the marine and deltaic unconsolidated sediment class has the highest lithology fr value 7 669 followed by fluvial unconsolidated sediments fr 1 592 in the case of land use fr weights from highest to lowest are 6 483 water bodies 5 846 plants in residential areas 4 805 agricultural areas 3 762 residential

profile curvature 0 186 spi 0 082 and flow accumulation 0 014 two factors flow direction and slope aspect have amigr values of 0 and were removed from the modeling process they would generate noise and lead to over fitting problems thus decreasing prediction accuracy during the modeling process bui et al 2016 4 3 application of the novel deep learning model we designed a code in matlab r2018 to develop our new deep learning model debp the results of the modeling process are shown in fig 9 fig 9a and d show how well the target flood and output estimate non flood values have been fitted when

annrbf and ftree 0 884 7 values of rmse for the proposed model are lower than those of the other benchmark machine learning algorithms 4 4 development of the flood susceptibility maps we ran the new debp model and the five benchmark machine learning models ann rbf lr lmt adt and ft on the training dataset in the case of the debp model we calculated flood susceptibility indexes fsis weights or probabilities in three steps 1 dbn pre training via rbms cd 1 algorithm for each rbm 2 elm fine tuning with the weights matrix of the first layer of the elms equal to the weights matrix obtained from the last rbm yielding the matrix β and 3 bp fine tuning training the whole network using bp in contrast the annrbf lr lmtree adtree and ftree algorithms have probability distribution functions computed based on fsi values between 0 and 1 each pixel is trained based on these models and fsis are calculated we assessed the goodness of fit of each model based on the training dataset we further tested the validation dataset on the training dataset to check the prediction accuracy of the models we then used all features in the study area as a testing dataset to obtain the fsis for each pixel in each model separately finally we transferred the calculated fsis into a map layer using arcgis software to produce flood susceptibility maps fig 10 a g to determine classes for the flood susceptibility maps we tested all classification methods including equal intervals natural breaks jenks quantile geometrical interval and standard deviation the natural breaks method was selected for the debp model and the quantile method was chosen for annrbf lr lmtree ftree and adtree models these classes in debp model fig 10a were very low susceptibility vls 0 0 100 low susceptibility ls 0 101 0 227 moderate susceptibility ms 0 2271 0 398 high susceptibility hs 0 399 0 437 and very high susceptibility vhs 0 438 1 for annrbf fig 10b these classes were vls 0 005 ls 0 00501 0 0399 ms 0 04 0 0437 hs 0 0438 0 0631 and vhs 0 0632 0 497 however for lr fig 10c model were vls 0 0 00196 ls 0 00197 0 00588 ms 0 00589 0 0176 hs 0 0177 0 0667 and vhs 0 0668 0 500 in the lmtree fig 10d model they were vls 0 001 0 00295 ls 0 00296 0 00686 ms 0 00687 0 0147 hs 0 0148 0 0576 and vhs 0 0577 0 499 in the ftree fig 10e model these classes were vls 0 001 0 00296 vls 0 001 0 00296 ms 0 00688 0 0167 hs

somewhat lower respectively 0 931 0 859 0 890 0 870 and 0 926 fig 11a the corresponding values using the validation dataset were 0 917 0 837 0 892 0 863 and 0 902 fig 11b overall the new deep learning model has a higher performance and prediction accuracy than the other five benchmark models 4 5 2 statistical tests we also examined the performance of the debp model by statistically testing differences between it and the five benchmark models using the friedman test we found that there is a significant difference in performance between the new model and all other benchmark models table 6 we checked the pairwise differences between the models with the wilcoxon signed rank test we found a significant difference between debp and each compared model at the 95 confidence level significance 0 05 and z value exceeds the critical values ranging from 1 96 to 1 96 table 7 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological aspects of flood conditioning factors it is important to select the best factors for predicting floods when developing a new deep learning model we used the frequency ratio fr to quantify the relations between a large number of conditioning factors and floods and found that the floods in the study area mainly occurred at low elevations on gentle to flat slopes with low curvatures and at low elevations in areas with the lowest rainfall surface runoff in the study area is concentrated on low lying flat surfaces adjacent to rivers these areas have a high water table and are vulnerable to flooding during cyclonic storms which are common in vietnam termeh et al 2018 our modeling shows that flooding in the study area is associated with low values of spi and sti and high values of twi areas with the highest values of twi typically have wet soils and a high water table and therefore are more susceptible to flooding termeh et al 2018 flood occurrence correlates strongly with the lowest values of distance to river and the highest values of river density these areas are most likely to experience overbank flooding during heavy rainfall tehrany et al 2014 tien bui et al 2018a 2019 in the case of lithology unconsolidated sediments strongly correlate with flooding because these materials underlie the surfaces of floodplains deltas and the coastal zone we initially assumed that all 16 conditioning factors were important for flood modeling using the igr technique however we found that two factors flow direction and aspect have amigr values of 0 and therefore could be eliminated from further consideration doing so helped decrease noise and over fitting problems and thus enhanced the predictive capability of our new model bui et al 2016 5 2 model verification and comparisons in this study we developed a new deep learning model based on a deep belief network dbn and an extreme learning machine elm algorithm structured by the back propagation and optimized by a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm we used the new model to map flood susceptibility in the vu gia thu bon watershed in central vietnam a total of 847 flood locations and 16 flood conditioning factors selected by the igr technique were used to build and validate the proposed model given the non linearity and complex process of flooding no model or algorithm can achieve perfect prediction power chen et al 2019a there will always be uncertainties related for example to selecting appropriate conditioning factors and the best model to apply to a specific dataset shirzadi et al 2019 a variety of models and techniques have been proposed and used for flood susceptibility mapping worldwide but a recent trend is the development of hybrid machine learning models ahmadlou et al 2019 hong et al 2018a shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 tien bui et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2019 in line with this recent research we have developed a new hybrid model debp and used it to prepare a flood susceptibility map of our study area in central vietnam we compared the map with maps generated from the same dataset by five soft computing machine learning intelligence models annrbf lr lmtree ftree and adtree based on sensitivity specificity accuracy the f1 measure jaccard coefficient mcc rmse and auc our new model has the highest goodness of fit and prediction power and outperformed the other models debp combines the advantages of the deep belief network with the extreme learning machine and the bp algorithms extreme learning machine is an efficient learning algorithm with better generalization performance higher scalability and lower computational complexity than the error propagation algorithm huang and chen 2007 we thus improved the dbn algorithm by using the elm classifier in addition during network training we used pso to find the optimal network topology pso finds suitable structures for flood forecasting by searching large solutions space in the proposed model the unsupervised rbm based pre training step initializes the network using only unlabeled data network initialization is a good starting point for the two next supervised fine tuning step using elm and bp and it significantly reduces the risk of being trapped in local optima ronoud and asadi 2019 because the proposed approach takes advantage of several powerful algorithms it achieves better classification performance than the benchmark models we tested although other mentioned dl models in the introduction for example sea bpnn and lstm have been used for flood forecasting none has been applied to flood susceptibility mapping based on conditioning factors sea bpnn combines a stack auto encoders which provides better optimization and bpnn which supports non linear relations between input parameters advantages of this model are its capacity to represent features and its ability to improve nonlinear simulation however it does not fully consider imbalances in data distribution and it is a cost insensitive approach madnani et al 2018 lstm is a popular recurrent neural network rnn algorithm that mitigates the gradient vanish problem common to rnns tan et al 2015 it uses daily river discharge and rainfall data to forecast floods the predictive ability of this model depends on the correlation between input data at the forecast station and other stations le et al 2019 the difference between dl models such as sea bpnn and lstm and the proposed model is that we use elm to improve dbn weights and the power performance and pso to find an optimal network topology and structure 5 3 limitation of the proposed methodology and future research although our new deep learning model shows promise many problems remain in flood modeling as previously mentioned the most important issues are uncertainties in data inputs and model selection appropriate conditioning factors decrease noise and error and also increase model performance a successful model uses a trial and error process to best fit a training dataset and thus provide the best predictive power and save time and money however researchers have not yet agreed on a universal model or set of guidelines that can be used to produce reliable flood susceptibility maps in all areas we suggest that work should continue on developing new models in different environments by using a combination of gis and data mining tools flooding is a function of many factors including those outside the river including hydrological geomorphological geological land cover and anthropogenic factors and the factors within the river such as hydrological and hydraulic models therefore in the future the combination of these factors may seem necessary to achieve a flood susceptibility map because the inputs of hydrological and hydraulic models and other models based on factors outside the river are completely different and the combination of these inputs in a combined model can reduce many of the challenges associated with flood susceptibility studies we suggest integrating machine learning approaches with physically based hydrological models such as hec hms and hec ras to accurately identify flood prone areas 6 conclusion reliable flood susceptibility maps provide land use managers and government officials with a valuable tool for managing flood risk in this paper we present a new deep learning algorithm and use it to produce an accurate flood susceptibility map we highlight the promise of machine learning tools and in particular deep learning algorithms to better delineate visualize and interpret flood prone areas in our study area in central vietnam the most important factors for flood modeling among the 16 flood conditioning factors that we considered are elevation rainfall and slope angle we successfully used the igr technique to choose appropriate conditioning factors thus objectively meeting the challenge of selecting an appropriate training dataset for modeling the fitted machine learning models and the proposed deep learning model met the challenges posed by data heterogeneity through parameter tuning and defining proper network architectures our model shows that low lying plains in the study area are highly susceptible to flooding because these are the areas where most people live they are a priority for flood management and remediation the proposed model can be extended and improved by incorporating hydraulic and hydrologic data and models to reduce flood risk notably in vietnam where remote sensing systems for constructing a real time flood warning system do not exist the novel deep learning model used and tested in this study has promise for further use in hazard susceptibility mapping flood control and mitigation and disaster management in flood prone areas funding this research was funded by the vietnam national foundation for science

5039,this paper introduces a new deep learning algorithm of deep belief network dbn based on an extreme learning machine elm that is structured by back propagation bn and optimized by particle swarm optimization pso algorithm named debp for flood susceptibility mapping in the vu gia thu bon watershed central vietnam we use 847 locations of floods that occurred in 2007 2009 and 2013 and 16 flood conditioning factors evaluated by an information gain ratio igr technique to construct and validate the proposed model statistical metrics including sensitivity specificity accuracy f1 measure jaccard coefficient matthews correlation coefficient mcc root mean square error rmse and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc are used to assess the goodness of fit performance and

prediction accuracy auc 0 967 of all of the tested models and thus shows promise as a tool for flood susceptibility modeling we conclude that novel deep learning algorithms such as the one used in this study can improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps that are required by planners decision makers and government agencies to manage of areas vulnerable to flood induced damage keywords flood susceptibility deep belief network extreme machine learning optimization algorithm goodness of fit vietnam 1 introduction floods are a global phenomenon and are responsible for much loss life and socio economic disruption and ecosystem damage between 1995 and 2015 damaging floods impacted about 109 million people worldwide alfieri et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2013 although floods have some positive functions for example aquifer replenishment restoration of wetlands and improved soil fertility the benefits of floods are greatly outweighed by the damage they cause as a result flood researchers and authorities are constantly seeking new ways to reduce flood hazards in high risk areas almost all countries of the world are affected by floods but asian countries are particularly vulnerable due to large populations living on floodplains and their vulnerability to cyclones hens et al 2018 van thanh et al 2017 vietnam for example is a typhoon prone country with large populated alluvial plains and a tropical monsoon climate ly and thuy 2019 son and van anh 2019 thai and tri 2019 the central plains of vietnam are particularly at high risk as they experience high rainfall 1800 2500 mm yr and are densely populated van ha et al 2019 an engineered solution to this problem is difficult perhaps even impossible because of the prohibitive costs of effective dyking and other flood control measures accordingly efforts are being made to identify flood prone areas by developing accurate flood susceptibility maps wu et al 2010 flood susceptibility maps are proactive tools that allow land use managers and planners to guide development and prioritize expenditures on flood protection and recovery minh et al 2018 norbiato et al 2008 tuyet et al 2019 there are numerous challenges faced by researchers involved in flood modeling and mapping notably model complexity lack of data and the size and complexity of study areas although many lumped hydrological and distributed models have been employed these models have different goodness of fit and prediction accuracy and none of them is able to accurately simulate floods under different conditions furthermore hydrological models cannot provide reliable results for watersheds with limited data and acquisition of sufficient data in the case of large watersheds can be prohibitively expensive given these limitations data driven models offer the flexibility and power to reliably map flood prone areas even with limited data khosravi et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 they can be used in tandem with geographic information systems and remote sensing tools to better interpret and visualize flood prone terrain traditional models that have been used in the past to map flood susceptibility include bivariate statistical models bsms and multi criteria decision making mcdms methods such as frequency ratio fr analytical hierarchy process ahp and weights of evidence woe shafapour tehrany et al 2019 2017 souissi et al 2019 these traditional methods are based on linear modeling and require hard statistical assumptions that are challenged by complex natural phenomena such as floods termeh et al 2018 to overcome these limitations researchers are increasingly favoring machine learning algorithms mlas for flood susceptibility modeling these algorithms offer several advantages over traditional methods 1 they can predict complex nonlinear structures generate data and model accurately 2 they can be integrated with traditional models but are not limited by statistical assumptions 3 they can easily and effectively cope with limited data olden et al 2008 rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 and 4 they can incorporate spatial data derived from photographs and satellite images lee et al 1990 among these algorithms support vector machine svm logistic regression lr artificial neural network ann and decision tree methods pradhan 2010a tehrany et al 2015 have been used to prepare flood susceptibility maps the most widely used decision tree algorithms in flood modeling are bayesian logistic regression blr logistic models tree lmt random forest chapi et al 2017 alternating decision trees adt classification and regression trees cart reduced error pruning trees rept and naïve bayes trees nbt khosravi et al 2018 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 bui et al 2019b recently argued that limitations and barriers still exist in accurately predicting flood susceptible areas and the search for new improved machine learning ensemble models and optimization algorithms with high predictive power continues ensemble models eliminate the weakness of a single methods by combining two or more methods to achieve higher predictive power hong et al 2018a for example researchers have integrated the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with evolutionary algorithms including cultural anfis ca bees anfis ba and invasive weed optimization anfis iwo tien bui et al 2018a they also used the imperialistic competitive algorithm ica and electromagnetism based firefly algorithm efa tien bui et al 2018a artificial neural network ann and the electromagnetism based firefly algorithm efa bui et al 2019a the genetic algorithm ga and differential evolution de hong et al 2018a and the biogeography based optimization bbo and bat ba algorithms ahmadlou et al 2019 these hybrid evolutionary models are appealing for flood modeling because of their goodness of fit and prediction accuracies in recent years deep learning dl models convolutional neural networks restricted boltzmann machines rbm auto encoders and sparse coding have provided an attractive machine learning framework that has garnered attention and notable success within the machine learning modeling community dls have outperformed traditional mlas in a variety of applications they are more powerful and accurate than machine learning models when a large amount of data must be trained and they learn high level features from complex data in an incremental manner bui et al 2020a reichstein et al 2019 they have been used in geoscience classification schemes such as flood and landslide susceptibility assessment bui et al 2020a ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and have demonstrated outstanding performance in other fields such as computer vision speech recognition control systems physics chemistry and biology khan and yairi 2018 bui et al 2020a developed a new deep learning neural network dlnn algorithm for flood susceptibility mapping in vietnam and showed that this algorithm performed better than the multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn and svm models huang et al 2019 developed a new deep learning model for landslide susceptibility mapping that they named the fully connected spare auto encoder fc sae their deep learning model outperformed benchmark models including svm and back propagation neural network bpnn liu et al 2017 proposed a new deep learning model sae bpnn that integrates stacked auto encoder sae and back propagation neural networks bpnn to predict stream flow six hours into the future they compared the results of this model with the svm bpnn rbf neural network and extreme learning machine elm models and concluded that it greatly outperformed the benchmarks finally le et al 2019 used their lstm neural network model to forecast floods based on daily discharge and rainfall as input data this paper presents and tests a new deep learning model for flood susceptibility mapping that is based on a deep belief network dbn and an extreme learning machine elm structured by back propagation bp and optimized by particle swarm optimization pso we apply this model to generate flood susceptibility maps in quang nam province a flood prone area in central vietnam to the best of our knowledge this is the first use of the new model for flood modeling and prediction ronoud and asadi 2019 developed a model e t dbn elm bp for breast cancer diagnosis however the structure and application of their model are different from those of the model proposed in this paper specifically ronoud and asadi 2019 used a genetic algorithm ga to optimize the weights of the deep neural networks whereas we use particle swarm optimization pso for this purpose our new model uses the elm and bp optimized by the pso algorithm to enhance dbn weights and obtain high prediction accuracy to flood modeling elm offers several advantages over error propagation algorithms such as bp huang and chen 2007 notably better generalization performance higher scalability lower computational complexity and improved dbn weights pso as a powerful optimization algorithm bui et al 2020b that searches in large solution space to find an optimal network topology and structure and thus is well suited for flood susceptibility mapping the proposed model network is initialized in the unsupervised rbm based pre training step using unlabeled data network initialization provides a good starting point for the subsequent supervised fine tuning step via elm and bp and significantly reduces the risk of becoming trapped in local optima ronoud and asadi 2019 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 identify the most important factors for flood modeling using the information gain ration igr technique 2 develop a new robust and powerful deep learning neural network model for flood susceptibility mapping and 3 compare the goodness of fit and prediction accuracy of the proposed model with those of some well known soft computing benchmark models the paper is structured as follows following this introduction we briefly summarize the mathematical structure of dl and mla algorithms we then describe the study area and modeling database results and analysis form the fourth section of the paper we provide a ranking of flood conditioning factors and show the relations between these factors and flood locations we compare and validate the proposed model against soft computing benchmark models we then compare our results with those derived from other published flood susceptibility studies conclusions are presented in the final section of the paper 2 mathematical background of the dl and mla algorithms 2 1 deep learning model restricted boltzmann machine rbm is one of the most successful machine learning methods for pre training large datasets as they can be combined to form deep belief networks dbn hinton et al 2006 dbns have become popular in machine learning applications because of their encoding speed fast inference and higher order network structures kuremoto et al 2014 ronoud and asadi 2019 tamilselvan and wang 2013 wang et al 2016 they have a hierarchical structure based on several rbms and work using a layer by layer learning process tamilselvan and wang 2013 however there are still challenges in their use in real world applications for example how to decide the initial values of connection weights and biases and how to decide their structure in this paper we use an evolutionary hybrid algorithm to improve the power of dbn training ronoud and asadi 2019 specifically we combine dbn with the extreme learning machine elm classifier then to overcome the second challenge mentioned above we optimize the number of hidden neurons and hidden layers by using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the following subsections briefly summarize the mathematical basis of dbn elm and pso and describe our proposed model debp in detail 2 1 1 deep belief network deep belief network dbn is a graphical model consisting of several layers of hidden units hinton 2009 it can be seen as a combination of simple learning modules each of which is a rbm containing a visible layer v and a hidden layer h the first layer represents the data and the second layer extracts higher level correlations from the data there is no connection within a layer but the visible and hidden layers are connected by a symmetrically weighted connection matrix w hinton 2009 rules for updating the weights and biases of stacked rbms are given in eqs 4 5 and 6 4 d w ij e v i h j data v i h j mod e l 5 δ b i ε v i data v i model 6 δ c j ε h j data h j model where d shows the mathematical expectation according to the distribution d and ε b and c are respectively the learning rate bias of the visible layer and bias of the hidden layer to update wij parameters based on eq 4 we must calculate two values v i h j data and v i h j model several methods have been proposed to calculate these values hinton 2010 keyvanrad and homayounpour 2015 le roux and bengio 2008 tieleman 2008 tieleman and hinton 2009 one of the most popular methods is the contrastive divergence algorithm with one gibbs sampling step cd 1 hinton 2010 fig 1 shows the cd 1 pseudo code for a rbm in algorithm 1 palm 2012 training of each rbm in a dbn is independent of the others the first rbm is trained as above and then the hidden layer of first rbm is used as the second rbm s visible layer fig 2 specifically v1 is set to a training instance and converted to h1 by the first rbm cd 1 then trains the second rbm the second training step is the same as the first except that the training data are mapped via the first rbm before being used as training samples shown by the dashed arrow in fig 2 for use in classification problems the visible layer lowest level in fig 2 is initialized with a sample and converted upward until it reaches the hidden layer of the preceding rbm a common way of applying dbns in classification problems is to add a labeled layer at the end of the network and train the entire network using an error back propagation algorithm 2 1 2 extreme learning machine extreme learning machine is an efficient learning algorithm in the family of single hidden layer feed forward neural networks it does not require the hidden layer tuning process the connection weights of the elm transferred from the input layer to the hidden layer as well as the hidden bias and neurons are computed randomly without any additional adjustment however the weights are determined computationally by the least squares method huang et al 2012 the elm function for binary classification schemes is given by eq 7 qu et al 2016 7 f l x s i g m h x β where β β 1 β l t is the output weight vector between the hidden layer and l output nodes and the output vector of the hidden layer is denoted as h x h 1 x h l x if we define t y 1 y n t the output weight can be formulated by eq 8 huang et al 2012 8 β h t h t h h t 1 t where h is the moore penrose generalized inverse of matrix h huang et al 2006 2 1 3 particle swarm optimization particle swarm optimization pso is an iterative algorithm that tracks the position and velocity of each of a large set of particles the position of each particle is used to represent a candidate solution of space and the velocity of each particle is used to update the particle s position in that space eberhart and shi 2001 while searching in a d dimensional hyperspace which is equal to the number of hidden layers in the network the position vector and velocity vector of the particle i are expressed as respectively xi xi1 xi2 xid and vi vi1 vi2 vid in each iteration of modeling process the best position of each particle till current iteration xlb and the best particle of all particles xgb are determined using a fitness function the values of xlb and xgb move the particles towards the optimal solution eberhart and shi 2001 the process starts with a random family of particles and then improves their positions by repeating eqs 9 and 10 9 v i k 1 ω v i k c 1 r 1 x lb x i k c 2 r 2 x gb x i k 10 x i k 1 x i k v i k 1 where ω denotes the damping coefficient which is the resistance of the particle to its movement this coefficient is initially set to 1 and in each iteration is multiplied by the inertia weight damping ratio ω d a m p c1 and c2 are velocity coefficients their function is to better balance the contributions of xlb and xgb to particle displacement random values r1 and r2 are in 0 1 2 1 4 proposed deep learning model debp the feed forward bp network is the most common type of neural network an issue facing modelers who use bp is the possibility that it becomes trapped in poor local optima especially in networks with multiple hidden layers abdel zaher and eldeib 2016 the dbn network s pre training process is used to address this issue hinton et al 2006 typical dbn training consists of three steps first the network is pre trained in a greedy layer wise manner with a stack of rbms using unsupervised data second the output layer is added to the dbn and random weights are assigned to this layer finally the whole network is trained by the bp algorithm using supervised data network pre training prevents the network from becoming trapped in local optima the algorithm converges better and faster if after adding the output layer in the second step the elm method is used to allocate the weight of the output layer ronoud and asadi 2019 the structure of a neural network is important because it affects the learning capacity and generalizability of the network ahmadizar et al 2015 determining the structure and the numbers of layers and nodes per layer are difficult for any dbn application guo et al 2015 discovering the proper structure of a network is a search problem in which the goal is to find the optimal topology for the network evolutionary algorithms are a good option for this task kuremoto et al 2014 ronoud and asadi 2019 and pso is an evolutionary search method that can find optimal or near optimal solutions therefore for our proposed evolutionary model debp we optimize the network topology using the pso algorithm the algorithm was originally used for continuous problems thus we use continuous values in the interval 0 1 for particle encoding then before evaluating particle positions using a fitness function the position of each particle is discretized by eq 11 11 k i min 1 m x i m in which m is the maximum number of hidden neurons determined by the user and ki is the discrete value of the continuous position xi the number of position dimensions represents the number of hidden layers and the discrete amount of each position s dimension represents the hidden neurons of the dbn the classification accuracy percentage criteria that is used to calculate the fitness of each ki is given by eq 12 12 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 100 in which tp tn fp and fn are respectively the number of true positive true negative false positive and false negative values the flowchart of the pso algorithm for finding optimal network topology is shown in fig 3 2 2 soft computing machine learning benchmark models 2 2 1 logistic regression logistic regression lr which was first introduced by mcfadden 1973 is a popular multivariate statistical analysis method we use lr to evaluate conditioning factors that might affect the probability of flood occurrences shafapour tehrany et al 2017 lr offers several advantages over other statistical models 1 the dependent variable and conditioning factors do not need to be normal distributed 2 conditioning factors can be either continuous discrete or an ensembles of the two 3 the dependent variable can be expressed with a binary code mousavi et al 2011 shirzadi et al 2012 in this paper flooding is the dependent variable and is coded as flood 1 or non flood 0 in contrast the conditioning factors are continuous to prepare the flood susceptibility map based on lr we computed the weights of all conditioning factors using weka 3 9 software and then assigned those weights spatially in a gis the higher the lr coefficient of the conditioning factor the higher the likelihood that the factor is associated with flood occurrence ayalew and yamagishi 2005 additionally a positive coefficient indicates a more important role compared to a negative coefficient shirzadi et al 2012 the following formulae were used to compute the probability of flood occurrence 13 p e z 1 e z 14 z c 0 c 1 x 1 c 2 x 2 c n x n where p is the probability of flood occurrence and ranges between 0 and 1 z is a linear combination c 0 is the intercept of the model c i i 0 1 2 n denotes the lr coefficients and x i i 0 1 2 n represents the flood conditioning factors 2 2 2 artificial neural network an artificial neural network ann is a supervised machine learning algorithm that computationally makes predictions from inputs based on human perception bui et al 2019b garrett 1994 the method is commonly used when relationships among data are unknown kia et al 2012 an ann comprises a number of neurons or nodes that are used to transform input data into output classes it comprises three layers an input layer neurons or in this study flood conditioning factors a hidden layer individual neurons to obtain the flood susceptibility class labels in the output layer and an output layer flood class labels fig 4 in each layer direct links connect neurons in order to assign weights to show the strength of the outgoing signal kia et al 2012 in this study input data flood conditioning factors are used for training by ann based on the class labels flood and non flood then the trained ann model is run to classify flood and non flood occurrences ngo et al 2018 the neural network architecture in our study employs a radial basis function rbf which is a vigor classifier yilmaz and kaynar 2011 its kernel function is an alternative to the multi perceptron neural network mlp for solving complex environmental problems and is used by many researchers bishop 1995 haykin 1994 ngo et al 2018 2 2 3 logistic model tree the logistic model tree lmtree combines a c4 5 decision tree algorithm quinlan 1996a and a logistic regression function chen et al 2018 two processes are performed by the algorithm 1 tree splitting is done using the information gain technique and 2 lr fitting at a tree node is done by the logitboost algorithm landwehr et al 2005 the over fitting problem encountered in the use of lmtree has been addressed by using the classification and regression tree cart algorithm chen et al 2019b in flood susceptibility modeling by lmtree a c4 5 algorithm first splits flood conditioning factors into two binary classes flood 1 and non flood 0 according to the probability of flood occurrence in the following equations m and ci are respectively the number of flood conditioning factors and the class label flood and non flood and α i and c 0 are respectively the coefficients of each flood conditioning factor and the constant coefficient of regression if l c x is the least square fit the posterior probability p c x of each class label is formulated as follows landwehr et al 2005 15 p c x exp l c x i 1 m exp l c x 16 l c x i 1 m α i x i c 0 2 2 4 functional tree functional tree ftree is a hierarchical model that is used to create multivariate trees in both regression and classification schemes gama 2004 it can be used for prediction in three states 1 inner nodes to decrease bias 2 leaves to decrease variance and 3 combined attributes at both functional inner nodes and leaves when the dataset is very large gama 2004 the main advantage of the ftree is that it uses a logistic regression function to split the inner nodes called oblique split and also to make predictions at the leaves in traditional hierarchical models inputs are divided at a tree node by comparing the values of some input attributes with a constant value frank and hall 2011 the goodness of fit performance of a ftree model depends on the parameters used in the ft model notably the number of instances the number of bootstrap iterations and the choice of functions pham et al 2017 to obtain the best performance in this study we selected these parameters by trial and error the ftree algorithm for splitting process uses the gain ratio technique to select an input attribute on which to split then the c4 5 pruning quinlan 1996b is performed to detect any over fitting problem finally the logitboost algorithm is used at leaves to fit the logistic regression functions with least square fits in the following equations m and ci are respectively the number of flood conditioning factors and the class label flood occurrence and non flood and α i and c 0 are respectively the coefficients of flood conditioning factors and the constant coefficient of regression if l c x is the least square fit doetsch et al 2009 the posterior probabilities in the leaves p c x of each class label are formulated as follows landwehr et al 2005 17 p c x exp 2 l c x 1 i 1 m exp 2 l c x 18 l c x i 1 m α i x i c 0 2 2 5 alternating decision tree alternating decision tree adtree is a powerful data mining algorithm that is widely applied to classification and prediction problems shirzadi et al 2018 it was first introduced by buntine 1992 based on the boosting technique and further developed by kohavi et al 1997 an advantage of adtree is that has a simpler structure than other decision tree algorithms with only two components prediction nodes and decision nodes khosravi et al 2018 adtree uses a boosting algorithm to grow the tree then the weights that indicate the contribution of a node to the final prediction score are assigned to each prediction node hong et al 2015 the final prediction probability is computed from the sum of all contribution weights consider a flood pixel in the training dataset x 1 y 1 x m y m where x i r d and y i flood occurrence non flood occurrence adtree predicts the class label of flood and non flood based on the flood conditioning factors if c 1 and c 2 are respectively the precondition and base condition and α and b are two real numbers the prediction is α if c 1 c 2 or b if c 1 c 2 the values of α and b can be formulated as follows chen et al 2017 19 α 1 2 ln w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 b 1 2 ln w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 where w and w are the sum of the weights of all labelled positive and negative examples the cost function for minimizing z t c 1 c 2 to achieve the optimal values of c 1 and c 2 is calculated as follows 20 z t c 1 c 2 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 1 c 2 w c 2 the flood class labels are those that have the best constant prediction and consequently cross validation khosravi et al 2019 3 study area and data acquisition 3 1 general description of the study area quang nam province in central of vietnam was selected for this study fig 5 the eastern part of the province is a densely populated plain whereas the western part is mountainous and sparsely populated in terms of flooding quang nam is the second most affected province in the country luu et al 2019 catastrophic floods such as those in 2007 2009 and 2013 occur in the rainy season from september to december and are responsible for considerable loss of life and property damage 3 2 description of the collected 3 2 1 flood inventory map our database comprises 847 historical flood marks in quang nam province derived from records of the 2007 2009 and 2013 flood events which were often occurred in rainy season from october to december flood mark data were provided by the quang nam provincial steering committee of natural disaster prevention and control and search and rescue and include a coding term location longitude and latitude flood depth and the name and address of the information provider we subdivided the flood marks into two groups one group of 678 locations 80 for the flood modeling process and a second group of 169 locations 20 for evaluation processes additionally we also randomly selected 847 non flood locations over the study area using the create random point tool in arcgis and subdivided them with the same ratio 80 20 we used matlab for modeling and validation processes that the methodology of the current study is shown in fig 6 3 2 2 flood conditioning factors we selected 16 flood conditioning factors as thematic layers for modeling slope angle elevation aspect curvature profile curvature plan curvature topographic wetness index twi stream power index sti stream power index spi distance to river river density flow direction flow accumulation rainfall lithology and land use table 1 the spatial databases were constructed in a matrix with 5493 columns and 4103 rows 22 537 779 pixels and a cell size of 30 30 m we prepared a digital elevation model dem of the study area from topographic maps provided by the vietnam department of geodesy and cartography using this dem we extracted slope angle elevation aspect curvature profile curvature plan curvature twi sti spi in an arcgis 10 3 environment to date there is no agreement among flood modelers as to the most appropriate flood conditioning factors and how to classify each factor in this study we use the natural break jenks optimization method to divide each conditioning factor into five classes table 1 the natural break method generates classes of similar values separated by breakpoints and is appropriate for values that are unevenly distributed or tend to accumulate at one end of the distribution feizizadeh and blaschke 2013 it treats factors equally during the modeling process and minimizes effects of input variability on output 3 2 2 1 slope angle in general gentle slopes are more susceptible to flooding than steeper slopes kazakis et al 2015 as rainfall rapidly runs off steep slopes and pools on plains çelik et al 2012 we grouped slope angle into five classes table 1 over 94 of the flood pixels are in the first class 0 2 66 3 2 2 2 elevation there is an inverse relationship between elevation and flooding as elevation decreases flood frequency and river discharge increase we created five elevation classes the lowest of which contained 99 of the flood pixels 3 2 2 3 aspect aspect affects soil moisture evapotranspiration infiltration solar radiation and local climate although aspect only indirectly affects flooding most researchers have included it as one of the conditioning factors in flood susceptibility mapping choubin et al 2019 aspect was mapped and placed in nine categories corresponding to cardinal directions flood pixels are relatively evenly distributed across these nine classes 3 2 2 4 curvature curvature is a slope form that contributes the heterogeneity of overland flow cardenas et al 2004 a positive curvature value represents a convex slope and a negative value indicates a concave slope while values between 0 and 1 indicate relatively planar surfaces chapi et al 2017 we group slope curvature into five classes over 98 of flood pixels are in the fourth class which is planar to slightly concave 0 2072 1 178 3 2 2 5 profile curvature runoff can accelerate or decelerate depending on the curvature of a profile parallel to the direction of the maximum slope some researchers have considered profile curvature to be an important flood conditioning factor bui et al 2020a hong et al 2018b convex slopes will accelerate overland flow and might affect infiltration soil saturation and surface runoff cao et al 2016 we divided profile curvature into five classes almost 98 of flood pixels are in the third class 0 3374 0 4787 3 2 2 6 plan curvature plan curvature similar to profile curvature is considered an important flood conditioning factor by some researchers ahmadlou et al 2019 hong et al 2018b termeh et al 2018 a convex slope will accelerate overland flow and can affect infiltration soil saturation and surface runoff cao et al 2016 we divided plan curvature into five classes nearly all the flood pixels are in the third class 0 2243 0 6094 3 2 2 7 topographic wetness index topographic wetness index twi is a metric that is based on the ratio of basin area to slope angle wilson and gallant 2000 it provides a measure of soil moisture and may be positively correlated with flood occurrence the twi can be formulated as follows 21 twi l n a s tan β where a s represents the specific catchment area m2 m and β is the slope gradient we divided twi into five classes about 83 of the flood pixels are in the fifth class 8 497 25 380 3 2 2 8 sediment transport index the sediment transport index sti can affect channel bed depth and sediment accumulation as well as structures and navigation systems naik and jay 2011 channel aggradation and erosion can increase flood frequency or magnitude and thus damage infrastructure sti is calculated as 22 sti a s 22 13 0 6 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where a s is the specific catchment area m2 m and β is the slope gradient we defined five classes of sti and found that 94 of the flood pixels are in the first class 0 5 05 3 2 2 9 sediment power index sediment power index spi is a metric that relates discharge to a specific area within a watershed and provides a measure of the erosive power of flowing water poudyal et al 2010 the higher the value of spi is the greater the power of the flood will be lower values of spi denote areas of possible flow accumulation turoğlu and dölek 2011 spi was calculated as 23 spi a s tan β where a s is the cumulative upslope area and tan β represents the slope angle in this study we divided spi into five classes so that 65 880 of flood pixels are in the first class 0 15 63 3 2 2 10 distance to river most flood prone areas are located near rivers where water overflows channel margins we defined five classes for this factor as expected the percentage of flood pixels decreases progressively with increasing distance to river 3 2 2 11 river density in general river density and flood frequency and volume are positively correlated horton 1932 the river density layer has five categories and as expected the percentage of flood pixels is greatest in the class with the highest river density values 3 2 2 12 flow direction flow direction is the characteristic of a surface that directs flow out of each pixel kia et al 2012 and is calculated using the eight flow direction algorithm fairfield and leymarie 1991 it has been considered a conditioning factor for flood susceptibility mapping jacinto et al 2015 lim and lee 2018 we generated the flow direction map using arc hydro tools in arcgis 10 3 3 2 2 13 flow accumulation flow accumulation is considered by some researchers to be an important conditioning factor for flood susceptibility mapping jacinto et al 2015 lim and lee 2018 it is derived from the flow direction variable and the number of upstream pixels each pixel is assigned a value equal to the number of pixels that drain through it kia et al 2012 like flow direction flow accumulation was calculated using the eight flow direction algorithm fairfield and leymarie 1991 and arc hydro tools in arcgis 10 3 the flow accumulation map has five categories over 97 of the flood pixels are in the first two classes 3 2 2 14 rainfall torrential rainfall over a period several hours commonly leads to major flooding chapi et al 2017 to generate a rainfall map we used a dataset from ten meteorological stations and spanning 30 years 1984 2014 interpolation is based the inverse distance weighted idw technique with a power range of 1 the rainfall map of the study area has five classes over 95 of the flood pixels are in the first class 2400 mm yr 3 2 2 15 lithology lithology can affect spatial and temporal patterns of drainage and sediment production in a watershed and thus indirectly affect flooding miller 1990 a lithology that is high erodible or that has low permeability may have an increased likelihood of flooding chapi et al 2017 we created a lithology map of the study area from a 1 50 000 scale nearly 97 of the floods are within areas of unconsolidated sediments 3 2 2 16 land use the land use map provided by department of natural resources and environment of quang nam province has 12 categories the classes with the largest areas are agricultural areas 10 345 forest 74 583 and woodland 6 080 most flood pixels are in residential areas 7 0 agricultural areas 49 7 water bodies 14 4 forests areas 4 4 and plants in residential areas 20 7 3 3 relationship between flood conditioning factors and flood occurrence we performed a frequency ratio fr analysis to check the relationship between each class of each flood conditioning factor and flood occurrences tehrany et al 2013 fr eq 24 is the ratio of the probability of an event to the probability of a non event for a given variable lee and pradhan 2007 pradhan 2010b pradhan and lee 2010 advantages of fr are that it easy to perform and its performance is easily interpreted and understood by model developers yilmaz 2007 the probability of flood occurrence is increased if the fr value in a given class of a conditioning factor is higher than 1 tehrany et al 2013 if the fr value is less than 1 the relationship is weak and the probability of flood occurrence is lower shirzadi et al 2017 we normalized the fr weights and then reclassified all conditioning factors using the normalized values for use as input for machine learning modeling and analysis we used the following equation to normalize the fr values yan et al 2019 24 nf r ij f r ij f r min i f r max i f r min i 25 f r ij n ij n taotal a ij a total where nf r ij is the normalized value of f r ij the ratio for each flood conditioning factor n ij is the number of floods in the jth subclass of factor i n taotal is the total number of floods a ij is the area of the corresponding jth subclass of factor i and a total is the total area of the study area 3 4 flood factor ranking flood conditioning factors that have little or no predictive power must be removed because they generate noise during modeling khosravi et al 2019 in this context data reduction can be accomplished using wrapper and filter methods wrapper feature selection techniques yield better results than filter methods but are computationally complex and require much processing time for large databases karegowda et al 2010 filter techniques are computationally simple fast and scalable examples of these methods include principal component analysis pca correlation based feature selection cfs chi square feature evaluation cfe gain ratio information gain ratio igr markov blanket filter mbf fast correlation based feature selection fcbf and euclidean distance abdel zaher and eldeib karegowda et al 2010 we used igr in this study in eqs 26 29 t is a training dataset with m input samples and m li l is the number of samples in the training dataset t belonging to the class label ci flood non flood occurrences to calculate igr we calculated the entropy en of the dataset with eqs 27 29 then we apply the igr determined by eq 26 to count numbers of instances per feature value and class for each conditioning factor next we computed probabilities and calculated the information gain finally we ranked flood conditioning factors based on their information gain in descending order and determined those flood conditioning factors that should remain in the filtered dataset 26 igr t s en t e n t s spliten t s 27 en t i 1 m m l i s t log 2 m l i s t 28 en t s j 1 m s j t e n t 29 spliten t s j 1 m s j t log 2 s j t where s is slope 3 5 prediction performance evaluation a broad range of metrics and tests have been used by machine learning researchers to evaluate prediction performance in this study we used statistical based metrics and inference statistical tests freidman and wilcoxon signed rank tests 3 5 1 statistical based metrics statistical metrics that we used are sensitivity specificity spe accuracy f1 measure jaccard coefficient matthews s correlation coefficient mcc root mean square error rmse and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc these metrics are calculated from data captured in a confusion matrix table 2 accordingly sensitivity eq 28 is the number of floods that are correctly classified as flood locations tien bui et al 2018a specificity eq 29 is the number of

domingos 2003 rosset 2004 it denotes the probability that a model ranks randomly the selected positive flood events higher than the negative non flood events halimu et al 2019 unlike the threshold and probability measures it represents the overall performance of a model hand and till 2001 it can be formulated for a two class problem as follows hand and till 2001 35 auc s p n p n n 1 n p n n where s p is the sum of all ranked floods and n p and n n are respectively the number of flood positives and non flood negative locations 3 5 2 inference statistics in this paper we compare our new model with benchmark models using the friedman test friedman 1937 and the wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon 1992 a non parametric test is appropriate because the dependent variable is binary flood and non flood the non parametric freidman test is used to compare the statistical performance of two models the null hypothesis is that the medians of two models are the same if the significance value is more than 0 05 the null hypothesis is true the performances of the flood models at a significant level of 0 05 are the same if on the other hand the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected indicating that there is a significant difference between the models chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 shirzadi et al 2019 we used the wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the significant differences between two flood models in this test if the null hypothesis is true p value 0 05 and the z value is over the critical values of z 1 96 and 1 96 there is a significant difference in performance between two susceptibility models 4 results and analysis 4 1 frequency ratio analysis of flood conditioning factors frequency ratio fr values for each flood conditioning factor are presented in fig 7 the lowest slope class 2 66 has the highest fr value 4 895 in terms of slope aspect e se s and nw facing slopes have fr values 1 but flat slopes have the highest fr value 2 575 other slope classes n ne sw and w have fr values less than 1 for elevation the lowest class 0 0253 50 739 m has the highest weight fr 5 216 elevation classes higher than 50 m do not contribute to flood occurrence in the study area the highest fr values for the curvature profile and plan curvature factors are associated with planar slope forms the twi class with the highest values 8 497 25 380 is the most susceptible to flooding fr 4 186 the lowest spi and sti classes have the highest fr values for flow direction the 1 2 and 8 32 classes have the highest fr values 1 077 and 1 070 respectively in the case of flow accumulation the 1 390 82 880 class has the highest fr weight 1 178 as might be expected one of the strongest flood condition factors is distance to river the 0 50 m class has the highest weight fr 2 400 and the 100 200 m and 200 500 m have fr values 1 the fr analysis also showed that higher values of river density are associated with higher flood susceptibility the fr value of the densest class 0 9901 2 574 is 3 795 the fr analysis of rainfall shows that the 2400 mm class is the most susceptible to flooding fr 4 915 most flood locations are located on low elevation plains where mean annual precipitation is lower than in the mountains precipitation and elevation thus are not independent variables the marine and deltaic unconsolidated sediment class has the highest lithology fr value 7 669 followed by fluvial unconsolidated sediments fr 1 592 in the case of land use fr weights from highest to lowest are 6 483 water bodies 5 846 plants in residential areas 4 805 agricultural areas 3 762 residential areas 3 470 bare soil and 1 971 transportation 4 2 relative importance of flood factors selecting factors with high prediction capability and removing weak ones enhance the predictive power of the

profile curvature 0 186 spi 0 082 and flow accumulation 0 014 two factors flow direction and slope aspect have amigr values of 0 and were removed from the modeling process they would generate noise and lead to over fitting problems thus decreasing prediction accuracy during the modeling process bui et al 2016 4 3 application of the novel deep learning model we designed a code in matlab r2018 to develop our new deep learning model debp the results of the modeling process are shown in fig 9 fig 9a and d show how well the target flood and output estimate non flood values have been fitted when the target and output using the training dataset are in agreement the model is well trained and therefore has a high goodness of fit mse and rmse provide quantitative measures of the goodness of fit

testing dataset are 0 0416 and 0 204 fig 9b e the standard deviation and mean for the training dataset are 0 00 and 0 196 and corresponding values for the testing dataset are 5 04 10 5 and 0 200 fig 9c f 4 3 1 parameter tuning a model is successfully trained and learned when the parameters in the model are appropriately selected and used parameter tuning helps to achieve this objective parameters were set through a trial and error method using the pso model both for the new proposed machine learning model table 3 and other benchmark machine models table 4 4 3 2 classification performance we ran the new proposed deep learning model and some benchmark machine learning models 20 times to achieve the highest evaluation metrics with the least error the results for the validation dataset which are summarized below and in table 5 show that our new deep learning model debp outperformed other models 1 the debp annrbf lmtree lr and ftree models have the highest sensitivity 0 994 indicating that they correctly classified 99 4 of flood pixels as flood the adtree model has a slightly lower sensitivity 0 988 2 debp yielded the highest specificity values 0 923 indicating that it correctly identified 92 3 of non flood pixels as non flood annrbf lr lmtree ftree and adtree yielded specificity values for the validation dataset of respectively 0 876 0 882 0 876 and 0 899 3 debp has the

annrbf and ftree 0 884 7 values of rmse for the proposed model are lower than those of the other benchmark machine learning algorithms 4 4 development of the flood susceptibility maps we ran the new debp model and the five benchmark machine learning models ann rbf lr lmt adt and ft on the training dataset in the case of the debp model we calculated flood susceptibility indexes fsis weights or probabilities in three steps 1 dbn pre training via rbms cd 1 algorithm for each rbm 2 elm fine tuning with the weights matrix of the first layer of the elms equal to the weights matrix obtained from the last rbm yielding the matrix β and 3 bp fine tuning training the whole network using bp in contrast the annrbf lr lmtree adtree and ftree algorithms have probability distribution functions computed based on fsi values between 0 and 1 each pixel is trained based on these models and fsis are calculated we assessed the goodness of fit of each model based on the training dataset we further tested the validation dataset on the training dataset to check the prediction accuracy of the models we then used all features in the study area as a testing dataset to obtain the fsis for each pixel in each model separately finally we transferred the calculated fsis into a map layer using arcgis software to produce flood susceptibility maps fig 10 a g to determine classes for the flood susceptibility maps we tested all classification methods including equal intervals natural breaks jenks quantile geometrical interval and standard deviation the natural breaks method was selected for the debp model and the quantile method was chosen for annrbf lr lmtree ftree and adtree models these classes in debp model fig 10a were very low susceptibility vls 0 0 100 low susceptibility ls 0 101 0 227 moderate susceptibility ms 0 2271 0 398 high susceptibility hs 0 399 0 437 and very high susceptibility vhs 0 438 1 for annrbf fig 10b these classes were vls 0 005 ls 0 00501 0 0399 ms 0 04 0

somewhat lower respectively 0 931 0 859 0 890 0 870 and 0 926 fig 11a the corresponding values using the validation dataset were 0 917 0 837 0 892 0 863 and 0 902 fig 11b overall the new deep learning model has a higher performance and prediction accuracy than the other five benchmark models 4 5 2 statistical tests we also examined the performance of the debp model by statistically testing differences between it and the five benchmark models using the friedman test we found that there is a significant difference in performance between the new model and all other benchmark models table 6 we checked the pairwise differences between the models with the wilcoxon signed rank test we found a significant difference between debp and each compared model at the 95 confidence level significance 0 05 and z value exceeds the critical values ranging from 1 96 to 1 96 table 7 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological aspects of flood conditioning factors it is important to select the best factors for predicting floods when developing a new deep learning model we used the frequency ratio fr to quantify the relations between a large number of conditioning factors and floods and found that the floods in the study area mainly occurred at low elevations on gentle to flat slopes with low curvatures and at low elevations in areas with the lowest rainfall surface runoff in the study area is concentrated on low lying flat surfaces adjacent to rivers these areas have a high water table and are vulnerable to flooding during cyclonic storms which are common in vietnam termeh et al 2018 our modeling shows that flooding in the study area is associated with low values of spi and sti and high values of twi areas with the highest values of twi typically have wet soils and a high water table and therefore are more susceptible to flooding termeh et al 2018 flood occurrence correlates strongly with the lowest values of distance to river and the highest values of river density these areas are most likely to experience overbank flooding during heavy rainfall tehrany et al 2014 tien bui et al 2018a 2019 in the case of lithology unconsolidated sediments strongly correlate with flooding because these materials underlie the surfaces of floodplains deltas and the coastal zone we initially assumed that all 16 conditioning factors were important for flood modeling using the igr technique however we found that two factors flow direction and aspect have amigr values of 0 and therefore could be eliminated from further consideration doing so helped decrease noise and over fitting problems and thus enhanced the predictive capability of our new model bui et al 2016 5 2 model verification and comparisons in this study we developed a new deep learning model based on a deep belief network dbn and an extreme learning machine elm algorithm structured by the back propagation and optimized by a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm we used the new model to map flood susceptibility in the vu gia thu bon watershed in central vietnam a total of 847 flood locations and 16 flood conditioning factors selected by the igr technique were used to build and validate the proposed model given the non linearity and complex process of flooding no model or algorithm can achieve perfect prediction power chen et al 2019a there will always be uncertainties related for example to selecting appropriate conditioning factors and the best model to apply to a specific dataset shirzadi et al 2019 a variety of models and techniques have been proposed and used for flood susceptibility mapping worldwide but a recent trend is the development of hybrid machine learning models ahmadlou et al 2019 hong et al 2018a shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 tien bui et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2019 in line with this recent research we have developed a new hybrid model debp and used it to prepare a flood susceptibility map of our study area in central vietnam we compared the map with maps generated from the same dataset by five soft computing machine learning intelligence models annrbf lr lmtree ftree and adtree based on sensitivity specificity accuracy the f1 measure jaccard coefficient mcc rmse and auc our new model has the highest goodness of fit and prediction power and outperformed the other models debp combines the advantages of the deep belief network with the extreme learning machine and the bp algorithms extreme learning machine is an efficient learning algorithm with better generalization performance higher scalability and lower computational complexity than the error propagation algorithm huang and chen 2007 we thus improved the dbn algorithm by using the elm classifier in addition during network training we used pso to find the optimal network topology pso finds suitable structures for flood forecasting by searching large solutions space in the proposed model the unsupervised rbm based pre training step initializes the network using only unlabeled data network initialization is a good starting point for the two next supervised fine tuning step using elm and bp and it significantly reduces the risk of being trapped in local optima ronoud and asadi 2019 because the proposed approach takes advantage of several powerful algorithms it achieves better classification performance than the benchmark models we tested although other mentioned dl models in the introduction for example sea bpnn and lstm have been used for flood forecasting none has been applied to flood susceptibility mapping based on conditioning factors sea bpnn combines a stack auto encoders which provides better optimization and bpnn which supports non linear relations between input parameters advantages of this model are its capacity to represent features and its ability to improve nonlinear simulation however it does not fully consider imbalances in data distribution and it is a cost insensitive approach madnani et al 2018 lstm is a popular recurrent neural network rnn algorithm that mitigates the gradient vanish problem common to rnns tan et al 2015 it uses daily river discharge and rainfall data to forecast floods the predictive ability of this model depends on the correlation between input data at the forecast station and other stations le et al 2019 the difference between dl models such as sea bpnn and lstm and the proposed model is that we use elm to improve dbn weights and the power performance and pso to find an optimal network topology and structure 5 3 limitation of the proposed methodology and future research although our new deep learning model shows promise many problems remain in flood modeling as previously mentioned the most important issues are uncertainties in data inputs and model selection appropriate conditioning factors decrease noise and error and also increase model performance a successful model uses a trial and error process to best fit a training dataset and thus provide the best predictive power and save time and money however researchers have not yet agreed on a universal model or set of guidelines that can be used to produce reliable flood susceptibility maps in all areas we suggest that work should continue on developing new models in different environments by using a combination of gis and data mining tools flooding is a function of many factors including those outside the river including hydrological geomorphological geological land cover and anthropogenic factors and the factors within the river such as hydrological and hydraulic models therefore in the future the combination of these factors may seem necessary to achieve a flood susceptibility map because the inputs of hydrological and hydraulic models and other models based on factors outside the river are completely different and the combination of these inputs in a combined model can reduce many of the challenges associated with flood susceptibility studies we suggest integrating machine learning approaches with physically based hydrological models such as hec hms and hec ras to accurately identify flood prone areas 6 conclusion reliable flood susceptibility maps provide land use managers and government officials with a valuable tool for managing flood risk in this paper we present a new deep learning algorithm and use it to produce an accurate flood susceptibility map we highlight the promise of machine learning tools and in particular deep learning algorithms to better delineate visualize and interpret flood prone areas in our study area in central vietnam the most important factors for flood modeling among the 16 flood conditioning factors that we considered are elevation rainfall and slope angle we successfully used the igr technique to choose appropriate conditioning factors thus objectively meeting the challenge of selecting an appropriate training dataset for modeling the fitted machine learning models and the proposed deep learning model met the challenges posed by data heterogeneity through parameter tuning and defining proper network architectures our model shows that low lying plains in the study area are highly susceptible to flooding because these are the areas where most people live they are a priority for flood management and remediation the proposed model can be extended and improved by incorporating hydraulic and hydrologic data and models to reduce flood risk notably in vietnam where remote sensing systems for constructing a real time flood warning system do not exist the novel deep learning model used and tested in this study has promise for further use in hazard susceptibility mapping flood control and mitigation and disaster management in flood prone areas funding this research was funded by the vietnam national foundation for science
