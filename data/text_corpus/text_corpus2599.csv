12995,operational strategies to maintain the potential for organic matter removal and methane production were applied to a pilot scale uasb reactor fed by vinasse the beginning of the research took place after interrupting the system feeding for 5 weeks three consecutive phases were carried out in phase i the uasb s restart with vinasse was studied in phase ii sugarcane molasses was used to replace vinasse and in phase iii resuming the vinasse operation was evaluated in the whole experiment the reactor maintained values close to 80 of cod removal efficiency phase i presented productivity and methane yield reaching 10 24 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and 0 40 l ch4 g 1 codr indicating the system s recovery capacity after shutdown exchanging vinasse for molasses phase ii caused a reduction of 69 7 in methane production which was 3 10 l ch4 l 1 day 1 after resuming vinasse feeding phase iii the methane production was 1 19 l ch4 l 1 day 1 the results led us to conclude that after a period of feeding interruption the reactor start up procedure was more adequate than the strategy of replacing vinasse with molasses to maintain methane production keywords codigestion anaerobic digestion pilot scale process stability methane productivity 1 introduction brazil is the world s largest producer of sugarcane which is why it ranks high in ethanol production globally average of 400 thousand l day 1 consequently the volume of vinasse wastewater generated in the processing of sugarcane for ethanol production is also significant in the country requiring strategies to mitigate the environmental impact the anaerobic biological process of organic matter conversion is a suitable option for reducing both the organic load and the waste of energy potential of vinasse because from the anaerobic microbial activity it is possible to convert organic matter into methane which can be used as an alternative source of energy since 1982 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors have been used on a full scale for processing sugarcane vinasse in brazil 1 2 this technology translates into an environmentally sustainable option for mitigating the negative impacts of vinasse reducing organic load and promoting the biogas generation from a business point of view including anaerobic digestion of vinasse in the sugar and alcohol industry is intended to save natural and financial resources uasb stands out among anaerobic treatment systems due to less investment requirements when compared to others technologies 3 this advantage is due to the fact that they are compact systems with low area demand relatively simple operation low sludge production relatively fast start up after long shutdown periods low energy consumption and potential for energy recovery through the produced biogas the limitations concerning technological applications of anaerobic processes to recover the energy content of vinasse in this case the uasb are mainly related to the start up and maintenance of active biomass in the reactor these factors are worsened by both the high concentration of organic matter and organic load rate applied to the reactor which have a toxic effect and the need for adapting biomass to by products of anaerobic digestion 4 considering the maintenance of active biomass in the reactor one of the aspects mentioned above another challenge is related to the interruption of the sugarcane harvest and consequent vinasse generation due to its seasonality which jeopardizes the vinasse availability to feed the uasb reactor throughout the year the problem of forced pause in the treatment system is related to the maintenance of the activity of the microorganisms responsible for the treatment and also to the continuity of energy production in this context the use of substrates such as molasses was thought of as an alternative to vinasse in these periods due to its low added value high availability and its potential for biogas production 5 the option of using by products from the sugar and alcohol industry during the off season period has been underexplored as a technological option mainly due to the lack of operational data regarding biogas generation and the stability of the system with the temporary exchange of the organic source de barros and santana pointed out challenges in replacing vinasse with molasses associated with operational problems 6 7 thus further studies regarding the design and performance of the uasb reactor using molasses to feed the reactor during the off season should be carried out to verify the potentials for cod chemical oxygen demand removal and biogas production molasses is a valuable organic substrate for biogas production as it contains high concentrations of carbohydrate sulfate and mineral salts and low concentration of cysteine 8 it is an intermediate product of sugar production and is generated in large quantities approximately between 40 and 60 kg per ton of processed sugarcane it has a high content of organic matter in addition to nutrient minerals 9 the hypothesis for implementing the alternative of temporary replacement of vinasse entails maintaining methane generation and minimizing the reactor start up period it is understood that the start up of the system should be as fast as possible aiming to explore the potential of methane generation from vinasse and to mitigate the negative impact of this effluent in the environment the evaluation of the substrate exchange strategy needs to be associated with maintaining the efficiency of conversion to methane based on aspects related to the dynamics of the microorganisms participating in the process which are the core of the reactor thus this research aimed to evaluate the efficiency and stability of the uasb reactor in the treatment of vinasse and molasses the two main points studied were the restart of the uasb reactor after a starvation period phase i and resilience to the total and gradual change of substrate from vinasse to molasses phase ii and from molasses to vinasse phase iii 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus installation consisted of a pilot scale uasb reactor fig 1 a biogas measurement system and a diaphragm pump used to feed the system the reactor had a total volume of 120 l and a height of 4 m with 60 l 2 m for the reaction area which is occupied by the anaerobic sludge used to inoculate the system the external and internal diameters of the reactor were 20 and 19 5 cm and the three phase separator 10 and 9 5 cm respectively the uasb body had 18 taps for sample collection nine of which were located in the reaction area the system was fed continuously and subjected to an effluent recirculation rate of 1 2 the biogas volume produced was measured using a ritter drum type gas meter tg 0 5 gasometer and the pump used was a grundfos dda 30 4 ar model with a flow capacity of 30 ml h 1 to 30 l h 1 a manometric height of 70 mca and mechanism operating in pulses prior to this study the reactor was fed with sugarcane vinasse for 600 days after which it was left without feed for 5 weeks before the feeding interruption the uasb system was stabilized with an average raw cod removal efficiency of 87 5 5 3 methane and productivity yield of 8 059 l 1 day 1 and 0 299 0 066 l ch4 g 1 cod respectively data published in 4 2 2 wastewater the carbon sources used were vinasse and molasses residue and a by product from sugarcane processing respectively the vinasse collected at the rio pardo mill located in cerqueira césar sp underwent the water evaporation process in the industry a technique that gave the vinasse a cod of 187 g cod l 1 to feed the reactor the vinasse was diluted to values close to those found in ethanol production mills the adopted cod was 20 g cod l 1 and 27 g cod l 1 in the different phases of the experiment table 2 the molasses that was used came from the são martinho mill located in the city of pradópolis são paulo and presented a concentration of 83 g cod l 1 this was stored for the whole period of operation at 4 c the molasses was diluted to feed the reactor to maintain the cod close to 27 g cod l 1 table 2 using molasses as an alternative organic source to vinasse to be used during the period that would simulate the off season was due to its low added value high availability and its potential for biogas production 5 the characterization of vinasse and molasses after dilution with a concentration of approximately 20 g cod l 1 is shown in table 1 vinasse and molasses were diluted with supply water the liquid stream influent to the reactor was supplemented with sodium bicarbonate 0 3 0 7 g nahco3 kg 1 cod in all phases to withstand any accumulation of organic acids in the reactor without harming the system 2 3 experimental procedure the study was divided into three phases in phase i which is subdivided into i a and i b the reactor started up after a 5 week shutdown period using vinasse as substrate in phase ia the increase in the organic loading rate olr from 5 to 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 was due to the increase in the feed flow from 15 to 74 l day 1 and cod of approximately 20 g cod l 1 and in phase i b the feed volume was kept constant 74 l but the olr was increased by increasing the cod from 20 to 27 g cod l 1 table 2 the change in the olr increase methodology was due to the reservoirs available for storing the influent in the reactor phase ii subdivided into ii a and ii b comprised the period of changing the organic source from vinasse to molasses in phase ii a the substrate was changed gradually changing staggered aliquots of 10 vinasse per molasses every one or two days until reaching 100 molasses in phase ii b the stability of the system was tested with molasses as the only carbon source table 2 simulating the possibility of using this energy matrix in the off season period and when there was a shortage of vinasse phase iii aimed to stimulate the return of ethanol production from sugarcane mills and consequently of the need to resume vinasse treatment by the system thus the use of molasses was discontinued and vinasse became the only carbon source the strategy adopted to reduce the impact of abrupt substrate change was to restart vinasse feeding from a olr of 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 with a gradual increase up to 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 the temperature was kept close to 24 c throughout the experiment the increase in olr or substrate alteration during the operational period was associated with the maintenance of cod removal efficiency above 70 and volatile acid concentration by titration below 500 mg hac l 1 2 4 monitoring analytics system monitoring was performed by analysing the cod 10 ph alkalinity 11 and total volatile acids by titration 12 twice a week and by analysing the determination of organic acids by gas chromatography 13 and carbohydrates 14 once a week methane production was computed from the volumetric determination and percentage of methane in the biogas the volume of biogas was measured using the ritter drum type gas meter tg 0 5 gasometer and the percentage of methane in the biogas was estimated by gas chromatography 15 the shimadzu chromatograph was used model gc 2014 with a thermal conductivity detector and hp plot column 30 m 0 53 mm to determine methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 contents specific methanogenic activity sma for the sludge was determined using the oxitop system 16 the sma test was performed using aliquots of sludge removed from the reactor before interrupting the operation with vinasse after the period of interruption in feeding at the end of phase i at the end of phase ii and at the end of phase iii microbial characterization was performed on sludge samples collected from the reactor at the following moments 0 after 5 weeks without feeding i end of phase i ii end of phase ii iii final sample of phase 3 for this purpose dna extraction 17 and amplification with primers f 968 gc and r 1401 18 and 1100 fgc and 1400 r 19 for the bacteria and archaea domains were carried out respectively dgge denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis band patterns were analysed using bionumerics v 7 0 software adopting pearson s correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma to construct the dendrogram microbial diversity was analysed using the shannon diversity index h 3 results and discussion 3 1 system stability assessment the system stability was evaluated based on the generation and consumption of volatile acids and the alkalinity of the system it is noteworthy that the uasb reactor under study was subjected to a olr of 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 with a cod removal efficiency greater than 80 at the time of feeding interruption data presented by 4 the repartition phase i started with a olr of 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 and the olr increments were based on the maintenance of the cod removal efficiency above 70 and maintaining the ratio between intermediate alkalinity and partial alkalinity ia pa below 0 3 the ia pa remained stable in all the analysed phases of the system with values between 0 1 and 0 3 fig 2 these values indicated that there was balance between generation and buffering of total volatile acids in the system 11 and maintenance of the effluent ph which was established in the range of 7 17 to 8 72 in phase i a the period required to reach a olr of 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 was 125 days maintaining a cod removal efficiency above 70 and a volatile acid concentration below 500 mg hac l 1 fig 3 table 5 and ia pa ratio less than 0 3 the low acid concentration in phase i indicated the syntrophism between acidogenic bacteria acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea in the reactor 21 which was proven to have the best methane yield my data discussed in section 3 2 the higher concentration of acetic and propionic acids in phase ii table 3 even with maintaining the same olr as in phase i b 33 g cod l 1 day 1 indicated that the methanogenic community did not consume all the generated metabolites in the fermentative stage of anaerobic digestion a fact proven by the reduction in methane productivity data discussed in section 3 2 at the end of phase ii it was observed that the substrate exchange caused a reduction in methane production data discussed in section 3 2 a decrease in the efficiency of cod removal and an increase in volatile acids table 5 requiring a reduction in olr in phase iii the operation with vinasse in the 10 kg olr cod m 3 day 1 was started however the drop in methane production required the olr to be reduced to 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 aiming to maintain stability with a cod removal efficiency greater than 70 fig 4 regarding carbohydrates molasses had an average concentration of 25 300 mg l 1 phase ii b which is about 13 times higher than the average concentration of carbohydrates in vinasse 1937 mg l 1 however the conversion efficiency of carbohydrates throughout the operating period was greater than 90 the data indicate that the acid digestion step was not limited to the process under any of the conditions studied therefore the analysis allowed us to conclude that molasses was more easily acidified as the treatment system showed higher percentages of carbohydrate removal when fed with molasses in co digestion phase ii a or monodigestion phase ii b even molasses presenting a higher carbohydrate load compared to vinasse table 4 the high standard deviation presented in phase ii a 11 164 mg l 1 was related to the substrate exchange methodology the vinasse was gradually reduced in proportion to the applied increase in molasses table 2 3 2 cod removal methane production and yield the volumetric production of methane prior to the shutdown was 8 0 l ch4 l 1 day 1 data presented by 4 in phase i a the volumetric production of methane increased when the olr was increased reaching a value of up to 12 96 l ch4 l 1 day 1 fig 5 in phase i b in which the reactor was subjected to constant olr around 33 kg of cod m 3 day 1 the average methane production was 10 24 3 59 l ch4 l 1 day 1 fig 5 table 5 after reaching the olr of the 33 kg cod m3 day 1 the maintenance of the cod removal efficiency and a 7 5 reduction in the methane yield was observed table 5 jáuregui jáuregui et al 22 studied the bioreactor start up for the anaerobic treatment of tequila vinasse after six months without feed the reactor start up period was 28 days with a volumetric organic load that increased from 2 2 to 5 2 kg cod m 3 day 1 the cod removal efficiency achieved was greater than 90 in the present study whose objective in phase i was to achieve olr more than six times greater the required time period was consequently longer but with a similar percentage of cod removal 84 5 3 3 del nery et al 4 found equivalent cod removal in vinasse monodigestion 87 5 5 3 and methane productivity reached the highest value of 8 059 l ch4 l 1 day 1 to olr of 32 27 kg cod m 3 day 1 4 the results obtained in phase i in terms of methane yield table 5 were higher than those obtained by molina et al 23 and del nery et al 4 who also used a pilot scale uasb reactor in vinasse treatment the authors reported yields of 330 ml ch4 g 1 codr and of 299 0 066 ml ch4 g 1 codr respectively in the transition period from vinasse to molasses phase ii a there was a 40 decrease in methane production compared to the previous phase fig 5 table 5 suggesting the deviation of the electron flow to the synthesis of microorganisms adapted to the new substrate 5 21 the drop in methane production was even greater in phase ii b only with molasses with substrate accompanied by a reduction in the average cod removal efficiency to 79 6 6 3 fig 4 table 5 the deviation of the electron flow for synthesis may explain the maintenance of cod removal and reduction of volumetric methane production in phase ii a and ii b as observed by oliveira et al 21 and vilela et al 5 who also worked with sugarcane molasses oliveira et al 21 attributed the establishment of cod removal levels in two phases of the study 76 2 and 62 15 to the diversion of the electron flow for cell growth even when methane production ceased according to aquino fuess and pires higher biomass growth yield coefficient values should be predictable for systems used to treat complex wastewaters considering the enhanced growth of all microbial populations involved in the complete conversion of the organic matter in specific acidogenic bacteria 24 the authors pointed out that the biomass growth yield coefficient for acidogenic bacteria may reach 0 15 g vss g 1 cod so that the enhanced tva production at the phase ii table 3 observed herein suggests that the growth of these microbial populations was favored in phase iii in which the feeding was again exclusively vinasse a gradually increasing olr was applied from 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 reaching 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 in a period of 65 days the progressive increase in olr was slower than in phase i due to the system response which required a longer time between progressive load increases to stabilize the system the cod removal efficiency was 82 5 9 2 fig 4 table 5 but with a greater deviation from the mean in this phase the average methane yield was 0 17 l ch4 g 1 codr and the average volumetric methane production was 1 19 0 17 l ch4 l 1 day 1 table 5 for olr applied to the reactor between 5 and 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 below the generation potential the diversion of the flow for the synthesis of microorganisms and therefore reduction of methane production can be noticed mainly in the phase of resumption of vinasse after feeding with molasses possibly related to the reorganization of the syntrophic chain limiting the methane yield 25 methane yield from molasses of 0 3 0 35 l ch4 g 1 codr was observed by vilela et al 5 for olr between 1 0 and 2 3 kg cod m 3 day 1 in which cod removal was greater than 70 for olr between 2 3 and 4 6 kg cod m 3 day 1 the authors op cit observed low methane yield and high cod removal which was attributed to cell production yun et al 8 used a uasb reactor for processing molasses and observed that in smaller olr 3 6 to 5 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 there was an increase in methane yield with a maximum rate of 0 48 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a decrease with the addition of olr up to 9 7 kg cod m 3 day 1 cod removal reached 91 2 in the 5 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 olr based on the results it was estimated that after the feed was stopped the reactor reached a olr of 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 with methane production of 4 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a yield of 0 23 l ch4 g 1 cod in 30 days phase i a while the return of feeding with vinasse phase iii after the period submitted to molasses the same olr was obtained only after 65 days and the methane production was 1 14 l ch4 l 1 day 1 fig 5 and the methane yield 0 08 l ch4 g 1 cod in addition in phase i the system performance was restored after the shutdown reaching high olr 33 kg cod l 1 day 1 and methane production equivalent to 89 of the theoretical potential with a yield of 0 40 0 14 l ch4 g 1 codr and cod removal efficiency of 84 5 6 7 table 5 the strategies used maintained the cod removal efficiency and stability in the operational period however the methane production was negatively affected when exchanging the substrate from vinasse to molasses and vice versa 3 3 sma and microbiological analysis of reactor sludge in the study phases in order to interpret the deviation of the observed electron flow maintaining cod removal and a reduction in methane production with substrate exchange microbiological analyses were carried out at the end of the experimental phases the reactor sludge maintained sma when the system remained without food for 5 weeks despite a 24 reduction in sma 0 45 g cod g 1 stv day 1 returning to the previous level 0 57 g cod g 1 stv day 1 after resuming vinasse feeding phase i table 6 at the end of phase ii after adapting the sludge blanket to exchange vinasse for molasses sma increased 0 75 g cod g 1 stv day 1 and was the highest among all phases the sma result for the sludge in phase ii compared to phase i showed a 31 increase in the potential of the methanogenic activity associated with the presence of an active methanogenic group in the sludge but inhibited in the system vilela et al 5 pointed out that the energy potential of molasses exceeded that of vinasse by at least 25 indicating that the high availability of biodegradable organic matter in molasses requires a low olr to provide efficient bioenergy recovery the results of sma in phase iii point to a reduction in the methanogenic activity as already observed by the low methane production and yield the community structure of archaea the similarity coefficient was 94 95 after 5 weeks without feeding the reactor and at the end of phases i ii iii fig 6a indicating the maintenance of most archaea in the operational phases of the uasb reactor despite the changes of wastewater that is vinasse to molasses and then to vinasse again in phase i the diversity index 2 70 and the methane yield 10 24 3 59 l ch4 l 1 day 1 were higher compared to the other phases this indicates that acidogenics generated by products acetic propionic and butyric acid for acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens that converted to methane in phase ii considering the change from vinasse to molasses the diversity decreased 2 69 as well as the methane yield 3 10 2 72 l ch4 l 1 day 1 compared to phase i and probably the accumulation of methanol acetic and propionic and butyric acid was due to the lower activity of acetoclastic methanogenics especially the hydrogenotrophic ones with an increase in the partial pressure of hydrogen and an imbalance in the methanogenetic stage thus causing a drop in methane production in phase iii the diversity index 2 63 was lower compared to the other phases table 7 probably due to the decrease in olr from 33 kg cod l 1 day 1 to 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 contributing to decrease in the methane yield of 1 19 0 17 l ch4 l 1 day 1 a bacterial community structure and similarity coefficient were as follows between moments 0 i 75 i ii 58 ii iii 65 fig 6b indicating a change in the bacterial community with the change of wastewater from vinasse to molasses and then to vinasse again in phase i with vinasse feeding there was an increase in the diversity index from 2 71 to 3 01 as well as in the exchange for molasses phase ii which went from 3 01 to 3 29 table 7 indicating a possible increase in the groups of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria including greater removal of carbohydrates 98 in phase ii compared to the others in phase iii with the exchange for vinasse and reduction of the olr from 33 kg cod l 1 day 1 to 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 there was a decrease in the diversity index 2 72 of bacteria populations as well as the decrease in carbohydrate removal 93 changes in the structure of the bacterial community 75 58 were caused by the change of wastewater from vinasse to molasses even so the microbial community present in the reactor was efficient in removing cod 79 and in removing carbohydrates 98 regarding the structure of the archaea community there was less change according to the similarity coefficient while the diversity index decreased 2 70 2 69 and 2 63 throughout the operation of the phases i ii iii as well as in the methane yield 10 24 3 10 and 1 19 l ch4 l 1 day 1 4 conclusion the results led us to conclude that in uasb adapted to vinasse the shutdown followed by restart was more adequate compared to the replacement with molasses and subsequent return to the vinasse this restart enabled us to obtain methane production of 10 24 3 59 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a yield of 0 37 0 14 l ch4 g 1 codr similar to the period before shutdown 8 06 ch4 l 1 day 1 and 0 30 l ch4 g 1 codr although the time required to reach the olr of 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 was 125 days the reactor achieved an olr of 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 in 30 days producing 4 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and 0 23 l ch4 g 1 codr replacing molasses and the subsequent return to vinasse the reactor reached 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 in 65 days of operation with a methane production of 1 14 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a yield of 0 08 l ch4 g 1 codr changes in the structure of the bacterial community were caused by the change of wastewater from vinasse to molasses and vice versa however the microbial community present in the reactor was efficient in cod removal and carbohydrate removal regarding the structure of the archaea community there was less change according to the similarity coefficient while the diversity index decreased along the operation of the phases as well as in the methane yield funding this work was supported by cnpq conselho

was supplemented with sodium bicarbonate 0 3 0 7 g nahco3 kg 1 cod in all phases to withstand any accumulation of organic acids in the reactor without harming the system 2 3 experimental procedure the study was divided into three phases in phase i which is subdivided into i a and i b the reactor started up after a 5 week shutdown period using vinasse as substrate in phase ia the increase in the organic loading rate olr from 5 to 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 was due to the increase in the feed flow from 15 to 74 l day 1 and cod of approximately 20 g cod l 1 and in phase i b the feed volume was kept constant 74 l but the olr was increased by increasing the cod from 20 to 27 g cod l 1 table 2 the change in the olr increase methodology was due to the reservoirs available for storing the influent in the reactor phase ii subdivided into ii a and ii b comprised the period of changing the organic source from vinasse to molasses in phase ii a the substrate was changed gradually changing staggered aliquots of 10 vinasse per molasses every one or two days until reaching 100 molasses in phase ii b the stability of the system was tested with molasses as the only carbon source table 2 simulating the possibility of using this energy matrix in the off season period and when there was a shortage of vinasse phase iii aimed to stimulate the return of ethanol production from sugarcane mills and consequently of the need to resume vinasse treatment by the system thus the use of molasses was discontinued and vinasse became the only carbon source the strategy adopted to reduce the impact of abrupt substrate change was to restart vinasse feeding from a olr of 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 with a gradual increase up to 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 the temperature was kept close to 24 c throughout the experiment the increase in olr or substrate alteration during the operational period was associated with the maintenance of cod removal efficiency above 70 and volatile acid concentration by titration below 500 mg hac l 1 2 4 monitoring analytics system monitoring was performed by analysing the cod 10 ph alkalinity 11 and total volatile acids by titration 12 twice a week and by analysing the determination of organic acids by gas chromatography 13 and carbohydrates 14 once a week methane production was computed from the volumetric determination and percentage of methane in the biogas the volume of biogas was measured using the ritter drum type gas meter tg 0 5 gasometer and the percentage of methane in the biogas was estimated by gas chromatography 15 the shimadzu chromatograph was used model gc 2014 with a thermal conductivity detector and hp plot column 30 m 0 53 mm to determine methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 contents specific methanogenic activity sma for the sludge was determined using the oxitop system 16 the sma test was performed using aliquots of sludge removed from the reactor before interrupting the operation with vinasse after the period of interruption in feeding at the end of phase i at the end of phase ii and at the end of phase iii microbial characterization was performed on sludge samples collected from the reactor at the following moments 0 after 5 weeks without feeding i end of phase i ii end of phase ii iii final sample of phase 3 for this purpose dna extraction 17 and amplification with primers f 968 gc and r 1401 18 and 1100 fgc and 1400 r 19 for the bacteria and archaea domains were carried out respectively dgge denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis band patterns were analysed using bionumerics v 7 0 software adopting pearson s correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma to construct the dendrogram microbial diversity was analysed using the shannon diversity index h 3 results and discussion 3 1 system stability assessment the system stability was evaluated based on the generation and consumption of volatile acids and the alkalinity of the system it is noteworthy that the uasb reactor under study was subjected to a olr of 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 with a cod removal efficiency greater than 80 at the time of feeding interruption data presented by 4 the repartition phase i started with a olr of 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 and the olr increments were based on the maintenance of the cod removal efficiency above 70 and maintaining the ratio between intermediate alkalinity and partial alkalinity ia pa below 0 3 the ia pa remained stable in all the analysed phases of the system with values between 0 1 and 0 3 fig 2 these values indicated that there was balance between generation and buffering of total volatile acids in the system 11 and maintenance of the effluent ph which was established in the range of 7 17 to 8 72 in phase i a the period required to reach a olr of 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 was 125 days maintaining a cod removal efficiency above 70 and a volatile acid concentration below 500 mg hac l 1 fig 3 table 5 and ia pa ratio less than 0 3 the low acid concentration in phase i indicated the syntrophism between acidogenic bacteria acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea in the reactor 21 which was proven to have the best methane yield my data discussed in section 3 2 the higher concentration of acetic and propionic acids in phase ii table 3 even with maintaining the same olr as in phase i b 33 g cod l 1 day 1 indicated that the methanogenic community did not consume all the generated metabolites in the fermentative stage of anaerobic digestion a fact proven by the reduction in methane productivity data discussed in section 3 2 at the end of phase ii it was observed that the substrate exchange caused a reduction in methane production data discussed in section 3 2 a decrease in the efficiency of cod removal and an increase in volatile acids table 5 requiring a reduction in olr in phase iii the operation with vinasse in the 10 kg olr cod m 3 day 1 was started however the drop in methane production required the olr to be reduced to 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 aiming to maintain stability with a cod removal efficiency greater than 70 fig 4 regarding carbohydrates molasses had an average concentration of 25 300 mg l 1 phase ii b which is about 13 times higher than the average concentration of carbohydrates in vinasse 1937 mg l 1 however the conversion efficiency of carbohydrates throughout the operating period was greater than 90 the data indicate that the acid digestion step was not limited to the process under any of the conditions studied therefore the analysis allowed us to conclude that molasses was more easily acidified as the treatment system showed higher percentages of carbohydrate removal when fed with molasses in co digestion phase ii a or monodigestion phase ii b even molasses presenting a higher carbohydrate load compared to vinasse table 4 the high standard deviation presented in phase ii a 11 164 mg l 1 was related to the substrate exchange methodology the vinasse was gradually reduced in proportion to the applied increase in molasses table 2 3 2 cod removal methane production and yield the volumetric production of methane prior to the shutdown was 8 0 l ch4 l 1 day 1 data presented by 4 in phase i a the volumetric production of methane increased when the olr was increased reaching a value of up to 12 96 l ch4 l 1 day 1 fig 5 in phase i b in which the reactor was subjected to constant olr around 33 kg of cod m 3 day 1 the average methane production was 10 24 3 59 l ch4 l 1 day 1 fig 5 table 5 after reaching the olr of the 33 kg cod m3 day 1 the maintenance of the cod removal efficiency and a 7 5 reduction in the methane yield was observed table 5 jáuregui jáuregui et al 22 studied the bioreactor start up for the anaerobic treatment of tequila vinasse after six months without feed the reactor start up period was 28 days with a volumetric organic load that increased from 2 2 to 5 2 kg cod m 3 day 1 the cod removal efficiency achieved was greater than 90 in the present study whose objective in phase i was to achieve olr more than six times greater the required time period was consequently longer but with a similar percentage of cod removal 84 5 3 3 del nery et al 4 found equivalent cod removal in vinasse monodigestion 87 5 5 3 and methane productivity reached the highest value of 8 059 l ch4 l 1 day 1 to olr of 32 27 kg cod m 3 day 1 4 the results obtained in phase i in terms of methane yield table 5 were higher than those obtained by molina et al 23 and del nery et al 4 who also used a pilot scale uasb reactor in vinasse treatment the authors reported yields of 330 ml ch4 g 1 codr and of 299 0 066 ml ch4 g 1 codr respectively in the transition period from vinasse to molasses phase ii a there was a 40 decrease in methane production compared to the previous phase fig 5 table 5 suggesting the deviation of the electron flow to the synthesis of microorganisms adapted to the new substrate 5 21 the drop in methane production was even greater in phase ii b only with molasses with substrate accompanied by a reduction in the average cod removal efficiency to 79 6 6 3 fig 4 table 5 the deviation of the electron flow for synthesis may explain the maintenance of cod removal and reduction of volumetric methane production in phase ii a and ii b as observed by oliveira et al 21 and vilela et al 5 who also worked with sugarcane molasses oliveira et al 21 attributed the establishment of cod removal levels in two phases of the study 76 2 and 62 15 to the diversion of the electron flow for cell growth even when methane production ceased according to aquino fuess and pires higher biomass growth yield coefficient values should be predictable for systems used to treat complex wastewaters considering the enhanced growth of all microbial populations involved in the complete conversion of the organic matter in specific acidogenic bacteria 24 the authors pointed out that the biomass growth yield coefficient for acidogenic bacteria may reach 0 15 g vss g 1 cod so that the enhanced tva production at the phase ii table 3 observed herein suggests that the growth of these microbial populations was favored in phase iii in which the feeding was again exclusively vinasse a gradually increasing olr was applied from 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 reaching 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 in a period of 65 days the progressive increase in olr was slower than in phase i due to the system response which required a longer time between progressive load increases to stabilize the system the cod removal efficiency was 82 5 9 2 fig 4 table 5 but with a greater deviation from the mean in this phase the average methane yield was 0 17 l ch4 g 1 codr and the average volumetric methane production was 1 19 0 17 l ch4 l 1 day 1 table 5 for olr applied to the reactor between 5 and 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 below the generation potential the diversion of the flow for the synthesis of microorganisms and therefore reduction of methane production can be noticed mainly in the phase of resumption of vinasse after feeding with molasses possibly related to the reorganization of the syntrophic chain limiting the methane yield 25 methane yield from molasses of 0 3 0 35 l ch4 g 1 codr was observed by vilela et al 5 for olr between 1 0 and 2 3 kg cod m 3 day 1 in which cod removal was greater than 70 for olr between 2 3 and 4 6 kg cod m 3 day 1 the authors op cit observed low methane yield and high cod removal which was attributed to cell production yun et al 8 used a uasb reactor for processing molasses and observed that in smaller olr 3 6 to 5 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 there was an increase in methane yield with a maximum rate of 0 48 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a decrease with the addition of olr up to 9 7 kg cod m 3 day 1 cod removal reached 91 2 in the 5 5 kg cod m 3 day 1 olr based on the results it was estimated that after the feed was stopped the reactor reached a olr of 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 with methane production of 4 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a yield of 0 23 l ch4 g 1 cod in 30 days phase i a while the return of feeding with vinasse phase iii after the period submitted to molasses the same olr was obtained only after 65 days and the methane production was 1 14 l ch4 l 1 day 1 fig 5 and the methane yield 0 08 l ch4 g 1 cod in addition in phase i the system performance was restored after the shutdown reaching high olr 33 kg cod l 1 day 1 and methane production equivalent to 89 of the theoretical potential with a yield of 0 40 0 14 l ch4 g 1 codr and cod removal efficiency of 84 5 6 7 table 5 the strategies used maintained the cod removal efficiency and stability in the operational period however the methane production was negatively affected when exchanging the substrate from vinasse to molasses and vice versa 3 3 sma and microbiological analysis of reactor sludge in the study phases in order to interpret the deviation of the observed electron flow maintaining cod removal and a reduction in methane production with substrate exchange microbiological analyses were carried out at the end of the experimental phases the reactor sludge maintained sma when the system remained without food for 5 weeks despite a 24 reduction in sma 0 45 g cod g 1 stv day 1 returning to the previous level 0 57 g cod g 1 stv day 1 after resuming vinasse feeding phase i table 6 at the end of phase ii after adapting the sludge blanket to exchange vinasse for molasses sma increased 0 75 g cod g 1 stv day 1 and was the highest among all phases the sma result for the sludge in phase ii compared to phase i showed a 31 increase in the potential of the methanogenic activity associated with the presence of an active methanogenic group in the sludge but inhibited in the system vilela et al 5 pointed out that the energy potential of molasses exceeded that of vinasse by at least 25 indicating that the high availability of biodegradable organic matter in molasses requires a low olr to provide efficient bioenergy recovery the results of sma in phase iii point to a reduction in the methanogenic activity as already observed by the low methane production and yield the community structure of archaea the similarity coefficient was 94 95 after 5 weeks without feeding the reactor and at the end of phases i ii iii fig 6a indicating the maintenance of most archaea in the operational phases of the uasb reactor despite the changes of wastewater that is vinasse to molasses and then to vinasse again in phase i the diversity index 2 70 and the methane yield 10 24 3 59 l ch4 l 1 day 1 were higher compared to the other phases this indicates that acidogenics generated by products acetic propionic and butyric acid for acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens that converted to methane in phase ii considering the change from vinasse to molasses the diversity decreased 2 69 as well as the methane yield 3 10 2 72 l ch4 l 1 day 1 compared to phase i and probably the accumulation of methanol acetic and propionic and butyric acid was due to the lower activity of acetoclastic methanogenics especially the hydrogenotrophic ones with an increase in the partial pressure of hydrogen and an imbalance in the methanogenetic stage thus causing a drop in methane production in phase iii the diversity index 2 63 was lower compared to the other phases table 7 probably due to the decrease in olr from 33 kg cod l 1 day 1 to 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 contributing to decrease in the methane yield of 1 19 0 17 l ch4 l 1 day 1 a bacterial community structure and similarity coefficient were as follows between moments 0 i 75 i ii 58 ii iii 65 fig 6b indicating a change in the bacterial community with the change of wastewater from vinasse to molasses and then to vinasse again in phase i with vinasse feeding there was an increase in the diversity index from 2 71 to 3 01 as well as in the exchange for molasses phase ii which went from 3 01 to 3 29 table 7 indicating a possible increase in the groups of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria including greater removal of carbohydrates 98 in phase ii compared to the others in phase iii with the exchange for vinasse and reduction of the olr from 33 kg cod l 1 day 1 to 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 there was a decrease in the diversity index 2 72 of bacteria populations as well as the decrease in carbohydrate removal 93 changes in the structure of the bacterial community 75 58 were caused by the change of wastewater from vinasse to molasses even so the microbial community present in the reactor was efficient in removing cod 79 and in removing carbohydrates 98 regarding the structure of the archaea community there was less change according to the similarity coefficient while the diversity index decreased 2 70 2 69 and 2 63 throughout the operation of the phases i ii iii as well as in the methane yield 10 24 3 10 and 1 19 l ch4 l 1 day 1 4 conclusion the results led us to conclude that in uasb adapted to vinasse the shutdown followed by restart was more adequate compared to the replacement with molasses and subsequent return to the vinasse this restart enabled us to obtain methane production of 10 24 3 59 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a yield of 0 37 0 14 l ch4 g 1 codr similar to the period before shutdown 8 06 ch4 l 1 day 1 and 0 30 l ch4 g 1 codr although the time required to reach the olr of 33 kg cod m 3 day 1 was 125 days the reactor achieved an olr of 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 in 30 days producing 4 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and 0 23 l ch4 g 1 codr replacing molasses and the subsequent return to vinasse the reactor reached 19 kg cod m 3 day 1 in 65 days of operation with a methane production of 1 14 l ch4 l 1 day 1 and a yield of 0 08 l ch4 g 1 codr changes in the structure of the bacterial community were caused by the change of wastewater from vinasse to molasses and vice versa however the microbial community present in the reactor was efficient in cod removal and carbohydrate removal regarding the structure of the archaea community there was less change according to the similarity coefficient while the diversity index decreased along the operation of the phases as well as in the methane yield funding this work was supported by cnpq conselho

12996,we developed two dimensional 2d molybdenum disulfide mos2 layers incorporated polyurethane pu sponges and demonstrated their proficiency in various environmental applications 2d mos2 pu sponges with precisely tailored porosity were fabricated by combining three dimensional 3d printing techniques and drop casting of dispersed 2d mos2 layers the sponges exhibited excellent photothermal properties i e rapid temperature increase under irradiation of photons due to the high optical absorption property of the 2d mos2 layers coupled with their intrinsic hydrophobicity such superior solar to thermal energy conversion was employed to demonstrate crude oil recovery and seawater desalination applications it was observed that the sponges exhibited remarkably faster speeds in recovering crude oils where the sponges with 2d mos2 layers resulted in complete recovery within 20 s under solar illumination vs negligible recovery for the sponges without 2d mos2 layers even up to 20 min the sponges with 2d mos2 layers also exhibited significantly higher evaporation rate e g 3 5 kg m 2 h 1 in desalinating seawater with approximately 1 8 and 3 3 times higher evaporation rates for the sponges compared to those without 2d mos2 layers and control no sponge respectively this study provides a new pathway for the application of 2d mos2 layer based hierarchically structured porous materials in versatile and broad domains of environmental technologies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords 2d mos2 crude oil spill desalination hydrophobicity photothermal sponge abbreviations polydimethylsiloxane pdms polyurethane pu molybdenum disulfide mos2 polyvinyl alcohol pva navy standard bilge mix nsbm water contact angle wca 1 introduction recent years have witnessed severe impacts on marine environments due to petroleum oil spills and chemical leaks 1 5 the release of these substances into coastal environments and oceanic ecosystems has posed a major threat to wildlife habitats and contamination of critical resources in the food chain 1 2 6 7 strategic initiatives to develop sustainable and environmentally benign solutions to this challenge remain a top priority conventional approaches such as skimming 8 ultrasonic methods 9 in situ combustion 10 and chemical dispersants 11 12 are energy and resource demanding and often cause toxic by products 3 in that regard attention has been primarily drawn upon developing oil sorbent materials and their implementation which can operate by simple and low cost principles 3 7 13 16 to this date a variety of materials have been explored including cellulose aerogels 17 polydimethylsiloxane pdms 7 functional melamine foams sponges 3 6 and polyurethane pu foams 13 14 they all share features of high structural porosity and mechanical robustness accompanying intrinsic hydrophobicity thus enabling efficient oil water separation and low process costs incorporating additional functional materials into sorbent materials has also been pursued to improve their performances for instance two dimensional 2d materials such as 2d molybdenum disulfide mos2 layers have been combined with porous polymers to improve proficiencies in the detection and recovery of spilled oil as demonstrated in our previous work 7 however most of the currently available sorbent materials are ill suited for absorbing and recovering crude oils of high viscosity 3 18 the low diffusion dynamics and poor fluidity inherent to crude oils often require additional energy sources e g electric or thermal to be applied to the sorbent materials for their dissociation and separation for example the joule heating remediation of crude oils utilizing 2d materials such as graphene has been explored and demonstrated by employing non renewable electrical energy 19 however such approaches relying on non renewable energy sources generally increase process costs and cause environmental vulnerability recently alternative approaches for the recovery of crude oils only utilizing renewable energy sources particularly solar energy have been explored 3 6 18 20 the successful implementation of these approaches is determined by the photothermal conversion efficiency of sorbent materials i e the materials should be efficiently heated upon sunlight illumination and this thermal energy translated to the crude oils should increase their fluidity thus leading to their improved mobility and collection furthermore owing to the environmentally benign nature of these approaches coupled with their accelerated oil separation rates they can be employed for the direct desalination of contaminated seawater 3 6 15 18 20 25 for example the solar energy driven self heating characteristics of hydrophobic oleophilic polymeric sponges have been demonstrated to reduce the viscosity of crude oils 18 21 but their application to seawater desalination has remained unexplored encouraged by these challenges we propose a new strategy to judiciously incorporate the photothermal properties of 2d mos2 layers into the hydrophobic oleophilic nature of pu sponges with precisely tailored porosity 2d mos2 layers present bandgap energies matching the visible spectrum range rendering excellent optoelectronic and photothermal properties 4 5 26 33 particularly they exhibit broad and high optical absorption with spectral tunability ideally suitable for sunlight harvesting applications 30 31 34 while the feasibility of 2d mos2 layers incorporated sponges for water evaporation has been previously suggested 24 35 36 several technical issues need to be resolved toward their practical utilization 1 conventional fabrications have relied on the uncontrolled and manual manipulation of polymeric templates yielding large sample to sample variations 2 comprehensive environmental applications for synchronizing crude oil recovery and seawater desalination only by utilizing the natural sunlight have remained unaddressed in this endeavor we employed a 3d printing technology in creating pu sponges with well tailored high porosity which enabled the precise control of the loading amount of the 2d mos2 layers the optimized 2d mos2 pu sponges exhibited excellent photothermal properties i e temperature increase up to 70 c in 10 mins under both the natural sunlight and the low intensity 0 79 sun 790 w m 2 solar illumination the solar illumination enabled drastic enhancement in the in situ absorption recovery of highly viscous crude oils was verified lastly this strategy was applied for solar energy driven water purification i e efficient desalination of crude oil contaminated seawater 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication of 3d printed 2d mos2 pu sponges a 3d printer original prusa i3 mk3s kit was used to fabricate patterned polyvinyl alcohol pva scaffolds with variable infill ratios a mixture of clearflex 50 pu and 2d mos2 powder cas no 1317 33 5 super fine grade 99 climax molybdenum was used for the drop casting method the prepared mixture clearflex 50 pu with 10 wt of 2d mos2 layers was then poured into the pva scaffold followed by vacuuming for 5 10 min to remove air residuals inside the structure afterward the pva scaffold with the 2d mos2 pu solution was left to cure at room temperature for 48 h the dried 2d mos2 pu pva was then immersed in deionized di water under ultrasonication 40 khz at 70 c for 2 h subsequently it was subject to constant magnetic stirring for 20 h which led to the complete removal of the pva scaffold following this step the remaining 2d mos2 pu sponge was dried in the air at room temperature for 24 h 2 2 crude oil absorption and separation from a crude oil water mixture all the tested oils were obtained from the naval surface warfare center carderock division west bethesda md usa and the united states naval research laboratory washington dc usa the prepared 2d mos2 pu sponge was connected to a peristaltic liquid pump 12 v dc dosing pump gikfun china by a teflon tube and was placed in a glass beaker filled with di water 200 ml and oil 50 ml respectively the pump was operated at a rate of 57 ml min 1 0 95 ml s 1 during the entire pumping process of 10 60 min all of the indoor tests were performed at a temperature of 22 24 c and a humidity of 30 45 the mass of the collected crude oil was measured using a digital balance

defined porosity in fibril scaffolds 37 fig 1 a illustrates the step by step procedure for the 3d printing of a 2d mos2 pu sponge water soluble pva was used as the scaffold material which was prepared in a 2 2 2 cm3 dimension following the 3d printing to fabricate the porosity of controlled density fig 1 a left a pre prepared dispersion of 2d mos2 layers pu was directly integrated into the porous pva scaffold by a drop casting method fig 1 a mid the 2d mos2 layers pu incorporated pva was allowed to be cured at room temperature for 48 h and was subsequently rinsed with di water as a result only the pva was dissolved leading to a formation of a 2d mos2 pu sponge where the porosity of the pva scaffold was templated fig 1 a right the 2d mos2 layers pu dispersion was composed of clearflex 50 pu mixed with 2d mos2 layers of 10 wt which was identified to be the optimum concentration for photothermal performances specific details regarding the fabrication process are presented in the materials and methods section fig 1 b shows images of a 3d printed pva scaffold with left and a pva frame without right porosity fig 1 c compares images of another pva scaffold before left and after right curing the dispersion of 2d mos2 layers pu incorporated into it fig 1 d presents images of three different pva scaffolds with controlled porosity left column and their corresponding optical microscopy images right column the porosity was controlled by adjusting the infill ratio in the 3d printing setting and the optical microscopy images present enlarged views of the porosity achieved with 40 60 and 80 all the photothermal property data presented in the next section were obtained from the samples with a 60 infill ratio photothermal properties of the 2d mos2 pu sponges were characterized and their application for solar energy driven water evaporation was demonstrated fig 2 a shows images of pu sponges with left and without right 2d mos2 layers used for the photothermal property characterization fig 2 b presents infrared ir camera images of the samples exposed under the natural sunlight outdoor temperature 30 c for 15 min the 2d mos2 layers incorporated sponge exhibited a drastic temperature increase up to 73 5 c left while the sample without 2d mos2 layers reached only 39 3 c right the samples were then further tested with a low intensity solar simulator i e 0 79 sun 790 w m 2 inside a laboratory fig 2 c shows the uv vis absorption spectra of mos2 pu and pu sponges using a spectrophotometer the average absorbance of mos2 pu and pu sponges were 93 26 and 73 79 respectively clearly showing that mos2 dramatically improves light absorption fig 2 d shows a plot of time dependent temperature change in the 2d mos2 pu sample suggesting a similar behavior to the observation with the outdoor test the influence of sample parameters i e the concentration of 2d mos2 layers and infill ratio of pu on resulting photothermal performances were evaluated supplementary information fig s1 a b optimum process conditions were identified to be 60 pu infill and 10 wt for 2d mos2 layers while highly reliable temperature dependency was observed at each set of conditions next the excellent photothermal properties of the 2d mos2 pu sponges were utilized for the solar energy driven desalination of synthetic seawater tested in both indoor and outdoor manners for the indoor test an identical volume 100 ml of di water was integrated onto the surfaces of two different samples 1 thin slab of 2d mos2 pu sponge thickness 1 mm area top 2 2 cm2 2 bare petri dish without any structures the di water integrated samples were exposed to the illumination of a solar simulator with identical conditions i e constant illumination intensity 790 w m 2 and constant illumination distance 1 cm fig 2 e presents the evaporation rates of di water for the samples manifested by its mass loss in the 2d mos2 pu sponge slab water vapor was observed on the surface in 5 min illumination and complete evaporation of the di water occurred in 40 min meanwhile the control sample did not exhibit a noticeable signature of di water evaporation within the same tested timeframe for the outdoor test we developed a compact and portable greenhouse setup 15 length 15 height 20 width cm3 for a simulated solar energy driven water desalination 35 38 as presented in fig 2 f seawater with an initial volume of 50 ml was integrated onto the three different samples located inside the chamber i e pu sponges with without 2d mos2 layers and a petri dish without the sponges the samples were subsequently exposed to the natural sunlight for a prolonged period and the evaporation rate of the seawater was simultaneously measured fig 2 g and h shows that the 2d mos2 pu sample exhibits the fastest evaporation rate i e 3 55 kg m 2 h 1 which is 1 8 and 3 3 times higher than the sample without 2d mos2 layers 1 97 kg m 2 h 1 and the control petri dish 1 08 kg m 2 h 1 respectively the solar

12996,we developed two dimensional 2d molybdenum disulfide mos2 layers incorporated polyurethane pu sponges and demonstrated their proficiency in various environmental applications 2d mos2 pu sponges with precisely tailored porosity were fabricated by combining three dimensional 3d printing techniques and drop casting of dispersed 2d mos2 layers the sponges exhibited excellent photothermal properties i e rapid temperature increase under irradiation of photons due to the high optical absorption property of the 2d mos2 layers coupled with their intrinsic hydrophobicity such superior solar to thermal energy conversion was employed to demonstrate crude oil recovery and seawater desalination applications it was observed that the sponges exhibited remarkably faster speeds in recovering crude oils where the sponges with 2d mos2 layers resulted in complete recovery within 20 s under solar illumination vs negligible recovery for the sponges without 2d mos2 layers even up to 20 min the sponges with 2d mos2 layers also exhibited significantly higher evaporation rate e g 3 5 kg m 2 h 1 in desalinating seawater with approximately 1 8 and 3 3 times higher evaporation rates for the sponges compared to those without 2d mos2 layers and control no sponge respectively this study provides a new pathway for the application of 2d mos2 layer based hierarchically structured porous

abbreviations polydimethylsiloxane pdms polyurethane pu molybdenum disulfide mos2 polyvinyl alcohol pva navy standard bilge mix nsbm water contact angle wca 1 introduction recent years have witnessed severe impacts on marine environments due to petroleum oil spills and chemical leaks 1 5 the release of these substances into coastal environments and oceanic ecosystems has posed a major threat to wildlife habitats and contamination of critical resources in the food chain 1 2 6 7 strategic initiatives to develop sustainable and environmentally benign solutions to this challenge remain a top priority conventional approaches such as skimming 8 ultrasonic methods 9 in situ combustion 10 and chemical dispersants 11 12 are energy and resource demanding and often cause toxic by products 3 in that regard attention has been primarily drawn upon developing oil sorbent materials and their implementation which can operate by simple and low cost principles 3 7 13 16 to this date a variety of materials have been explored including cellulose aerogels 17 polydimethylsiloxane pdms 7 functional melamine foams sponges 3 6 and polyurethane pu foams 13 14 they all share features of high structural porosity and mechanical robustness accompanying intrinsic hydrophobicity thus enabling efficient oil water separation and low process costs incorporating additional functional materials into sorbent materials has also been pursued to improve their performances for instance two dimensional 2d materials such as 2d molybdenum disulfide mos2 layers have been combined with porous polymers to improve proficiencies in the detection and recovery of spilled oil as demonstrated in our previous work 7 however most of the currently available sorbent materials are ill suited for absorbing and recovering crude oils of high viscosity 3 18 the low diffusion dynamics and poor fluidity inherent to crude oils often require additional energy sources e g electric or thermal to be applied to the sorbent materials for their dissociation and separation for example the joule heating remediation of crude oils utilizing 2d materials such as graphene has been explored and demonstrated by employing non renewable electrical energy 19 however such approaches relying on non renewable energy sources generally increase process costs and cause environmental vulnerability recently alternative approaches for the recovery of crude oils only utilizing renewable energy sources particularly solar energy have been explored 3 6 18 20 the successful implementation of these approaches is determined by the photothermal conversion efficiency of sorbent materials i e the materials should be efficiently heated upon sunlight illumination and this thermal energy translated to the crude oils should increase their fluidity thus leading to their improved mobility and collection furthermore owing to the environmentally benign nature of these approaches coupled with their accelerated oil separation rates they can be employed for the direct desalination of contaminated seawater 3 6 15 18 20 25 for example the solar energy driven self heating characteristics of hydrophobic oleophilic polymeric sponges have been demonstrated to reduce the viscosity of crude oils 18 21 but their application to seawater desalination has remained unexplored encouraged by these challenges we propose a new strategy to judiciously incorporate the photothermal properties of 2d mos2 layers into the hydrophobic oleophilic nature of pu sponges with precisely tailored porosity 2d mos2 layers present bandgap energies matching the visible spectrum range rendering excellent optoelectronic and photothermal properties 4 5 26 33 particularly they exhibit broad and high optical absorption with spectral tunability ideally suitable for sunlight harvesting applications 30 31 34 while the feasibility of 2d mos2 layers incorporated sponges for water evaporation has been previously suggested 24 35 36 several technical issues need to be resolved toward their practical utilization 1 conventional fabrications have relied on the uncontrolled and manual manipulation of polymeric templates yielding large sample to sample variations 2 comprehensive environmental applications for synchronizing crude oil recovery and seawater desalination only by utilizing the natural sunlight have remained unaddressed in this endeavor we employed a 3d printing technology in creating pu sponges with well tailored high porosity which enabled the precise control of the loading amount of the 2d mos2 layers the optimized 2d mos2 pu sponges exhibited excellent photothermal properties i e temperature increase up to 70 c in 10 mins under both the natural sunlight and the low intensity 0 79 sun 790 w m 2

aqueous solutions containing caramel class iv caramel class iii and acid orange 7 were comparatively treated by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes including electro oxidation eo electro fenton ef and electro oxidation combined with electro fenton eo ef the experiments were performed in a stirred flask reactor using an inflator pump coupled with an undivided cell with bdd and ti pt

inorganic matters in effluents from food industry 3 4 it was necessary to find a cost effective degradation technique which could decolorize dark brown color 5 and allowed the reuse these valuable matters for food production like the cultivation of edible photosynthetic microalgae various methods have been applied to treat effluent containing caramel like food colorant including physicochemical treatment and biological treatment for example an adsorption with activated carbon has been utilized for melanoidin decolorization 6 and an effective discoloration of caramel from sugar cane juice was obtained through ultrafiltration coupled with ion exchange decolorization process 7 in the study of santal et al 8 melanoidin food colorant could be biodecolorized by aerobic bacterial strain sag5 although physicochemical methods could achieve fast discoloration they often generated large volumes of sludge 9 and required regular maintenance of absorbent or membrane 10 11 moreover some recalcitrant food colorants like caramel were biorefractory and difficult to be degraded by non destructive methods 12 existed in food processing including physicochemical treatment electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops used oxidant factors to destroy organic matter effectively electrochemical oxidation eo was a simple and widespread eaop due to the fact that it always had a high removal efficiency using a simple apparatus under a mild condition 13 in the eo process electrons were generated or consumed without any chemical side products which often occurred in other treatments 14 eo process has been applied to decolorize molasses and melanoidins from sugar industries 15 it was used to decolorize azo dye such as methyl orange using ti4o7 anode 16 electro fenton ef process was also a key eaop and referred to electrochemical process based on fenton reaction chemistry which degraded organics using different reaction other than the one used in eo process 17 fenton reaction was mainly composed of fenton reagent which consisted of fe2 and h2o2 fenton reagent proceeded a reaction that yields oh a sort of strong oxidant that destroyed nearly all organic matters non selectively and produced fe3 according to reaction 1 18 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh as h2o2 and fe2 were continuously consumed by fenton reaction they were often externally supplemented considering the high demand and hazardous characteristic of chemical reagent such as h2o2 an evolution of fenton reaction combined with electrochemical process so called electro fenton process was required this process had many advantages including its environmental compatibility amenability of automation high efficiency of energy consumption versatility and safe operation under temperate conditions 19 the ef process have been used to remove effectively the colorant in molasses and melanoidins 20 the capability of generating physically or chemically absorbed oh occurring in parallel with the oxygen evolution and the characteristics of anode material affected direct oxidation the electrode was a vital parameter when improving the effectiveness of electrolyte as the mechanism and the products of anodic reactions were known to critically depend on the anode material 21 the bdd electrode was found to be appropriate for electrochemical applications owing to its high activity towards oh production and other characteristics including chemical inertness high hardness wide electrochemical window and electrochemical stability 22 the eo process with the bdd anode could accelerate the decolorization rate colored effluents such as the application of melanoidins decolorization by eo process with bdd anode 21 and food azo color ponceau 4r degradation by eo bdd treatment 13 the colorants such as orange ii and malachite green attained effective decolorization by ef process using bdd anode and faster performance was obtained compared to ef process with pt anode 23 24 the work of bedolla guzman s team showed that eo combined with ef eo ef process with bdd performed better degradation than eo process with bdd 25 2 bdd h 2 o bdd oh h e 3 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 eo coupled to ef process for dye effluent treatment have been reported previously however most of these coupling processes carried out one after another i e as pre treatment to post treatment 26 few studies have shown the simultaneous application of eo and ef in a synergic electrochemical system 26 27 and the bdd had much greater oxygen evolution overpotential than other conventional anodes 28 29 therefore as a non active anode bdd could yield physisorbed bdd oh a variety of strong oxidant at the bdd anodic surface through reaction 2 13 19 for eo process as cathode the bdd cathode continuously fed h2o2 into contaminated acidic solutions by the bi electron reduction of o2 in pressed air from reaction 3 12 for ef process this study aimed to investigate the removal of caramel colorants contained by liquid food biomass effluents using the eo ef with bdd electrodes for the futurereuse to reach this goal we applied eo ef and eo combined with ef methods to degrade colorants in this paper we compared different decolorization methods for caramel or ao7 using bdd electrodes or ti pt electrodes independent parameters of air flow rate for oxygen supply concentration of fe2 added and applied current intensity on degradations were evaluated to clarify their effects on decolorization yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the caramel class iv and caramel class iii were supplied by amano foods applied acid orange 7 was issued from tokyo chemical industry feso4 7h2o used as catalyst as well as anhydrous na2so4 utilized as background supporting electrolyte they were guaranteed grade and analytical grade reagent respectively from wako pure chemical industries solutions were prepared with ultrapure water from direct q 3uv system and their ph value were adjusted to 3 0 17 30 with analytical grade h2so4 purchased from wako pure chemical industries the caramel colorants showed dark color in solutions with a specific absorption wavelength of 610 nm 34 in the application of caramel colorants by food industry the yellow index was applied to analyze their quality in regard to caramel colorants the yellow index was measured at 470 480 nm 31 2 2 apparatus and experimental procedures all electrolytic experiments were carried out in a 500 ml cylindrical flask reactor containing 400 ml of solution equipped with an inflator pump coupled to an undivided cell within a water bath for maintaining the temperature of solutions at 25 c it was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 800 rpm and under given direct current condition by a dc power supply kx 100 l from takasago electric inc titanium doped platinum ti pt electrodes with 50 cm2 projected area for each piece were supplied by tanaka kikinzoku kogyo co ltd three pieces of 50 cm2 bdd thin film from sumitomo electric industries 32 were selected as anode and cathode and the inter electrode gap was 0 5 cm of each group experimental apparatus were illustrated in fig 1 the bdd cathodes were applied to produce h2o2 via reaction 3 which was ensured by the improvement of air feeding system and increased arte of air flow through the solution prior to the experiments a period of 30 min air feeding processing was carried out with the purpose of saturating the solution with oxygen solutions containing 155 mg l caramel class iv 200 mg l caramel class iii and 25 mg l ao7 were comparatively degraded in 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 mm fe2 the initial ph was adjusted to 3 0 with h2so4 since this value has been found as optimal for reaction 1 under ef conditions 2 3 analytical methods each assay was proceeded with decolorization from the initial solution with the same pt co color unit of 5700 dark color to around 150 pt co unit clear state which was our target clarity every trial was performed by utilizing the solution with a selected colorant content 0 05 m na2so4 and a given fe2 concentration in the cell and then bubbled air at a given flow of a given rate for 30 min three pieces of bdd electrodes and ti pt electrodes were immersed into the solution a constant current was provided and an air pump was used to maintain the air flow through the solution to ensure o2 feeding for the cathode samples were withdrawn from the solution at different times the color removal of solutions was evaluated from their absorbance decay at λ 475 nm for caramel colorant and λmax 484 nm for ao7 which were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer hitachi u 5100 the decolorization efficiency or percentage of color removal was calculated by eq 4 based on the measured absorbance at above certain wavelength 33 4 color removal a 0 a a 0 100 where a0 and a denoted the simple absorbance at the initial time and at a given time during the oxidation run respectively the calibration curve of pt co unit and absorbance of solutions was followed from 100 and 1000 pt co unit color standard solutions 33 34 the decolorization rates rd were considered as the independent factors and calculated from eq 5 5 r d c 0 c c 0 100 where c and c0 were pt co unit after treatment and pt co unit before treatment respectively in order to assess the energy performance of electrochemical oxidation of caramel and ao7 the relationship 6 was used to calculate energy consumption ec as kwh l 1 35 6 e c uit v where u was the average voltage of the electrolyzer cell v i was the average applied current intensity a t was the electrolysis time h and v presented the volume of solution l 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative decolorization for the colorants the comparative electrochemical trials of three different colorants were performed using eo ef process with bdd bdd electrodes and 0 05 m na2so4 0 05 and 0 2 mm fe2 solution at a ph of 3 0 and a temperature of 25 c the applied air flow rate was 1 5 l min and the current intensity was 1 5 a in this trial the same initial clarity in pt co unit was observed and the colorant concentration of solutions was 155 200 and 25 mg l for caramel class iv caramel class iii and ao7 respectively fig 2 illustrates the effects of the variety of pigment on color absorbance and color removal fig 2a depicts the comparison of three different colorants on decolorization with 0 05 mm fe2 while the comparison of three different colorants on decolorization yield with 0 2 mm fe2 is shown in fig 2b the color removal for ao7 solutions lost rapidly and further became colorless with an approximate value of 150 pt co unit after 35 min achieved 99 color decay fig 2a the same initial pt co color unit of caramel class iv reached clear state with around 150 pt co unit and 97 color removal at 154 min the same behavior was observed for caramel class iii whereas the rate of color loss was slower than caramel class iv which achieved 96 color removal for 224 min oxidation time the decolorization trends of the three colorants in fig 2b were similar with the decolorization tendency in fig 2a fig 2b shows that 96 color removal of caramel class iv was achieved after 189 min while the color removal of caramel class iii was slower and decreased by 3 in the end compared to the former trial in fig 2a the higher color removal rate with ao7 compared to that of caramel could be accounted for the fact that the colorants had a distinct chemical structure and caramel had a greater amount of organics per unit than ao7 11 36 the caramel colorant was a complex mixture with separable high molecular weight and low molecular weight constituents 36 and it had a number of various chromophore and auxochrome such as carbon carbon double bond carbon carbon triple bond ketone group and amino group different from caramel class iv caramel class iii contains 2 acetyl 4 tetrahydroxy butylimidazole thi which was refractory and potential toxic matter with color intensity of absorbance at 385 nm 37 this might contribute to the lower color removal in caramel class iii with regard to the ao7 on the basis of its chemical structure it was indicated that relative molecular weight of the ao7 was far lower than caramel and the ao7 had a single chromophore which was azo bond 11 the number complexity variety and interaction of chromophore and auxochrome in colorant solution caramel and ao7 with the same initial color unit affected the color removal rate fig 3 presents pictures of the initial caramel solution with pt co color unit of 5700 and the treated solution with 150 pt co unit although the ao7 solutions showed a faster performance on decolorization the caramel class iv and caramel class iii also could be decolorized completely and reached the target clarity with clear state as shown in fig 3 3 2 effect of electrode materials on decolorization the characteristics of electrodes anode and cathode were key parameters assuring the efficiency of an electrochemical treatment process 38 it was conceivable that the eo ef process with bdd electrodes generates oh and fe3 in situ by fenton reaction 1 and additionally regenerated fe3 via cathodic reduction 7 12 which provided an enhancement on fenton reaction in the bulk based on the above observation the combination of eo using bdd anode and ef using bdd cathode was meaningfully proposed for efficient removal of caramel colorants 7 fe 3 e fe 2 the applied electrodes affected the rate of some electrochemical reactions the rate at which bdd oh h2o2 and fe2 were generated and consequently the rate at which the colorants were oxidized 38 fig 4 showed the effect of electrode material on the decline of absorbance related to the concentration of added fe2 trials were carried out under 1 5 a current intensity and 1 5 l min air flow rate the blank condition in fig 4 refers to the eo process without fe2 the ti pt anode was referred to be an active anode which indicated that the indirect oxidation predominated over direct oxidation 39 while bdd was a non active anode therefore a comparison between active anode and non active anode was carried out fig 4a depicts the decolorization performances of the eo process with ti pt anode and bdd anode the performance of decolorization applying bdd anode was faster than ti pt anode fig 4b illustrates that the eo process using bdd cathode reached the target clarity pt co unit with 96 color removal at 189 min the eo process with ti pt cathode achieved 93 color removal at 294 min the results indicated that color removal of eo process were affected by anode and cathode materials the results in fig 4a confirmed that the bdd anode possessed relatively high efficiency on the decolorizaton of colorants this could be attributed to the stronger oxidizing capacity of bdd oh compared to that of oh generated on the ti pt anode in fact bdd anodes had the following properties and merits wide electrochemical window stability under tough condition and relative low background current 40 it was assumed that these advantages could improve the efficiency of reaction 2 to generate larger amounts of bdd oh by comparing the two arrangements of the eo process with different cathodes in fig 4b it corroborated that the bdd cathodes favored a higher color removal than ti pt cathode it could be attributed to the property of bdd cathode which was able to produce h2o2 through reaction 3 40 the decolorization efficiency was affected by anodic and cathodic materials ti pt classified as an active anode merely accumulated small amounts of oh in fact these accumulated oxidants were subsequently oxidized to the weaker oxidant mox which only incurred the conversion of colorants into persistent short chain linear carboxylic acids 24 41 on the other hand bdd anode was a non active anode which could accumulate larger amounts of bdd oh thus the relative oxidizing capacity of accumulated bdd oh was stronger than that of accumulated oh generated on the ti pt anode the decolorization assisted by the fenton process were usually described by a first order rate equation 42 the electrochemical oxidation of caramel class iv with ti pt and bdd electrodes exhibited first order kinetic behavior eq 8 8 ln c 0 c t k 1 t where k 1 was the apparent first order rate constant and c0 and ct were the concentrations of pt co color unit determined from absorbance at initial time and at reaction time t respectively the kinetic parameters determined via eq 8 were summarized in table 1 fig 4c depicts the decolorization of eo and ef process with ti pt anode and bdd cathode the process of ti pt anode and bdd cathode without fe2 was the eo process while the ef process referred to the former conditions with fe2 a faster decolorization performance of ef process with 0 05 mm fe2 in solutions was observed during the 300 min trials the blank trial attained 30 color removal while 33 was achieved in the experiment with 0 05 mm fe2 fig 4d shows the effects of eo and eo ef processes on the decolorization of caramel class iv using bdd anode and cathode the process applied bdd electrodes without fe2 was the eo process while the eo ef process referred to the process with bdd anode and bdd cathode with fe2 it indicated that eo ef process with bdd anode and cathode was more efficient on decolorization rate than eo process under the same condition at 154 min the decolorization rate of electrochemical process with different configurations of eo ef process reached target clarity 18 40 22 60 71 53 94 48 and 97 45 for eo ti pt bdd ef ti pt bdd eo bdd ti pt eo bdd bdd and eo ef bdd bdd respectively the similar behavior shown in fig 4 substantiated foregoing results of ranking of eo ti pt bdd ef ti pt bdd eo bdd ti pt eo bdd bdd eo ef bdd bdd the color unit decay were analyzed from kinetic equation related to simple reaction orders and excellent fits were obtained for a pseudo first order reaction 8 as could be seen in table 1 in the case of ef process with fe2 it corroborated that ef process could accelerate decolorization more efficiently compared with eo process on account of a larger amount of oxidants produced by fenton reaction 1 18 it further confirmed that eo ef process resulted in the most high color removal among eo ef and eo ef process 3 3 effect of air flow rate on decolorization the air flow rate on ef process was a key parameter for cathodic reaction as it is related to the generation of h2o2 the effect of air flow rate on the degradation of 25 mg l ao7 and 155 mg l caramel class iv solution with 0 05 mm fe2 at 1 5 a constant current by eo ef with bdd electrodes process was investigated between 0 5 l min and 1 5 l min air flow rate fig 5 fig 5a highlights that the solution with caramel became colorless at a shorter time with increasing air flow rate from 0 5 to 1 5 l min at the end of electrolyte process the color removals were achieved from 95 for blank condition to 97 for 1 5 l min in fig 5a the eo ef process without air feeding yielded the slowest decolorization and reached the target clarity at 190 min however as for eo ef process with an air flow rate of 1 5 l min the color removal reached the target clarity at 155 min the pseudo first order reaction was used to simulate the decolorization process by electro oxidation treatment eq 9 11 43 9 a a 0 e kt where a0 and a were the absorbance at initial time and time t at the corresponding wavelength respectively k was determined as the slope of the liner fitting between absorbance decay and t the results in table 1 showed a gradual increase of k value with air flow rate which suggested that the progressive acceleration of cathodic reactions generated larger amounts of h2o2 through reaction 3 due to the increase of dissolved oxygen in solutions and consequently enhanced the rate of fenton reaction 1 a similar trend of fig 5a could be observed in fig 5b where higher color removal was achieved from 97 for blank trial to 99 for 1 5 l min it was noticed in fig 5b that the absorbance values declined sharply with air feeding system regardless of air flow rate value while the values dropped smoothly without air feeding with a longer reaction time of 42 min these results indicated that increasing air flow rate enhanced the decolorization of caramel class iv and ao7 owing to the acceleration of electro fenton reactions 3 4 effect of ferrous ion concentration on decolorization the hydroxyl radicals were generated from fenton reagent and the fe2 concentration was involved in the hydroxyl radical generation according to reaction 1 to gain insight into the decolorization yield of caramel colorant and ao7 the effects of fe2 concentration on the decolorized performances of eo and ao ef using bdd bdd cell were investigated ao7 and caramel class iv solutions with the same initial pt co color unit and 1 5 l min flow rate were electrolyzed between 0 and 0 2 mm fe2 under 1 5 a current intensity fig 6 illustrates the results obtained with caramel and ao7 solutions when the catalyst content varied between 0 and 0 2 mm fig 6a depicts that when the catalyst content was above 0 1 mm the color rate decreased and even was similar to that without fe2 however different results were obtained with ao7 decolorization yield fig 6b shows that ao7 established a positive correlation with fe2 concentration and absorbance abatement required 42 min at 0 mm fe2 and 21 min at 0 05 0 1 0 2 mm fe2 to reach at least 97 color removal this tendency could be corroborated by the pseudo first order kinetic analysis of two colorants presented in table 1 with regard to ao7 a rise of k value was found at a higher fe2 concentration being 2 6 fold 2 08 fold and 2 06 fold higher at 0 2 0 1 and 0 05 mm respectively as compared with without fe2 in contrast as for caramel colorant no further enhancement was achieved beyond 0 05 mm fe2 concentration the results from fig 6 could be explained by progressive upgrades of oh generation from fenton reaction 1 as a result of the increase of fe2 concentration on the contrary the excess of catalyst could lead to efficiency decline because it eliminates partial oh as shown in reaction 10 44 10 fe 2 oh fe 3 oh with respect to caramel we could conclude that within a given scale increasing fe2 concentration could promote the fenton reaction 1 whereas higher fe2 and or generated oh could react with each other and consume themselves via reaction 10 moreover the fe3 complexes a colored matter 24 43 generated during electrolyte they imposed an interference on absorbance as they had a certain absorbance which corresponded to constant pt co unit around 475 nm 3 5 effect of current intensity on decolorization the applied current was the driving force for both the oxygen reduction which gave rise to hydrogen peroxide generation at cathode and the production of physisorbed bdd oh on the surface of anode 45 the effects of current intensity on the decolorization of 25 mg l ao7 and 155 mg l caramel class iv solutions with 0 05 mm fe2 applying 1 5 l min air flow rate by eo ef bdd process was investigated between 0 4 a and 1 5 a the changes in decolorization rate with prolonging time for the ef process at three different current intensity values were investigated and the results are shown in table 1 the changes of ao7 in fig 7 indicate almost same decolorization curve and charge utilization between 0 8 and 0 4 a current intensity conditions under 1 5 a current intensity condition the charge utilization of decolorization curve was lower than 0 8 and 0 4 a conditions with respect to caramel solution more obvious trends of increasing current intensity causing a loss of the charge utilization charge utilization 1 5 a 0 8 a 0 4 a are shown in fig 7 it was assumed that higher current intensity resulted in higher amounts of bdd oh generated by reaction 2 as well as of h2o2 yielded at cathode via reaction 3 which favored larger generation of oh from fenton reaction 1 however the decrease of the charge utilization with the increase of current intensity could be explained from two aspects the one aspect was caused by the enhancement of competitive electrode reactions the discharge of oxygen at anode and evolution of hydrogen at cathode occurred at higher current intensity 46 moreover the bdd oh production could be inhibited by the generation of other weaker oxidants like s2o8 2 via reaction 11 47 these side electrode reactions inhibited the main reactions 2 3 and 6 which resulted to the decrease of charge utilization the other aspect could refer to the consumption of excess yielded oh which caused by non oxidizing parasitic reaction 48 these side reactions could incur the removal of oh by reaction 10 and the loss of h2o2 through reaction 12 49 11 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 12 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o the proportion between expenses and outcome of electrolysis should be well considered the energy consumption was calculated by eq 6 the energy consumption of eo ef process 0 05 mm fe2 and eo process without fe2 were 12 77 kwh l 1 and 16 05 kwh l 1 respectively for ao7 decolorization under condition of 1 5 a 1 5 l min bdd bdd with respect to caramel 4 the energy consumption of eo ef process 0 05 mm fe2 and eo process without fe2 were 53 43 kwh l 1 and 67 15 kwh l 1 at 1 5 a 1 5 l min flow rate with bdd bdd electrode the combination of eo ef process could save more energy than eo process whether for decolorization of ao7 or caramel 4 colorants 4 conclusions the decolorization rate of caramel class iv was investigated by eo ef and eo ef process with bdd and ti pt electrodes the caramel was decolorized almost completely with the shortest electrolyte time 154 min by the eo ef process using bdd electrodes with the addition of 0 05 mm fe2 via applying 1 5 l min air flow rate and 1 5 a current intensity the decolorization of ao7 exceeded 99 within 40 min under all experimental conditions it suggested that the caramel was more difficult to be degraded than ao7 owing to its complicated constituents however a complete decolorization of caramel lower 150 pt co unit was still observed under our experimental condition and the highest kinetic constant of 2 3 10 2 min 1 was found under these conditions the results of the effect of electrode material indicated that the performances of eo ef and eo ef processes were affected by the anode and cathode materials especially bdd anode and cathode favored better decolorization yield than other electrode materials the decolorization efficiency has been investigated and listed in increasing order as follows eo ti pt bdd ef ti pt bdd eo bdd ti pt eo bdd bdd eo ef bdd bdd a higher concentration of fe2 caused a faster discoloration meanwhile it was assumed that it could incurred removal of fe2 and oh as well as some interferences on account of its oxidized complex the color loss always obeyed a pseudo first order kinetics and the reaction rate k varied positively and linearly with the air flow rate and current intensity higher current intensity accelerated the color removal however it was detrimental to the electric charge consumption due to the parasitic reaction the eo combined with ef process using bdd electrodes was an effective treatment for color removal of caramel colorants allowing a significant decolorization to be achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

the simultaneous application of eo and ef in a synergic electrochemical system 26 27 and the bdd had much greater oxygen evolution overpotential than other conventional anodes 28 29 therefore as a non active anode bdd could yield physisorbed bdd oh a variety of strong oxidant at the bdd anodic surface through reaction 2 13 19 for eo process as cathode the bdd cathode continuously fed h2o2 into contaminated acidic solutions by the bi electron reduction of o2 in pressed air from reaction 3 12 for ef process this study aimed to investigate the removal of caramel colorants contained by liquid food biomass effluents using the eo ef with bdd electrodes for the futurereuse to reach this goal we applied eo ef and eo combined with ef methods to degrade colorants in this paper we compared different decolorization methods for caramel or ao7 using bdd electrodes or ti pt electrodes independent parameters of air flow rate for oxygen supply concentration of fe2 added and applied current intensity on degradations were evaluated to clarify their effects on decolorization yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the caramel class iv and caramel class iii were supplied by amano foods applied acid orange 7 was issued from tokyo chemical industry feso4 7h2o used as catalyst as well as anhydrous na2so4 utilized as background supporting electrolyte they were guaranteed grade and analytical grade reagent respectively from wako pure chemical industries solutions were prepared with ultrapure water from direct q 3uv system and their ph value were adjusted to 3 0 17 30 with analytical grade h2so4 purchased from wako pure chemical industries the caramel colorants showed dark color in solutions with a specific absorption wavelength of 610 nm 34 in the application of caramel colorants by food industry the yellow index was applied to analyze their quality in regard to caramel colorants the yellow index was measured at 470 480 nm 31 2 2 apparatus and experimental procedures all electrolytic experiments were carried out in a 500 ml cylindrical flask reactor containing 400 ml of solution equipped with an inflator pump coupled to an undivided cell within a water bath for maintaining the temperature of solutions at 25 c it was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 800 rpm and under given direct current condition by a dc power supply kx 100 l from takasago electric inc titanium doped platinum ti pt electrodes with 50 cm2 projected area for each piece were supplied by tanaka kikinzoku kogyo co ltd three pieces of 50 cm2 bdd thin film from sumitomo electric industries 32 were selected as anode and cathode and the inter electrode gap was 0 5 cm of each group experimental apparatus were illustrated in fig 1 the bdd cathodes were applied to produce h2o2 via reaction 3 which was ensured by the improvement of air feeding system and increased arte of air flow through the solution prior to the experiments a period of 30 min air feeding processing was carried out with the purpose of saturating the solution with oxygen solutions containing 155 mg l caramel class iv 200 mg l caramel class iii and 25 mg l ao7 were comparatively degraded in 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 mm fe2 the initial ph was adjusted to 3 0 with h2so4 since this value has been found as optimal for reaction 1 under ef conditions 2 3 analytical methods each assay was proceeded with decolorization from the initial solution with the same pt co color unit of 5700 dark color to around 150 pt co unit clear state which was our target clarity every trial was performed by utilizing the solution with a selected colorant content 0 05 m na2so4 and a given fe2 concentration in the cell and then bubbled air at a given flow of a given rate for 30 min three pieces of bdd electrodes and ti pt electrodes were immersed into the solution a constant current was provided and an air pump was used to maintain the air flow through the solution to ensure o2 feeding for the cathode samples were withdrawn from the solution at different times the color removal of solutions was evaluated from their absorbance decay at λ 475 nm for caramel colorant and λmax 484 nm for ao7 which were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer hitachi u 5100 the decolorization efficiency or percentage of color removal was calculated by eq 4 based on the measured absorbance at above certain wavelength 33 4 color removal a 0 a a 0 100 where a0 and a denoted the simple absorbance at the initial time and at a given time during the oxidation run respectively the calibration curve of pt co unit and absorbance of solutions was followed from 100 and 1000 pt co unit color standard solutions 33 34 the decolorization rates rd were considered as the independent factors and calculated from eq 5 5 r d c 0 c c 0 100 where c and c0 were pt co unit after treatment and pt co unit before treatment respectively in order to assess the energy performance of electrochemical oxidation of caramel and ao7 the relationship 6 was used to calculate energy consumption ec as kwh l 1 35 6 e c uit v where u was the average voltage of the electrolyzer cell v i was the average applied current intensity a t was the electrolysis time h and v presented the volume of solution l 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative decolorization for the colorants the comparative electrochemical trials of three different colorants were performed using eo ef process with bdd bdd electrodes and 0 05 m na2so4 0 05 and 0 2 mm fe2 solution at a ph of 3 0 and a temperature of 25 c the applied air flow rate was 1 5 l min and the current intensity was 1 5 a in this trial the same initial clarity in pt co unit was observed and the colorant concentration of solutions was 155 200 and 25 mg l for caramel class iv caramel class iii and ao7 respectively fig 2 illustrates the effects of the variety of pigment on color absorbance and color removal fig 2a depicts the comparison of three different colorants on decolorization with 0 05 mm fe2 while the comparison of three different colorants on decolorization yield with 0 2 mm fe2 is shown in fig 2b the color removal for ao7 solutions lost rapidly and further became colorless with an approximate value of 150 pt co unit after 35 min achieved 99 color decay fig 2a the same initial pt co color unit of caramel class iv reached clear state with around 150 pt co unit and 97 color removal at 154 min the same behavior was observed for caramel class iii whereas the rate of color loss was slower than caramel class iv which achieved 96 color removal for 224 min oxidation time the decolorization trends of the three colorants in fig 2b were similar with the decolorization tendency in fig 2a fig 2b shows that 96 color removal of caramel class iv was achieved after 189 min while the color removal of caramel class iii was slower and decreased by 3 in the end compared to the former trial in fig 2a the higher color removal rate with ao7 compared to that of caramel could be accounted for the fact that the colorants had a distinct chemical structure and caramel had a greater amount of organics per unit than ao7 11 36 the caramel colorant was a complex mixture with separable high molecular weight and low molecular weight constituents 36 and it had a number of various chromophore and auxochrome such as carbon carbon double bond carbon carbon triple bond ketone group and amino group different from caramel class iv caramel class iii contains 2 acetyl 4 tetrahydroxy butylimidazole thi which was refractory and potential toxic matter with color intensity of absorbance at 385 nm 37 this might contribute to the lower color removal in caramel class iii with regard to the ao7 on the basis of its chemical structure it was indicated that relative molecular weight of the ao7 was far lower than caramel and the ao7 had a single chromophore which was azo bond 11 the number complexity variety and interaction of chromophore and auxochrome in colorant solution caramel and ao7 with the same initial color unit affected the color removal rate fig 3 presents pictures of the initial caramel solution with pt co color unit of 5700 and the treated solution with 150 pt co unit although the ao7 solutions showed a faster performance on decolorization the caramel class iv and caramel class iii also could be decolorized completely and reached the target clarity with clear state as shown in fig 3 3 2 effect of electrode materials on decolorization the characteristics of electrodes anode and cathode were key parameters assuring the efficiency of an electrochemical treatment process 38 it was conceivable that the eo ef process with bdd electrodes generates oh and fe3 in situ by fenton reaction 1 and additionally regenerated fe3 via cathodic reduction 7 12 which provided an enhancement on fenton reaction in the bulk based on the above observation the combination of eo using bdd anode and ef using bdd cathode was meaningfully proposed for efficient removal of caramel colorants 7 fe 3 e fe 2 the applied electrodes affected the rate of some electrochemical reactions the rate at which bdd oh h2o2 and fe2 were generated and consequently the rate at which the colorants were oxidized 38 fig 4 showed the effect of electrode material on the decline of absorbance related to the concentration of added fe2 trials were carried out under 1 5 a current intensity and 1 5 l min air flow rate the blank condition in fig 4 refers to the eo process without fe2 the ti pt anode was referred to be an active anode which indicated that the indirect oxidation predominated over direct oxidation 39 while bdd was a non active anode therefore a comparison between active anode and non active anode was carried out fig 4a depicts the decolorization performances of the eo process with ti pt anode and bdd anode the performance of decolorization applying bdd anode was faster than ti pt anode fig 4b illustrates that the eo process using bdd cathode reached the target clarity pt co unit with 96 color removal at 189 min the eo process with ti pt cathode achieved 93 color removal at 294 min the results indicated that color removal of eo process were affected by anode and cathode materials the results in fig 4a confirmed that the bdd anode possessed relatively high efficiency on the decolorizaton of colorants this could be attributed to the stronger oxidizing capacity of bdd oh compared to that of oh generated on the ti pt anode in fact bdd anodes had the following properties and merits wide electrochemical window stability under tough condition and relative low background current 40 it was assumed that these advantages could improve the efficiency of reaction 2 to generate larger amounts of bdd oh by comparing the two arrangements of the eo process with different cathodes in fig 4b it corroborated that the bdd cathodes favored a higher color removal than ti pt cathode it could be attributed to the property of bdd cathode which was able to produce h2o2 through reaction 3 40 the decolorization efficiency was affected by anodic and cathodic materials ti pt classified as an active anode merely accumulated small amounts of oh in fact these accumulated oxidants were subsequently oxidized to the weaker oxidant mox which only incurred the conversion of colorants into persistent short chain linear carboxylic acids 24 41 on the other hand bdd anode was a non active anode which could accumulate larger amounts of bdd oh thus the relative oxidizing capacity of accumulated bdd oh was stronger than that of accumulated oh generated on the ti pt anode the decolorization assisted by the fenton process were usually described by a first order rate equation 42 the electrochemical oxidation of caramel class iv with ti pt and bdd electrodes exhibited first order kinetic behavior eq 8 8 ln c 0 c t k 1 t where k 1 was the apparent first order rate constant and c0 and ct were the concentrations of pt co color unit determined from absorbance at initial time and at reaction time t respectively the kinetic parameters determined via eq 8 were summarized in table 1 fig 4c depicts the decolorization of eo and ef process with ti pt anode and bdd cathode the process of ti pt anode and bdd cathode without fe2 was the eo process while the ef process referred to the former conditions with fe2 a faster decolorization performance of ef process with 0 05 mm fe2 in solutions was observed during the 300 min trials the blank trial attained 30 color removal while 33 was achieved in the experiment with 0 05 mm fe2 fig 4d shows the effects of eo and eo ef processes on the decolorization of caramel class iv using bdd anode and cathode the process applied bdd electrodes without fe2 was the eo process while the eo ef process referred to the process with bdd anode and bdd cathode with fe2 it indicated that eo ef process with bdd anode and cathode was more efficient on decolorization rate than eo process under the same condition at 154 min the decolorization rate of electrochemical process with different configurations of eo ef process reached target clarity 18 40 22 60 71 53 94 48 and 97 45 for eo ti pt bdd ef ti pt bdd eo bdd ti pt eo bdd bdd and eo ef bdd bdd respectively the similar behavior shown in fig 4 substantiated foregoing results of ranking of eo ti pt bdd ef ti pt bdd eo bdd ti pt eo bdd bdd eo ef bdd bdd the color unit decay were analyzed from kinetic equation related to simple reaction orders and excellent fits were obtained for a pseudo first order reaction 8 as could be seen in table 1 in the case of ef process with fe2 it corroborated that ef process could accelerate decolorization more efficiently compared with eo process on account of a larger amount of oxidants produced by fenton reaction 1 18 it further confirmed that eo ef process resulted in the most high color removal among eo ef and eo ef process 3 3 effect of air flow rate on decolorization the air flow rate on ef process was a key parameter for cathodic reaction as it is related to the generation of h2o2 the effect of air flow rate on the degradation of 25 mg l ao7 and 155 mg l caramel class iv solution with 0 05 mm fe2 at 1 5 a constant current by eo ef with bdd electrodes process was investigated between 0 5 l min and 1 5 l min air flow rate fig 5 fig 5a highlights that the solution with caramel became colorless at a shorter time with increasing air flow rate from 0 5 to 1 5 l min at the end of electrolyte process the color removals were achieved from 95 for blank condition to 97 for 1 5 l min in fig 5a the eo ef process without air feeding yielded the slowest decolorization and reached the target clarity at 190 min however as for eo ef process with an air flow rate of 1 5 l min the color removal reached the target clarity at 155 min the pseudo first order reaction was used to simulate the decolorization process by electro oxidation treatment eq 9 11 43 9 a a 0 e kt where a0 and a were the absorbance at initial time and time t at the corresponding wavelength respectively k was determined as the slope of the liner fitting between absorbance decay and t the results in table 1 showed a gradual increase of k value with air flow rate which suggested that the progressive acceleration of cathodic reactions generated larger amounts of h2o2 through reaction 3 due to the increase of dissolved oxygen in solutions and consequently enhanced the rate of fenton reaction 1 a similar trend of fig 5a could be observed in fig 5b where higher color removal was achieved from 97 for blank trial to 99 for 1 5 l min it was noticed in fig 5b that the absorbance values declined sharply with air feeding system regardless of air flow rate value while the values dropped smoothly without air feeding with a longer reaction time of 42 min these results indicated that increasing air flow rate enhanced the decolorization of caramel class iv and ao7 owing to the acceleration of electro fenton reactions 3 4 effect of ferrous ion concentration on decolorization the hydroxyl radicals were generated from fenton reagent and the fe2 concentration was involved in the hydroxyl radical generation according to reaction 1 to gain insight into the decolorization yield of caramel colorant and ao7 the effects of fe2 concentration on the decolorized performances of eo and ao ef using bdd bdd cell were investigated ao7 and caramel class iv solutions with the same initial pt co color unit and 1 5 l min flow rate were electrolyzed between 0 and 0 2 mm fe2 under 1 5 a current intensity fig 6 illustrates the results obtained with caramel and ao7 solutions when the catalyst content varied between 0 and 0 2 mm fig 6a depicts that when the catalyst content was above 0 1 mm the color rate decreased and even was similar to that without fe2 however different results were obtained with ao7 decolorization yield fig 6b shows that ao7 established a positive correlation with fe2 concentration and absorbance abatement required 42 min at 0 mm fe2 and 21 min at 0 05 0 1 0 2 mm fe2 to reach at least 97 color removal this tendency could be corroborated by the pseudo first order kinetic analysis of two colorants presented in table 1 with regard to ao7 a rise of k value was found at a higher fe2 concentration being 2 6 fold 2 08 fold and 2 06 fold higher at 0 2 0 1 and 0 05 mm respectively as compared with without fe2 in contrast as for caramel colorant no further enhancement was achieved beyond 0 05 mm fe2 concentration the results from fig 6 could be explained by progressive upgrades of oh generation from fenton reaction 1 as a result of the increase of fe2 concentration on the contrary the excess of catalyst could lead to efficiency decline because it eliminates partial oh as shown in reaction 10 44 10 fe 2 oh fe 3 oh with respect to caramel we could conclude that within a given scale increasing fe2 concentration could promote the fenton reaction 1 whereas higher fe2 and or generated oh could react with each other and consume themselves via reaction 10 moreover the fe3 complexes a colored matter 24 43 generated during electrolyte they imposed an interference on absorbance as they had a certain absorbance which corresponded to constant pt co unit around 475 nm 3 5 effect of current intensity on decolorization the applied current was the driving force for both the oxygen reduction which gave rise to hydrogen peroxide generation at cathode and the production of physisorbed bdd oh on the surface of anode 45 the effects of current intensity on the decolorization of 25 mg l ao7 and 155 mg l caramel class iv solutions with 0 05 mm fe2 applying 1 5 l min air flow rate by eo ef bdd process was investigated between 0 4 a and 1 5 a the changes in decolorization rate with prolonging time for the ef process at three different current intensity values were investigated and the results are shown in table 1 the changes of ao7 in fig 7 indicate almost same decolorization curve and charge utilization between 0 8 and 0 4 a current intensity conditions under 1 5 a current intensity condition the charge utilization of decolorization curve was lower than 0 8 and 0 4 a conditions with respect to caramel solution more obvious trends of increasing current intensity causing a loss of the charge utilization charge utilization 1 5 a 0 8 a 0 4 a are shown in fig 7 it was assumed that higher current intensity resulted in higher amounts of bdd oh generated by reaction 2 as well as of h2o2 yielded at cathode via reaction 3 which favored larger generation of oh from fenton reaction 1 however the decrease of the charge utilization with the increase of current intensity could be explained from two aspects the one aspect was caused by the enhancement of competitive electrode reactions the discharge of oxygen at anode and evolution of hydrogen at cathode occurred at higher current intensity 46 moreover the bdd oh production could be inhibited by the generation of other weaker oxidants like s2o8 2 via reaction 11 47 these side electrode reactions inhibited the main reactions 2 3 and 6 which resulted to the decrease of charge utilization the other aspect could refer to the consumption of excess yielded oh which caused by non oxidizing parasitic reaction 48 these side reactions could incur the removal of oh by reaction 10 and the loss of h2o2 through reaction 12 49 11 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 12 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o the proportion between expenses and outcome of electrolysis should be well considered the energy consumption was calculated by eq 6 the energy consumption of eo ef process 0 05 mm fe2 and eo process without fe2 were 12 77 kwh l 1 and 16 05 kwh l 1 respectively for ao7 decolorization under condition of 1 5 a 1 5 l min bdd bdd with respect to caramel 4 the energy consumption of eo ef process 0 05 mm fe2 and eo process without fe2 were 53 43 kwh l 1 and 67 15 kwh l 1 at 1 5 a 1 5 l min flow rate with bdd bdd electrode the combination of eo ef process could save more energy than eo process whether for decolorization of ao7 or caramel 4 colorants 4 conclusions the decolorization rate of caramel class iv was investigated by eo ef and eo ef process with bdd and ti pt electrodes the caramel was decolorized almost completely with the shortest electrolyte time 154 min by the eo ef process using bdd electrodes with the addition of 0 05 mm fe2 via applying 1 5 l min air flow rate and 1 5 a current intensity the decolorization of ao7 exceeded 99 within 40 min under all experimental conditions it suggested that the caramel was more difficult to be degraded than ao7 owing to its complicated constituents however a complete decolorization of caramel lower 150 pt co unit was still observed under our experimental condition and the highest kinetic constant of 2 3 10 2 min 1 was found under these conditions the results of the effect of electrode material indicated that the performances of eo ef and eo ef processes were affected by the anode and cathode materials especially bdd anode and cathode favored better decolorization yield than other electrode materials the decolorization efficiency has been investigated and listed in increasing order as follows eo ti pt bdd ef ti pt bdd eo bdd ti pt eo bdd bdd eo ef bdd bdd a higher concentration of fe2 caused a faster discoloration meanwhile it was assumed that it could incurred removal of fe2 and oh as well as some interferences on account of its oxidized complex the color loss always obeyed a pseudo first order kinetics and the reaction rate k varied positively and linearly with the air flow rate and current intensity higher current intensity accelerated the color removal however it was detrimental to the electric charge consumption due to the parasitic reaction the eo combined with ef process using bdd electrodes was an effective treatment for color removal of caramel colorants allowing a significant decolorization to be achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

corresponding author 1 these authors contributed equally to this work design of experiment doe is a robust design methodology that can be used to solve various water engineering problems it aims to obtain the maximal results from data while minimizing inputs in terms of experiments required doe consists of various steps and experimental designs however the steps experimental design and selection of designs are not well discussed in literature prior reviews are also not as comprehensive in the provision of all forms of does available in the context of water chemistry this study hence aims to fill that gap and provide a unique and novel perspective of doe application in this sector specific and contextualized examples of doe were reviewed with recent innovation within these 5 years steps detailing the process for doe were also discussed with emphasis on experiment design type model analysis and up to date applications of doe it was found that the selection of doe protocol depends on the contextualized application of the doe where certain doe was more suitable for some context the application of doe can be generally split into 3 distinct categories screening optimization or the study of variable interactions whereas the selection of experimental design and modeling approach was also found to be a trade off between the accuracy of the modeling results and the number of experiments required when considering different doe approaches to water chemistry it is important to evaluate the different advantages and disadvantages of each doe in its contextualized use through this review practitioners would hence have more informed decisions in the selection of doe for its appropriate application graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords design of experiment optimization water chemistry wastewater treatment modeling 1 introduction various processes in environmental chemistry require design and modeling for practical application and industrial use in environmental chemical system management engineering bottlenecks like optimization and process understanding are technical hurdles that are faced globally technical challenges like fabrication understanding complex mechanisms optimisation are some of the common engineering challenges faced globally 1 3 for example lawson 1 reported the challenge of metabolic engineering and how these could be addressed with machine learning models whereas zhang et al 3 reported the challenge in material composition for carbon nanotube synthesis in the water sector operation control and optimization studies are needed for the practical application commercialisation of technology one factor at a time ofat is conventionally used to simulate and model various environmental chemical systems in ofat modeling one factor was varied while other variables are constrained to observe the changes to the output 4 5 however one of the key issues with ofat is the difficulty of observing interactive effects between the different variables and the inefficient allocation of resources 6 weissman and anderson 6 also reported that ofat methodology is unreliable and highly dependent on the starting point of the model sequence statistical design of experiments doe is a potential alternative to address such technical hurdles doe is defined as a structured and organized method to determine relationships between variables that influence a process with the output of that process 7 it uses a series of workflows and methodology for the optimization and modeling of various processes 6 the main objective of doe is to obtain the maximum amount of information while limiting the number of observations needed 6 and hence this will reduce the total number of experiments needed doe was reported to be used in various domains like pharmaceutical designs water treatment optimization and engineering optimization 8 11 with good degrees of success bastürk and alver 8 used artificial neural network genetic algorithm ann ga and response surface methodology rsm for the modeling of azo dye removal by the sono fenton process whereas cai et al 9 used ann for the optimisation of operating parameters for fluidized bed reactor fenton ann model for fbr fenton process performance prediction was reported to have an error within 2 for toc removal efficiency and 4 for sludge production shokri 11 studied the use of full factorial design ffd to optimize the sono photo fenton process a complex system with a high degree of accuracy the reported r2 value of 0 9884 for modeling the reduction of cod the key advantage of doe compared to ofat is the ability to model complex interactions well with less information needed a hidden relationship that would otherwise be unseen with ofat could be visualized and modeled well with doe methods while the concept of doe is not new an updated and comprehensive review on the topic in the water chemistry domain is unavailable most reviewed articles on the topic of doe focused on other sectors like the pharmaceutical industry process engineering aerodynamic analyses mechanical engineering field metabolomics related studies and biofuel production limited literature also discusses doe and its effectiveness in solving chemical and environmental engineering bottlenecks 12 prior reviews also provided limited evaluation and comparison of different doe types for its contextualized application this shows that the study of doe types and applications are under explored and the authors identified this as research gaps that need to be further studied there is also a lack of a guide for doe application in the water sector hence this review aims to provide a comprehensive review of doe types and contextualized applications in the water and wastewater sector various does would be reviewed to provide insights into the selection of does for each environmental context key concepts methodology and contextualized application of various doe in the water sector would be discussed in this review 2 present reviews on doe many researchers have assessed and reviewed the application of doe for use in various contexts since there were limited reviews of doe application in the water or wastewater sector a review of doe in other similar applications was summarized in table 1 nair et al 13 reviewed the usage of ccd with rsm in water and wastewater modeling in their article contextualized use of ccd coupled with rsm analysis was applied to various fields of water and wastewater modeling weissman and anderson 6 reviewed that doe has been gaining popularity in chemical and organic applications in his review doe application was categorized based on reaction mechanisms and it was concluded that doe can be applied to various stages of operations screening optimization and modeling various reactions fukuda et al 15 and gujral et al 14 reviewed the fundamentals of doe for the pharmaceuticals industry 14 15 various factorial designs used in the doe were compared for either screening or optimization applications fukuda et al 15 found that 2 level full factorial fractionate factorial and plackett burman designs were more suitable for screening whereas 3 level full factorial central composite designs ccd and box behnken designs were more suitable for optimization fukuda et al 15 also discussed in depth the amalgamation of doe and quality by design qbd for a more holistic approach in pharmaceutical applications blondet et al 17 and yondo et al 16 summarized the use of doe in mechanical and aeronautical engineering applications in their review the use of surrogate models was suggested to be incorporated into doe for better modeling performance 16 17 tavizón pozos et al 19 and jacyna et al 18 summarized the use of factorial type doe in their respective field of metabolomic and biofuel production 18 19 jacyna et al 18 gave an overview of doe used in metabolomics related studies with a focus more on factorial designs and its variant it was recommended the use of a promising hybridized doe development called experimental design assistant eda which uses domain expertise coupled with doe for modeling in metabolomics related studies tavizón pozos et al 19 reviewed factorial designs and response surface methodology rsm used in the biofuel sector in that study they demonstrated the scope and limitation of the use of doe in biofuel production newer perspective papers have also emerged in recent years such as the use of ccd type doe for the application in catalysis formation and electrochemical application 20 21 ahmed et al 20 suggest that screening design before progressing to extensive factor effects and optimization studies is recommended macqueen et al 21 found that current methods can be coupled with machine learning as an alternative design for catalysis optimization present reviews offers some insights to the general application of doe with most reviews focused on the use of ccd coupled with rsm for model analysis other forms of does were not thoroughly explored especially in the water sector this study aims to fill that gap and provide a more comprehensive review of various doe its fundamentals analysis and applications 3 doe process and procedures for the successful application of doe in wastewater treatment a systematic workflow adapted from weissman anderson 6 is illustrated in fig 1 in the first phase the model object is defined and this involves the consideration of the water treatment process and the model function the definition of the model objective would hence determine subsequent variables like the choice of does used 22 certain does are more suitable for screening studies while certain designs are more suitable for optimization studies in the second phase the definition of variables involves careful selection of variables and proper usage of measured data within a single doe multiple types of variables can be used within a study cai et al 9 used a randomized experimental design with process variables like ph and continuous variables like fe2 and h2o2 concentration within a single study understanding the variable type is crucial to determine the suitability of certain doe that can be utilized supporting text s1 summarizes the types of variables and their suitability for certain does the next few stages involve the definition of responses based on model requirements followed by experimental design selection data collection and confirming reactions data collection and confirming of reaction involves statistical analysis of data 3 1 experimental design does could be used for various applications and categorized into screening studies optimization studies and variable interaction studies fig 2 3 1 1 factorial design full factorial designs measure response variables for every scenario and combination of factor levels the number of runs in a factorial design is denoted in eq 1 1 number of runs i n p where n denotes the variables tested i denote the number of levels studied and p denotes the number of generators no of variables that cannot be estimated independent of each other in a full factorial design p is zero and the no of runs needed is in while advantageous for separating individual effects full factorial designs can make large demands on data collection 23 most commonly only up to 3 levels are studied due to the high number of iterations needed it is generally recommended to conduct a full factorial design when the number of variables studied is small and if resources are available 22 for 4 or higher levels studied it is more ideal to use other forms of doe for more efficient modeling full factorial doe was pioneered by r a fisher in the 1930s and builds the fundamentals of other does explained further in the sections below they are presently not as popular due to the innovation of other does and the redundancy experimental runs needed 24 fractional factorial design is a variant of full factorial design and is usually used to only observe the main effects of the system 18 the reduction in the number of experiments was performed by confounding variable that has no distinguishable effects on a response together by a p factor to reduce the number of runs 25 hence it is less resource demanding compared to full factorial designs for more details on the background theory and worked example of confounding refer to the supporting text s2 the fractional design is 1 i p of the full factorial design a 25 2 fractional design is 1 4 of a two level five factor factorial design and requires only 8 runs instead of 32 none crucial variables could be confounded with interactions generated by other variables 26 employed the use of a 25 1 fractional factorial design for the optimization of biomass pretreatments in his study the 5 variables studied were ball milling time a h2so4 concentration b naoh concentration c temperature d and reaction time e interactive binary interactions like naoh temperature cxd could be formed resulting in lesser runs than a full factorial design another subset of factorial design is the plackett burman design 27 this design run number is in the multiple of four rather than nn with 8 as the starting point n 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 the key advantage of this is that it simplifies and further reduce runs by assuming negligible interactive effects between variables this doe is most suitable for screening since the resolution of the result is relatively poorer with a restricted number of levels to only 2 28 generation of the orthogonal pattern is formed using the generator shown in fig 2 based on the number of variables the number of runs and generators used would be different in each number of runs the pattern of the generator gets shifted down by 1 this is illustrated in the color coded figure with 7 variables namely a g fig 3 3 1 2 taguchi design taguchi design was created to address the high experimental counts of factorial designs particularly so for higher levels problems 29 it uses a unique orthogonal array coupled with loss functions to determine the optimized conditions many taguchi designs are based on factorial designs for example taguchi s l8 design is a standard 23 factorial design the key difference is the analysis of the results and that taguchi s design is highly fractionalized and confounded 30 31 another notable difference is that taguchi designs are based on the prior selection of the most likely interactions whereas in standard fractional factorial designs the confounding interactions are selected later on this property hence requires careful selection of design points with taguchi being conventionally performed in a minimum of 2 iterations taguchi s design makes use of latin squares for the orthogonal arrays a detailed breakdown of the latin s design and orthogonal arrays is shown in the supporting text s3 possible arrays from taguchi s design are illustrated in table 2 whereby l latin squares a number of rows b number of levels and c number of variables taguchi s design can only be used to address optimization problems where the evaluation of the experimental conditions was done using a signal to noise ratio representing the magnitude of the mean of a process compared to its variation while the number of experiments is greatly reduced it requires careful selection of variable levels in the study by cai et al 32 taguchi optimization was used to determine the optimal dosage of fenton s reagent and uv operation conditions for the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate in their study the selection of variable levels was done based on extensive background research on similar water characteristics of other reported studies however the key drawback to such a design is that it assumes that interactions between variables are confounded which in the real world context is not always true another drawback is the accuracy and lack of resolution for optimized conditions in taguchi optimization the optimized condition would only fall within the design points of the doe taguchi is not able to provide us with the true optimal value of a variable setting it merely tells us which is the best level for a variable setting from the levels chosen for experimentation this results in a poorer optimized condition compared to other forms of doe kozik et al 33 similarly reported that the lack of modeled resolution of the taguchi method resulted in the poorer optimized condition compared to central composite designs 33 3 1 3 central composite design ccd ccd designs are partial factorial designs and were reported to have lower experimental runs while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy 34 35 the key difference between a ccd design and a fractional factorial design is that modeled approximations of ccd are second degree polynomials while partial factorials are first degree polynomial approximations 36 37 ccd generally consists of 5 levels namely α 1 0 center point 1 and α composite designs have 3 variants inscribed cci circumscribed ccc and face centered ccf fig 4 knowing the differences in the 3 variants is important since certain variants have a better modeling performance selected context in cci the α design is within the set 1 limit making this unsuitable for certain variables that have a true limit in the context of environmental chemistry certain variables have true limit i e the saturated dissolved oxygen do content or solubility of a reactant at a given condition etc and modeling beyond the set design space may not be a practical approach or is limited by engineering constraints 16 in this aspect cci would be a more suitable option cci and ccc are rotatable which means the variance of a predicted response depends solely on the distance of x from the center design point this is a desirable property for modeling quadratic functions cci however has a poorer modeling performance compared to ccc due to regions of poor prediction quality like in the context of combined variables at the extremes whereas ccf design points have 3 levels and are not rotatable and hence not suitable for quadratic functions ccf also does not allow for orthogonal blocking which allows experiments to be performed in blocks that isolate the block effects from the variable effects 35 38 detailed background on the theory of blocking can be found in supporting document s4 blocking for example allows the application of doe to isolate the effects of raw materials tested i e different batches of wastewater treated or operational fluctuations within a day in the context of environmental chemistry ccf might not be suitable for the modeling of large scale continuous systems or systems that have raw material variation box behnken design bbd is a variant of ccd with only 3 levels namely 1 0 center point and 1 34 39 it is a unique design that is a hybrid of factorial designs with incomplete blocking 40 while bbd requires a lesser number of experiments bbd is also reported to have poorer modeling accuracy as compared to other experimental designs 34 rakić et al 34 reported that bbd had a lower predicted r2 value as compared to ccc or factorial designs bbd also does not include experimental runs at the extreme settings 41 3 1 4 simplex design simplex designs are unique to mixture variables and will not work with other types of variables in a general mixture problem the measured response is assumed to depend only on the proportions of the ingredients in the mixture not the amount of the mixture the response in a mixture experiment is usually described by a polynomial function the key purposes of conducting a mixture experiment are to find the best proportion of each component and the best value of each process variable to optimize single or multiple responses simplex lattice provides a better understanding of the shape of the response surface since the points are evenly spread across the whole simplex for screening purposes simplex axial and simplex centroid designs are used 15 23 extreme vertex designs are used for the cases when there are constraints on one or more variable components an example in context would be the physical limit of a material like the solubility of solutes at a given temperature an illustration of the design space of simplex systems is shown in fig 4 the simplex design uses a coordinate system for the value of each variable component x f denotes the coordinate points for the variable component eq 2 where f denotes the variables from 0 to q and m is the degree of the lattice 2 x f 0 1 m 2 m 1 the simplex lattice design is useful for a small number of components with response surfaces that need a polynomial equation of order 2 or greater for an accurate description for simplex centroid design all design points are centroid design points as illustrated in fig 4b simplex centroid design usually consists of lesser datapoints than simplex lattice design hence this is most suitable for screening applications an alternative to the simplex centroid design is the axial designs consist of design points that are not within the boundary of the simplex except for the central centroid axial designs are usually used for screening of variables where first degree models are to be fitted it has design points along the axial an imaginary line extending from the base point to the vertex fig 5 3 1 5 alternative designs optimal design like d optimal design has increasing application in various uses in water chemistry d optimal design is particularly useful when an experimental region is not regular in shape i e missing data or when it is not feasible to run the experiment under certain conditions 42 the d optimal design uses an iterative search algorithm to minimize the covariance of the parameter estimates for the specified model in place of traditional orthogonal design matrices as described earlier this was reported to reduce the total amount of experiments needed 43 44 this method is also unrestricted to the type of variable used while most doe only works with continuous variables d optimal design is also able to incorporate categorical elements as well giménez et al 45 used a d optimal design for the optimization of process variables for the photo fenton process with h2o2 concentration temperature and radiation level as the key variable studied 45 in his study 2 process variable and 1 categorical variable was used process variable h2o2 concentration and temperature categorical variable radiation level random design in the context of water related doe uses machine learning to aid doe experiments in a random doe the variables are assigned randomly within a range of values and the modeled results are analyzed using machine learning algorithms due to its flexibility in experimental design it can only be analyzed using powerful generalization tools such as artificial neural networks ann 9 the key advantage of such a design is the simplicity and the ability to work with preexisting data 46 for example the modeling performance of a water treatment plant could be modeled using ann with a random experiment design newhart et al 46 used ann and recurrent neural networks rnn modeling for the prediction of disinfection performance of peracetic acid paa 46 in his study a random experiment design was used with process variables as the input to the model however the key drawback for ann rnn coupled random design is the relatively large amount of data required as compared to other experimental designs 3 2 model analysis the model analysis utilizes different regression and statistical analysis to model results from the experimental designs as elaborated in the earlier section common model analysis methodology would be explained in the sections below 3 2 1 multi linear regression mlr multiple linear regression mlr is used for the analysis of factorial designs and their various variants mlr is a first degree polynomial approximation and models the relationship between two or more variables with that of a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data 47 it can help to determine the level of variation between the variables mlr line of y dependent variable on x independent variable is defined in the below equation eq 3 3 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b i x i where x i is the value of the ith predictor b 0 is the regression constant and b i is the coefficient of the ith predictor 3 2 2 signal to noise ratio s n analysis s n analysis is used for the evaluation of the modeled results for the taguchi design the methodology for the computation of the s n ratio is dependent on the purpose of the intended use s n ratio evaluates the signal to noise ratio where signal refers to controllable inputs and noise being uncontrollable variables into the model the ratio denotes how the response varies relative to a nominal value under different noise conditions 48 the computation of the s n ratio for the various uses is detailed in the supporting document s5 an illustration of the s n results of the taguchi design is illustrated below in fig 6 and obtained from 32 the doe design has 3 variables and 3 levels with an orthogonal design as shown in fig 6a in this context the signal denotes the removal efficiency of the system whereas the noise indicates the various operating conditions for the system i e chemical dosage ph uv intensity etc 3 2 3 responses surface methodology rsm response surface methodology rsm analysis is used for the analysis of ccd simplex designs and bbd due to the addition of a quadratic term rsm can model curvature in the response hence making this more accurate a general equation can be used to represent rsm eq 4 4 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i j β i j x i x j i 1 k β ii x i 2 where y is the response variable β 0 β i β ii are offset term linear coefficients quadratic coefficients interaction coefficients respectively x i and x j are independent variables typically the rsm uses modeling software like in statgraphics centurion xvi statgraphic usa design expert statease usa and minitab minitab usa for the analysis of the results an illustration of an rsm design by mahtab et al 49 is shown in fig 7 rsm offers a graphical approach for the optimization and understanding of variable interaction of systems and processes in this context the analysis of the results was performed by pairing two operation parameters such as time and ph fig 7b to observe the cod removal efficiency x i and x j denotes the operation parameter whereas y denotes the cod removal efficiency the modeling software was then used to determine the other variables β 0 β i β ii linear coefficients quadratic coefficients and interaction coefficients 3 2 4 artificial neural network ann ann is a powerful tool in terms of multivariate calibration and it can identify cause effect correlations through training with multiple inputs and outputs ann is also an alternative method for solving multi response problems 50 ann can be used with a variety of doe like random design central composite designs and even factorial designs 9 51 55 ann uses a series of interconnected nodes with an associated weight with the general equation as shown below eq 5 5 y f w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w i x i b where y is the output of the neuron and is a function f of x i is the input of the neuron w i is the associated weight and b is the bias the illustration of the output of the neuron is shown in the supporting text s6 the ann model uses algorithms to calibrate the weights of the nodes in the model a detailed breakdown of the calibration methodology is shown in supporting documents s7 an illustration of an ann design by cai et al 9 is shown in fig 8 in this context the modeling of toc removal was done using 4 control variables ph h2o2 fe2 and hydraulic retention time hrt similar to rsm ann is also able to graphically demonstrate the optimization and understanding of variable interaction of systems and processes the key difference between ann and rsm is the methodology ann uses a non distinctive arbitrary equation for the fitting of the model whereas rsm uses a quadratic function for the fitting of the model 56 57 4 up to date application of doe 4 1 application of factorial design in environmental chemistry the detailed information of factorial based design is summarized in table 3 most factorial studies are used to model adsorption processes biosorption processes synthesis of materials and process optimization of newer advanced oxidation processes the use of full factorial design ffd studies in the environmental field is relatively limited this was reportedly due to more experimental data required for modeling 59 however the advantage of such a design is that it accounts for all variable interactions 60 even without the use of a screening step hence ffd would be more suitable for complex relationships with unknown interactions 58 morshed et al 60 optimized the operation parameters of the heterogeneous fenton like mechanism of a newly developed fibrous catalyst for organic degradation shokri 11 studied the use of ffd to optimize the sono photo fenton process a complex system with a high degree of accuracy with a reported r2 value of 0 9884 for modeling the reduction of cod regti et al 58 and saleh et al 59 studied the adsorption process of complex solutions with known competitive reactions like blended dyes and synthetic compounds however the key disadvantage to ffd is the number of experiments ran and as such lesser variables have to be studied to limit the total number of experiments needed 66 woll and burkhard 66 found that a 7 variables design experiment required 729 experiments compared to only 9 experiments needed for a taguchi l8 27 design fractional factorial designs only observe the main effect of the variables and hence reduce the amount of data needed this method was reviewed to be mostly used in the optimization of adsorption processes with a high degree of accuracy and an r2 value of more than 0 80 61 63 65 elayadi et al 62 however reported a slightly lower r2 value of 0 75 in some instances variable noise might impact the model accuracy 67 to further enhance factorial design s model accuracy it is recommended to either perform a screening step or perform a certain variable sensitivity analysis for better model accuracy 67 4 2 application of taguchi design in environmental chemistry taguchi was used in the various context of environmental engineering from chemical process optimization 32 33 68 69 to physical process optimization 70 and even synthesis optimization of new materials 71 a list of recent publication of taguchi doe is summarised in table 4 taguchi does generally have much lower experiment runs as compared to other does kozik et al 33 reported that taguchi required only 12 experimental runs as compared to ccd which required 48 runs due to its low number of experimental runs it is an effective screening tool for process comparison cai et al 32 used taguchi optimization as a screening tool for different advanced oxidation processes aops pretreatment for reverse osmosis concentrate roc taguchi optimization can sometimes yield different optimized conditions depending on the optimization response 71 pander et al 71 reported that optimized conditions for annealing time hydrogen flowrate and argon flowrate is different when the target objective is for catalyst roughness compared to catalyst size this is also similarly reported by kaya et al 68 where the reported optimized condition for ozonation is different for cod removal dfz removal and uv254 removal 68 another study by younis et al 72 also reported that the adsorption capacity and partition coefficient for the three microbeads were different another shortfall of taguchi optimization is the inability to combine isolated effects of input parameters since taguchi optimization assumes that variables are all confounded hence ongoing research is done to further improve the application of taguchi doe for multi response optimization in the water domain a newer form of taguchi grey analysis was reported to convert a multiple response optimization problem into a single response one 69 grey s analysis is also used to explore the complicated relationships among input parameters 73 it uses a coefficient that presents the ratio between the desired values and the measured experimental response data then a weighted sum takes into account the grey relational coefficient corresponding to each process response and their corresponding weights 50 4 3 application of central composite design ccd doe in environmental chemistry central composite design ccd has been utilized for various applications of environmental chemistry such as process optimization modeling complex reactions like adsorption and also giving insights into variable interactions table 5 most researchers have applied ccd for the optimization and modeling of chemical processes such as the fenton process 49 75 electro fenton processes 77 81 82 sono photo processes 76 80 and ozonation process 83 other researchers also applied doe to biological and physical processes like membrane processes 55 adsorption processes 33 51 54 coagulation processes 74 79 and biological processes 77 78 most modeling techniques have good prediction performance compared to experimental results with reported r2 values 0 8 through the use of ccd the variable interactions were observed to have better insights into the overall system understanding 49 80 azizpour and qaderi 80 reported that uv source power had the most significant effect and that the flow rate had the least significant effect on the removal efficiency of photocatalytic processes whereas mahtab et al 49 reported that ph played the most significant impact on the cod removal efficiency of the fenton process various researchers have used the results from doe as a good cost estimate for processes 77 79 varank et al 79 computed the estimated operating costs for electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes at optimized conditions amounting to 6 4 m3 and 6 8 m3 respectively whereas bustillo lecompte et al 114 computed the cost of operation of the system at the optimized condition was computed to be 0 12 m3 traditionally ccd processes are analyzed using rsm techniques however alternative techniques like ann and ga were explored for the analysis of results from ccd 51 55 84 increasingly machine learning and artificial intelligence are gaining popularity in the water sector 85 ann was reported to show a better prediction accuracy compared to the rsm model 52 84 ann model uses a non standard parametric equation whereas rsm analysis is conventionally done using the quadratic function 56 however some researchers reported that rsm performance showed better accuracy than ann 51 ahmadi et al 51 reported that rsm performed marginally better than ann with r2 values of 0 9970 and 0 9919 respectively this is likely due to the overcomplication of design resulting in larger errors more studies on this aspect could be done to have a more comprehensive performance evaluation between the two modeling tools 4 4 application of box behnken design bbd in environmental chemistry bbd is a variant of ccd with generally fewer experiments needed as summarized in table 6 bbd has been used to model and optimize various advanced oxidation processes and modeling of adsorption studies gilpavas et al 39 utilized bbd for the modeling and optimization of various processes for the degradation of textile wastewater bbd was used to reduce the number of experiments needed such that a comparison of different advanced oxidation processes could be made it was found that ec with the photo fenton process produces the highest degradation performance of 76 100 and 78 for cod removal color removal and toc removal respectively whereas moradi et al 89 utilized bbd for the modeling of the removal of acid yellow 36 ay36 for the photoelectron fenton process pef in his study a total of 29 experiments was run thirugnanasambandham et al 87 also successfully deployed bbd for the modeling of the electrochemical process with a high degree of accuracy and high r2 of 0 9856 and r2 of 0 9956 for cod and color removal respectively bbd was able to show the interactive effects of process variables 86 tak et al 86 studied the performance of the electrocoagulation process for livestock wastewater in his study interactive effects of the process variables were observed with ph current density electrolysis time and nacl concentration similarly chaker et al 88 reported that anova analysis of the results from bbd optimization showed the mass of catalyst was the most significant variable for the optimization of the tio2 photocatalyst bbd is conventionally visualized and modeled using rsm however in recent years there has been ongoing research to couple bbd with neural networks for the modeling and optimization of processes 90 91 ezemagu et al 90 optimized the operation condition for the coagulation process for the removal of turbidity they utilized rsm and ann to compare the results of two different model fitting in their study they found that ann was more accurate with a smaller pre percentage relative error and aad absolute average deviation of 0 0241 and 0 0139 respectively whereas sivamani et al 91 optimized the reaction conditions for the adsorption of copper with orange zest biochar using a forward back propagation neural network ffbpnn these alternate forms of modeling showed a high degree of accuracy with r2 greater than 0 9 4 5 application of simplex design in environmental chemistry the simplex design has been employed in a variety of contexts in environmental chemistry on the optimization of compositions of catalyst and biofuel precursors the simplex design has limited applications as it can only work for mixture variables 92 for certain environmental chemistry contexts such as composition optimization simplex design is proven to be fairly effective it was also reported to yield similar results compared to regression analysis with lesser experimental runs 93 simplex design can optimize objectives that are opposable arias madrid et al 94 employed the use of simplex centroid mixture design optimization with two opposing objective functions maximal asphaltene adsorption and minimal activation energy for nanocatalyst adsorption similarly dias et al 95 used a simplex centroid mixture design for 2 opposing responses to maximize mac as while minimizing rc as simplex designs can also be used for the optimization of the composition of constituents used in oil production and pyrolysis 96 97 while the simplex design is generally used for the optimization of the adsorption process a newer application of simplex design has been proposed innovative use of simplex design includes greenhouse gas accounting 98 extraction of phenolic compounds for antioxidant and antibacterial applications 99 concrete mix proportioning 100 and solid waste management 101 further studies could be done on the application of simplex designs for solving problems in the field of environmental chemistry table 7 5 discussion and potential application the selection of doe experiment designs and model analysis is often unclear and difficult in the water sector the advantages and disadvantages of each doe would be listed down as a guide for doe selection in the context of water chemistry it shall be noted that this will only serve as a guide for practitioners to effectively select suitable doe for each context based on table 8 the selection of doe would be dependent on the main context of the model for models of provided datasets an alternative design would be most appropriate whereas for linear responses and non quadratic responses factorial designs would be more suitable 115 in most water and wastewater problems quadratic responses are generally better fits as such factorial designs may not be as suitable taguchi designs use a signal noise response and can be used for most applications however some assumptions are to be taken note of taguchi generally uses fewer experiments and this results in variables being highly confounded and hence potential for larger errors variables condition in taguchi is also selected either by prior knowledge or prior screening studies taguchi uses s n ratio to determine the optimized condition this optimized condition is relative to other pre selected conditions resulting in difficulty to observe true optimized values this is especially so when the true optimal values falls outside the variable condition hence for reliable optimisation using taguchi the selection of variable condition is crucial through screening iterations or prior knowledge ccd uses can be applied in most context since its variables are not determined beforehand unlike that of taguchi method while ccd can be used in most context the number of variables explored are generally below 4 due to a larger number of experiments as the number of variable increases in such instance it may be more useful to consider other forms of doe with lesser computational requirements the computation of the number of experiments for each doe is summarized in the supporting document s8 bbd is a modification of ccd and does not examine borderline regions and hence require fewer experiments however it comes at an opportunity cost with a lower number of degrees of freedom compared with ccd 20 cci and ccc have higher experiments than ccf and bbd for example in a 3 variable problem bbd would require 17 runs compared to 20 runs for ccc beyond 3 variable the number of runs of bbd would far exceed ccc careful selection of doe is hence needed to produce modeled results with a high degree of accuracy coupled with the least experiment data often there is a trade off between the accuracy of the modeling results and the number of experiments required conventionally the analysis of factorial designs and ccd uses multi linear regression and quadratic functions respectively the key shortfall is the need to fit models to a certain regression type alternative analysis like ann has increasingly been used in recent years to analyze such models and hence addressing the model fitting issue for mixture design problems a simplex design would be most appropriate it is also noted that for such problems it is possible to utilise other does like taguchi ccd and factorial design the key advantage of simplex design over other designs is that it accounts for the dependency of individual variables and the consideration for the overall mixture component an illustration in this water sector is the optimisation of components of a catalyst the output of the simplex is a ratio blend of individual components of the catalyst whereas other methods optimize the absolute amount of components in a catalyst and hence negating the proportion dependency process variables could be blended with a mixture design to study both the proportion effect as well as the absolute amount 6 conclusion this review provided a timely overview of doe for use in the environmental chemistry context key concepts and doe methodology were discussed in this article with emphasis on the experimental design types and model analysis doe involves multiple steps objective definition variable definition response definition selection of doe data collection and modeling analysis in this review the key fundamentals of each design are well explained with visual applied examples for practitioners to understand examples were given to illustrate the current application of doe in the environmental chemistry context in this review the advantages and disadvantages were also discussed to give insights into the selection of does and their implications it was found that the most common doe used is ccd coupled with rsm as discussed earlier moving forward other types of doe design can be explored as well doe can also be applied in other fields of environmental engineering such as stormwater runoff treatment e g in the form of optimizing bioretention soil mix and microplastics treatment e g optimizing experimental conditions as the water sector progresses along with the digital transformation across every industry machine learning that deals with large volume and varieties of data have taken prominence increasingly there has been a trend to blend doe with machine learning to form newer alternative designs this aspect has strong development potential due to the strong generalization ability of machine learning traditional analysis of doe using rsm multi linear analysis has shortfalls addressed earlier ann a form of machine learning showed promising application in this aspect further explorations to other forms of machine learning can also be explored machine learning can also be used to address issues such as missing data and data munging etc

corresponding author 1 these authors contributed equally to this work design of experiment doe is a robust design methodology that can be used to solve various water engineering problems it aims to obtain the maximal results from data while minimizing inputs in terms of experiments required doe consists of various steps and experimental designs however the steps experimental design and selection of designs are not well discussed in literature prior reviews are also not as comprehensive in the provision of all forms of does available in the context of water chemistry this study hence aims to fill that gap and provide a unique and novel perspective of doe application in this sector specific and contextualized examples of doe were reviewed with recent innovation within these 5 years steps detailing the process for doe were also discussed with emphasis on experiment design type model analysis and up to date applications of doe it was found that the selection of doe protocol depends on the contextualized application of the doe where certain doe was more suitable for some context the application of doe can be generally split into 3 distinct categories screening optimization or the study of variable interactions whereas the selection of experimental design and modeling approach was also found to be a trade off between the accuracy of the modeling results and the number of experiments required when considering different doe approaches to water chemistry it is important to evaluate the different advantages and disadvantages of each doe in its contextualized use through this review practitioners would hence have more informed decisions in the selection of doe for its appropriate application graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords design of experiment optimization water chemistry wastewater treatment modeling 1 introduction various processes in environmental chemistry require design and modeling for practical application and industrial use in environmental chemical system management engineering bottlenecks like optimization and process understanding are technical hurdles that are faced globally technical challenges like fabrication understanding complex mechanisms optimisation are some of the common engineering challenges faced globally 1 3 for example lawson 1 reported the challenge of metabolic engineering and how these could be addressed with machine learning models whereas zhang et al 3 reported the challenge in material composition for carbon nanotube synthesis in the water sector operation control and optimization studies are needed for the practical application commercialisation of technology one factor at a time ofat is conventionally used to simulate and model various environmental chemical systems in ofat modeling one factor was varied while other variables are constrained to observe the changes to the output 4 5 however one of the key issues with ofat is the difficulty of observing interactive effects between the different variables and the inefficient allocation of resources 6 weissman and anderson 6 also reported that ofat methodology is unreliable and highly dependent on the starting point of the model sequence statistical design of experiments doe is a potential alternative to address such technical hurdles doe is defined as a structured and organized method to determine relationships between variables that influence a process with the output of that process 7 it uses a series of workflows and methodology for the optimization and modeling of various processes 6 the main objective of doe is to obtain the maximum amount of information while limiting the number of observations needed 6 and hence this will reduce the total number of experiments needed doe was reported to be used in various domains like pharmaceutical designs water treatment optimization and engineering optimization 8 11 with good degrees of success bastürk and alver 8 used artificial neural network genetic algorithm ann ga and response surface methodology rsm for the modeling of azo dye removal by the sono fenton process whereas cai et al 9 used ann for the optimisation of operating parameters for fluidized bed reactor fenton ann model for fbr fenton process performance prediction was reported to have an error within 2 for toc removal efficiency and 4 for sludge production shokri 11 studied the use of full factorial design ffd to optimize the sono photo fenton process a complex system with a high degree of accuracy the reported r2 value of 0 9884 for modeling the reduction of cod the key advantage of doe compared to ofat is the ability to model complex interactions well with less information needed a hidden relationship that would otherwise be unseen with ofat could be visualized and modeled well with doe methods while the concept of doe is not new an updated and comprehensive review on the topic in the water chemistry domain is unavailable most reviewed articles on the topic of doe focused on other sectors like the pharmaceutical industry process engineering aerodynamic analyses mechanical engineering field metabolomics related studies and biofuel production limited literature also discusses doe and its effectiveness in solving chemical and environmental engineering bottlenecks 12 prior reviews also provided limited evaluation and comparison of different doe types for its contextualized application this shows that the study of doe types and applications are under explored and the authors identified this as research gaps that need to be further studied there is also a lack of a guide for doe application in the water sector hence this review aims to provide a comprehensive review of doe types and contextualized applications in the water and wastewater sector various does would be reviewed to provide insights into the selection of does for each environmental context key concepts methodology and contextualized application of various doe in the water sector would be discussed in this review 2 present reviews on doe many researchers have assessed and reviewed the application of doe for use in various contexts since there were limited reviews of doe application in the water or wastewater sector a review of doe in other similar applications was summarized in table 1 nair et al 13 reviewed the usage of ccd with rsm in water and wastewater modeling in their article contextualized use of ccd coupled with rsm analysis was applied to various fields of water and wastewater modeling weissman and anderson 6 reviewed that doe has been gaining popularity in chemical and organic applications in his review doe application was categorized based on reaction mechanisms and it was concluded that doe can be applied to various stages of operations screening optimization and modeling various reactions fukuda et al 15 and gujral et al 14 reviewed the fundamentals of doe for the pharmaceuticals industry 14 15 various factorial designs used in the doe were compared for either screening or optimization applications fukuda et al 15 found that 2 level full factorial fractionate factorial and plackett burman designs were more suitable for screening whereas 3 level full factorial central composite designs ccd and box behnken designs were more suitable for optimization fukuda et al 15 also discussed in depth the amalgamation of doe and quality by design qbd for a more holistic approach in pharmaceutical applications blondet et al 17 and yondo et al 16 summarized the use of doe in mechanical and aeronautical engineering applications in their review the use of surrogate models was suggested to be incorporated into doe for better modeling performance 16 17 tavizón pozos et al 19 and jacyna et al 18 summarized the use of factorial type doe in their respective field of metabolomic and biofuel production 18 19 jacyna et al 18 gave an overview of doe used in metabolomics related studies with a focus more on factorial designs and its variant it was recommended the use of a promising hybridized doe development called experimental design assistant eda which uses domain expertise coupled with doe for modeling in metabolomics related studies tavizón pozos et al 19 reviewed factorial designs and response surface methodology rsm used in the biofuel sector in that study they demonstrated the scope and limitation of the use of doe in biofuel production newer perspective papers have also emerged in recent years such as the use of ccd type doe for the application in catalysis formation and electrochemical application 20 21 ahmed et al 20 suggest that screening design before progressing to extensive factor effects and optimization studies is recommended macqueen et al 21 found that current methods can be coupled with machine learning as an alternative design for catalysis optimization present reviews offers some insights to the general application of doe with most reviews focused on the use of ccd coupled with rsm for model analysis other forms of does were not thoroughly explored especially in the water sector this study aims to fill that gap and provide a more comprehensive review of various doe its fundamentals analysis and applications 3 doe process and procedures for the successful application of doe in wastewater treatment a systematic workflow adapted from weissman anderson 6 is illustrated in fig 1 in the first phase the model object is defined and this involves the consideration of the water treatment process and the model function the definition of the model objective would hence determine subsequent variables like the choice of does used 22 certain does are more suitable for screening studies while certain designs are more suitable for optimization studies in the second phase the definition of variables involves careful selection of variables and proper usage of measured data within a single doe multiple types of variables can be used within a study cai et al 9 used a randomized experimental design with process variables like ph and continuous variables like fe2 and h2o2 concentration within a single study understanding the variable type is crucial to determine the suitability of certain doe that can be utilized supporting text s1 summarizes the types of variables and their suitability for certain does the next few stages involve the definition of responses based on model requirements followed by experimental design selection data collection and confirming reactions data collection and confirming of reaction involves statistical analysis of data 3 1 experimental design does could be used for various applications and categorized into screening studies optimization studies and variable interaction studies fig 2 3 1 1 factorial design full factorial designs measure response variables for every scenario and combination of factor levels the number of runs in a factorial design is denoted in eq 1 1 number of runs i n p where n denotes the variables tested i denote the number of levels studied and p denotes the number of generators no of variables that cannot be estimated independent of each other in a full factorial design p is zero and the no of runs needed is in while advantageous for separating individual effects full factorial designs can make large demands on data collection 23 most commonly only up to 3 levels are studied due to the high number of iterations needed it is generally recommended to conduct a full factorial design when the number of variables studied is small and if resources are available 22 for 4 or higher levels studied it is more ideal to use other forms of doe for more efficient modeling full factorial doe was pioneered by r a fisher in the 1930s and builds the fundamentals of other does explained further in the sections below they are presently not as popular due to the innovation of other does and the redundancy experimental runs needed 24 fractional factorial design is a variant of full factorial design and is usually used to only observe the main effects of the system 18 the reduction in the number of experiments was performed by confounding variable that has no distinguishable effects on a response together by a p factor to reduce the number of runs 25 hence it is less resource demanding compared to full factorial designs for more details on the background theory and worked example of confounding refer to the supporting text s2 the fractional design is 1 i p of the full factorial design a 25 2 fractional design is 1 4 of a two level five factor factorial design and requires only 8 runs instead of 32 none crucial variables could be confounded with interactions generated by other variables 26 employed the use of a 25 1 fractional factorial design for the optimization of biomass pretreatments in his study the 5 variables studied were ball milling time a h2so4 concentration b naoh concentration c temperature d and reaction time e interactive binary interactions like naoh temperature cxd could be formed resulting in lesser runs than a full factorial design another subset of factorial design is the plackett burman design 27 this design run number is in the multiple of four rather than nn with 8 as the starting point n 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 the key advantage of this is that it simplifies and further reduce runs by assuming negligible interactive effects between variables this doe is most suitable for screening since the resolution of the result is relatively poorer with a restricted number of levels to only 2 28 generation of the orthogonal pattern is formed using the generator shown in fig 2 based on the number of variables the number of runs and generators used would be different in each number of runs the pattern of the generator gets shifted down by 1 this is illustrated in the color coded figure with 7 variables namely a g fig 3 3 1 2 taguchi design taguchi design was created to address the high experimental counts of factorial designs particularly so for higher levels problems 29 it uses a unique orthogonal array coupled with loss functions to determine the optimized conditions many taguchi designs are based on factorial designs for example taguchi s l8 design is a standard 23 factorial design the key difference is the analysis of the results and that taguchi s design is highly fractionalized and confounded 30 31 another notable difference is that taguchi designs are based on the prior selection of the most likely interactions whereas in standard fractional factorial designs the confounding interactions are selected later on this property hence requires careful selection of design points with taguchi being conventionally performed in a minimum of 2 iterations taguchi s design makes use of latin squares for the orthogonal arrays a detailed breakdown of the latin s design and orthogonal arrays is shown in the supporting text s3 possible arrays from taguchi s design are illustrated in table 2 whereby l latin squares a number of rows b number of levels and c number of variables taguchi s design can only be used to address optimization problems where the evaluation of the experimental conditions was done using a signal to noise ratio representing the magnitude of the mean of a process compared to its variation while the number of experiments is greatly reduced it requires careful selection of variable levels in the study by cai et al 32 taguchi optimization was used to determine the optimal dosage of fenton s reagent and uv operation conditions for the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate in their study the selection of variable levels was done based on extensive background research on similar water characteristics of other reported studies however the key drawback to such a design is that it assumes that interactions between variables are confounded which in the real world context is not always true another drawback is the accuracy and lack of resolution for optimized conditions in taguchi optimization the optimized condition would only fall within the design points of the doe taguchi is not able to provide us with the true optimal value of a variable setting it merely tells us which is the best level for a variable setting from the levels chosen for experimentation this results in a poorer optimized condition compared to other forms of doe kozik et al 33 similarly reported that the lack of modeled resolution of the taguchi method resulted in the poorer optimized condition compared to central composite designs 33 3 1 3 central composite design ccd ccd designs are partial factorial designs and were reported to have lower experimental runs while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy 34 35 the key difference between a ccd design and a fractional factorial design is that modeled approximations of ccd are second degree polynomials while partial factorials are first degree polynomial approximations 36 37 ccd generally consists of 5 levels namely α 1 0 center point 1 and α composite designs have 3 variants inscribed cci circumscribed ccc and face centered ccf fig 4 knowing the differences in the 3 variants is important since certain variants have a better modeling performance selected context in cci the α design is within the set 1 limit making this unsuitable for certain variables that have a true limit in the context of environmental chemistry certain variables have true limit i e the saturated dissolved oxygen do content or solubility of a reactant at a given condition etc and modeling beyond the set design space may not be a practical approach or is limited by engineering constraints 16 in this aspect cci would be a more suitable option cci and ccc are rotatable which means the variance of a predicted response depends solely on the distance of x from the center design point this is a desirable property for modeling quadratic functions cci however has a poorer modeling performance compared to ccc due to regions of poor prediction quality like in the context of combined variables at the extremes whereas ccf design points have 3 levels and are not rotatable and hence not suitable for quadratic functions ccf also does not allow for orthogonal blocking which allows experiments to be performed in blocks that isolate the block effects from the variable effects 35 38 detailed background on the theory of blocking can be found in supporting document s4 blocking for example allows the application of doe to isolate the effects of raw materials tested i e different batches of wastewater treated or operational fluctuations within a day in the context of environmental chemistry ccf might not be suitable for the modeling of large scale continuous systems or systems that have raw material variation box behnken design bbd is a variant of ccd with only 3 levels namely 1 0 center point and 1 34 39 it is a unique design that is a hybrid of factorial designs with incomplete blocking 40 while bbd requires a lesser number of experiments bbd is also reported to have poorer modeling accuracy as compared to other experimental designs 34 rakić et al 34 reported that bbd had a lower predicted r2 value as compared to ccc or factorial designs bbd also does not include experimental runs at the extreme settings 41 3 1 4 simplex design simplex designs are unique to mixture variables and will not work with other types of variables in a general mixture problem the measured response is assumed to depend only on the proportions of the ingredients in the mixture not the amount of the mixture the response in a mixture experiment is usually described by a polynomial function the key purposes of conducting a mixture experiment are to find the best proportion of each component and the best value of each process variable to optimize single or multiple responses simplex lattice provides a better understanding of the shape of the response surface since the points are evenly spread across the whole simplex for screening purposes simplex axial and simplex centroid designs are used 15 23 extreme vertex designs are used for the cases when there are constraints on one or more variable components an example in context would be the physical limit of a material like the solubility of solutes at a given temperature an illustration of the design space of simplex systems is shown in fig 4 the simplex design uses a coordinate system for the value of each variable component x f denotes the coordinate points for the variable component eq 2 where f denotes the variables from 0 to q and m is the degree of the lattice 2 x f 0 1 m 2 m 1 the simplex lattice design is useful for a small number of components with response surfaces that need a polynomial equation of order 2 or greater for an accurate description for simplex centroid design all design points are centroid design points as illustrated in fig 4b simplex centroid design usually consists of lesser datapoints than simplex lattice design hence this is most suitable for screening applications an alternative to the simplex centroid design is the axial designs consist of design points that are not within the boundary of the simplex except for the central centroid axial designs are usually used for screening of variables where first degree models are to be fitted it has design points along the axial an imaginary line extending from the base point to the vertex fig 5 3 1 5 alternative designs optimal design like d optimal design has increasing application in various uses in water chemistry d optimal design is particularly useful when an experimental region is not regular in shape i e missing data or when it is not feasible to run the experiment under certain conditions 42 the d optimal design uses an iterative search algorithm to minimize the covariance of the parameter estimates for the specified model in place of traditional orthogonal design matrices as described earlier this was reported to reduce the total amount of experiments needed 43 44 this method is also unrestricted to the type of variable used while most doe only works with continuous variables d optimal design is also able to incorporate categorical elements as well giménez et al 45 used a d optimal design for the optimization of process variables for the photo fenton process with h2o2 concentration temperature and radiation level as the key variable studied 45 in his study 2 process variable and 1 categorical variable was used process variable h2o2 concentration and temperature categorical variable radiation level random design in the context of water related doe uses machine learning to aid doe experiments in a random doe the variables are assigned randomly within a range of values and the modeled results are analyzed using machine learning algorithms due to its flexibility in experimental design it can only be analyzed using powerful generalization tools such as artificial neural networks ann 9 the key advantage of such a design is the simplicity and the ability to work with preexisting data 46 for example the modeling performance of a water treatment plant could be modeled using ann with a random experiment design newhart et al 46 used ann and recurrent neural networks rnn modeling for the prediction of disinfection performance of peracetic acid paa 46 in his study a random experiment design was used with process variables as the input to the model however the key drawback for ann rnn coupled random design is the relatively large amount of data required as compared to other experimental designs 3 2 model analysis the model analysis utilizes different regression and statistical analysis to model results from the experimental designs as elaborated in the earlier section common model analysis methodology would be explained in the sections below 3 2 1 multi linear regression mlr multiple linear regression mlr is used for the analysis of factorial designs and their various variants mlr is a first degree polynomial approximation and models the relationship between two or more variables with that of a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data 47 it can help to determine the level of variation between the variables mlr line of y dependent variable on x independent variable is defined in the below equation eq 3 3 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b i x i where x i is the value of the ith predictor b 0 is the regression constant and b i is the coefficient of the ith predictor 3 2 2 signal to noise ratio s n analysis s n analysis is used for the evaluation of the modeled results for the taguchi design the methodology for the computation of the s n ratio is dependent on the purpose of the intended use s n ratio evaluates the signal to noise ratio where signal refers to controllable inputs and noise being uncontrollable variables into the model the ratio denotes how the response varies relative to a nominal value under different noise conditions 48 the computation of the s n ratio for the various uses is detailed in the supporting document s5 an illustration of the s n results of the taguchi design is illustrated below in fig 6 and obtained from 32 the doe design has 3 variables and 3 levels with an orthogonal design as shown in fig 6a in this context the signal denotes the removal efficiency of the system whereas the noise indicates the various operating conditions for the system i e chemical dosage ph uv intensity etc 3 2 3 responses surface methodology rsm response surface methodology rsm analysis is used for the analysis of ccd simplex designs and bbd due to the addition of a quadratic term rsm can model curvature in the response hence making this more accurate a general equation can be used to represent rsm eq 4 4 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i j β i j x i x j i 1 k β ii x i 2 where y is the response variable β 0 β i β ii are offset term linear coefficients quadratic coefficients interaction coefficients respectively x i and x j are independent variables typically the rsm uses modeling software like in statgraphics centurion xvi statgraphic usa design expert statease usa and minitab minitab usa for the analysis of the results an illustration of an rsm design by mahtab et al 49 is shown in fig 7 rsm offers a graphical approach for the optimization and understanding of variable interaction of systems and processes in this context the analysis of the results was performed by pairing two operation parameters such as time and ph fig 7b to observe the cod removal efficiency x i and x j denotes the operation parameter whereas y denotes the cod removal efficiency the modeling software was then used to determine the other variables β 0 β i β ii linear coefficients quadratic coefficients and interaction coefficients 3 2 4 artificial neural network ann ann is a powerful tool in terms of multivariate calibration and it can identify cause effect correlations through training with multiple inputs and outputs ann is also an alternative method for solving multi response problems 50 ann can be used with a variety of doe like random design central composite designs and even factorial designs 9 51 55 ann uses a series of interconnected nodes with an associated weight with the general equation as shown below eq 5 5 y f w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w i x i b where y is the output of the neuron and is a function f of x i is the input of the neuron w i is the associated weight and b is the bias the illustration of the output of the neuron is shown in the supporting text s6 the ann model uses algorithms to calibrate the weights of the nodes in the model a detailed breakdown of the calibration methodology is shown in supporting documents s7 an illustration of an ann design by cai et al 9 is shown in fig 8 in this context the modeling of toc removal was done using 4 control variables ph h2o2 fe2 and hydraulic retention time hrt similar to rsm ann is also able to graphically demonstrate the optimization and understanding of variable interaction of systems and processes the key difference between ann and rsm is the methodology ann uses a non distinctive arbitrary equation for the fitting of the model whereas rsm uses a quadratic function for the fitting of the model 56 57 4 up to date application of doe 4 1 application of factorial design in environmental chemistry the detailed information of factorial based design is summarized in table 3 most factorial studies are used to model adsorption processes biosorption processes synthesis of materials and process optimization of newer advanced oxidation processes the use of full factorial design ffd studies in the environmental field is relatively limited this was reportedly due to more experimental data required for modeling 59 however the advantage of such a design is that it accounts for all variable interactions 60 even without the use of a screening step hence ffd would be more suitable for complex relationships with unknown interactions 58 morshed et al 60 optimized the operation parameters of the heterogeneous fenton like mechanism of a newly developed fibrous catalyst for organic degradation shokri 11 studied the use of ffd to optimize the sono photo fenton process a complex system with a high degree of accuracy with a reported r2 value of 0 9884 for modeling the reduction of cod regti et al 58 and saleh et al 59 studied the adsorption process of complex solutions with known competitive reactions like blended dyes and synthetic compounds however the key disadvantage to ffd is the number of experiments ran and as such lesser variables have to be studied to limit the total number of experiments needed 66 woll and burkhard 66 found that a 7 variables design experiment required 729 experiments compared to only 9 experiments needed for a taguchi l8 27 design fractional factorial designs only observe the main effect of the variables and hence reduce the amount of data needed this method was reviewed to be mostly used in the optimization of adsorption processes with a high degree of accuracy and an r2 value of more than 0 80 61 63 65 elayadi et al 62 however reported a slightly lower r2 value of 0 75 in some instances variable noise might impact the model accuracy 67 to further enhance factorial design s model accuracy it is recommended to either perform a screening step or perform a certain variable sensitivity analysis for better model accuracy 67 4 2 application of taguchi design in environmental chemistry taguchi was used in the various context of environmental engineering from chemical process optimization 32 33 68 69 to physical process optimization 70 and even synthesis optimization of new materials 71 a list of recent publication of taguchi doe is summarised in table 4 taguchi does generally have much lower experiment runs as compared to other does kozik et al 33 reported that taguchi required only 12 experimental runs as compared to ccd which required 48 runs due to its low number of experimental runs it is an effective screening tool for process comparison cai et al 32 used taguchi optimization as a screening tool for different advanced oxidation processes aops pretreatment for reverse osmosis concentrate roc taguchi optimization can sometimes yield different optimized conditions depending on the optimization response 71 pander et al 71 reported that optimized conditions for annealing time hydrogen flowrate and argon flowrate is different when the target objective is for catalyst roughness compared to catalyst size this is also similarly reported by kaya et al 68 where the reported optimized condition for ozonation is different for cod removal dfz removal and uv254 removal 68 another study by younis et al 72 also reported that the adsorption capacity and partition coefficient for the three microbeads were different another shortfall of taguchi optimization is the inability to combine isolated effects of input parameters since taguchi optimization assumes that variables are all confounded hence ongoing research is done to further improve the application of taguchi doe for multi response optimization in the water domain a newer form of taguchi grey analysis was reported to convert a multiple response optimization problem into a single response one 69 grey s analysis is also used to explore the complicated relationships among input parameters 73 it uses a coefficient that presents the ratio between the desired values and the measured experimental response data then a weighted sum takes into account the grey relational coefficient corresponding to each process response and their corresponding weights 50 4 3 application of central composite design ccd doe in environmental chemistry central composite design ccd has been utilized for various applications of environmental chemistry such as process optimization modeling complex reactions like adsorption and also giving insights into variable interactions table 5 most researchers have applied ccd for the optimization and modeling of chemical processes such as the fenton process 49 75 electro fenton processes 77 81 82 sono photo processes 76 80 and ozonation process 83 other researchers also applied doe to biological and physical processes like membrane processes 55 adsorption processes 33 51 54 coagulation processes 74 79 and biological processes 77 78 most modeling techniques have good prediction performance compared to experimental results with reported r2 values 0 8 through the use of ccd the variable interactions were observed to have better insights into the overall system understanding 49 80 azizpour and qaderi 80 reported that uv source power had the most significant effect and that the flow rate had the least significant effect on the removal efficiency of photocatalytic processes whereas mahtab et al 49 reported that ph played the most significant impact on the cod removal efficiency of the fenton process various researchers have used the results from doe as a good cost estimate for processes 77 79 varank et al 79 computed the estimated operating costs for electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes at optimized conditions amounting to 6 4 m3 and 6 8 m3 respectively whereas bustillo lecompte et al 114 computed the cost of operation of the system at the optimized condition was computed to be 0 12 m3 traditionally ccd processes are analyzed using rsm techniques however alternative techniques like ann and ga were explored for the analysis of results from ccd 51 55 84 increasingly machine learning and artificial intelligence are gaining popularity in the water sector 85 ann was reported to show a better prediction accuracy compared to the rsm model 52 84 ann model uses a non standard parametric equation whereas rsm analysis is conventionally done using the quadratic function 56 however some researchers reported that rsm performance showed better accuracy than ann 51 ahmadi et al 51 reported that rsm performed marginally better than ann with r2 values of 0 9970 and 0 9919 respectively this is likely due to the overcomplication of design resulting in larger errors more studies on this aspect could be done to have a more comprehensive performance evaluation between the two modeling tools 4 4 application of box behnken design bbd in environmental chemistry bbd is a variant of ccd with generally fewer experiments needed as summarized in table 6 bbd has been used to model and optimize various advanced oxidation processes and modeling of adsorption studies gilpavas et al 39 utilized bbd for the modeling and optimization of various processes for the degradation of textile wastewater bbd was used to reduce the number of experiments needed such that a comparison of different advanced oxidation processes could be made it was found that ec with the photo fenton process produces the highest degradation performance of 76 100 and 78 for cod removal color removal and toc removal respectively whereas moradi et al 89 utilized bbd for the modeling of the removal of acid yellow 36 ay36 for the photoelectron fenton process pef in his study a total of 29 experiments was run thirugnanasambandham et al 87 also successfully deployed bbd for the modeling of the electrochemical process with a high degree of accuracy and high r2 of 0 9856 and r2 of 0 9956 for cod and color removal respectively bbd was able to show the interactive effects of process variables 86 tak et al 86 studied the performance of the electrocoagulation process for livestock wastewater in his study interactive effects of the process variables were observed with ph current density electrolysis time and nacl concentration similarly chaker et al 88 reported that anova analysis of the results from bbd optimization showed the mass of catalyst was the most significant variable for the optimization of the tio2 photocatalyst bbd is conventionally visualized and modeled using rsm however in recent years there has been ongoing research to couple bbd with neural networks for the modeling and optimization of processes 90 91 ezemagu et al 90 optimized the operation condition for the coagulation process for the removal of turbidity they utilized rsm and ann to compare the results of two different model fitting in their study they found that ann was more accurate with a smaller pre percentage relative error and aad absolute average deviation of 0 0241 and 0 0139 respectively whereas sivamani et al 91 optimized the reaction conditions for the adsorption of copper with orange zest biochar using a forward back propagation neural network ffbpnn these alternate forms of modeling showed a high degree of accuracy with r2 greater than 0 9 4 5 application of simplex design in environmental chemistry the simplex design has been employed in a variety of contexts in environmental chemistry on the optimization of compositions of catalyst and biofuel precursors the simplex design has limited applications as it can only work for mixture variables 92 for certain environmental chemistry contexts such as composition optimization simplex design is proven to be fairly effective it was also reported to yield similar results compared to regression analysis with lesser experimental runs 93 simplex design can optimize objectives that are opposable arias madrid et al 94 employed the use of simplex centroid mixture design optimization with two opposing objective functions maximal asphaltene adsorption and minimal activation energy for nanocatalyst adsorption similarly dias et al 95 used a simplex centroid mixture design for 2 opposing responses to maximize mac as while minimizing rc as simplex designs can also be used for the optimization of the composition of constituents used in oil production and pyrolysis 96 97 while the simplex design is generally used for the optimization of the adsorption process a newer application of simplex design has been proposed innovative use of simplex design includes greenhouse gas accounting 98 extraction of phenolic compounds for antioxidant and antibacterial applications 99 concrete mix proportioning 100 and solid waste management 101 further studies could be done on the application of simplex designs for solving problems in the field of environmental chemistry table 7 5 discussion and potential application the selection of doe experiment designs and model analysis is often unclear and difficult in the water sector the advantages and disadvantages of each doe would be listed down as a guide for doe selection in the context of water chemistry it shall be noted that this will only serve as a guide for practitioners to effectively select suitable doe for each context based on table 8 the selection of doe would be dependent on the main context of the model for models of provided datasets an alternative design would be most appropriate whereas for linear responses and non quadratic responses factorial designs would be more suitable 115 in most water and wastewater problems quadratic responses are generally better fits as such factorial designs may not be as suitable taguchi designs use a signal noise response and can be used for most applications however some assumptions are to be taken note of taguchi generally uses fewer experiments and this results in variables being highly confounded and hence potential for larger errors variables condition in taguchi is also selected either by prior knowledge or prior screening studies taguchi uses s n ratio to determine the optimized condition this optimized condition is relative to other pre selected conditions resulting in difficulty to observe true optimized values this is especially so when the true optimal values falls outside the variable condition hence for reliable optimisation using taguchi the selection of variable condition is crucial through screening iterations or prior knowledge ccd uses can be applied in most context since its variables are not determined beforehand unlike that of taguchi method while ccd can be used in most context the number of variables explored are generally below 4 due to a larger number of experiments as the number of variable increases in such instance it may be more useful to consider other forms of doe with lesser computational requirements the computation of the number of experiments for each doe is summarized in the supporting document s8 bbd is a modification of ccd and does not examine borderline regions and hence require fewer experiments however it comes at an opportunity cost with a lower number of degrees of freedom compared with ccd 20 cci and ccc have higher experiments than ccf and bbd for example in a 3 variable problem bbd would require 17 runs compared to 20 runs for ccc beyond 3 variable the number of runs of bbd would far exceed ccc careful selection of doe is hence needed to produce modeled results with a high degree of accuracy coupled with the least experiment data often there is a trade off between the accuracy of the modeling results and the number of experiments required conventionally the analysis of factorial designs and ccd uses multi linear regression and quadratic functions respectively the key shortfall is the need to fit models to a certain regression type alternative analysis like ann has increasingly been used in recent years to analyze such models and hence addressing the model fitting issue for mixture design problems a simplex design would be most appropriate it is also noted that for such problems it is possible to utilise other does like taguchi ccd and factorial design the key advantage of simplex design over other designs is that it accounts for the dependency of individual variables and the consideration for the overall mixture component an illustration in this water sector is the optimisation of components of a catalyst the output of the simplex is a ratio blend of individual components of the catalyst whereas other methods optimize the absolute amount of components in a catalyst and hence negating the proportion dependency process variables could be blended with a mixture design to study both the proportion effect as well as the absolute amount 6 conclusion this review provided a timely overview of doe for use in the environmental chemistry context key concepts and doe methodology were discussed in this article with emphasis on the experimental design types and model analysis doe involves multiple steps objective definition variable definition response definition selection of doe data collection and modeling analysis in this review the key fundamentals of each design are well explained with visual applied examples for practitioners to understand examples were given to illustrate the current application of doe in the environmental chemistry context in this review the advantages and disadvantages were also discussed to give insights into the selection of does and their implications it was found that the most common doe used is ccd coupled with rsm as discussed earlier moving forward other types of doe design can be explored as well doe can also be applied in other fields of environmental engineering such as stormwater runoff treatment e g in the form of optimizing bioretention soil mix and microplastics treatment e g optimizing experimental conditions as the water sector progresses along with the digital transformation across every industry machine learning that deals with large volume and varieties of data have taken prominence increasingly there has been a trend to blend doe with machine learning to form newer alternative designs this aspect has strong development potential due to the strong generalization ability of machine learning traditional analysis of doe using rsm multi linear analysis has shortfalls addressed earlier ann a form of machine learning showed promising application in this aspect further explorations to other forms of machine learning can also be explored machine learning can also be used to address issues such as missing data and data munging etc

12999,ink wastewater is hazardous because it contains oil and refractory pollutants with high chroma and turbidity there are many aromatic compounds in the wastewater such as benzene toluene xylene and phthalocyanines azos and nitroso which make high chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen content the refractory pollutants are always encapsulated in diverse oil water systems usually a massive degreaser has to be used to destroy the dispersant oil forms under preferred alkaline condition and advanced oxidation is used for good removal of refractory pollutants under preferred acid condition which commonly lead to a bad coagulation and sedimentation as a result in this study the nano fe3o4 mnps activated sodium persulfate sps has been testified to enhance degrease with efficient coagulation and sedimentation the results showed that the removal of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma and turbidity reached respectively 96 40 98 35 88 00 99 70 and 98 22 within 40 50 min the mechanism shows that the catalytic oxidation significantly decreased the zeta potential of the colloidal particles in the wastewater which destroyed the steady state of the colloid and enhanced the effect of

emulsified oil and dissolved oil will form complex structures with water such as water in oil oil in water in oil which wrap contaminants and then widely disperse in wastewater to limit the mass transfer and reduce the removal ratio 10 11 oils form a film on the outside maintaining the high zeta potential and hindering the mutual contact of the colloidal particles 12 the composition of oils is complex including more than 150 toxic substances including naphthalene pyrene phenanthrene anthracene which can cause persistent damage to environmental microbes involved in the nitrogen and carbon cycles through long term accumulation 13 resulting in serious water pollution if discharged into the aquatic environment 14 macromolecular oils will occupy the adsorption sites of colloidal particles thereby weakening polymer coagulants adsorption bridging effect 15 previous studies mainly used surfactants or alkalis and other chemical agents to demulsify and remove the oil before biochemical treatment and electrochemical method 16 coagulation sedimentation 17 ultrafiltration membrane 18 biochemical treatment 19 redox method 20 and multi method coupling treatment are usually used 3 21 due to the poor biodegradability of oil oil coagulation sedimentation is commonly used to reduce chroma cod and other pollutants in practice nevertheless demulsification and degreasing treatment are always applied before coagulation sedimentation usually the subsequent coagulation sedimentation is not very effective because of emulsified oil and dissolved oil resulting in a limited removal of organic pollutants the alkaline degreaser is commonly chosen and introduced with surfactant 22 23 to destroy the oil water structure and penetrate and dissolve the oil wrapped on the particles into the solution system simultaneously 24 25 however the residual surfactant and alkalinity after degreasing are not conducive to the destabilization of colloidal particles and consequently reduce coagulation sedimentation 26 moreover most oxidation activity like potassium permanganate will not be efficient in the alkaline condition of ink wastewater 27 as a kind of typical persulfate the sodium persulfate na2s2o8 sps has a higher redox potential than mno4 compared to hydrogen standard electrodes s2o8 2 e0 2 01 v mno4 e0 1 68 v there have been many successful cases in removing organic pollutants 28 29 and sodium persulfate also has strong oxidation activity under neutral and alkaline conditions in addition the s2o8 2 in sodium persulfate can be activated under thermal radiation photocatalysis ultrasound strong alkaline conditions transition metal ions 30 activated carbon 31 to be converted to so 4 so 4 is less affected by ph when it interacts with organic pollutants 32 moreover so 4 can be induced and converted to ho and further to efficiently degrade long chain hydrocarbon organics including micro oils pigments dispersants and azo and aromatic refractory organic pollutants in solution with different ph values meanwhile as a kind of inorganic oxidant sodium persulfate also breaks the stable state of colloid particles and digests residual surfactant 33 which reduces the unfavourable effect on coagulation sedimentation fe3o4 is a typical soft magnetic metal oxide which is often used as magnetic nanoparticles or magnetic carrier of synthetic magnetic nanoparticles 34 for the removal of pollutants in wastewater existing studies have shown that the amino rich magnetic nanoparticles constructed by modifying the amino functional groups of the adsorbent materials containing fe3o4 can improve the adsorption and removal of organic pollutants heavy metals and dyes in wastewater 35 furthermore the synthesis with other nanomaterials such as zinc oxide carbon nanotubes 36 37 are well studied in order to improve the recovery of nanoparticles even used to synthesize magnetic polystyrene and other magnetic polymer adsorption materials 38 moreover nano fe3o4 mnps is a type of heterogeneous catalytic oxidations which activates sps in the crystal structure producing so 4 at neutral and normal temperature 39 in the current study sps mnps were introduced to weak the effect of micro oil on coagulation sedimentation and realize the efficient removal of the oil and organic pollutants in the oily ink wastewater the effect of followed coagulation sedimentation was furtherly testified furthermore an improvement mechanism was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for new compound degreaser the oily ink wastewater was collected from the cleaning process of the printing equipment in a packaging and printing factory the properties of the wastewater were measured after the heavier solid residues were removed by preliminary sedimentation table 1 the new degreaser was prepared by our lab with alkaline substances and surfactants nano fe3o4 mnps 97 purity ethanol tert butanol analytical purity and dmpo 97 purity were all purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd sodium persulfate sps 99 purity was purchased from kangzhen chemical technology co ltd poly aluminium chloride pac polyacrylamide pam industrial purity were purchased from fulinyuan water treatment agent co ltd 2 2 new compound degreaser treatment on oily ink wastewater the ph of the initial wastewater treated is slightly alkaline and the main ingredient of the new degreaser is alkaline matters with a small amount of surfactant which are not sensitive to ph the single factor test was set up to optimize the dosage of degreaser volume ratio and processing time on the cod and oil removal the dosage was increased from 0 to 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the removal ratio was determined for processing time of 0 20 min the effect of the degreasing time under the appropriate dosage was obtained by evaluating the removal ratio and the effluent parameters after coagulation sedimentation 2 3 sodium persulfate sps treatment sps can be effective to oxidize and degrade pollutants under neutral and alkaline conditions the concentration of s2o8 2 directly determines the oxidation removal effect of pollutants exorbitant sps concentration may lead to consequent destabilization and coagulation of colloid in the wastewater 40 41 causing the excessive addition of inorganic salt reducing the oxidation effect of sps therefore the suitable sps dosage and processing time was investigated based on the overall treatment efficiency the concentration gradient mm of sps was firstly set in the experiment as 0 00 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 and 30 min processing time was selected and then the processing time gradient was further optimized as 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 min to achieve the best processing time on the overall effect of oily ink wastewater 2 4 mnps sps catalytic oxidation the mnps activated sps reaction belongs to the transition metal activated persulfate system a kind of heterogeneous activation reaction the addition of fe3o4 can introduce fe ii into the system to activate sps generating more so 4 through increasing the reactive sites per unit volume of the reaction system thereby improving the removal efficiency of pollutants this stable and efficient 42 system can generally produce so 4 under acidic and neutral conditions at room temperature a kind of free radical with strong oxidation activity and can be converted to ho under strongly alkaline conditions 43 nevertheless the oxidizing capacity and efficiency of the activation system are easily affected by various factors such as the compound concentration ph and processing time especially when fe2 is excessive so 4 will be converted intoso 4 2 under strongly alkaline conditions it will be converted into ho and in the case of excessive na2s2o8 the probability of mutual quenching of so 4 will increase significantly 44 45 so when using this catalytic oxidation system to treat wastewater it cannot be ignored to test the influence of compound concentration ph and processing time the probable main chemical reactions eqs 1 4 in sps activated by mnps were summarized 1 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 s o 4 so 4 2 2 fe 2 s o 4 fe 3 so 4 2 3 s o 4 oh so 4 2 ho 4 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 different gradient of dosage mm were set as 0 00 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 0 60 and the processing time min was set as 0 5 10 15 20 min the mnps sps catalytic oxidation system was arranged between degreasing and coagulation sedimentation to reduce the adverse effects of micro oil the ph of the solution should be regulated before the oxidation process to enhance the performance of the catalytic oxidation system the ph gradient in the oxidation process was set as 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 8 0 8 5 to test the impact of ph on the oxidation process the ph was regulated with dilute sulphuric acid to avoid the negative influence of cl to radicals 46 and inhibit the reaction between so 4 and fe 2 eq 2 2 5 the integrated treatment process the technical route fig 1 concludes the degreasing process advanced oxidation process and coagulation sedimentation process degreasing stage the new degreaser with a volume fraction of 1 0 1 5 was added and then was stirred at 100 r min for 5 10 min finally precipitated for 5 10 min mnps sps advanced oxidation stage the ph of the degreased wastewater was adjusted to 7 5 8 0 and then added 0 3 0 4 mm sps and 0 4 0 5 mm mnps the solution was stirred at 150 200 r min for 5 10 min and finally precipitated for 10 min coagulation sedimentation stage the ph of the wastewater after oxidation was regulated to 6 0 7 0 and then 500 600 mg l pac was added and stirred for 3 min at 250 r min the addition of 1 25 1 50 mg l pam was followed and stirred for 10 min at 50 r min and finally precipitated statically for 15 20 min after three stages the treatment was pumped into a filter column containing activated carbon ac and quartz sand for secondary treatment 2 6 detection methods the infrared oil detector mi 900 tianjin zhongke chuangpu technology co ltd china was used to perform a full scan to obtain the total oil content 47 the specific method of first destabilizing and then extracting was shown in s 1 to achieve a good extraction and accurate oil content the chroma of wastewater was determined by the dilution method 48 cod was determined by the digestion apparatus drb200 hach company usa ammonia nitrogen was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometric method 49 50 for measuring turbidity take the mixed water sample dilute it 100 times and use the turbidity meter xz 0101 shanghai haiheng electromechanical instrument co ltd china to measure the turbidity zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zsp malvern instruments co ltd uk was used to measure the zeta potential of colloidal particles 51 the electron spin resonance spectrometer epr jes x320 jeol co ltd japan was used to detect and analyze the free radicals in the reaction process tem hf 3300 hitachi japan sem thermo apreo sem thermo scientific usa xrd x pert pro panalytical netherland xps escalab250xi thermofisher scientific usa ftir atr nicolet in10mx thermofisher scientific usa vsm squid vsm quantum design usa were used to test and analyze the apparent morphology crystal phase structure functional group composition element valence state and magnetic properties of mnps and precipitated phase 2 7 analysis methods 2 7 1 removal ratio calculation the removal ratio was calculated with the equation shown in eq 5 5 r x 1 0 v c f dv c o v where r x was the removal ratio of parameters including oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma and turbidity c o mg l ntu multiple was the initial value of the parameters c f mg l ntu multiple was the final value of the parameters v ml was the hydraulic loading of treatment stages the evaluation of related parameters referred to the chinese national standard for related sewage disposal 52 2 7 2 analysis of active intermediates so 4 and ho can quickly undergo hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer reactions with ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba in which they extract hydrogen atoms from hydroxyl and convert to h2o and so 4 2 so ethanol and tert butanol commonly were used as quenchers of free radicals in the intervention experiment excessive ethanol and tert butanol were added to quench free radicals in the advanced oxidation stage and then the cod removal ratio ammonia nitrogen removal ratio and chroma removal ratio of the effluent in the oxidation stage were measured to evaluate the inhibition of the quenching intervention a contrast experiment was also designed including three groups blank advanced oxidation group ad ox ethanol intervention group etoh and tert butanol intervention group tba 2 7 3 free radical species identification and intensity determination to identify the free radicals accurately and determine the activity of free radicals a contrast experiment was set using the electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr method three treatment groups were set the blank ck was sps solution n1 was sps pdw solution pdw pre degreased wastewater n2 was sps mnps solution n3 was sps mnps pdw solution in which the solvents are all deionized water the dmpo was used to capture the free radicals to determine the concentration of radicals with a stable state due to the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin of so 4 ho and the orbital spin of the n atom in dmpo the characteristic signals of dmpo so 4 sextet 1 1 1 1 1 1 and dmpo ho quartet 1 2 2 1 53 can be detected where the hyperfine structure coupling constant of the dmpo ho adduct is αn 1 49 mt αh 1 49 mt and g value 2 0055 54 the hyperfine structure coupling constant of the dmpo so 4 adduct is αn 1 38 mt αh 1 02 mt αh 0 14 mt αh 0 08 mt 55 which helped us identify these two radicals from the spectral lines obtained the activity of radicals was analyzed through the comparison of the intensity of the peaks 2 7 4 statistics analysis the research was measured in parallel three times and the average values with standard deviations were calculated data statistics and analysis software of origin 2017 originlab corporation usa and spss 21 0 ibm corporation usa were used for data statistics mapping and analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 the optimization for the new degreaser application when the dosage volume ratio was 1 0 10 ml l the removal ratios of oil and cod reached the maximum 72 00 2 31 of oil and 71 98 2 50 of cod respectively and the optimal processing time was 5 10 min fig 2a and b the removal ratio in blank groups both ratcheted up gradually in 0 15 min then declined slowly the decrease in treatment efficiency was caused by the hydraulic shear on the oil and colloids and the increased dissolved oxygen in the wastewater an excessive stirring can lead to the re aggregation of colloidal micelles and excessive emulsification 56 when the dosage was 2 0 the removal ratio declined with the extension of processing time this phenomenon was mainly caused by excessive degreaser with surfactant and alkaline the rapid increase of ph enhanced the stability of colloids and the excessive alkaline substance led to severe saponification and emulsification to shorten the overall processing time 5 min was taken as the optimal degreasing time the trend of removal ratios of ammonia nitrogen chroma turbidity was similar within 5 min fig 2d the optimal dosage of degreaser was 1 0 10 ml l when the ratios were 71 99 oil 71 14 cod 66 69 ammonia 76 19 chroma 76 67 turbidity compared with the treatment effect of the pure coagulation sedimentation with pac and pam fig s2 settling time on coagulation sedimentation was studied in detail compared to direct pac and pam coagulation sedimentation the new degreaser improved the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma turbidity respectively by 40 43 44 53 50 67 26 46 32 71 however removing oil and chroma was still much room to improve to meet high emission requirements 3 2 mnps activated sps treatment for oily ink wastewater the structural characteristics crystal phase and functional groups of nano fe3o4 used in the study were tested and analyzed tem images showed that mnps had uniform dispersive grain size and a certain degree of agglomeration fig s3 xrd spectra fig s4a and ftir atr spectra fig s4b showed that the main components of mnps were fe3o4 where the iron content in transition valence state was noticeable and there were little impurities and unrelated characteristic functional groups meanwhile vsm test results showed that mnps had good magnetic hysteresis with magnetic storage function its saturation magnetic intensity was 88 75 emu g fig s5a and keep stable in the range of 0 to 300 c fig s5b the introduction of the sps oxidation process into coagulation sedimentation coupled with a new degreaser to treat the oily ink wastewater efficiently improved overall treatment efficiencies fig 3a and b with the increase of the sps concentration the removal increased within the dosage of 0 0 2 mm and then reached the maximum at 0 3 0 4 mm when the removal ratios were 86 12 oil 79 29 cod 66 93 ammonia 83 81 chroma 81 76 turbidity but declined quickly when over 0 4 mm fig 3a the excessive persulfate ions broke the stable state of colloidal particles and the possible radicals interacted to be self cleaned when it was excess the removal ratios of cod and ammonia nitrogen declined slowly when sps were excess owing to the structure of pollutants combined with colloidal particles which slowed down the oxidation reactions to sum up sps was successfully used to oxidize the pollutants in the oily ink wastewater alone to further improve the oxidation effect to degrade pollutants the mnps was introduced to achieve an overall treatment increase the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia chroma and turbidity were 96 4 98 35 88 00 99 70 and 98 22 when the ph was 8 0 and the dosage of mnps was 0 5 mm fig 3e importantly it was found that the sps mnps system performed stronger oxidation activity under weakly alkaline conditions when the concentration of mnps was 0 5 mm the removal ratios increased almost 12 fig 3c compared with the system with only sps the degreaser coupled with the coagulation sedimentation method achieved the removal ratio of oil 93 04 the cod 95 81 the ammonia 85 46 the chroma 97 13 and the turbidity 95 69 the xps spectra of fe 2p in mnps and sediments treated by mnps sps fig s6 showed the obvious changes of the valence state of fe 2p and the transition between fe2 and fe3 indicating that mnps was involved in the activation oxidation process of sps with the increase of mnps concentration the removal ratios first went up and then declined within 0 6 mm and the removal ratios of parameters except for oil content all increased rapidly within 0 3 0 5 mm when over 0 5 mm they declined quickly because of the adverse impact of excessive fe2 the excessive fe2 converted so4 to so4 2 eq 2 to reduce the oxidation activity 57 however the removal of oil was changed little the oxidation processing time was shortened by almost 10 min fig 3d after adding mnps with the extension of processing time oil removal gradually increased and then reached an unstable balance state in comparison the removal ratio of others declined after oxidizing for 10 15 min because of the self cleaning of radicals in the activated oxidation system 44 45 the influence of ph on the overall treatment efficiency had been tested fig 3e the removal increased within ph 6 0 8 0 gradually and then plunged when the ph was over 8 0 therefore the optimal ph was around 8 0 the chroma and oil in the effluent of the overall treatment reached the discharge standard but cod ammonia nitrogen turbidity were very close up to the standard table 2 so the adsorption filter device filled with activated carbon and quartz sand was added after coagulation sedimentation as a secondary treatment to ensure the final effluent could be discharged or be reused 4 mechanism analysis 4 1 zeta potential analysis the stability of colloidal particles is closely related to zeta potential which also determines the colloidal particle s surface polarity and particle size in the present study of the impact of degreaser dosage on the stability of colloidal particles zeta potential declined first before 1 0 and then increased fig 4a the degreaser solubilized the oil film enfolding the colloids reducing the surface polarity and zeta potential the surface charge and hydrophobic groups increased because of the excessive alkalinity and surfactant so that the stability of colloidal particles became stronger which was similar to a previous study of oily wastewater treatment 58 the mild degreaser could reduce the zeta potential of colloids by removing the oil film enfolding colloidal particles to break the stable state the data showed the zeta potential declined from 18 27 mv to 8 72 mv after degreased fig 4a compared the zeta potential data of colloidal particles in different treatment stages fig 4b the zeta potential decreased significantly after introduced sps mnps oxidation which was 2 32 mv lower than the original the degreased and sps oxidized by 15 95 mv 6 40 mv 4 17 mv respectively 4 2 so 4 and ho cooperative oxidation enhanced the degradation of micro oil and organic pollutants the catalytic oxidation system had generated active intermediates with the strong oxidizing property after introducing the sps mnps system the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma turbidity increased by 33 89 38 25 31 96 30 85 28 11 combined with the treatment process without sps mnps system fig 5 table s2 the treatment efficiency was better than the treatment just with sps oxidized the striking difference indicated the coexistence of so 4 and ho under the weakly alkaline condition similar to the study of photocatalytic persulfate producing so 4 and ho under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions to degrade organic pollutants 59 the data obtained from the intervention experiment showed that the removal ratios of cod ammonia nitrogen chroma was inhibited by 72 30 67 52 and 63 90 after quenching with etoh while the inhibition effects of tert butanol were 36 82 32 71 and 31 55 respectively fig 6 table s3 meanwhile referring to relevant studies of using so 4 and ho to degrade organic pollutants such as aniline 60 p nitro aniline 42 61 methyl orange 62 methyl tert butyl ether 63 the degradation performance is mainly attributed to the radicals attacks on azo bonds or ch bonds in the pollutants by abstracting hydrogen atoms and transferring electrons thereby generating intermediates further oxidizing and hydrolyzing similarly there were masses of cyclic organics in the oily ink wastewater such as phthalocyanines azos aromatic hydrocarbons and other refractory pollutants even a large number of long chain hydrocarbon organics further evidence from fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir atr test showed the structural changes of organic pollutants in sediments before and after introducing mnps sps fig 7 in which the unsaturated bond content of ch out of plane bending vibration type rch chr 665 730 cm 1 decreased obviously the contents of functional groups of alcohol phenol oh stretching vibration 3200 3550 cm 1 3584 3700 cm 1 decreased significantly and the co co functional groups 1300 1500 cm 1 1600 1900 cm 1 of the stretching vibrations of ketone aldehydes esters and aromatics were significantly reduced therefore the analysis indicated the reinforcing mechanism involved in micro oil conversion 64 when the sps mnps are into the system 4 3 the positive roles of weak alkaline system and adsorption of particulate matter as we all know the fe ii activated persulfate system can generate so 4 65 66 under acidic and neutral conditions and so 4 could be converted to ho when reacted with oh under alkaline condition eq 3 63 67 the oxidizing ability of ho is weaker than so 4 under neutral and alkaline conditions in these experimental results the treatment efficiency was still good under weakly alkaline conditions of ph 7 5 8 0 compared to that in acidic conditions fig 3e 4 3 1 weak alkaline conditions created a suitable reaction contact environment the experimental results showed that the variation of the zeta potential with the increase of ph appeared approximately linear in the oxidation system fig 4c when ph was 7 5 8 0 the zeta potential was higher than the acidic conditions the instability and aggregation of colloids were inhibited and would maintain a smaller particle size 68 under acidic conditions colloidal particles zeta potential and surface polarity were lower than the neutral or alkaline conditions and colloidal particles were easy to destabilize and aggregate 69 however the interaction areas and sites between radicals and pollutants will decrease leading to lower oxidation efficiency in sps mnps system so the weak alkaline condition provided a more suitable reaction contact environment for the oxidation reaction 4 3 2 the promoted radicals conversion under weak alkaline conditions ph 7 5 8 0 both so 4 and ho existed as the main active species the optimal treatment condition appeared at ph 8 0 which showed that the cooperative oxidation capacity of so 4 and ho under weak alkaline conditions was stronger than that of so 4 under weak acid conditions however the fe ii activated sps system generates plenty of hydroxyl radicals under strongly alkaline conditions ph 9 0 microwave radiation ultraviolet radiation and other conditions a hypothesis was proposed that the co existing of colloidal particles and mnps promoted so 4 and ho and the activation of mnps enhanced the conversion of so 4 to oh when more colloidal particles existed at weak alkaline as a result more cod removal was further achieved by ho with so 4 in the epr detection almost no radicals in ck fig 8 there were weak peaks of the adducts of dmpo so 4 in n1 but no dmpo ho adducts peak was detected indicating a small amount of organic substance that could activate sps in degreased wastewater it was referred to be phenolic hydroxyl group oxides 70 the spectrum of n2 presented an obvious high intensity of dmpo so 4 adducts sextet and contained a low intensity of dmpo ho adducts quartet it hinted that the adsorption and activation of mnps contributed to the conversion conditions of so 4 to ho promoting ho to generate in surface catalytic zones whereas in the spectrum of n3 it could be found that the intensity of dmpo so 4 adducts sextet became weaker while the quartet intensity of dmpo ho increased which indicated that adding of colloidal particles promoted the conversion of so 4 to ho the integrated colloidal particles mnps and sps mnps generate more ho under weak alkaline conditions sem images of sediments treated by sps mnps directly showed loose pores fig 9a of colloidal particles and enrichment of mnps fig 9b in the reaction the possible mechanism diagram was given in fig 10 5 conclusion new technology for efficient treatment of oily ink wastewater was developed in which the sps mnps advanced oxidation system was introduced to assist new degreaser coupled coagulation sedimentation the sps mnps system degraded micro oils and organic pollutants through generating so 4 to ho thereby improving the zeta potential of colloidal particles to promote coagulation sedimentation efficiency compared with the treatment process without introducing the sps mnps the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma and turbidity increased by 33 89 38 25 31 96 30 85 and 28 11 respectively the technology and mechanism proposed a new joint treatment strategy for treating

12999,ink wastewater is hazardous because it contains oil and refractory pollutants with high chroma and turbidity there are many aromatic compounds in the wastewater such as benzene toluene xylene and phthalocyanines azos and nitroso which make high chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen content the refractory pollutants are always encapsulated in diverse oil water systems usually a massive degreaser has to be used to destroy the dispersant oil forms under preferred alkaline condition and advanced oxidation is used for good removal of refractory pollutants under preferred acid condition which commonly lead to a bad coagulation and sedimentation as a result in this study the nano fe3o4 mnps activated sodium persulfate sps has been testified to enhance degrease with efficient coagulation and sedimentation the results showed that the removal of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma and turbidity reached respectively 96 40 98 35 88 00 99 70 and 98 22 within 40 50 min the mechanism shows that the catalytic oxidation significantly decreased the zeta potential of the colloidal particles in the wastewater which destroyed the steady state of the colloid and enhanced the effect of coagulation sedimentation importantly the combination of mnps and colloidal particles successfully promoted the simultaneous production of so 4 and a large amount of ho under weakly alkaline ph 7 5 8 0 conditions which made synergistic oxidation to remove micro oil and organic pollution efficiently graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oily ink wastewater sodium persulfate advanced oxidation coagulation sedimentation 1 introduction as a kind of difficult to treat ink wastewater oily ink wastewater contains lots of cyclic organic pigments such as phthalocyanines azos and nitroso 1 and masses of aromatic hydrocarbon organic dispersants such as benzene toluene xylene 2 which result in wastewater with high cod ammonia nitrogen content poor biodegradability b c 0 2 0 4 3 meanwhile these toxic compounds are difficult to degrade 4 6 the organic pigments and dispersers in this type of wastewater generally exist in granular and colloidal forms 7 which make the chroma and turbidity very high and the chroma measured by the general dilution method can reach 300 500 times 8 the mineral oil and plant oil make organic pollutants in the wastewater difficult to remove 9 emulsified oil and dissolved oil will form complex structures with water such as water in oil oil in water in oil which wrap contaminants and then widely disperse in wastewater to limit the mass transfer and reduce the removal ratio 10 11 oils form a film on the outside maintaining the high zeta potential and hindering the mutual contact of the colloidal particles 12 the composition of oils is complex including more than 150 toxic substances including naphthalene pyrene phenanthrene anthracene which can cause persistent damage to environmental microbes involved in the nitrogen and carbon cycles through long term accumulation 13 resulting in serious water pollution if discharged into the aquatic environment 14 macromolecular oils will occupy the adsorption sites of colloidal particles thereby weakening polymer coagulants adsorption bridging effect 15 previous studies mainly used surfactants or alkalis and other chemical agents to demulsify and remove the oil before biochemical treatment and electrochemical method 16 coagulation sedimentation 17 ultrafiltration membrane 18 biochemical treatment 19 redox method 20 and multi method coupling treatment are usually used 3 21 due to the poor biodegradability of oil oil coagulation sedimentation is commonly used to reduce chroma cod and other pollutants in practice nevertheless demulsification and degreasing treatment are always applied before coagulation sedimentation usually the subsequent coagulation sedimentation is not very effective because of emulsified oil and dissolved oil resulting in a limited removal of organic pollutants the alkaline degreaser is commonly chosen and introduced with surfactant 22 23 to destroy the oil water structure and penetrate and dissolve the oil wrapped on the particles into the solution system simultaneously 24 25 however the residual surfactant and alkalinity after degreasing are not conducive to the destabilization of colloidal particles and consequently reduce coagulation sedimentation 26 moreover most oxidation activity like potassium permanganate will not be efficient in the alkaline condition of ink wastewater 27 as a kind of typical persulfate the sodium persulfate na2s2o8 sps has a higher redox potential than mno4 compared to hydrogen standard electrodes s2o8 2 e0 2 01 v mno4 e0 1 68 v there have been many successful cases in removing organic pollutants 28 29 and sodium persulfate also has strong oxidation activity under neutral and alkaline conditions in addition the s2o8 2 in sodium persulfate can be activated under thermal radiation photocatalysis ultrasound strong alkaline conditions transition metal ions 30 activated carbon 31 to be converted to so 4 so 4 is less affected by ph when it interacts with organic pollutants 32 moreover so 4 can be induced and converted to ho and further to efficiently degrade long chain hydrocarbon organics including micro oils pigments dispersants and azo and aromatic refractory organic pollutants in solution with different ph values meanwhile as a kind of inorganic oxidant sodium persulfate also breaks the stable state of colloid particles and digests residual surfactant 33 which reduces the unfavourable effect on coagulation sedimentation fe3o4 is a typical soft magnetic metal oxide which is often used as magnetic nanoparticles or magnetic carrier of synthetic magnetic nanoparticles 34 for the removal of pollutants in wastewater existing studies have shown that the amino rich magnetic nanoparticles constructed by modifying the amino functional groups of the adsorbent materials containing fe3o4 can improve the adsorption and removal of organic pollutants heavy metals and dyes in wastewater 35 furthermore the synthesis with other nanomaterials such as zinc oxide carbon nanotubes 36 37 are well studied in order to improve the recovery of nanoparticles even used to synthesize magnetic polystyrene and other magnetic polymer adsorption materials 38 moreover nano fe3o4 mnps is a type of heterogeneous catalytic oxidations which activates sps in the crystal structure producing so 4 at neutral and normal temperature 39 in the current study sps mnps were introduced to weak the effect of micro oil on coagulation sedimentation and realize the efficient removal of the oil and organic pollutants in the oily ink wastewater the effect of followed coagulation sedimentation was furtherly testified furthermore an improvement mechanism was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for new compound degreaser the oily ink wastewater was collected from the cleaning process of the printing equipment in a packaging and printing factory the properties of the wastewater were measured after the heavier solid residues were removed by preliminary sedimentation table 1 the new degreaser was prepared by our lab with alkaline substances and surfactants nano fe3o4 mnps 97 purity ethanol tert butanol analytical purity and dmpo 97 purity were all purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd sodium persulfate sps 99 purity was purchased from kangzhen chemical technology co ltd poly aluminium chloride pac polyacrylamide pam industrial purity were purchased from fulinyuan water treatment agent co ltd 2 2 new compound degreaser treatment on oily ink wastewater the ph of the initial wastewater treated is slightly alkaline and the main ingredient of the new degreaser is alkaline matters with a small amount of surfactant which are not sensitive to ph the single factor test was set up to optimize the dosage of degreaser volume ratio and processing time on the cod and oil removal the dosage was increased from 0 to 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the removal ratio was determined for processing time of 0 20 min the effect of the degreasing time under the appropriate dosage was obtained by evaluating the removal ratio and the effluent parameters after coagulation sedimentation 2 3 sodium persulfate sps treatment sps can be effective to oxidize and degrade pollutants under neutral and alkaline conditions the concentration of s2o8 2 directly determines the oxidation removal effect of pollutants exorbitant sps concentration may lead to consequent destabilization and coagulation of colloid in the wastewater 40 41 causing the excessive addition of inorganic salt reducing the oxidation effect of sps therefore the suitable sps dosage and processing time was investigated based on the overall treatment efficiency the concentration gradient mm of sps was firstly set in the experiment as 0 00 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 and 30 min processing time was selected and then the processing time gradient was further optimized as 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 min to achieve the best processing time on the overall effect of oily ink wastewater 2 4 mnps sps catalytic oxidation the mnps activated sps reaction belongs to the transition metal activated persulfate system a kind of heterogeneous activation reaction the addition of fe3o4 can introduce fe ii into the system to activate sps generating more so 4 through increasing the reactive sites per unit volume of the reaction system thereby improving the removal efficiency of pollutants this stable and efficient 42 system can generally produce so 4 under acidic and neutral conditions at room temperature a kind of free radical with strong oxidation activity and can be converted to ho under strongly alkaline conditions 43 nevertheless the oxidizing capacity and efficiency of the activation system are easily affected by various factors such as the compound concentration ph and processing time especially when fe2 is excessive so 4 will be converted intoso 4 2 under strongly alkaline conditions it will be converted into ho and in the case of excessive na2s2o8 the probability of mutual quenching of so 4 will increase significantly 44 45 so when using this catalytic oxidation system to treat wastewater it cannot be ignored to test the influence of compound concentration ph and processing time the probable main chemical reactions eqs 1 4 in sps activated by mnps were summarized 1 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 s o 4 so 4 2 2 fe 2 s o 4 fe 3 so 4 2 3 s o 4 oh so 4 2 ho 4 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 different gradient of dosage mm were set as 0 00 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 0 60 and the processing time min was set as 0 5 10 15 20 min the mnps sps catalytic oxidation system was arranged between degreasing and coagulation sedimentation to reduce the adverse effects of micro oil the ph of the solution should be regulated before the oxidation process to enhance the performance of the catalytic oxidation system the ph gradient in the oxidation process was set as 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 8 0 8 5 to test the impact of ph on the oxidation process the ph was regulated with dilute sulphuric acid to avoid the negative influence of cl to radicals 46 and inhibit the reaction between so 4 and fe 2 eq 2 2 5 the integrated treatment process the technical route fig 1 concludes the degreasing process advanced oxidation process and coagulation sedimentation process degreasing stage the new degreaser with a volume fraction of 1 0 1 5 was added and then was stirred at 100 r min for 5 10 min finally precipitated for 5 10 min mnps sps advanced oxidation stage the ph of the degreased wastewater was adjusted to 7 5 8 0 and then added 0 3 0 4 mm sps and 0 4 0 5 mm mnps the solution was stirred at 150 200 r min for 5 10 min and finally precipitated for 10 min coagulation sedimentation stage the ph of the wastewater after oxidation was regulated to 6 0 7 0 and then 500 600 mg l pac was added and stirred for 3 min at 250 r min the addition of 1 25 1 50 mg l pam was followed and stirred for 10 min at 50 r min and finally precipitated statically for 15 20 min after three stages the treatment was pumped into a filter column containing activated carbon ac and quartz sand for secondary treatment 2 6 detection methods the infrared oil detector mi 900 tianjin zhongke chuangpu technology co ltd china was used to perform a full scan to obtain the total oil content 47 the specific method of first destabilizing and then extracting was shown in s 1 to achieve a good extraction and accurate oil content the chroma of wastewater was determined by the dilution method 48 cod was determined by the digestion apparatus drb200 hach company usa ammonia nitrogen was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometric method 49 50 for measuring turbidity take the mixed water sample dilute it 100 times and use the turbidity meter xz 0101 shanghai haiheng electromechanical instrument co ltd china to measure the turbidity zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zsp malvern instruments co ltd uk was used to measure the zeta potential of colloidal particles 51 the electron spin resonance spectrometer epr jes x320 jeol co ltd japan was used to detect and analyze the free radicals in the reaction process tem hf 3300 hitachi japan sem thermo apreo sem thermo scientific usa xrd x pert pro panalytical netherland xps escalab250xi thermofisher scientific usa ftir atr nicolet in10mx thermofisher scientific usa vsm squid vsm quantum design usa were used to test and analyze the apparent morphology crystal phase structure functional group composition element valence state and magnetic properties of mnps and precipitated phase 2 7 analysis methods 2 7 1 removal ratio calculation the removal ratio was calculated with the equation shown in eq 5 5 r x 1 0 v c f dv c o v where r x was the removal ratio of parameters including oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma and turbidity c o mg l ntu multiple was the initial value of the parameters c f mg l ntu multiple was the final value of the parameters v ml was the hydraulic loading of treatment stages the evaluation of related parameters referred to the chinese national standard for related sewage disposal 52 2 7 2 analysis of active intermediates so 4 and ho can quickly undergo hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer reactions with ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba in which they extract hydrogen atoms from hydroxyl and convert to h2o and so 4 2 so ethanol and tert butanol commonly were used as quenchers of free radicals in the intervention experiment excessive ethanol and tert butanol were added to quench free radicals in the advanced oxidation stage and then the cod removal ratio ammonia nitrogen removal ratio and chroma removal ratio of the effluent in the oxidation stage were measured to evaluate the inhibition of the quenching intervention a contrast experiment was also designed including three groups blank advanced oxidation group ad ox ethanol intervention group etoh and tert butanol intervention group tba 2 7 3 free radical species identification and intensity determination to identify the free radicals accurately and determine the activity of free radicals a contrast experiment was set using the electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr method three treatment groups were set the blank ck was sps solution n1 was sps pdw solution pdw pre degreased wastewater n2 was sps mnps solution n3 was sps mnps pdw solution in which the solvents are all deionized water the dmpo was used to capture the free radicals to determine the concentration of radicals with a stable state due to the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin of so 4 ho and the orbital spin of the n atom in dmpo the characteristic signals of dmpo so 4 sextet 1 1 1 1 1 1 and dmpo ho quartet 1 2 2 1 53 can be detected where the hyperfine structure coupling constant of the dmpo ho adduct is αn 1 49 mt αh 1 49 mt and g value 2 0055 54 the hyperfine structure coupling constant of the dmpo so 4 adduct is αn 1 38 mt αh 1 02 mt αh 0 14 mt αh 0 08 mt 55 which helped us identify these two radicals from the spectral lines obtained the activity of radicals was analyzed through the comparison of the intensity of the peaks 2 7 4 statistics analysis the research was measured in parallel three times and the average values with standard deviations were calculated data statistics and analysis software of origin 2017 originlab corporation usa and spss 21 0 ibm corporation usa were used for data statistics mapping and analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 the optimization for the new degreaser application when the dosage volume ratio was 1 0 10 ml l the removal ratios of oil and cod reached the maximum 72 00 2 31 of oil and 71 98 2 50 of cod respectively and the optimal processing time was 5 10 min fig 2a and b the removal ratio in blank groups both ratcheted up gradually in 0 15 min then declined slowly the decrease in treatment efficiency was caused by the hydraulic shear on the oil and colloids and the increased dissolved oxygen in the wastewater an excessive stirring can lead to the re aggregation of colloidal micelles and excessive emulsification 56 when the dosage was 2 0 the removal ratio declined with the extension of processing time this phenomenon was mainly caused by excessive degreaser with surfactant and alkaline the rapid increase of ph enhanced the stability of colloids and the excessive alkaline substance led to severe saponification and emulsification to shorten the overall processing time 5 min was taken as the optimal degreasing time the trend of removal ratios of ammonia nitrogen chroma turbidity was similar within 5 min fig 2d the optimal dosage of degreaser was 1 0 10 ml l when the ratios were 71 99 oil 71 14 cod 66 69 ammonia 76 19 chroma 76 67 turbidity compared with the treatment effect of the pure coagulation sedimentation with pac and pam fig s2 settling time on coagulation sedimentation was studied in detail compared to direct pac and pam coagulation sedimentation the new degreaser improved the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma turbidity respectively by 40 43 44 53 50 67 26 46 32 71 however removing oil and chroma was still much room to improve to meet high emission requirements 3 2 mnps activated sps treatment for oily ink wastewater the structural characteristics crystal phase and functional groups of nano fe3o4 used in the study were tested and analyzed tem images showed that mnps had uniform dispersive grain size and a certain degree of agglomeration fig s3 xrd spectra fig s4a and ftir atr spectra fig s4b showed that the main components of mnps were fe3o4 where the iron content in transition valence state was noticeable and there were little impurities and unrelated characteristic functional groups meanwhile vsm test results showed that mnps had good magnetic hysteresis with magnetic storage function its saturation magnetic intensity was 88 75 emu g fig s5a and keep stable in the range of 0 to 300 c fig s5b the introduction of the sps oxidation process into coagulation sedimentation coupled with a new degreaser to treat the oily ink wastewater efficiently improved overall treatment efficiencies fig 3a and b with the increase of the sps concentration the removal increased within the dosage of 0 0 2 mm and then reached the maximum at 0 3 0 4 mm when the removal ratios were 86 12 oil 79 29 cod 66 93 ammonia 83 81 chroma 81 76 turbidity but declined quickly when over 0 4 mm fig 3a the excessive persulfate ions broke the stable state of colloidal particles and the possible radicals interacted to be self cleaned when it was excess the removal ratios of cod and ammonia nitrogen declined slowly when sps were excess owing to the structure of pollutants combined with colloidal particles which slowed down the oxidation reactions to sum up sps was successfully used to oxidize the pollutants in the oily ink wastewater alone to further improve the oxidation effect to degrade pollutants the mnps was introduced to achieve an overall treatment increase the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia chroma and turbidity were 96 4 98 35 88 00 99 70 and 98 22 when the ph was 8 0 and the dosage of mnps was 0 5 mm fig 3e importantly it was found that the sps mnps system performed stronger oxidation activity under weakly alkaline conditions when the concentration of mnps was 0 5 mm the removal ratios increased almost 12 fig 3c compared with the system with only sps the degreaser coupled with the coagulation sedimentation method achieved the removal ratio of oil 93 04 the cod 95 81 the ammonia 85 46 the chroma 97 13 and the turbidity 95 69 the xps spectra of fe 2p in mnps and sediments treated by mnps sps fig s6 showed the obvious changes of the valence state of fe 2p and the transition between fe2 and fe3 indicating that mnps was involved in the activation oxidation process of sps with the increase of mnps concentration the removal ratios first went up and then declined within 0 6 mm and the removal ratios of parameters except for oil content all increased rapidly within 0 3 0 5 mm when over 0 5 mm they declined quickly because of the adverse impact of excessive fe2 the excessive fe2 converted so4 to so4 2 eq 2 to reduce the oxidation activity 57 however the removal of oil was changed little the oxidation processing time was shortened by almost 10 min fig 3d after adding mnps with the extension of processing time oil removal gradually increased and then reached an unstable balance state in comparison the removal ratio of others declined after oxidizing for 10 15 min because of the self cleaning of radicals in the activated oxidation system 44 45 the influence of ph on the overall treatment efficiency had been tested fig 3e the removal increased within ph 6 0 8 0 gradually and then plunged when the ph was over 8 0 therefore the optimal ph was around 8 0 the chroma and oil in the effluent of the overall treatment reached the discharge standard but cod ammonia nitrogen turbidity were very close up to the standard table 2 so the adsorption filter device filled with activated carbon and quartz sand was added after coagulation sedimentation as a secondary treatment to ensure the final effluent could be discharged or be reused 4 mechanism analysis 4 1 zeta potential analysis the stability of colloidal particles is closely related to zeta potential which also determines the colloidal particle s surface polarity and particle size in the present study of the impact of degreaser dosage on the stability of colloidal particles zeta potential declined first before 1 0 and then increased fig 4a the degreaser solubilized the oil film enfolding the colloids reducing the surface polarity and zeta potential the surface charge and hydrophobic groups increased because of the excessive alkalinity and surfactant so that the stability of colloidal particles became stronger which was similar to a previous study of oily wastewater treatment 58 the mild degreaser could reduce the zeta potential of colloids by removing the oil film enfolding colloidal particles to break the stable state the data showed the zeta potential declined from 18 27 mv to 8 72 mv after degreased fig 4a compared the zeta potential data of colloidal particles in different treatment stages fig 4b the zeta potential decreased significantly after introduced sps mnps oxidation which was 2 32 mv lower than the original the degreased and sps oxidized by 15 95 mv 6 40 mv 4 17 mv respectively 4 2 so 4 and ho cooperative oxidation enhanced the degradation of micro oil and organic pollutants the catalytic oxidation system had generated active intermediates with the strong oxidizing property after introducing the sps mnps system the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma turbidity increased by 33 89 38 25 31 96 30 85 28 11 combined with the treatment process without sps mnps system fig 5 table s2 the treatment efficiency was better than the treatment just with sps oxidized the striking difference indicated the coexistence of so 4 and ho under the weakly alkaline condition similar to the study of photocatalytic persulfate producing so 4 and ho under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions to degrade organic pollutants 59 the data obtained from the intervention experiment showed that the removal ratios of cod ammonia nitrogen chroma was inhibited by 72 30 67 52 and 63 90 after quenching with etoh while the inhibition effects of tert butanol were 36 82 32 71 and 31 55 respectively fig 6 table s3 meanwhile referring to relevant studies of using so 4 and ho to degrade organic pollutants such as aniline 60 p nitro aniline 42 61 methyl orange 62 methyl tert butyl ether 63 the degradation performance is mainly attributed to the radicals attacks on azo bonds or ch bonds in the pollutants by abstracting hydrogen atoms and transferring electrons thereby generating intermediates further oxidizing and hydrolyzing similarly there were masses of cyclic organics in the oily ink wastewater such as phthalocyanines azos aromatic hydrocarbons and other refractory pollutants even a large number of long chain hydrocarbon organics further evidence from fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir atr test showed the structural changes of organic pollutants in sediments before and after introducing mnps sps fig 7 in which the unsaturated bond content of ch out of plane bending vibration type rch chr 665 730 cm 1 decreased obviously the contents of functional groups of alcohol phenol oh stretching vibration 3200 3550 cm 1 3584 3700 cm 1 decreased significantly and the co co functional groups 1300 1500 cm 1 1600 1900 cm 1 of the stretching vibrations of ketone aldehydes esters and aromatics were significantly reduced therefore the analysis indicated the reinforcing mechanism involved in micro oil conversion 64 when the sps mnps are into the system 4 3 the positive roles of weak alkaline system and adsorption of particulate matter as we all know the fe ii activated persulfate system can generate so 4 65 66 under acidic and neutral conditions and so 4 could be converted to ho when reacted with oh under alkaline condition eq 3 63 67 the oxidizing ability of ho is weaker than so 4 under neutral and alkaline conditions in these experimental results the treatment efficiency was still good under weakly alkaline conditions of ph 7 5 8 0 compared to that in acidic conditions fig 3e 4 3 1 weak alkaline conditions created a suitable reaction contact environment the experimental results showed that the variation of the zeta potential with the increase of ph appeared approximately linear in the oxidation system fig 4c when ph was 7 5 8 0 the zeta potential was higher than the acidic conditions the instability and aggregation of colloids were inhibited and would maintain a smaller particle size 68 under acidic conditions colloidal particles zeta potential and surface polarity were lower than the neutral or alkaline conditions and colloidal particles were easy to destabilize and aggregate 69 however the interaction areas and sites between radicals and pollutants will decrease leading to lower oxidation efficiency in sps mnps system so the weak alkaline condition provided a more suitable reaction contact environment for the oxidation reaction 4 3 2 the promoted radicals conversion under weak alkaline conditions ph 7 5 8 0 both so 4 and ho existed as the main active species the optimal treatment condition appeared at ph 8 0 which showed that the cooperative oxidation capacity of so 4 and ho under weak alkaline conditions was stronger than that of so 4 under weak acid conditions however the fe ii activated sps system generates plenty of hydroxyl radicals under strongly alkaline conditions ph 9 0 microwave radiation ultraviolet radiation and other conditions a hypothesis was proposed that the co existing of colloidal particles and mnps promoted so 4 and ho and the activation of mnps enhanced the conversion of so 4 to oh when more colloidal particles existed at weak alkaline as a result more cod removal was further achieved by ho with so 4 in the epr detection almost no radicals in ck fig 8 there were weak peaks of the adducts of dmpo so 4 in n1 but no dmpo ho adducts peak was detected indicating a small amount of organic substance that could activate sps in degreased wastewater it was referred to be phenolic hydroxyl group oxides 70 the spectrum of n2 presented an obvious high intensity of dmpo so 4 adducts sextet and contained a low intensity of dmpo ho adducts quartet it hinted that the adsorption and activation of mnps contributed to the conversion conditions of so 4 to ho promoting ho to generate in surface catalytic zones whereas in the spectrum of n3 it could be found that the intensity of dmpo so 4 adducts sextet became weaker while the quartet intensity of dmpo ho increased which indicated that adding of colloidal particles promoted the conversion of so 4 to ho the integrated colloidal particles mnps and sps mnps generate more ho under weak alkaline conditions sem images of sediments treated by sps mnps directly showed loose pores fig 9a of colloidal particles and enrichment of mnps fig 9b in the reaction the possible mechanism diagram was given in fig 10 5 conclusion new technology for efficient treatment of oily ink wastewater was developed in which the sps mnps advanced oxidation system was introduced to assist new degreaser coupled coagulation sedimentation the sps mnps system degraded micro oils and organic pollutants through generating so 4 to ho thereby improving the zeta potential of colloidal particles to promote coagulation sedimentation efficiency compared with the treatment process without introducing the sps mnps the removal ratios of oil cod ammonia nitrogen chroma and turbidity increased by 33 89 38 25 31 96 30 85 and 28 11 respectively the technology and mechanism proposed a new joint treatment strategy for treating wastewater with high cod high chroma and oil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
