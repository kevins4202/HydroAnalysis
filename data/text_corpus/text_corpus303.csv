1515,characterization of hydrological conditions at polluted sites is critical for understanding of contaminant distribution and transport standard techniques for site characterization such as soil coring together with well installation for piezometric measurements and water sampling allow only some insights into subsurface properties and processes to obtain additional data direct push techniques are often used in soils and unconsolidated formations the various available techniques provide high resolution information on cm to mm scale recently the optical imaging profiler oip was developed for detection of fluorescent contaminants here we have investigated the applicability of the oip for groundwater tracing using fluorophores our laboratory experiments show that it is possible to qualitatively trace various fluorophores meaning that light emitted by the fluorophores can be detected by a standard digital camera sensor the measured fluorescence depends on the number of fluorophore molecules present in the pore space adjacent to the oip and decreases with smaller pore size as well as fluorophore concentration in a field trial an injected eosin y solution could be very clearly detected after the injection within a radius of 0 5 m around the injection point when the oip is equipped with a second light source emitting visible light images of the soil texture and color can be captured sediment color can act as a proxy for various soil properties tests at a second field site indicate that detected variation in soil color depend on water saturation and redox processes hence the oip is a flexible cost effective and multifunctional tool for characterization of contaminated sites keywords fluorescence contaminated site investigation in situ remediation hydrogeology tracer test 1 introduction detailed hydrogeological characterization is crucial for understanding groundwater flow and contaminant transport it forms the basis for planning of drinking water extraction groundwater remediation and the delineation of water protection zones most commonly characterization of a given site consists of soil coring accompanied by well installation for piezometric measurements water sampling and groundwater tracer testing however these methods allow only limited insight into the flow conditions and the transport of the constituents the fluid carries soil coring and well installation are expensive and rarely adequately in number for a site in addition wells cannot be flexibly placed and screen length typically limits the depth from which information can be obtained to obtain more detailed information two approaches are typically applied one approach relies on surface or cross borehole geophysical measurements e g gueting et al 2016 zhao and illman 2018 and the second one on low invasive direct push probes dpps which can provide in situ information at centimeter scale in unconsolidated sediments dpps have been developed for assessment of geotechnical physical hydraulic and chemical properties overviews about dpps are given in dietrich and leven 2006 bumberger et al 2015 and mccall et al 2006 for example static cone penetration testing and electrical conductivity ec logging have been used over decades to assess stratigraphic variations in unconsolidated sediments e g begemann 1965 schulmeister et al 2003 in the field of soil and groundwater contamination the laser induced fluorescence lif probes and the membrane interface probe were applied successfully and results from these dpps have correlated well with laboratory analysis of organic contaminants e g bloch et al 1998 bujewski and rutherford 1997 knowles and lieberman 1995 lieberman 1998 mccall et al 2011 the visioncpt geovis and video cone a standard cone penetration testing dpps equipped with a camera have been used to directly visualize the sediment e g raschke and hryciw 1997 other applications include logging with ec and laser induced fluorescence lif for detection of groundwater tracers vienken et al 2017 suthersan et al 2014 in situ colorimetric measurements for characterizing stratigraphical variations using the scost system hausmann et al 2016 2017 and assessment of microbial activity schurig et al 2014 recent work has demonstrated that direct push ec logs follow archie s law in sandy formations so that bulk formation ec can be related to specific conductance of the groundwater mccall et al 2017 moreover some fluorophores fluorescent molecules readily partition into certain non aqueous phase liquids napl this means that such napl s can be fluorescently tagged through fluorophore injection and detected indirectly with lif horst et al 2018 dpps suffer from limitations that are inherent to the method of detection or to the probe design cone penetration testing cannot resolve layers thinner than several times the cone diameter of 35 7 or 43 7 mm hryciw et al 2009 ec direct push logging in sediments is influenced by clay content water saturation and pore water composition and is unable to resolve small scale heterogeneities in sediments with low clay content schulmeister et al 2003 furthermore ec probe design and probe attrition influences performance demuth et al 2015 the membrane interface probe mip which detects volatile organic compounds loses vertical resolution because of compound dispersion during transport to the analyzer at the surface bumberger et al 2011 for the lif probes chromatic dispersion occurs along the fiber optic cable leading to non synchronous arrival of the emitted light waves from a fluorophore at the detector apitz et al 1992 bumberger et al 2015 moreover recorded fluorescence depends on contaminant type and concentration the specific surface area of the soil water saturation soil mineralogy and exposure time of the sensor apitz et al 1993 knowles and lieberman 1995 in addition conflicting results have been published on the excitation emission behavior of fluorescent compounds in contact with soil thus reported excitation emission matrices which relates the intensity and wavelength of the fluorescence with the wavelength of the light used for excitation may or may not change in the presence of a soil matrix for a range of compounds kram and keller 2004 alostaz et al 2008 because such shortcomings mean that dpps only partially portray subsurface qualities we have conducting laboratory experiments and field tests with a newly developed 2d imaging dpp to explore its capabilities and limitations and determine if the obtained data is such that it overcome some of the current dpp limitations and or provide different new information the probe the optical imaging profiler oip is developed by kejr engineering inc geoprobe systems salina kansas usa it combines fluorescent and visible light image logging using the same sensor mccall et al 2018 additionally the probe is equipped with an ec dipole for measuring bulk conductivities of formation it was originally designed for the detection of fluorescent contaminants e g gasoline jet fuel diesel crude oil and creosote here we are specifically interested in the use of the oip for 1 groundwater tracing using fluorophores combining their detectability at low concentration with flexible placement of logs 2 extraction of qualitative information on imaged color to potentially distinguish differently emitting fluorophores and visualize changes in soil color which relate to depositional environment or geochemical processes 2 equipment and methods 2 1 the optical imaging profiler oip the dpp used consists of an ec dipole array located at the tip of the probe and an oip unit at the center fig 1 the oip unit features two light sources a and b producing constant light intensity when activated a a high intensity light emitting diode led that produce light with the wavelength required to induce fluorescence and b a secondary led emitting either a broad spectrum visible light or infrared light we will denote the light sources employed as oip source a source b table 1 e g oip uv vis refers to the use of a uv light source for inducing fluorescence and a broad spectrum visible light for general imaging through a 2 mm thick sapphire window with a diameter of 12 7 mm the light illuminates the adjacent soil and fluids light from backscattering and fluorescence returning through the window is passed through a fixed focus lens and then detected with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor cmos the probe can run in two modes in mode 1 uv or green light is emitted from source a to induce fluorescence in mode 2 visible or infrared light is emitted from source b to induce general backscattering of light exposure time gain and white balancing are adjusted automatically by the camera to optimize image quality depending on the light sources used different physical filters passing light with wavelength shorter short pass and longer long pass than specific cut off cut on values to emit light of a specific wavelength and to avoid detection of elastically backscattered source light by the camera table 1 the maximum suggested penetration rate is 4 ft min 1 2 m min kejr inc 2019 because at higher penetration rates the number of images showing motion blur which is an apparent streaking in the image increases significantly for a more detailed description of the system and system components we refer to mccall et al 2018 2 2 image processing and analysis captured images are in the standard rgb color scheme whose color gamut i e the color range which can be represented by the color scheme is described by the additive mixing of the primary colors red r green g and blue b for an 8 bit digital system colors represented by a 3d cubic color space take values between 0 and 255 values of 0 for all primary colors yield black and values of 255 white in the 3d space nuances of gray fall on the line connecting the points for black and white for image analysis rgb images were converted to the hsb color model a derivate of the rgb color model that describes the gamut using values from 0 to 255 for hue h saturation s and brightness b for the hsv color model we used again a cubic color space instead of the more common cylindrical space images were captured with a rate of 30 frames per second and analyzed on line by the manufacturer s software acquisition software from geoprobe in addition to the physical filters two sets of corresponding digital filters based on the hsb color model and specific to the oip type are applied to discretize the measured fluorescence mccall et al 2018 the percent area fluorescence af of a given image is then calculated from the relative number of pixels in an image that record fluorescence based on the discretization e g if 25 of all pixels pass the digital filter criteria then the measured fluorescence is 25 af regardless of how much fluorescence was measured by the 25 of pixels the af from multiple analyzed images is averaged to one value for every 1 5 cm 0 05 ft depth section as the probe is advanced into the sediment in addition an image with a dimension of 9 5 mm 7 0 mm 640 480 pixels is saved at the same frequency in jpg format using rgb color space and an image depth of 8 bit henceforth termed raw image to test if the signals from fluorophores with different wavelength of emission could be unraveled based on the color of the captured images and to determine the color of soil images we manually applied additional image analysis to raw images first noise was removed by applying a mean filter with a pixel radius of 2 using the software fiji schindelin et al 2012 for images from laboratory experiments a specific region of each image was selected region of interest roi because images were dark at their corner possibly because of uneven illumination a shadow from the sapphire window or by imperfect mounting of the camera the images were averaged over this roi to one color to reduce the amount of data and to simplify data comparison then the image within the roi was clipped and saved in jpg format using fiji from these jpg images the primaries of the rgb color space and hsb color space were extracted and the distribution of the values visualized as histograms the color space transformation and color histogram extraction was conducted in python 2 7 using the numpy library 2 3 laboratory testing to assess the detection of fluorescent tracers with oip uv vis oip green vis and oip green ir a series of laboratory tests were conducted initial tests were carried out using tap water whereas later tests were conducted using synthetic groundwater containing 120 mg l ca 20 mg l mg 20 mg l na 340 mg l hco3 30 8 mg l cl and 99 mg l so4 the synthetic groundwater was made using the procedure given in smith et al 2002 with deionized water resistivity 18 mω cm milliq nacl acs 99 and caco3 acs 99 95 sigma aldrich mgso4 98 appli chem and co2 gas 99 995 industrial grade nahco3 bearing fluorescein eosin y sulphorhodamine b powder 75 fluorophore hue corporation or liquid rhodamine wt 25 fluorophore sensient were used for the preparation of 1 l stock solutions commercially available chlorine and isopropyl alcohol was purchased for cleaning of the cuvettes to gauge the influence of sediments on the measurements of fluorescence industrial quartz sands 93 wt sio2 with a known narrow grain size distribution uniformity from 1 25 to 2 07 and geometric mean grain size from 0 121 to 1 041 mm were purchased from dansand a s and used as delivered stock solutions were prepared prior to each set of experiments and diluted with tap water or synthetic groundwater to generate solutions with variable fluorophore concentrations for the duration of an experimental set up to 8 days solutions were wrapped in aluminum foil or stored in an opaque box to avoid photolytic bleaching the ph of solutions was measured either with a two point calibrated wtw multiline p3 for initial tests with a three point calibrated ph meter from metrohm metrohm 827 ph lab or from wtw wtw multi 3430 based on previous test of a similar ph meter and electrode the uncertainty of the measurement is 0 02 ph units or so 2 standard deviation davesne et al 2010 measured values ranged from 7 5 to 8 1 for imaging without sand 4 ml diluted fluorophore solutions were transferred to a quartz cuvette when imaging was performed on solutions with sediments 1 4 ml diluted fluorophore solutions were first transferred to a quartz cuvette after which sand was added until the cuvette was filled up to the neck this procedure minimizes the presence of trapped air bubbles in the cuvette kram and keller 2004 to exclude ambient light during the measurement the cuvette was put in a black cuvette holder with a single opening held in direct contact with the sapphire window of the oip the fluorescence background of the sands was determined by putting dry sand directly on the sapphire window and covering the sediment with aluminum foil to exclude ambient light before and after a measurement session the functionality of the probe was assured by measuring reference materials with known fluorescence diesel fuel creosote motor oil a non fluorescent black reference and a geoprobe emblem as key fob optical target all tests except the initial test with tap water and with szvi were conducted in triplicates after use the cuvette was rinsed with chlorine isopropyl alcohol and trice with deionized water 2 4 field application during the course of this study three opportunities arose for conducting experiments in the field and test the performance of the probe in the complex settings of the environment 2 4 1 field site i the capability of the oip green vis for detection of eosin y in the field was tested by performing a dual tracer injection at field site i in västernorrland sweden eosin y is considered as harmless and has been suggested as an inert tracer for porous aquifers because of its chemical stability and limited retardation during transport e g behrens et al 2001 field et al 1995 flury and wai 2003 oba and poulson 2012 the subsurface at field site i consists of a surface layer of artificial fill underlain by 5 6 m of sandy clay till into which the tracers were injected the nature of the deeper subsurface was not determined in this study but in the surrounding area quaternary sediments were deposited on top of granite or greywacke the sandy clay till hosts a local aquifer with a water table approximately 3 m below ground level bgl hydraulic conductivities are in the range of 2 10 4 to 2 10 5 m s and the hydraulic gradient is about 0 01 to 0 02 m m first 1 m3 solution for injection was prepared by dissolving 0 8 kg kh2po4 budenheim 16 4 kg k2hpo4 budenheim and 160 g na2co3 merck subsequently one liter stock solution containing 1 875 g eosin y hue corporation was added prior to use the solution was mixed for 2 h after which ph was 8 1 and temperature 20 4 c the presence of kh2po4 k2hpo4 and na2co3 increased the electrical conductivity to 19 ms cm allowing the tracer solution to be detected also by ec logging during injection a pneumatic driven pump blagdon provided a maximum pressure of 10 bar 250 l of the prepared solution were injected at a constant depth of 3 9 m bgl using geoprobe s pressure activated injection probe the subsurface distribution of the tracers was detected using a dpp equipped with an ec dipole and an oip green vis module seven logs were obtained in a radius of 0 5 m around the injection point within 32 h after the injection the logs reached a depth of 3 3 6 4 m bgl and were acquired by pushing the dpp at an average penetration rate of 1 m min the functionality of the oip unit was tested before and after each log by measuring the reference materials with known fluorescence the ec dipole was tested with a jig holding two different resistors and measuring the resistors conductivity low 55 ms high 360 ms m 2 4 2 field site ii at field site ii in kalmar county sweden we investigated the oip green vis performance in relation to the detection limit of fluorescent contaminants using the green light if the oip sensitivity is not sufficient then contamination could perhaps be overseen by missing of a fluorescent response from the contaminant called false negative this potentially leads to underestimation of the contaminant distribution which limits the success of a later remediation action at a later stage the subsurface of field site ii consists of up to 23 m unconsolidated fluvial sediments and are partly contaminated with creosote the alluvial sediments are underlain by estuarine clayey deposits a log was generated by pushing the dpp into the subsurface at a penetration rate of 1 m min soil samples were taken nearby via direct push dual tube coring for comparison of af primary colors of captured images with concentration of organics in the soil the sampled material was sent to højvang laboratory for analyses of the 16 major polyaromatic hydrocarbons method epa 8270c 1996 mod defined by the danish environmental protection agency and total organic carbon toc method ds 9377 2 2001 mod fid images from one log were analyzed for fluorescence manually to confirm the resolution of the oip green vis 2 4 3 field site iii soil color is described routinely in geological investigations and used as proxy for sedimentological changes e g changes in mineralogy water saturation redox state or determination of stratigraphic boundaries at field site iii in jutland denmark we tested to what degree in situ color logging can provide information about the sediment this site consists of alternating layers of glacial till and meltwater sand with a 10 20 m thick glacial till at the top field site iii is contaminated with fuel products a dpp equipped with an oip uv vis module and an ec dipole was driven down into the top glacial till twice to a depth of 3 m bgl the first log was advanced with a penetration rate of 1 m min in fluorescence mode whereas the second log was acquired at a penetration rate of 0 5 m min solely in visible mode placed adjacent to the first one 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory tests of the detectability of fluorescent tracers to probe the performance of the oip for inducing and detecting fluorescence laboratory experiments were performed with two different light sources for inducing fluorescence light source a table 1 and four fluorophores in the absence or presence of a sand matrix fig 2a shows example raw images of solutions with fluorescein concentrations from 0 to 81 mg l obtained with the oip green vis using the green light the images feature a diffuse reddish and circular area at low fluorophore concentration that is displaced slightly downwards from the image center with increasing fluorophore concentration the reddish area expands and turns bright orange at the center these observations agree with previous reports on images produced by the probe mccall et al 2018 reflecting the geometry of the illumination detector setup and the use of a point light source which resulted in a decrease in recorded light at the edge of the detector the redness is ubiquitous for the tested fluorophores and is caused by the physical long pass filter which removes diffusely reflected light from the green source shorter than 590 nm table 1 fig s1 hence only the lower energy portion of the fluorescence is recorded the reddish to bright orange appearance of the images is also seen in the manual image analysis fig 2c e where values for hue match with the reddish sections of the hue ramp indicated on right side of fig 2c of the three parameters that describe the color gamut brightness is particularly sensitive to changes in concentrations of the fluorophores at higher dilution with marked increase in this value occurring between 0 003 and 0 1 mg l fig 2e based on the curves detection limits range from 0 05 mg l for rhodamine wt to 0 2 mg l for fluorescein at the conditions of our experiments generally the relationships between brightness saturation and hue for the four fluorophores are quite similar meaning that their individual fluorescence cannot be differentiated with the oip green vis the oip green vis sensitivity is governed by the fluorophores peak excitation wavelength λex peak emission wavelength λem and quantum yield ɸ which describes the ratio between absorbed and emitted photons table 2 for ideal detection the fluorophore λex should be close to the light sources wavelength and λem equal or longer than the long pass filter wavelength of 590 nm λex is fluorophore specific but within 39 nm of the wavelength of the light source meaning that the light source is nearly ideal for excitation of the used fluorophores λem of the tested fluorophores is shorter than the used long pass filters which passes only the part of the emitted light from the fluorophore longer than the long pass filter wavelength of 590 m fig s1 for example most of the emitted light from fluorescein is removed by the filter decreasing its detection although the molecule features the highest ɸ of the tested fluorophores as a result of differences in ɸ removal of emitted light from the fluorophore and the difference between wavelength of the light source and peak excitation of the fluorophores the oip green vis is most sensitive to rhodamine wt sulforhodamine b eosin y fluorescein the absorbance spectra of the used fluorophores fig s1 show that light is additionally absorbed in the uv range meaning the uv light can be used as well for excitation if the uv light from the oip uv vis is used for recording images then the images for the different fluorophores show difference in color because the oip uv vis does not feature a 590 nm long pass filter images of solutions with fluorescein fig 2 g and eosin y are greenish whereas those with sulfhorhodamine b and rhodamine wt are yellowish to reddish consistent with the fluorophores λem in the images brightness is indistinguishable from the blank until fluorophore concentrations reach 0 1 mg l the value then increases to about 200 at 10 mg l after which it remains constant concomitantly the values for hue becomes separate for red and green emitting fluorophores for fluorescein and eosin y the values for hue decrease slightly with increasing concentration possibly this redshift is caused by preferential reabsorption of emitted fluorescence at the shorter wavelength based on these observations we conclude that the oip uv vis allows detection of the fluorophores at 0 1 mg l and that fluorescence from different fluorophores should be discernible provided λem is sufficiently different application of the automatic image analysis to the raw images in fig 2a g to decrease the information in the image to a single value af results in variation from 0 blank to 92 2 fig 2f l fig 2b h highlights in gray the pixels in the raw images that contributed to af af for all four tracers shows a log normal trend with tracer concentration fig 2f when the green light of the oip green vis was used the detection limit varies between 0 005 mg l for rhodamine wt to 0 1 mg l for fluorescein for comparison the detection limit reported for the lif is 0 01 mg l for rhodamine wt and fluorescein suthersan et al 2014 at high concentrations af reaches a plateau of around 90 independent of the fluorophore tested because the hue of rhodamine wt sulforhodamine b and to some extent eosin y does not match the color region that is filtered during the automatic image analysis fig 2i only fluorescein is recognized as fluorescent using uv light of the oip uv vis fig 2 l for this fluorophore the curve for af is similar to that obtained with the oip green vis custom made digital filters could potentially improve the standard applicability of the dpp with other fluorophores 3 1 1 soil matrix effect on af to test the influence of a soil matrix on detected fluorescence we imaged eosin y solutions in variably sized sand with the oip green ir the raw image was typically either reddish when fluorescence was recorded using the green light or grayish when backscattered ir light was recorded generally all images showed a blurry rim and coarser grains could be clearly identified fig 3a b fig 3c summarizes determined af at variable eosin y concentrations in the presence of six different sands with a geometric mean grain size from 0 121 mm to 1 043 mm data is additionally plotted in separate 2d diagrams in si s3 for higher fluorophore concentrations and grain size above average mean diameter of 0 327 mm af was very similar to that determined in experiments without sand i e sand addition had little influence on af for the fine grain sized sand however the recorded af was consistently lower relative to the values determined without sand at eosin y concentrations below 0 25 mg l the decrease in af from the presence of sand was most pronounced for a 0 1 mg l eosin y solutions for example recorded af decreased from 60 9 to 33 as mean grain size decreased fluorescence from the sand itself give rise to a negligible 0 6 2 0 af in our experiments all sands were well sorted grain size distribution curves in si s2 we calculated the porosity based on the grain size distribution using the empirical relationship between uniformity and porosity found by istomina 1957 which is a good approximation for loosely packed grains fuchs et al 2017 porosity is in the range of 0 46 0 43 thus the decreased af for fine grained sand does not depend on variation in pore volume and hence the total number of fluorescent molecules in the cuvette the sand will however absorb and scatter both incoming light from the light source and emitted light from the fluorophore thus the volume of solution that can be irradiated by the light source will decrease with the volume of individual pores similar interpretations have been reached by apitz et al 1992 and sinfield et al 1999 for results obtained with lif their findings suggest that only the filled pores between the sapphire window and sand contributes to the measured fluorescence alostaz et al 2008 found that detection limits deteriorated with decreased soil porosity and at poorer degree of sorting hence for the oip and dissolved fluorophores in a sand matrix a decrease in the excitable solution volume between sand and sapphire window could be responsible for the decrease in fluorescence in a simple consideration light from the source is absorbed by fluorophores during penetration into the sample hence a fluorophore molecule at a certain distance from the sample boundary will receive less light secondly the light emitted by a fluorophore molecule may become absorbed by other molecules on its way to the detector if absorption and the emission spectra overlap a process known as inner filter effect lakowicz 2006 for the fluorophores used here absorption and the emission spectra does indeed overlap s1 as a consequence emitted light from fluorophores close to the sample boundary contribute more to the fluorescence detected for the oip this means that at high fluorophore concentration only the fluorophores closest to the sapphire window contribute to the detected fluorescence in this case area fluorescence would be less influenced by the depth of pores and hence absolute pore size and fluorescence would be similar for all sand types as we observe in contrast at lower fluorophore concentration fluorescence can be detected at greater distance from the detector meaning that pore depth would influence the recorded signal for such concentrations determined af would be expected to decrease with grain size consistent with observations clearly quantitative determination of fluorophore concentration is only possible if the grain size distribution is considered and only if the tracer concentration is not too high this means that the oip probe is mainly a qualitative tool additional work is required to understand the influence of sorting shape and packing 3 2 field application 3 2 1 field site i to assess the applicability of the oip in groundwater tracing studies in the field 1 875 mg l eosin y was injected in the local aquifer at field site 1 in a saline solution that could be detected through ec measurement also subsequently seven logs were produced using the green light of the oip green vis and arranged in a pattern indicated in fig 4 for log1 fluorescence was low and log5 could not be hammered down to the target depth but significant fluorescence was recorded in the other five logs with values reaching nearly 50 af fig 4 the dominant fluorescent signal in these logs originated from 2 5 4 m bgl and was accompanied by elevated values for ec reaching 730 ms m showing that the measured signals stem from the injected tracers thus a 1 875 mg l eosin y solution can be used for conducting tracer tests the logs show two interesting features firstly af and ec signals do not coincide completely af shows sharper peaks than those recorded with ec measurement and in several places increases in conductivity is measured without concomitant increase in af most likely the variable response of the two tracing methods relates to the details of the measurement the ec dipole measures the bulk ec of a soil volume around the tip of the dpp the bulk formation ec is governed by the clay content and ec of the pore fluid mccall et al 2017 so that higher clay contents and stronger saline solutions will increase the ec in which ec increases linearly with increasing salinity in comparison the oip camera captures fluorescence from the pore space adjacent to the sapphire window and the relationship between low fluorophore concentrations and af is log normal contrary to ec measurement our laboratory experiments show that measured fluorescence declines with decreasing grain size consequently variable match between af and ec could indicate aquifer heterogeneity recorded af are the result of variations in fluorophore concentration and changes in the soil matrix if we assume that tracer concentration is high then the occurrence of non favorable soil matrix will be expressed by low af but high ec values high af and low ec will be indicative for a low tracer concentration in a favorable soil matrix for detection of fluorescence moreover the ec signal of thin layers in the sediment is influenced by the ec of adjacent layers leading to a loss of spatial resolution i e a thin layer with low ec surrounded by areas with high ec will go undetected or vice versa thin layers are resolvable by fluorescence measurements the second main observation is related to the nature of an injection if a tracer is injected in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer a radial tracer distribution is assumed e g hall et al 1991 a concentration gradient will be observed between the distal and the proximal part of the injected volume because of dispersion of the tracer e g graupner et al 2011 hoopes and harleman 1967 in this case the inhomogeneous distributed fluorescence and ec values reflect the spatial heterogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer leading to different hydraulic conductivities as noticed in other studies e g seaman et al 2007 suthersan et al 2014 in conclusion the oip green vis was able to detect an injected fluorophore and in combination with an ec dipole a dual tracer test could be conducted small scale heterogeneities in the soil matrix could be revealed by comparison of af and ec because the two measurement have different sensitivity to such variation however differences in the nature of the subsurface may complicate such analysis in other sediments during dpp penetration for example fine grained sediments may smear on the sapphire window or vibrations from probe advancement may suspend fine particles in the pore water causing it to become turbid and less transparent both phenomena will interfere with illumination of the soil and collection of backscattered light to an unknown degree thus we do not currently know how general the detection of small scale heterogeneities is potentially the combination of oip ec with the hydraulic profiling tool hpt could offer a solution for this problem because hpt can provide information about heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivities but further work in this direction is necessary 3 2 2 field site ii successful remediation requires detailed knowledge about contaminant distribution in this case creosote which can potentially be determined by detection of induced fluorescence from the contaminant by the oip hence we investigated the detection capability of the oip green vis using the green light the average primary colors hue saturation and brightness from the images were extracted because each little change in color will be expressed by a change in color composition as it is expected to happen if the light emitted by the stimulated creosote is recorded subsequently the primary colors were compared to recorded af ec and contaminant content in soil samples the brightness of most images possesses a color value of 75 fig 5a inspection of the related raw images showed that they were overall slightly reddish because filters did not completely remove elastically backscattered source light brightness shows peaks at distinct depths 19 08 20 07 20 71 21 78 and 22 71 m bgl and below 23 m bgl the values are generally higher the deviations in the brightness coincidence with elevated ec values fig 5b suggesting that they are related to changes in the sedimentary deposits i e ec rises with decreasing grain size and higher clay content schulmeister et al 2003 furthermore hunter 1975 demonstrated that fine grained material will appear in a different color in comparison to its coarse grained counterpart because it reflects a higher proportion of light hence a fine grained sand or silt with some clay content potentially backscatters more light from the green light source than for comparison coarse sand and gravel which is subsequently not completely removed by the long pass filter on the camera fluorescence was only recorded in the bottom section where also toc was elevated however pah s concentrations in the core were low based on laboratory measurement fig 5c indicating that the concentration of contaminants capable of inducing fluorescence was insufficient for its detection thus we interpret that the green light induced fluorescence by naturally occurring organic material e g schultze et al 2004 therefore post processing of images shows that the camera is highly light sensitive allowing detection of additional features such as fine grained layers and or natural occurring fluorophores fluorescence did not originate from contamination in this case 3 2 3 field site iii at field site iii which contained petroleum contamination s4 we investigated if detected soil color can be used at a contaminated site as proxy for aspects of the sediments or geochemical conditions the soil color was derived from images captured by the oip uv vis using the visible light to relate differences in soil colors to sediment parameters such as water saturation and soil contamination fig 6a shows the average color of the images as a function of depth from each image the primary colors using the rgb and hsb color model were extracted with blue in the rgb model and saturation in the hsb model showing the highest variability fig 6b concomitant with the color log ec was collected fig 6a and fluorescence was recorded in a second log 0 5 m from the first fig 6c in the logs the image primaries blue and saturation change abruptly at a depth of 0 58 m bgl this coincides with a change in pore water saturation from unsaturated to saturated which was assessed directly from the raw images through visible inspection fig 6c fig s5 such observations agree with soil color depending on water saturation e g hausmann et al 2016 at a depth of 2 m the image saturation decreases to bin values of 50 whereas values for blue increase this coincides with an average color change in the images from brownish to grayish and with a change in ec in the second logging performed nearby significant fluorescence was detected at the same level in addition visible images show a glossy surface fig 6c fig s5 both observations are consistent with the presence of petroleum products we interpret that the change in color most likely reflects the presence of the redox boundary below which degradation of organic contamination have resulted in reducing conditions and affected the fe redox state iron minerals act as pigments coloring the soil soil science division staff 2017 the color of ferric iron minerals ranges from yellow brown to red e g barron and torrent 1986 heron et al 1994 torrent et al 1983 which are mainly present under aerobe conditions if o2 is completely consumed by microbial respiration then conditions change to an anoxic environment and other oxidants are used one mechanism is reduction of fe iii to fe ii new ferrous minerals are formed or iron is leached out because of the higher solubility of fe ii this leads to a soil color change from brownish reddish to gray greenish as observed here and elsewhere at contaminated sites e g pedersen et al 1991 zachara et al 2004 other factors such as mineralogical composition natural organic carbon clay content can also influence the soil color a strong correlation was found for organic carbon with soil color because the humic acid fraction of the organic carbons acts as black pigment and forms also organo mineral complexes e g schulze et al 1993 vodyanitskii and kirillova 2016 vodyanitskii and savichev 2017 decomposition of natural organic carbon could also be another explanation for reducing conditions thus we conclude that the oip may be used to detect the degree of water saturation as well as the location of redox boundaries this could be helpful way for determining the contaminant plume downgradient of the source where potentially no pure phase can be detected 4 conclusion our results show that a recently developed 2d subsurface imaging probe offers new ways to characterize the unconsolidated subsurface by fluorescence and visible light imaging imaging data is available on a vertical resolution of 1 5 cm and logs can be acquired reasonably quick placed flexibly as results are obtained and at comparably low costs allowing much more detailed site characterization laboratory experiments and field trials indicate that the probe allows the detection of contaminants which fluoresce in the visible range and injected fluorescent tracers at low concentration up to 0 05 mg l for rwt if green light is used for excitation of the fluorophore the imaging offers the possibility to perform dual tracer experiments combined with ec logging this may provide information on the heterogeneity in porosity of sediments because detected fluorescence and conductivity are related differently to pore size moreover fluorescence of sufficiently different color can be distinguished meaning that dual tracer injections can potentially be performed only the use of fluorophores has the advantage that only small amounts are required compared to electrolyte tracers where the high concentration can lead to density driven flow in addition reactive fluorophores can be injected which could allow probing of geochemical aspects of the subsurface additional studies would however be needed to understand such approaches our results indicate that sedimentological information can be directly derived from visible light images abrupt color variation in the logs reflected change in water saturation and redox conditions the gained information can either be used for reconstruction of the depositional history in a scientific context or as well for the understanding for contaminant distribution see also hausmann et al 2016 some nanoparticulate reactants for subsurface remediation such as nanoscale zerovalent iron are highly colored if injected the radius of influence for such material might be delineated based on logs of sediment color declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this

1515,characterization of hydrological conditions at polluted sites is critical for understanding of contaminant distribution and transport standard techniques for site characterization such as soil coring together with well installation for piezometric measurements and water sampling allow only some insights into subsurface properties and processes to obtain additional data direct push techniques are often used in soils and unconsolidated formations the various available techniques provide high resolution information on cm to mm scale recently the optical imaging profiler oip was developed for detection of fluorescent contaminants here we have investigated the applicability of the oip for groundwater tracing using fluorophores our laboratory experiments show that it is possible to qualitatively trace various fluorophores meaning that light emitted by the fluorophores can be detected by a standard digital camera sensor the measured fluorescence depends on the number of fluorophore molecules present in the pore space adjacent to the oip and decreases with smaller pore size as well as fluorophore concentration in a field trial an injected eosin y solution could be very clearly detected after the injection within a radius of 0 5 m around the injection point when the oip is equipped with a second light source emitting visible light images of the soil texture and color can be captured sediment color can act as a proxy for various soil properties tests at a second field site indicate that detected variation in soil color depend on water saturation and redox processes hence the oip is a flexible cost effective and multifunctional tool for characterization of contaminated sites keywords fluorescence contaminated site investigation in situ remediation hydrogeology tracer test 1 introduction detailed hydrogeological characterization is crucial for understanding groundwater flow and contaminant transport it forms the basis for planning of drinking water extraction groundwater remediation and the delineation of water protection zones most commonly characterization of a given site consists of soil coring accompanied by well installation for piezometric measurements water sampling and groundwater tracer testing however these methods allow only limited insight into the flow conditions and the transport of the constituents the fluid carries soil coring and well installation are expensive and rarely adequately in number for a site in addition wells cannot be flexibly placed and screen length typically limits the depth from which information can be obtained to obtain more detailed information two approaches are typically applied one approach relies on surface or cross borehole geophysical measurements e g gueting et al 2016 zhao and illman 2018 and the second one on low invasive direct push probes dpps which can provide in situ information at centimeter scale in unconsolidated sediments dpps have been developed for assessment of geotechnical physical hydraulic and chemical properties overviews about dpps are given in dietrich and leven 2006 bumberger et al 2015 and mccall et al 2006 for example static cone penetration testing and electrical conductivity ec logging have been used over decades to assess stratigraphic variations in unconsolidated sediments e g begemann 1965 schulmeister et al 2003 in the field of soil and groundwater contamination the laser induced fluorescence lif probes and the membrane interface probe were applied successfully and results from these dpps have correlated well with laboratory analysis of organic contaminants e g bloch et al 1998 bujewski and rutherford 1997 knowles and lieberman 1995 lieberman 1998 mccall et al 2011 the visioncpt geovis and video cone a standard

hausmann et al 2016 2017 and assessment of microbial activity schurig et al 2014 recent work has demonstrated that direct push ec logs follow archie s law in sandy formations so that bulk formation ec can be related to specific conductance of the groundwater mccall et al 2017 moreover some fluorophores fluorescent molecules readily partition into certain non aqueous phase liquids napl this means that such napl s can be fluorescently tagged through fluorophore injection and detected indirectly with lif horst et al 2018 dpps suffer from limitations that are inherent to the method of detection or to the probe design cone penetration testing cannot resolve layers thinner than several times the cone diameter of 35 7 or 43 7 mm hryciw et al 2009 ec direct push logging in sediments is influenced by clay content water saturation and pore water composition and is unable to resolve small scale heterogeneities in sediments with low clay content schulmeister et al 2003 furthermore ec probe design and probe attrition influences performance demuth et al 2015 the membrane interface probe mip which detects volatile organic compounds loses vertical resolution because of compound dispersion during transport to the analyzer at the surface bumberger et al 2011 for the lif probes chromatic dispersion occurs along the fiber optic cable leading to non synchronous arrival of the emitted light waves from a fluorophore at the detector apitz et al 1992 bumberger et al 2015 moreover recorded fluorescence depends on contaminant type and concentration the specific surface area of the soil water saturation soil mineralogy and exposure time of the sensor apitz et al 1993 knowles and lieberman 1995 in addition conflicting results have been published on the excitation emission behavior of fluorescent compounds in contact with soil thus reported excitation emission matrices which relates the intensity and wavelength of the fluorescence with the wavelength of the light used for excitation may or may not change in the presence of a soil matrix for a range of compounds kram and keller 2004 alostaz et al 2008 because such shortcomings mean that dpps only partially portray subsurface qualities we have conducting laboratory experiments and field tests with a newly developed 2d imaging dpp to explore its capabilities and limitations and determine if the obtained data is such that it overcome some of the current dpp limitations and or provide different new information the probe the optical imaging profiler oip is developed by kejr engineering inc geoprobe systems salina kansas usa it combines fluorescent and visible light image logging using the same sensor mccall et al 2018 additionally the probe is equipped with an ec dipole for measuring bulk conductivities of formation it was originally designed for the detection of fluorescent contaminants e g gasoline jet fuel diesel crude oil and creosote here we are specifically interested in the use of the oip for 1 groundwater tracing using fluorophores combining their detectability at low concentration with flexible placement of logs 2 extraction of qualitative information on imaged color to potentially distinguish differently emitting fluorophores and visualize changes in soil color which relate to depositional environment or geochemical processes 2 equipment and methods 2 1 the optical imaging profiler oip the dpp used consists of an ec dipole array located at the tip of the probe and an oip unit at the center fig 1 the oip unit features two light sources a and b producing constant light intensity when activated a a high intensity light emitting diode led that produce light with the wavelength required to induce fluorescence and b a secondary led emitting either a broad spectrum visible light or infrared light we will denote the light sources employed as oip source a source b table 1 e g oip uv vis refers to the use of a uv light source for inducing fluorescence and a broad spectrum visible light for general imaging through a 2 mm thick sapphire window with a diameter of 12 7 mm the light illuminates the adjacent soil and fluids light from backscattering and fluorescence returning through the window is passed through a fixed focus lens and then detected with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor cmos the probe can run in two modes in mode 1 uv or green light is emitted from source a to induce fluorescence in mode 2 visible or infrared light is emitted from source b to induce general backscattering of light exposure time gain and white balancing are adjusted automatically by the camera to optimize image quality depending on the light sources used different physical filters passing light with wavelength shorter short pass and longer long pass than specific cut off cut on values to emit light of a specific wavelength and to avoid detection of elastically backscattered source light by the camera table 1 the maximum suggested penetration rate is 4 ft min 1 2 m min kejr inc 2019 because at higher penetration rates the number of images showing motion blur which is an apparent streaking in the image increases significantly for a more detailed description of the system and system components we refer to mccall et al 2018 2 2 image processing and analysis captured images are in the standard rgb color scheme whose color gamut i e the color range which can be represented by the color scheme is described by the additive mixing of the primary colors red r green g and blue b for an 8 bit digital system colors represented by a 3d cubic color space take values between 0 and 255 values of 0 for all primary colors yield black and values of 255 white in the 3d space nuances of gray fall on the line connecting the points for black and white for image analysis rgb images were converted to the hsb color model a derivate of the rgb color model that describes the gamut using values from 0 to 255 for hue h saturation s and brightness b for the hsv color model we used again a cubic color space instead of the more common cylindrical space images were captured with a rate of 30 frames per second and analyzed on line by the manufacturer s software acquisition software from geoprobe in addition to the physical filters two sets of corresponding digital filters based on the hsb color model and specific to the oip type are applied to discretize the measured fluorescence mccall et al 2018 the percent area fluorescence af of a given image is then calculated from the relative number of pixels in an image that record fluorescence based on the discretization e g if 25 of all pixels pass the digital filter criteria then the measured fluorescence is 25 af regardless of how much fluorescence was measured by the 25 of pixels the af from multiple analyzed images is averaged to one value for every 1 5 cm 0 05 ft depth section as the probe is advanced into the sediment in addition an image with a dimension of 9 5 mm 7 0 mm 640 480 pixels is saved at the same frequency in jpg format using rgb color space and an image depth of 8 bit henceforth termed raw image to test if the signals from fluorophores with different wavelength of emission could be unraveled based on the color of the captured images and to determine the color of soil images we manually applied additional image analysis to raw images first noise was removed by applying a mean filter with a pixel radius of 2 using the software fiji schindelin et al 2012 for images from laboratory experiments a specific region of each image was selected region of interest roi because images were dark at their corner possibly because of uneven illumination a shadow from the sapphire window or by imperfect mounting of the camera the images were averaged over this roi to one color to reduce the amount of data and to simplify data comparison then the image within the roi was clipped and saved in jpg format using fiji from these jpg images the primaries of the rgb color space and hsb color space were extracted and the distribution of the values visualized as histograms the color space transformation and color histogram extraction was conducted in python 2 7 using the numpy library 2 3 laboratory testing to assess the detection of fluorescent tracers with oip uv vis oip green vis and oip green ir a series of laboratory tests were conducted initial tests were carried out using tap water whereas later tests were conducted using synthetic groundwater containing 120 mg l ca 20 mg l mg 20 mg l na 340 mg l hco3 30 8 mg l cl and 99 mg l so4 the synthetic groundwater was made using the procedure given in smith et al 2002 with deionized water resistivity 18 mω cm milliq nacl acs 99 and caco3 acs 99 95 sigma aldrich mgso4 98 appli chem and co2 gas 99 995 industrial grade nahco3 bearing fluorescein eosin y sulphorhodamine b powder 75 fluorophore hue corporation or liquid rhodamine wt 25 fluorophore sensient were used for the preparation of 1 l stock solutions commercially available chlorine and isopropyl alcohol was purchased for cleaning of the cuvettes to gauge the influence of sediments on the measurements of fluorescence industrial quartz sands 93 wt sio2 with a known narrow grain size distribution uniformity from 1 25 to 2 07 and geometric mean grain size from 0 121 to 1 041 mm were purchased from dansand a s and used as delivered stock solutions were prepared prior to each set of experiments and diluted with tap water or synthetic groundwater to generate solutions with variable fluorophore concentrations for the duration of an experimental set up to 8 days solutions were wrapped in aluminum foil or stored in an opaque box to avoid photolytic bleaching the ph of solutions was measured either with a two point calibrated wtw multiline p3 for initial tests with a three point calibrated ph meter from metrohm metrohm 827 ph lab or from wtw wtw multi 3430 based on previous test of a similar ph meter and electrode the uncertainty of the measurement is 0 02 ph units or so 2 standard deviation davesne et al 2010 measured values ranged from 7 5 to 8 1 for imaging without sand 4 ml diluted fluorophore solutions were transferred to a quartz cuvette when imaging was performed on solutions with sediments 1 4 ml diluted fluorophore solutions were first transferred to a quartz cuvette after which sand was added until the cuvette was filled up to the neck this procedure minimizes the presence of trapped air bubbles in the cuvette kram and keller 2004 to exclude ambient light during the measurement the cuvette was put in a black cuvette holder with a single opening held in direct contact with the sapphire window of the oip the fluorescence background of the sands was determined by putting dry sand directly on the sapphire window and covering the sediment with aluminum foil to exclude ambient light before and after a measurement session the functionality of the probe was assured by measuring reference materials with known fluorescence diesel fuel creosote motor oil a non fluorescent black reference and a geoprobe emblem as key fob optical target all tests except the initial test with tap water and with szvi were conducted in triplicates after use the cuvette was rinsed with chlorine isopropyl alcohol and trice with deionized water 2 4 field application during the course of this study three opportunities arose for conducting experiments in the field and test the performance of the probe in the complex settings of the environment 2 4 1 field site i the capability of the oip green vis for detection of eosin y in the field was tested by performing a dual tracer injection at field site i in västernorrland sweden eosin y is considered as harmless and has been suggested as an inert tracer for porous aquifers because of its chemical stability and limited retardation during transport e g behrens et al 2001 field et al 1995 flury and wai 2003 oba and poulson 2012 the subsurface at field site i consists of a surface layer of artificial fill underlain by 5 6 m of sandy clay till into which the tracers were injected the nature of the deeper subsurface was not determined in this study but in the surrounding area quaternary sediments were deposited on top of granite or greywacke the sandy clay till hosts a local aquifer with a water table approximately 3 m below ground level bgl hydraulic conductivities are in the range of 2 10 4 to 2 10 5 m s and the hydraulic gradient is about 0 01 to 0 02 m m first 1 m3 solution for injection was prepared by dissolving 0 8 kg kh2po4 budenheim 16 4 kg k2hpo4 budenheim and 160 g na2co3 merck subsequently one liter stock solution containing 1 875 g eosin y hue corporation was added prior to use the solution was mixed for 2 h after which ph was 8 1 and temperature 20 4 c the presence of kh2po4 k2hpo4 and na2co3 increased the electrical conductivity to 19 ms cm allowing the tracer solution to be detected also by ec logging during injection a pneumatic driven pump blagdon provided a maximum pressure of 10 bar 250 l of the prepared solution were injected at a constant depth of 3 9 m bgl using geoprobe s pressure activated injection probe the subsurface distribution of the tracers was detected using a dpp equipped with an ec dipole and an oip green vis module seven logs were obtained in a radius of 0 5 m around the injection point within 32 h after the injection the logs reached a depth of 3 3 6 4 m bgl and were acquired by pushing the dpp at an average penetration rate of 1 m min the functionality of the oip unit was tested before and after each log by measuring the reference materials with known fluorescence the ec dipole was tested with a jig holding two different resistors and measuring the resistors conductivity low 55 ms high 360 ms m 2 4 2 field site ii at field site ii in kalmar county sweden we investigated the oip green vis performance in relation to the detection limit of fluorescent contaminants using the green light if the oip sensitivity is not sufficient then contamination could perhaps be overseen by missing of a fluorescent response from the contaminant called false negative this potentially leads to underestimation of the contaminant distribution which limits the success of a later remediation action at a later stage the subsurface of field site ii consists of up to 23 m unconsolidated fluvial sediments and are partly contaminated with creosote the alluvial sediments are underlain by estuarine clayey deposits a log was generated by pushing the dpp into the subsurface at a penetration rate of 1 m min soil samples were taken nearby via direct push dual tube coring for comparison of af primary colors of captured images with concentration of organics in the soil the sampled material was sent to højvang laboratory for analyses of the 16 major polyaromatic hydrocarbons method epa 8270c 1996 mod defined by the danish environmental protection agency and total organic carbon toc method ds 9377 2 2001 mod fid images from one log were analyzed for fluorescence manually to confirm the resolution of the oip green vis 2 4 3 field site iii soil color is described routinely in geological investigations and used as proxy for sedimentological changes e g changes in mineralogy water saturation redox state or determination of stratigraphic boundaries at field site iii in jutland denmark we tested to what degree in situ color logging can provide information about the sediment this site consists of alternating layers of glacial till and meltwater sand with a 10 20 m thick glacial till at the top field site iii is contaminated with fuel products a dpp equipped with an oip uv vis module and an ec dipole was driven down into the top glacial till twice to a depth of 3 m bgl the first log was advanced with a penetration rate of 1 m min in fluorescence mode whereas the second log was acquired at a penetration rate of 0 5 m min solely in visible mode placed adjacent to the first one 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory tests of the detectability of fluorescent tracers to probe the performance of the oip for inducing and detecting fluorescence laboratory experiments were performed with two different light sources for inducing fluorescence light source a table 1 and four fluorophores in the absence or presence of a sand matrix fig 2a shows example raw images of solutions with fluorescein concentrations from 0 to 81 mg l obtained with the oip green vis using the green light the images feature a diffuse reddish and circular area at low fluorophore concentration that is displaced slightly downwards from the image center with increasing fluorophore concentration the reddish area expands and turns bright orange at the center these observations agree with previous reports on images produced by the probe mccall et al 2018 reflecting the geometry of the illumination detector setup and the use of a point light source which resulted in a decrease in recorded light at the edge of the detector the redness is ubiquitous for the tested fluorophores and is caused by the physical long pass filter which removes diffusely reflected light from the green source shorter than 590 nm table 1 fig s1 hence only the lower energy portion of the fluorescence is recorded the reddish to bright orange appearance of the images is also seen in the manual image analysis fig 2c e where values for hue match with the reddish sections of the hue ramp indicated on right side of fig 2c of the three parameters that describe the color gamut brightness is particularly sensitive to changes in concentrations of the fluorophores at higher dilution with marked increase in this value occurring between 0 003 and 0 1 mg l fig 2e based on the curves detection limits range from 0 05 mg l for rhodamine wt to 0 2 mg l for fluorescein at the conditions of our experiments generally the relationships between brightness saturation and hue for the four fluorophores are quite similar meaning that their individual fluorescence cannot be differentiated with the oip green vis the oip green vis sensitivity is governed by the fluorophores peak excitation wavelength λex peak emission wavelength λem and quantum yield ɸ which describes the ratio between absorbed and emitted photons table 2 for ideal detection the fluorophore λex should be close to the light sources wavelength and λem equal or longer than the long pass filter wavelength of 590 nm λex is fluorophore specific but within 39 nm of the wavelength of the light source meaning that the light source is nearly ideal for excitation of the used fluorophores λem of the tested fluorophores is shorter than the used long pass filters which passes only the part of the emitted light from the fluorophore longer than the long pass filter wavelength of 590 m fig s1 for example most of the emitted light from fluorescein is removed by the filter decreasing its detection although the molecule features the highest ɸ of the tested fluorophores as a result of differences in ɸ removal of emitted light from the fluorophore and the difference between wavelength of the light source and peak excitation of the fluorophores the oip green vis is most sensitive to rhodamine wt sulforhodamine b eosin y fluorescein the absorbance spectra of the used fluorophores fig s1 show that light is additionally absorbed in the uv range meaning the uv light can be used as well for excitation if the uv light from the oip uv vis is used for recording images then the images for the different fluorophores show difference in color because the oip uv vis does not feature a 590 nm long pass filter images of solutions with fluorescein fig 2 g and eosin y are greenish whereas those with sulfhorhodamine b and rhodamine wt are yellowish to reddish consistent with the fluorophores λem in the images brightness is indistinguishable from the blank until fluorophore concentrations reach 0 1 mg l the value then increases to about 200 at 10 mg l after which it remains constant concomitantly the values for hue becomes separate for red and green emitting fluorophores for fluorescein and eosin y the values for hue decrease slightly with increasing concentration possibly this redshift is caused by preferential reabsorption of emitted fluorescence at the shorter wavelength based on these observations we conclude that the oip uv vis allows detection of the fluorophores at 0 1 mg l and that fluorescence from different fluorophores should be discernible provided λem is sufficiently different application of the automatic image analysis to the raw images in fig 2a g to decrease the information in the image to a single value af results in variation from 0 blank to 92 2 fig 2f l fig 2b h highlights in gray the pixels in the raw images that contributed to af af for all four tracers shows a log normal trend with tracer concentration fig 2f when the green light of the oip green vis was used the detection limit varies between 0 005 mg l for rhodamine wt to 0 1 mg l for fluorescein for comparison the detection limit reported for the lif is 0 01 mg l for rhodamine wt and fluorescein suthersan et al 2014 at high concentrations af reaches a plateau of around 90 independent of the fluorophore tested because the hue of rhodamine wt sulforhodamine b and to some extent eosin y does not match the color region that is filtered during the automatic image analysis fig 2i only fluorescein is recognized as fluorescent using uv light of the oip uv vis fig 2 l for this fluorophore the curve for af is similar to that obtained with the oip green vis custom made digital filters could potentially improve the standard applicability of the dpp with other fluorophores 3 1 1 soil matrix effect on af to test the influence of a soil matrix on detected fluorescence we imaged eosin y solutions in variably sized sand with the oip green ir the raw image was typically either reddish when fluorescence was recorded using the green light or grayish when backscattered ir light was recorded generally all images showed a blurry rim and coarser grains could be clearly identified fig 3a b fig 3c summarizes determined af at variable eosin y concentrations in the presence of six different sands with a geometric mean grain size from 0 121 mm to 1 043 mm data is additionally plotted in separate 2d diagrams in si s3 for higher fluorophore concentrations and grain size above average mean diameter of 0 327 mm af was very similar to that determined in experiments without sand i e sand addition had little influence on af for the fine grain sized sand however the recorded af was consistently lower relative to the values determined without sand at eosin y concentrations below 0 25 mg l the decrease in af from the presence of sand was most pronounced for a 0 1 mg l eosin y solutions for example recorded af decreased from 60 9 to 33 as mean grain size decreased fluorescence from the sand itself give rise to a negligible 0 6 2 0 af in our experiments all sands were well sorted grain size distribution curves in si s2 we calculated the porosity based on the grain size distribution using the empirical relationship between uniformity and porosity found by istomina 1957 which is a good approximation for loosely packed grains fuchs et al 2017 porosity is in the range of 0 46 0 43 thus the decreased af for fine grained sand does not depend on variation in pore volume and hence the total number of fluorescent molecules in the cuvette the sand will however absorb and scatter both incoming light from the light source and emitted light from the fluorophore thus the volume of solution that can be irradiated by the light source will decrease with the volume of individual pores similar interpretations have been reached by apitz et al 1992 and sinfield et al 1999 for results obtained with lif their findings suggest that only the filled pores between the sapphire window and sand contributes to the measured fluorescence alostaz et al 2008 found that detection limits deteriorated with decreased soil porosity and at poorer degree of sorting hence for the oip and dissolved fluorophores in a sand matrix a decrease in the excitable solution volume between sand and sapphire window could be responsible for the decrease in fluorescence in a simple consideration light from the source is absorbed by fluorophores during penetration into the sample hence a fluorophore molecule at a certain distance from the sample boundary will receive less light secondly the light emitted by a fluorophore molecule may become absorbed by other molecules on its way to the detector if absorption and the emission spectra overlap a process known as inner filter effect lakowicz 2006 for the fluorophores used here absorption and the emission spectra does indeed overlap s1 as a consequence emitted light from fluorophores close to the sample boundary contribute more to the fluorescence detected for the oip this means that at high fluorophore concentration only the fluorophores closest to the sapphire window contribute to the detected fluorescence in this case area fluorescence would be less influenced by the depth of pores and hence absolute pore size and fluorescence would be similar for all sand types as we observe in contrast at lower fluorophore concentration fluorescence can be detected at greater distance from the detector meaning that pore depth would influence the recorded signal for such concentrations determined af would be expected to decrease with grain size consistent with observations clearly quantitative determination of fluorophore concentration is only possible if the grain size distribution is considered and only if the tracer concentration is not too high this means that the oip probe is mainly a qualitative tool additional work is required to understand the influence of sorting shape and packing 3 2 field application 3 2 1 field site i to assess the applicability of the oip in groundwater tracing studies in the field 1 875 mg l eosin y was injected in the local aquifer at field site 1 in a saline solution that could be detected through ec measurement also subsequently seven logs were produced using the green light of the oip green vis and arranged in a pattern indicated in fig 4 for log1 fluorescence was low and log5 could not be hammered down to the target depth but significant fluorescence was recorded in the other five logs with values reaching nearly 50 af fig 4 the dominant fluorescent signal in these logs originated from 2 5 4 m bgl and was accompanied by elevated values for ec reaching 730 ms m showing that the measured signals stem from the injected tracers thus a 1 875 mg l eosin y solution can be used for conducting tracer tests the logs show two interesting features firstly af and ec signals do not coincide completely af shows sharper peaks than those recorded with ec measurement and in several places increases in conductivity is measured without concomitant increase in af most likely the variable response of the two tracing methods relates to the details of the measurement the ec dipole measures the bulk ec of a soil volume around the tip of the dpp the bulk formation ec is governed by the clay content and ec of the pore fluid mccall et al 2017 so that higher clay contents and stronger saline solutions will increase the ec in which ec increases linearly with increasing salinity in comparison the oip camera captures fluorescence from the pore space adjacent to the sapphire window and the relationship between low fluorophore concentrations and af is log normal contrary to ec measurement our laboratory experiments show that measured fluorescence declines with decreasing grain size consequently variable match between af and ec could indicate aquifer heterogeneity recorded af are the result of variations in fluorophore concentration and changes in the soil matrix if we assume that tracer concentration is high then the occurrence of non favorable soil matrix will be expressed by low af but high ec values high af and low ec will be indicative for a low tracer concentration in a favorable soil matrix for detection of fluorescence moreover the ec signal of thin layers in the sediment is influenced by the ec of adjacent layers leading to a loss of spatial resolution i e a thin layer with low ec surrounded by areas with high ec will go undetected or vice versa thin layers are resolvable by fluorescence measurements the second main observation is related to the nature of an injection if a tracer is injected in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer a radial tracer distribution is assumed e g hall et al 1991 a concentration gradient will be observed between the distal and the proximal part of the injected volume because of dispersion of the tracer e g graupner et al 2011 hoopes and harleman 1967 in this case the inhomogeneous distributed fluorescence and ec values reflect the spatial heterogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer leading to different hydraulic conductivities as noticed in other studies e g seaman et al 2007 suthersan et al 2014 in conclusion the oip green vis was able to detect an injected fluorophore and in combination with an ec dipole a dual tracer test could be conducted small scale heterogeneities in the soil matrix could be revealed by comparison of af and ec because the two measurement have different sensitivity to such variation however differences in the nature of the subsurface may complicate such analysis in other sediments during dpp penetration for example fine grained sediments may smear on the sapphire window or vibrations from probe advancement may suspend fine particles in the pore water causing it to become turbid and less transparent both phenomena will interfere with illumination of the soil and collection of backscattered light to an unknown degree thus we do not currently know how general the detection of small scale heterogeneities is potentially the combination of oip ec with the hydraulic profiling tool hpt could offer a solution for this problem because hpt can provide information about heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivities but further work in this direction is necessary 3 2 2 field site ii successful remediation requires detailed knowledge about contaminant distribution in this case creosote which can potentially be determined by detection of induced fluorescence from the contaminant by the oip hence we investigated the detection capability of the oip green vis using the green light the average primary colors hue saturation and brightness from the images were extracted because each little change in color will be expressed by a change in color composition as it is expected to happen if the light emitted by the stimulated creosote is recorded subsequently the primary colors were compared to recorded af ec and contaminant content in soil samples the brightness of most images possesses a color value of 75 fig 5a inspection of the related raw images showed that they were overall slightly reddish because filters did not completely remove elastically backscattered source light brightness shows peaks at distinct depths 19 08 20 07 20 71 21 78 and 22 71 m bgl and below 23 m bgl the values are generally higher the deviations in the brightness coincidence with elevated ec values fig 5b suggesting that they are related to changes in the sedimentary deposits i e ec rises with decreasing grain size and higher clay content schulmeister et al 2003 furthermore hunter 1975 demonstrated that fine grained material will appear in a different color in comparison to its coarse grained counterpart because it reflects a higher proportion of light hence a fine grained sand or silt with some clay content potentially backscatters more light from the green light source than for comparison coarse sand and gravel which is subsequently not completely removed by the long pass filter on the camera fluorescence was only recorded in the bottom section where also toc was elevated however pah s concentrations in the core were low based on laboratory measurement fig 5c indicating that the concentration of contaminants capable of inducing fluorescence was insufficient for its detection thus we interpret that the green light induced fluorescence by naturally occurring organic material e g schultze et al 2004 therefore post processing of images shows that the camera is highly light sensitive allowing detection of additional features such as fine grained layers and or natural occurring fluorophores fluorescence did not originate from contamination in this case 3 2 3 field site iii at field site iii which contained petroleum contamination s4 we investigated if detected soil color can be used at a contaminated site as proxy for aspects of the sediments or geochemical conditions the soil color was derived from images captured by the oip uv vis using the visible light to relate differences in soil colors to sediment parameters such as water saturation and soil contamination fig 6a shows the average color of the images as a function of depth from each image the primary colors using the rgb and hsb color model were extracted with blue in the rgb model and saturation in the hsb model showing the highest variability fig 6b concomitant with the color log ec was collected fig 6a and fluorescence was recorded in a second log 0 5 m from the first fig 6c in the logs the image primaries blue and saturation change abruptly at a depth of 0 58 m bgl this coincides with a change in pore water saturation from unsaturated to saturated which was assessed directly from the raw images through visible inspection fig 6c fig s5 such observations agree with soil color depending on water saturation e g hausmann et al 2016 at a depth of 2 m the image saturation decreases to bin values of 50 whereas values for blue increase this coincides with an average color change in the images from brownish to grayish and with a change in ec in the second logging performed nearby significant fluorescence was detected at the same level in addition visible images show a glossy surface fig 6c fig s5 both observations are consistent with the presence of petroleum products we interpret that the change in color most likely reflects the presence of the redox boundary below which degradation of organic contamination have resulted in reducing conditions and affected the fe redox state iron minerals act as pigments coloring the soil soil science division staff 2017 the color of ferric iron minerals ranges from yellow brown to red e g barron and torrent 1986 heron et al 1994 torrent et al 1983 which are mainly present under aerobe conditions if o2 is completely consumed by microbial respiration then conditions change to an anoxic environment and other oxidants are used one mechanism is reduction of fe iii to fe ii new ferrous minerals are formed or iron is leached out because of the higher solubility of fe ii this leads to a soil color change from brownish reddish to gray greenish as observed here and elsewhere at contaminated sites e g pedersen et al 1991 zachara et al 2004 other factors such as mineralogical composition natural organic carbon clay content can also influence the soil color a strong correlation was found for organic carbon with soil color because the humic acid fraction of the organic carbons acts as black pigment and forms also organo mineral complexes e g schulze et al 1993 vodyanitskii and kirillova 2016 vodyanitskii and savichev 2017 decomposition of natural organic carbon could also be another explanation for reducing conditions thus we conclude that the oip may be used to detect the degree of water saturation as well as the location of redox boundaries this could be helpful way for determining the contaminant plume downgradient of the source where potentially no pure phase can be detected 4 conclusion our results show that a recently developed 2d subsurface imaging probe offers new ways to characterize the unconsolidated subsurface by fluorescence and visible light imaging imaging data is available on a vertical resolution of 1 5 cm and logs can be acquired reasonably quick placed flexibly as results are obtained and at comparably low costs allowing much more detailed site characterization laboratory experiments and field trials indicate that the probe allows the detection of contaminants which fluoresce in the visible range and injected fluorescent tracers at low concentration up to 0 05 mg l for rwt if green light is used for excitation of the fluorophore the imaging offers the possibility to perform dual tracer experiments combined with ec logging this may provide information on the heterogeneity in porosity of sediments because detected fluorescence and conductivity are related differently to pore size moreover fluorescence of sufficiently different color can be distinguished meaning that dual tracer injections can potentially be performed only the use of fluorophores has the advantage that only small amounts are required compared to electrolyte tracers where the high concentration can lead to density driven flow in addition reactive fluorophores can be injected which could allow probing of geochemical aspects of the subsurface additional studies would however be needed to understand such approaches our results indicate that sedimentological information can be directly derived from visible light images abrupt color variation in the logs reflected change in water saturation and redox conditions the gained information can either be used for reconstruction of the depositional history in a scientific context or as well for the understanding for contaminant distribution see also hausmann et al 2016 some nanoparticulate reactants for subsurface remediation such as nanoscale zerovalent iron are highly colored if injected the radius of influence for such material might be delineated based on logs of sediment color declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this

1516,rivers are the most common and vital sources of water which play a fundamental role in ecological systems and human life water quality assessment is a major element of managing water resources and accurate prediction of water quality is very essential for better management of rivers the electrical conductivity ec is known as one of the most important water quality parameters to predict salinity and mineralization of water the present study introduces a novel hybrid wavelet locally weighted linear regression w lwlr method to predict the monthly ec of the sefidrud river in iran 240 monthly discharge q and ec samples over a period of 20 years were collected the data were divided into two frequency components at two decomposition levels using the mother wavelet bior 6 8 to compare the performance of various methods the standalone lwlr support vector regression svr wavelet support vector regression w svr autoregressive integrated moving average arima wavelet arima w arima multivariate linear regression mlr and wavelet mlr w mlr were also used the discrete wavelet transform dwt was coupled with the lwlr svr and arima to create the w lwlr w svr w arima methods to predict the ec parameter the comparisons demonstrated that the w lwlr was more accurate and efficient than the lwlr svr w svr arima and w arima methods the correlation coefficient r values were 0 973 0 95 0 565 0 473 0 425 0 917 for the w lwlr w svr lwlr svr arima and w arima methods respectively further the root mean square error rmse of w lwlr was 89 78 while the corresponding values for w svr lwlr svr arima w arima mlr and w mlr were 123 50 319 95 341 20 350 153 155 292 351 774 and 157 856 respectively the overall comparison metrics and error analysis demonstrated the superiority of the new proposed w lwlr method for water quality prediction 1 introduction surface water resources such as rivers streams lakes and reservoirs are the most vitally important water sources for drinking irrigation in agriculture mining and industrial purposes hence considering the lack of fresh surface water resources water quality monitoring and control are the most important strategies to obtain the information that leads to decision making and knowledge about water contamination and the spatial and temporal variations electrical conductivity ec based salinity is one of the most significant water quality parameters to determine the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation purposes kumarasamy et al 2014 ec is normally measured in a unit of microsiemens per centimeter μs cm heydari et al 2013 since ec is dominated by total dissolved solid tds and is directly related to dissolved ionic solutes such as sodium na chloride cl magnesium mg 2 sulfate so4 2 and calcium ca 2 in water it can be an indicator of pollutants in surface water the increased ionic composition of water has a significant influence on plant growth and can reduce the quality of drinking water in surface water quality classifications ec is a main measure of the salinity hazard for irrigation and drinking water the u s department of agriculture wilcox 1948 and the world health organization 2008 classify surface water quality based on the ec sodium concentration of water and ec respectively the ec of freshwater usually varies between 0 and 1500 μs cm while the ec of sea water can be as high as 50 000 μs cm according to the wilcox ec based classification for irrigation water 0 750 ms cm 750 2000 ms cm and 2000 ms cm are respectively classified as fine allowable and unacceptable wilcox 1948 the ec level higher than 10 000 μs cm is not suitable for human consumption or irrigation the maximum permissible ec value recommended by the world health organization who for drinking water is 1400 μs cm 1993 nowadays prediction of water quality parameters such as tds ec and turbidity in water is among the challenging issues in water resources management multivariate statistics and time series analysis have been widely used for water quality prediction the commonly used methods include moving average ma autoregressive moving average arma autoregressive integrated moving average arima and multiple linear regression mlr çamdevýren et al 2005 civelekoglu et al 2007 however the aforementioned traditional models may not be able to provide proper predictions due to the lack of reliable instruments to collect observation data for a given timeframe the complexity of effective factors in forecasting and the inability to capture non stationarity and nonlinearity of the water quality parameters deng et al 2015 in recent decades the artificial intelligence ai method has been successfully utilized in various aspects of environmental engineering such as water quality prediction which is able to overcome the drawback of the traditional methods the artificial neural network ann and the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis techniques have been widely employed to predict nocturnal dynamics of dissolved oxygen do in aquatic systems karakaya et al 2013 to forecast tds ec and turbidity in rivers najah et al 2009 to estimate do and specific conductance as two water quality parameters in rivers heydari et al 2013 to assess ec sodium absorption ratio sar and total hardness th in rivers azad et al 2018 and to predict the chemical concentrations in rivers mahmoodabadi and arshad 2018 in recent years hybrid support vector regression svr and shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla were employed to forecast eight water quality parameters including na k mg 2 so4 2 cl ph ec and tds mahmoudi et al 2016 a deep learning predictive model was developed to model the do levels of the reservoir banerjee et al 2019 the least square support vector machine lssvm multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and m5 model tree m5tree were used to assess free ammonia amm total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn water temperature wt total coliform tc fecal coliform fc and ph kisi and parmar 2016 comparing the overall results indicated that the mars and lssvm models had better performance in the accuracy than other methods more recently artificial neural network ann has been widely applied for surface water quality modeling for instance have conducted various studies on the do concentration modeling using different ai based models developed two nonlinear predictive models namely modified response surface method mrsm and multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn to model the daily dissolved oxygen concentration applied three data driven methods such as ann anfis svm arima and three different ensemble techniques i e simple average ensemble sae weighted average ensemble wae and neural network ensemble nne to forecast single and multi step ahead modeling of do at river water provided a model to assess the do of water using the polynomial chaos expansion approach further some researchers focused on different applicable aspects of ann methods to forecast the water quality indexes recently hybrid discrete wavelet transform dwt and robust artificial intelligence have been used to estimate water quality parameters based on limited time series data in particular the hybrid wavelet artificial neural network wann techniques have been applied to predict the ec of river water ravansalar and rajaee 2015 specifically the original time series of monthly ec and discharge q values were decomposed by using the dwt and then coupled with the ann model the results indicated that the wann model enhanced the modeling accuracy montaseri et al montaseri et al 2018 utilized wavelet anfis wavelet gep and other hybrid ai models to forecast tds based on ec na cl under various climatic conditions rajaee et al rajaee et al 2018 applied wavelet multiple linear regression wmlr and wann to predict daily ph levels with the original time series of ph and discharge q barzegar et al barzegar et al 2016 used ann anfis wavelet ann and wavelet anfis to assess water salinity levels based on different subsets of monthly ca 2 mg 2 na so4 2 and cl in rivers barzegar et al barzegar et al 2018 simulated multi step ahead ec by a hybrid wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm model and compared with an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the dwt in the lwlr method to predict monthly ec levels in the sefidrud river iran based on multiple hydrological data including ec and discharge to the best of our knowledge the hybrid wavelet locally weighted linear regression w lwlr method has not been utilized before to forecast the water quality parameters also few studies have been conducted to use the lwlr as a data driven method ahmadianfar et al 2019 jamei and ahmadianfar 2019 in this research the w lwlr w svr w arima and w mlr models are developed to assess monthly ec levels and the results are compared with those from the original lwlr svr arima and mlr models 2 materials and methods 2 1 support vector machine the svm is a machine learning method based on the theory of statistical learning and the structural risk minimization principle which was firstly introduced by cortes and vapnik vapnik and cortes 1995 svm has been widely applied for classification and regression which usually outperforms traditional methods used in the previous studies huang et al 2002 sarzaeim et al 2017 the svr is the utilization of svm for regression various types of kernel function such as exponential radial basis function erbf radial basis function rbf polynomial poly linear and sigmoid are used in svm compared with the traditional methods such as ann one of the main advantages of svm is that it does not suffer from converge to local minima which provides a suitable balance between model complexity and accuracy and presents an improved prediction capability kwon and moon 2007 assuming that a training dataset is given by x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x k y k where x k x r y k y r k 1 2 n and n is the total number of dataset svr searches to estimate the following function 1 f x w t θ x b where w is the vector of weights θ x is a nonlinear mapping function and b is the bias of w t θ x from the actual values the following optimization is implemented to acquire w 2 minimize z 1 2 w 2 c k 1 n ξ k ξ k subject to y k w t θ x b ε ξ k k 1 2 n 3 ξ k ξ k 0 k 1 2 n where ε is the insensitive loss function ξ k and ξ k are the slack variables and c is a constant penalty coefficient finally the svr is solved by using lagrange multipliers λ k and λ k with the following formula 4 f x k 1 n λ k λ k k x x i b where k x x i is the kernel function 2 2 linear regression linear regression lr is a statistical approach for modeling the relationship between some dependent variables and one or more independent variables due to its simplest formulation the lr method has been widely used various types of the lr include the simple linear regression logistic regression multinomial regression and multivariate linear regression ghani and ahmad 2010 kisi and ozkan 2017 the multivariate regression mr is one of the most preferred approaches rencher and schaalje 2008 wang et al 2013 this method determines a dependent variable y k by using a linear equation depending on more than two independent variables x n which is defined by 5 y k α k 0 n 1 m α kn x kn ε k where α k0 α k1 α kn are the coefficients of regression calculated by using the least square ls method ε k is the random error an m is total number of variables eq 6 defines an objective function to compute the best fit line in the mr method for the observed dataset y o 6 minimize f 1 2 n k 1 n y ok y k 2 where f is the objective function the squared error 2 3 locally weighted linear regression the lwlr is introduced herein according to the mr method in the first step the parameters of mr α are calculated by eq 6 the squared error objective function can be expressed as 7 minimize f 1 2 n k 1 n α k 0 n 1 m α kn x kn ε k y k 2 eq 7 can be defined in a matrix form as xα y t xα y by derivation of this matrix with respect to α x t xα y is obtained let this new matrix be zero and solve for α to generate the ls equation 8 α x t x 1 x t y where x is the matrix of input training dataset and y is the target dataset one of the main problems in the mr is its tendency to under fit the data which can lead to a negative impact on the accuracy of prediction hence many methods have been proposed to minimize this drawback by joining bias coefficients to the estimators lu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the locally weighted method introduced by atkeson et al 1997 can be used to improve the performance of the mr method the lwlr uses a weight fucntion to describe the relationship between the training dataset and the current prediction this function gives higher weights to the data points that are close to each other and smaller weights to the data points that are farther away in fact it is assumed that the points nearest to the target ones have the best indicators accordingly in the lwlr method the squared error objective function is defined as follows 9 minimize f 1 2 n k 1 n w k α k 0 n 1 m α kn x kn ε k y k 2 where w is a weight function matrix eq 9 can be expressed in a matrix form as xα y t w xα y to minimize f in eq 9 the derivative of f with respect to α must be zero as follows 10 f α α x t wxα x t wy 0 thus 11 α x t wx 1 x t wy the lwlr employs a kernel function to specify the weighted matrix wang et al 2016 in this study the radial basis function rbf is used to determine this matrix which is described as 12 w ij exp γ x i x j 2 where γ is a constant number and x i x j is the difference between observation points i and j 2 4 discrete wavelet transform the data mining techniques need the hidden information in the time series dataset but in most of physical phenomena due to the variation in the data frequency derivation of the pertinent information is difficult one of the most popular methods to analyze the dataset in the time frequency domain is wavelet transform this theory was introduced to derive the information of time frequency by decomposing the dataset into low and high frequency components many researchers have applied this theory in various areas of civil engineering such as water quality barzegar et al 2018 ravansalar et al 2016 suspended sediments kisi and ozkan 2017 streamflow forecasting kisi and cimen 2011 and hydrological prediction kalteh 2015 kisi and shiri 2011 as a strong tool wavelet transform is able to compress the signals and de noise the non stationary time series to improve the performance of an ai based model sang 2013 the wavelet theory is used to represent or approximate a function ψ t called the mother wavelet zhang et al 2004 13 ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a a b r a 0 where ψ a b t is the successive wavelet a is the scale factor b is a time factor and t is time the wavelet transform of function f t can be defined as 14 w ψ f a b a 1 2 r f t ψ t b a dt f t l 2 r where ψ t is the complex conjugate of wavelet function ψ t for hydrological and water quality time series the input dataset f t is usually discretely sampled let a a 0 i and b lb 0 a 0 i a 0 1 b 0 r l and i are integer numbers accordingly the discrete wavelet transform dwt of f t can be expressed as 15 w ψ f i l a 0 i 2 r f t ψ a 0 i t lb 0 dt the common selection for a 0 and b 0 are 2 and 1 respectively kisi and cimen 2012 using these values eq 16 becomes 16 w ψ f i l 2 i 2 r f t ψ 2 i t l dt for a discrete input dataset of f t the dwt is given by 17 w ψ f i l 2 i 2 t 0 n f t ψ 2 i t l where w ψ f i l indicates the properties of the original time series with the scale factor a and time domain b the dwt presents two sets of functions called low pass and high pass filters the input dataset f t is decomposed with the low pass and high pass filters which results in two vectors a and d respectively the vectors a and d are called the approximation and detail coefficients respectively budu 2013 2 5 study area the sefidrud river is the second longest river in iran with a length of 670 km and a drainage area of 13 450 km2 which connects to the caspian sea at rasht city this river plays an important role in the associated aquatic ecosystems and provides water for drinking and irrigation for the regions along the river in this study 240 monthly q and ec samples were taken in the period of 1985 2005 from the astane station 49 37 40 e 36 57 02 n fig 1 2 6 model evaluation several statistical criteria including the coefficient of correlation r root mean square error rmse willmott and matsuura 2005 nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 mean absolute error mae chai and draxler 2014 the relative absolute error rae and mean squared relative error msre are employed to assess the performance of the models in the ec simulations these coefficients are detailed in appendix a moreover the taylor diagram is used in this study to provide a visual comparison between the simulated and observed data based on three different statistics correlation coefficient centered root mean square error crmse and standard deviation appendix a in the taylor diagram the correlation coefficient is given by the cosine of the azimuthal angle the standard deviation is described as the proportion of the radial distance from the origin and crmse is defined as the proportion of the distance to the target observed point on the x axis the taylor diagram shows the best fit of the developed models with the least distance from the observed data points taylor 2001 2 7 datasets and preliminary analysis as aforementioned 240 monthly q and ec samples of the sefidrud river were collected from the astane station in the modeling the first 70 of the data 168 samples were utilized for model training and the remaining 30 of the data 72 samples were chosen for model testing the original time series of q and ec are depicted in fig 2 the optimal selection of the input patterns and the combination of different lagged variables are critical for developing hydrological predicting models despite lack of a direct method to determine the above values accurate statistical analysis examining autocorrelations and cross correlations between the variables are most commonly applied in literatures sudheer et al 2002 table 1 shows the statistical parameters of the discharge and ec for all original data and the training and testing sub datasets including the minimum maximum mean mod standard deviation s d coefficient of variation c v skewness coefficient c s also lag 1 lag 2 lag 3 and lag 4 auto correlation coefficients r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 were determined table 1 comparison of the statistical characteristics of the training and testing time series shows a similar trend it can be observed that the skewness coefficient of the ec datasets a measure of the degree of asymmetry of the ec data distribution is significantly low indicating a normal distribution the skewness coefficients of the river discharge for both training and testing datasets are relatively high the 1 month lag auto correlation coefficients for both ec and river discharge are significantly higher than the others while the 2 month 3 month and 4 month lag auto correlation coefficients are actually close to zero for both training and testing datasets it is worth noting that the 4 month auto correlation coefficient due to the high negative values has a more negative effect on prediction and is therefore removed from the input pattern combinations the cross correlation coefficients the observed ec and discharge time series for the current month 1 month before 2 months before and 3 months before q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 are shown in table 2 according to the auto correlation of each time series and the cross correlation between ec and q the current and lagged monthly discharges q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 and the lagged ec values ec t 1 ec t 2 and ec t 3 were used as input data to predict the current month ec ec t seven combinations of the input data with different time lags were selected for the lwlr svr and arima models they are defined as follows ec t 1 q t ec t 1 ec t 2 q t q t 1 ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 ec t 1 q t q t 1 ec t 1 ec t 2 q t q t 1 q t 2 ec t 1 ec t 2 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 the control parameter value of the lwlr method which is found by the trial and error method is γ 0 4 and the values of the two svr parameters are γ 0 4 and c 1 in this study following faruk 2010 and maleki et al 2018 the arima 1 1 1 model was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed lwlr method the lwlr svr arima and mlr models were trained and tested based on three statistical parameters i e r rmse and mae and seven combinations of the input time series which are shown in tables 3 4 5 and 6 respectively fig 3 shows the correlation coefficients of the lwlr mlr svr and arima models for the seven different combinations in both training and testing stages indicating that the lwlr and svr had the best performance for the third combination and the arima and mlr had the best performance for the fourth combination in the ec predictions 2 8 hybrid wavelet lwlr and wavelet svr to promote the performances of the lwlr and svr models the hybrid w lwlr and w svr were developed in the first stage the original dataset of ec was decomposed into two components i e details and approximation by using the dwt the decomposition level and the type of the mother wavelet are two key factors for the wavelet based model one of the most effective criteria for selecting a proper mother wavelet is similarity in width and shape between the time series and the mother wavelet nourani et al 2014 sang 2012 according to barzegar et al 2016 the bior 6 8 has been identified as the best mother wavelet to forecast the ec levels using hybrid wavelet artificial intelligence models therefore the mother wavelet bior 6 8 was used in this study to decompose the original dataset following nourani et al 2009 the number of decomposition levels can be expressed as 17 m int log n where n is the length of time series since the number of data points in this study was 240 the number of decomposition levels of the selected wavelet m was equal to 2 level 2 produced two different sub series that consist of 2 details and 2 approximations fig 4 by applying the dwt the time series of river discharge q t and ec t were decomposed into the details q t d1 q t d2 for q t and ec t d1 ec t d2 for ec t and the approximations q t a1 q t a2 for q t and ec t a1 ec t a2 for ec t using the decomposed datasets input data the hybrid w lwlr and wsvr models were applied to predict the ec levels output fig 5 depicts the structures of the w lwlr w svr and w arima models note that the three models were developed by using matlab 2017 and the simulations were executed on a pentium iv pc with 3 40 ghz cpu and 16 mb ram 3 results and discussion tables 3 6 show the statistical metrics obtained for the lwlr svr arima and mlr models respectively as indicated in these tables for the lwlr combination 3 is the best one which contains ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 and q t 2 with an average rank of 2 335 2 and 2 67 for the training and testing phases respectively the best input combination for the svr is combination 3 with an average rank of 3 2 and 4 for the training and testing phases respectively for the arima model the best input combination is combination 4 that contains ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 with an average rank of 2 50 1 and 4 for the training and testing phases respectively the best input combination for the mlr model is combination 4 that includes ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 with average rank 2 17 1 and 3 33 for training and testing phases respectively the performance of the lwlr model for the optimum combination in the sefidrud river basin was evaluated and compared with those of the svr arima and mlr models for both training and testing stages tables 7 and 8 as shown in these two tables among these three models without the wavelet decomposition the lwlr has the best efficiency r 0 565 rmse 319 95 and ns 0 785 for the training phase for the testing phase the lwlr has the best performance in terms of the statistical criteria r 0 451 ns 0 113 and rae 0 891 while the svr has the best performance in terms of rmse 370 80 and msre 0 744 and the arima model has the best performance in terms of mae 291 808 the ec results simulated by the w lwlr w svr w arima and w mlr models for the training and testing datasets are listed in tables 7 and 8 respectively for comparison purposes the statistical criteria for three models demonstrate that the w lwlr model has a higher r value 0 97 than the w svr r 0 95 in addition the w lwlr model had the best performance for the training dataset with a higher ns 0 946 and smaller rmse 89 78 mae 46 17 and other error metrics tables 7 and 8 for the testing dataset the w lwlr model also showed the best performance with a higher ns 0 785 and lower rmse 182 37 and mae 147 26 it is worth noting that the mlr model s performance was poor when compared with the lwlr svr and arima models in addition the w mlr model performance was poor when compared with the w lwlr w svr and w arima models therefore it was not considered in other comparisons the performances of the arima svr and lwlr models were compared by using the monthly observed and simulated ec plots over the training and testing periods figs 6 8 as shown in these figures the ec values simulated by the w lwlr model are closer to the observed data than those simulated by the w svr w arima lwlr svr and arima models moreover the scatter plots of the ec data points simulated by the w lwlr w svr and w arima models are closer to the 450 straight line than those from the lwlr svr and arima models which imply better simulations finally the taylor diagrams of the training and testing datasets are shown in fig 9 the taylor diagrams for both training and testing datasets illustrate that the locus of the data simulated by the w lwlr model is closer to the target than those of the other methods the w lwlr model for both testing stage r 0 904 s d 327 60 and training stage r 0 973 s d 359 38 is able to provide more accurate ec simulations than the other models it is worth noting that the standard deviation s d of the observed ec values for the training and testing datasets are 387 26 and 395 93 respectively the absolute relative error values for all ai models were illustrated in the form of box plots fig 10 according to the following formula 18 e r ec o ec m ec o the results of error analysis indicated that the w lwlr had the lowest absolute relative error e r value among all ai and arima models fig 11 shows the cumulative frequency vs the absolute percentage of relative error percentage of e r it can be observed from fig 11 that more than 80 of the ec values estimated by the w lwlr model had an absolute relative error less than 27 9 whereas the corresponding values for the w svr w arima lwlr svr and arima models are 32 5 32 65 66 55 66 75 and 55 3 respectively it can be concluded from the error analysis for all ai models that the w lwlr model provided more accurate prediction of the monthly ec levels in the river than the w svr w arima lwlr svr and arima models 4 conclusions in this research for the first time the lwlr model was developed to predict the water quality parameters particularly the lwlr was coupled with the discrete wavelet transform to forecast the monthly ec levels of surface water in order to evaluate the performance and the ability of the models they were compared with the svr w svr arima w arima mlr and w mlr models in the model development 240 observed monthly river discharge and water ec sample data from the astane station were considered with 70 of the data for training and the remaining 30 of the data for testing in order to determine the optimal input patterns and appropriate lag times of the discharge and ec time series the autocorrelation and cross correlation analyses were implemented for this purpose various combinations were examined by using the svr lwlr arima and mlr models and the third combination that contained e t 1 e t 2 e t 3 q t and q t 1 was

1516,rivers are the most common and vital sources of water which play a fundamental role in ecological systems and human life water quality assessment is a major element of managing water resources and accurate prediction of water quality is very essential for better management of rivers the electrical conductivity ec is known as one of the most important water quality parameters to predict salinity and mineralization of water the present study introduces a novel hybrid wavelet locally weighted linear regression w lwlr method to predict the monthly ec of the sefidrud river in iran 240 monthly discharge q and ec samples over a period of 20 years were collected the data were divided into two frequency components at two decomposition levels using the mother wavelet bior 6 8 to compare the performance of various methods the standalone lwlr support vector regression svr wavelet support vector regression w svr autoregressive integrated moving average arima wavelet arima w arima multivariate linear regression mlr and wavelet mlr w mlr were also used the discrete wavelet transform dwt was coupled with the lwlr svr and arima to create the w lwlr w svr w arima methods to predict the ec parameter the comparisons demonstrated that the w lwlr was more accurate and efficient than the lwlr svr w svr arima and w arima methods the correlation coefficient r values were 0 973 0 95 0 565 0 473 0 425 0 917 for the w lwlr w svr lwlr svr arima and w arima methods respectively further the root mean square error rmse of w lwlr was 89 78 while the corresponding values for w svr lwlr svr arima w arima mlr and w mlr were 123 50 319 95 341 20 350 153 155 292 351 774 and 157 856 respectively the overall comparison metrics and error analysis demonstrated the superiority of the new proposed w lwlr method for water quality prediction 1 introduction surface water resources such as rivers streams lakes and reservoirs are the most vitally important water sources for drinking irrigation in agriculture mining and industrial purposes hence considering the lack of fresh surface water resources water quality monitoring and control are the most important strategies to obtain the information that leads to decision making and knowledge about water contamination and the spatial and temporal variations electrical conductivity ec based salinity is one of the most significant water quality parameters to determine the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation purposes kumarasamy et al 2014 ec is normally measured in a unit of microsiemens per centimeter μs cm heydari et al 2013 since ec is dominated by total dissolved solid tds and is directly related to dissolved ionic solutes such as sodium na chloride cl magnesium mg 2 sulfate so4 2 and calcium ca 2 in water it can be an indicator of pollutants in surface water the increased ionic composition of water has a significant influence on plant growth and can reduce the quality of drinking water in surface water quality classifications ec is a main measure of the salinity hazard for irrigation and drinking water the u s department of agriculture wilcox 1948 and the world health organization 2008 classify surface water quality based on the ec sodium concentration of water and ec respectively the ec of freshwater usually varies between 0 and 1500 μs cm while the ec of sea water can be as high as 50 000 μs cm according to the wilcox ec based classification for irrigation water 0 750 ms cm 750 2000 ms cm and 2000 ms cm are respectively classified as fine allowable and unacceptable wilcox 1948 the ec level higher than 10 000 μs cm is not suitable for human consumption or irrigation the maximum permissible ec value recommended by the world health organization who for drinking water is 1400 μs cm 1993 nowadays prediction of water quality parameters such as tds ec and turbidity in water is among the challenging issues in water resources management multivariate statistics and time series analysis have been widely used for water quality prediction the commonly used methods include moving average ma autoregressive moving average arma autoregressive integrated moving average arima and multiple linear regression mlr çamdevýren et al 2005 civelekoglu et al 2007 however the aforementioned traditional models may not be able to provide proper predictions due to the lack of reliable instruments to collect observation data for a given timeframe the complexity of effective factors in forecasting and the inability to capture non stationarity and nonlinearity of the water quality parameters deng et al 2015 in recent decades the artificial intelligence ai method has been successfully utilized in various aspects of environmental engineering such as water quality prediction which is able to overcome the drawback of the traditional methods the artificial neural network ann and the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis techniques have been widely employed to predict nocturnal dynamics of dissolved oxygen do in aquatic systems karakaya et al 2013 to forecast tds ec and turbidity in rivers najah et al 2009 to estimate do and specific conductance as two water quality parameters in rivers heydari et al 2013 to assess ec sodium absorption ratio sar and total hardness th in rivers azad et al 2018 and to predict the chemical concentrations in rivers mahmoodabadi and arshad 2018 in recent years hybrid support vector regression svr and shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla were employed to forecast eight water quality parameters including na k mg 2 so4 2 cl ph ec and tds mahmoudi et al 2016 a deep learning predictive model was developed to model the do levels of the reservoir banerjee et al 2019 the least square support vector machine lssvm multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and m5 model tree m5tree were used to assess free ammonia amm total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn water temperature wt total coliform tc fecal coliform fc and ph kisi and parmar 2016 comparing the overall results indicated that the mars and lssvm models had better performance in the accuracy than other methods more recently artificial neural network ann has been widely applied for surface water quality modeling for instance have conducted various studies on the do concentration modeling using different ai based models developed two nonlinear predictive models namely modified response surface method mrsm and multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn to model the daily dissolved oxygen concentration applied three data driven methods such as ann anfis svm arima and three different ensemble techniques i e simple average ensemble sae weighted average ensemble wae and neural network ensemble nne to forecast single and multi step ahead modeling of do at river water provided a model to assess the do of water using the polynomial chaos expansion approach further some researchers focused on different applicable aspects of ann methods to forecast the water quality indexes recently hybrid discrete wavelet transform dwt and robust artificial intelligence have been used to estimate water quality parameters based on limited time series data in particular the hybrid wavelet artificial neural network wann techniques have been applied to predict the ec of river water ravansalar and rajaee 2015 specifically the original time series of monthly ec and discharge q values were decomposed by using the dwt and then coupled with the ann model the results indicated that the wann model enhanced the modeling accuracy montaseri et al montaseri et al 2018 utilized wavelet anfis wavelet gep and other hybrid ai models to forecast tds based on ec na cl under various climatic conditions rajaee et al rajaee et al 2018 applied wavelet multiple linear regression wmlr and wann to predict daily ph levels with the original time series of ph and discharge q barzegar et al barzegar et al 2016 used ann anfis wavelet ann and wavelet anfis to assess water salinity levels based on different subsets of monthly ca 2 mg 2 na so4 2 and cl in rivers barzegar et al barzegar et al 2018 simulated multi step ahead ec by a hybrid wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm model and compared with an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the dwt in the lwlr method to predict monthly ec levels in the sefidrud river iran based on multiple hydrological data including ec and discharge to the best of our knowledge the hybrid wavelet locally weighted linear regression w lwlr method has not been utilized before to forecast the water quality parameters also few studies have been conducted to use the lwlr as a data driven method ahmadianfar et al 2019 jamei and ahmadianfar 2019 in this research the w lwlr w svr w arima and w mlr models are developed to assess monthly ec levels and the results are compared with those from the original lwlr svr arima and mlr models 2 materials and methods 2 1 support vector machine the svm is a machine learning method based on the theory of statistical learning and the structural risk minimization principle which was firstly introduced by cortes and vapnik vapnik and cortes 1995 svm has been widely applied for classification and regression which usually outperforms traditional methods used in the previous studies huang et al 2002 sarzaeim et al 2017 the svr is the utilization of svm for regression various types of kernel function such as exponential radial basis function erbf radial basis function rbf polynomial poly linear and sigmoid are used in svm compared with the traditional methods such as ann one of the main advantages of svm is that it does not suffer from converge to local minima which provides a suitable balance between model complexity and accuracy and presents an improved prediction capability kwon and moon 2007 assuming that a training dataset is given by x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x k y k where x k x r y k y r k 1 2 n and n is the total number of dataset svr searches to estimate the following function 1 f x w t θ x b where w is the vector of weights θ x is a nonlinear mapping function and b is the bias of w t θ x from the actual values the following optimization is implemented to acquire w 2 minimize z 1 2 w 2 c k 1 n ξ k ξ k subject to y k w t θ x b ε ξ k k 1 2 n 3 ξ k ξ k 0 k 1 2 n where ε is the insensitive loss function ξ k and ξ k are the slack variables and c is a constant penalty coefficient finally the svr is solved by using lagrange multipliers λ k and λ k with the following formula 4 f x k 1 n λ k λ k k x x i b where k x x i is the kernel function 2 2 linear regression linear regression lr is a statistical approach for modeling the relationship between some dependent variables and one or more independent variables due to its simplest formulation the lr method has been widely used various types of the lr include the simple linear regression logistic regression multinomial regression and multivariate linear regression ghani and ahmad 2010 kisi and ozkan 2017 the multivariate regression mr is one of the most preferred approaches rencher and schaalje 2008 wang et al 2013 this method determines a dependent variable y k by using a linear equation depending on more than two independent variables x n which is defined by 5 y k α k 0 n 1 m α kn x kn ε k where α k0 α k1 α kn are the coefficients of regression calculated by using the least square ls method ε k is the random error an m is total number of variables eq 6 defines an objective function to compute the best fit line in the mr method for the observed dataset y o 6 minimize f 1 2 n k 1 n y ok y k 2 where f is the objective function the squared error 2 3 locally weighted linear regression the lwlr is introduced herein according to the mr method in the first step the parameters of mr α are calculated by eq 6 the squared error objective function can be expressed as 7 minimize f 1 2 n k 1 n α k 0 n 1 m α kn x kn ε k y k 2 eq 7 can be defined in a matrix form as xα y t xα y by derivation of this matrix with respect to α x t xα y is obtained let this new matrix be zero and solve for α to generate the ls equation 8 α x t x 1 x t y where x is the matrix of input training dataset and y is the target dataset one of the main problems in the mr is its tendency to under fit the data which can lead to a negative impact on the accuracy of prediction hence many methods have been proposed to minimize this drawback by joining bias coefficients to the estimators lu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the locally weighted method introduced by atkeson et al 1997 can be used to improve the performance of the mr method the lwlr uses a weight fucntion to describe the relationship between the training dataset and the current prediction this function gives higher weights to the data points that are close to each other and smaller weights to the data points that are farther away in fact it is assumed that the points nearest to the target ones have the best indicators accordingly in the lwlr method the squared error objective function is defined as follows 9 minimize f 1 2 n k 1 n w k α k 0 n 1 m α kn x kn ε k y k 2 where w is a weight function matrix eq 9 can be expressed in a matrix form as xα y t w xα y to minimize f in eq 9 the derivative of f with respect to α must be zero as follows 10 f α α x t wxα x t wy 0 thus 11 α x t wx 1 x t wy the lwlr employs a kernel function to specify the weighted matrix wang et al 2016 in this study the radial basis function rbf is used to determine this matrix which is described as 12 w ij exp γ x i x j 2 where γ is a constant number and x i x j is the difference between observation points i and j 2 4 discrete wavelet transform the data mining techniques need the hidden information in the time series dataset but in most of physical phenomena due to the variation in the data frequency derivation of the pertinent information is difficult one of the most popular methods to analyze the dataset in the time frequency domain is wavelet transform this theory was introduced to derive the information of time frequency by decomposing the dataset into low and high frequency components many researchers have applied this theory in various areas of civil engineering such as water quality barzegar et al 2018 ravansalar et al 2016 suspended sediments kisi and ozkan 2017 streamflow forecasting kisi and cimen 2011 and hydrological prediction kalteh 2015 kisi and shiri 2011 as a strong tool wavelet transform is able to compress the signals and de noise the non stationary time series to improve the performance of an ai based model sang 2013 the wavelet theory is used to represent or approximate a function ψ t called the mother wavelet zhang et al 2004 13 ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a a b r a 0 where ψ a b t is the successive wavelet a is the scale factor b is a time factor and t is time the wavelet transform of function f t can be defined as 14 w ψ f a b a 1 2 r f t ψ t b a dt f t l 2 r where ψ t is the complex conjugate of wavelet function ψ t for hydrological and water quality time series the input dataset f t is usually discretely sampled let a a 0 i and b lb 0 a 0 i a 0 1 b 0 r l and i are integer numbers accordingly the discrete wavelet transform dwt of f t can be expressed as 15 w ψ f i l a 0 i 2 r f t ψ a 0 i t lb 0 dt the common selection for a 0 and b 0 are 2 and 1 respectively kisi and cimen 2012 using these values eq 16 becomes 16 w ψ f i l 2 i 2 r f t ψ 2 i t l dt for a discrete input dataset of f t the dwt is given by 17 w ψ f i l 2 i 2 t 0 n f t ψ 2 i t l where w ψ f i l indicates the properties of the original time series with the scale factor a and time domain b the dwt presents two sets of functions called low pass and high pass filters the input dataset f t is decomposed with the low pass and high pass filters which results in two vectors a and d respectively the vectors a and d are called the approximation and detail coefficients respectively budu 2013 2 5 study area the sefidrud river is the second longest river in iran with a length of 670 km and a drainage area of 13 450 km2 which connects to the caspian sea at rasht city this river plays an important role in the associated aquatic ecosystems and provides water for drinking and irrigation for the regions along the river in this study 240 monthly q and ec samples were taken in the period of 1985 2005 from the astane station 49 37 40 e 36 57 02 n fig 1 2 6 model evaluation several statistical criteria including the coefficient of correlation r root mean square error rmse willmott and matsuura 2005 nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 mean absolute error mae chai and draxler 2014 the relative absolute error rae and mean squared relative error msre are employed to assess the performance of the models in the ec simulations these coefficients are detailed in appendix a moreover the taylor diagram is used in this study to provide a visual comparison between the simulated and observed data based on three different statistics correlation coefficient centered root mean square error crmse and standard deviation appendix a in the taylor diagram the correlation coefficient is given by the cosine of the azimuthal angle the standard deviation is described as the proportion of the radial distance from the origin and crmse is defined as the proportion of the distance to the target observed point on the x axis the taylor diagram shows the best fit of the developed models with the least distance from the observed data points taylor 2001 2 7 datasets and preliminary analysis as aforementioned 240 monthly q and ec samples of the sefidrud river were collected from the astane station in the modeling the first 70 of the data 168 samples were utilized for model training and the remaining 30 of the data 72 samples were chosen for model testing the original time series of q and ec are depicted in fig 2 the optimal selection of the input patterns and the combination of different lagged variables are critical for developing hydrological predicting models despite lack of a direct method to determine the above values accurate statistical analysis examining autocorrelations and cross correlations between the variables are most commonly applied in literatures sudheer et al 2002 table 1 shows the statistical parameters of the discharge and ec for all original data and the training and testing sub datasets including the minimum maximum mean mod standard deviation s d coefficient of variation c v skewness coefficient c s also lag 1 lag 2 lag 3 and lag 4 auto correlation coefficients r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 were determined table 1 comparison of the statistical characteristics of the training and testing time series shows a similar trend it can be observed that the skewness coefficient of the ec datasets a measure of the degree of asymmetry of the ec data distribution is significantly low indicating a normal distribution the skewness coefficients of the river discharge for both training and testing datasets are relatively high the 1 month lag auto correlation coefficients for both ec and river discharge are significantly higher than the others while the 2 month 3 month and 4 month lag auto correlation coefficients are actually close to zero for both training and testing datasets it is worth noting that the 4 month auto correlation coefficient due to the high negative values has a more negative effect on prediction and is therefore removed from the input pattern combinations the cross correlation coefficients the observed ec and discharge time series for the current month 1 month before 2 months before and 3 months before q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 are shown in table 2 according to the auto correlation of each time series and the cross correlation between ec and q the current and lagged monthly discharges q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 and the lagged ec values ec t 1 ec t 2 and ec t 3 were used as input data to predict the current month ec ec t seven combinations of the input data with different time lags were selected for the lwlr svr and arima models they are defined as follows ec t 1 q t ec t 1 ec t 2 q t q t 1 ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 ec t 1 q t q t 1 ec t 1 ec t 2 q t q t 1 q t 2 ec t 1 ec t 2 q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 the control parameter value of the lwlr method which is found by the trial and error method is γ 0 4 and the values of the two svr parameters are γ 0 4 and c 1 in this study following faruk 2010 and maleki et al 2018 the arima 1 1 1 model was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed lwlr method the lwlr svr arima and mlr models were trained and tested based on three statistical parameters i e r rmse and mae and seven combinations of the input time series which are shown in tables 3 4 5 and 6 respectively fig 3 shows the correlation coefficients of the lwlr mlr svr and arima models for the seven different combinations in both training and testing stages indicating that the lwlr and svr had the best performance for the third combination and the arima and mlr had the best performance for the fourth combination in the ec predictions 2 8 hybrid wavelet lwlr and wavelet svr to promote the performances of the lwlr and svr models the hybrid w lwlr and w svr were developed in the first stage the original dataset of ec was decomposed into two components i e details and approximation by using the dwt the decomposition level and the type of the mother wavelet are two key factors for the wavelet based model one of the most effective criteria for selecting a proper mother wavelet is similarity in width and shape between the time series and the mother wavelet nourani et al 2014 sang 2012 according to barzegar et al 2016 the bior 6 8 has been identified as the best mother wavelet to forecast the ec levels using hybrid wavelet artificial intelligence models therefore the mother wavelet bior 6 8 was used in this study to decompose the original dataset following nourani et al 2009 the number of decomposition levels can be expressed as 17 m int log n where n is the length of time series since the number of data points in this study was 240 the number of decomposition levels of the selected wavelet m was equal to 2 level 2 produced two different sub series that consist of 2 details and 2 approximations fig 4 by applying the dwt the time series of river discharge q t and ec t were decomposed into the details q t d1 q t d2 for q t and ec t d1 ec t d2 for ec t and the approximations q t a1 q t a2 for q t and ec t a1 ec t a2 for ec t using the decomposed datasets input data the hybrid w lwlr and wsvr models were applied to predict the ec levels output fig 5 depicts the structures of the w lwlr w svr and w arima models note that the three models were developed by using matlab 2017 and the simulations were executed on a pentium iv pc with 3 40 ghz cpu and 16 mb ram 3 results and discussion tables 3 6 show the statistical metrics obtained for the lwlr svr arima and mlr models respectively as indicated in these tables for the lwlr combination 3 is the best one which contains ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 and q t 2 with an average rank of 2 335 2 and 2 67 for the training and testing phases respectively the best input combination for the svr is combination 3 with an average rank of 3 2 and 4 for the training and testing phases respectively for the arima model the best input combination is combination 4 that contains ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 with an average rank of 2 50 1 and 4 for the training and testing phases respectively the best input combination for the mlr model is combination 4 that includes ec t 1 ec t 2 ec t 3 q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 with average rank 2 17 1 and 3 33 for training and testing phases respectively the performance of the lwlr model for the optimum combination in the sefidrud river basin was evaluated and compared with those of the svr arima and mlr models for both training and testing stages tables 7 and 8 as shown in these two tables among these three models without the wavelet decomposition the lwlr has the best efficiency r 0 565 rmse 319 95 and ns 0 785 for the training phase for the testing phase the lwlr has the best performance in terms of the statistical criteria r 0 451 ns 0 113 and rae 0 891 while the svr has the best performance in terms of rmse 370 80 and msre 0 744 and the arima model has the best performance in terms of mae 291 808 the ec results simulated by the w lwlr w svr w arima and w mlr models for the training and testing datasets are listed in tables 7 and 8 respectively for comparison purposes the statistical criteria for three models demonstrate that the w lwlr model has a higher r value 0 97 than the w svr r 0 95 in addition the w lwlr model had the best performance for the training dataset with a higher ns 0 946 and smaller rmse 89 78 mae 46 17 and other error metrics tables 7 and 8 for the testing dataset the w lwlr model also showed the best performance with a higher ns 0 785 and lower rmse 182 37 and mae 147 26 it is worth noting that the mlr model s performance was poor when compared with the lwlr svr and arima models in addition the w mlr model performance was poor when compared with the w lwlr w svr and w arima models therefore it was not considered in other comparisons the performances of the arima svr and lwlr models were compared by using the monthly observed and simulated ec plots over the training and testing periods figs 6 8 as shown in these figures the ec values simulated by the w lwlr model are closer to the observed data than those simulated by the w svr w arima lwlr svr and arima models moreover the scatter plots of the ec data points simulated by the w lwlr w svr and w arima models are closer to the 450 straight line than those from the lwlr svr and arima models which imply better simulations finally the taylor diagrams of the training and testing datasets are shown in fig 9 the taylor diagrams for both training and testing datasets illustrate that the locus of the data simulated by the w lwlr model is closer to the target than those of the other methods the w lwlr model for both testing stage r 0 904 s d 327 60 and training stage r 0 973 s d 359 38 is able to provide more accurate ec simulations than the other models it is worth noting that the standard deviation s d of the observed ec values for the training and testing datasets are 387 26 and 395 93 respectively the absolute relative error values for all ai models were illustrated in the form of box plots fig 10 according to the following formula 18 e r ec o ec m ec o the results of error analysis indicated that the w lwlr had the lowest absolute relative error e r value among all ai and arima models fig 11 shows the cumulative frequency vs the absolute percentage of relative error percentage of e r it can be observed from fig 11 that more than 80 of the ec values estimated by the w lwlr model had an absolute relative error less than 27 9 whereas the corresponding values for the w svr w arima lwlr svr and arima models are 32 5 32 65 66 55 66 75 and 55 3 respectively it can be concluded from the error analysis for all ai models that the w lwlr model provided more accurate prediction of the monthly ec levels in the river than the w svr w arima lwlr svr and arima models 4 conclusions in this research for the first time the lwlr model was developed to predict the water quality parameters particularly the lwlr was coupled with the discrete wavelet transform to forecast the monthly ec levels of surface water in order to evaluate the performance and the ability of the models they were compared with the svr w svr arima w arima mlr and w mlr models in the model development 240 observed monthly river discharge and water ec sample data from the astane station were considered with 70 of the data for training and the remaining 30 of the data for testing in order to determine the optimal input patterns and appropriate lag times of the discharge and ec time series the autocorrelation and cross correlation analyses were implemented for this purpose various combinations were examined by using the svr lwlr arima and mlr models and the third combination that contained e t 1 e t 2 e t 3 q t and q t 1 was selected as the optimal combination for the lwlr and svr models and the forth combination was selected for the arima and mlr models the results showed that in the ec modeling the performance of the lwlr model r 0 565 rmse 319 95 and ns 0 314 was better than those of the svr arima and mlr models for the training stage the selected data pattern was further decomposed into two frequency components at two decomposition levels by using the dwt it was observed that using the wavelet transform as a pre processing technique in the w lwlr w svr w arima w mlr models significantly enhanced the accuracy of ec prediction besides the w lwlr model r 0 973 rmse 89 78 and ns 0 946 provided better simulations than the w svr w arima and w mlr models this study demonstrates that the w lwlr model can be used as an efficient soft computing tool to precisely predict surface water quality variations funding this study was funded by vice chancellor for research and technology shohadaye hoveizeh university of

1517,in a shale gas reservoir the rock matrix has a relatively large porosity and gas in place but extremely low permeability thus the rock matrix is a bottleneck for shale gas flow from the reservoir to hydraulic fractures and then to the production well we speculate that the next big thing after hydraulic fracturing for unconventional resources development is to enhance the matrix permeability in an economically feasible way consequently the efficient and accurate characterization of rock matrix permeability in the laboratory is a critical task the current laboratory techniques for source rock permeability measurement follow a point by point approach they need multiple test runs to obtain a permeability pressure curve because they can only measure one permeability data point for one test run and are thus time consuming the root cause of this point by point approach is that these laboratory techniques are based on linearized gas flow theory requiring only small pore pressure disturbances to the experiment system liu et al 2019 and this work introduce a new methodology that is based on the nonlinear gas flow theory and allows for direct measurement of the permeability pressure curve with a single test run this makes the approach highly time efficient the feasibility and validity of the methodology are demonstrated in this work based on laboratory measurement results and their consistency with theoretical expectations and other independent measurements the observed permeability exhibits a complex relationship with pore pressure as a result of the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation for a given confining pressure the observed permeability initially decreases with pore pressure because of knudsen diffusion and then increases with pore pressure owing to the mechanical deformation a rock sample with a lower permeability corresponds to a stronger knudsen diffusion effect and weaker mechanical diffusion effect this complex behavior highlights the need to accurately and efficiently measure the combined effects that may have important impacts on shale gas production 1 introduction in an unconventional gas reservoir shale gas flows from the rock matrix to the production well through natural and or hydraulic fractures along this flow path the rock matrix has the largest pore space or gas in place but the smallest permeability the low permeability rock matrix is really the bottleneck of hydrocarbon flow ozkan et al 2011 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2019a b so far the most important technological innovation in the unconventional oil and gas community is hydraulic fracturing which increases the reservoir contact area and has made the hydrocarbon production from shale reservoirs economically feasible the authors speculate that the next big thing after hydraulic fracturing is the enhancement of matrix permeability in an economically feasible way to attack this important issue the first step is to determine how to accurately measure the matrix permeability because of its extremely low value the accurate measurement of shale matrix permeability remains a challenge the most commonly used laboratory method to measure permeability for a shale core sample is called the pressure pulse decay method that was invented by hydrogeologists in the 1960s and then adopted by the oil and gas industry brace et al 1968 hsieh et al 1981 dicker and smits 1988 jones 1997 darabi et al 2012 the laboratory system consists of a core holder and upstream and downstream gas reservoirs a core sample is placed inside the core holder which imposes the confining stress or pressure on the core sample and its two ends are connected with the upstream and downstream gas reservoirs respectively the non reactive gases such as nitrogen gas are generally employed as working fluids for permeability measurements initially the pressures in the gas reservoirs and pore pressure in the core sample are in equilibrium then a gas pressure pulse is created in the upstream gas reservoir by injecting a certain amount of the working fluid the gas will flow from the upstream gas reservoir to the downstream gas reservoir through the shale core sample evolutions of the gas pressures from the two gas reservoirs are monitored as a function of time the permeability of shale sample is then determined by fitting the pressure measurements with the relevant analytical solution to gas flow within the test system that includes permeability as a fitting parameter in the pressure pulse decay method a small pressure pulse is introduced into the upstream gas reservoir where the maximum pressure increase is allowed to be a few percent of the initial gas pressure e g dicker and smits 1988 jones 1997 this is because the current pressure decay method relies on analytical solutions to linear or linearized gas flow equations that require small disturbances to the test system such that fluid density and viscosity can be approximated as constants within the core sample as a result of this limitation the traditional pressure pulse decay method belongs to the so called point by point method for the following reason for a given confining pressure and pore pressure one measures one permeability point only with one test run in order to measure another permeability point one needs to change the confining pressure and or pore pressure and re equilibrate the system before taking the permeability measurement to investigate permeability as a function of effective stress requires multiple data points or multiple test runs each of which corresponds to one permeability point under different stress pressure conditions depending on the permeability the re equilibrium process can take a long time jones 1997 thus the point by point method can be very time consuming another widely used laboratory method for shale permeability measurement is the gas research institute gri method luffel et al 1993 gri 1996 when rock cores are taken from deep within the subsurface to the surface they can be subjected to significant stress release this in many cases generates fractures in core samples that can dominate measured laboratory permeability values this makes the laboratory permeability measurement irrelevant to the true permeability value in the reservoir the development of the gri method is partially motivated by overcoming the impact of the induced features in core samples on permeability measurement luffel et al 1993 gri 1996 the gri uses crushed rock samples with a particle size diameter of about 1 mm because it is believed that the induced fractures do not exist at that scale the brief procedure of the gri method is given as follows put the crushed samples into a container and let equilibrium occur between the gas pressures in the container and pores in the rock samples then connect the container to another container with a higher gas pressure the gas pressures within two containers become the same almost simultaneously then the gas pressure in the containers continues to decline because of the penetration of the gas into rock particles the permeability is determined by fitting the observed pressure as a function of time with the associated analytical solution with permeability as a fitting parameter the gri method suffers from several major limitations the gri permeability measurements have been found to be dependent on the particle size of crushed samples and a larger particle size corresponds to a larger measured permeability value cui et al 2009 tinni et al 2012 a question is naturally raised regarding how representative the gri measurements for a given particle size are the gri test is generally conducted at small pore pressures that induce significant impact of diffusion on the measurements as well liu et al 2018 the diffusion effect will be discussed later furthermore the gri method is only conducted under the zero confining stress condition and thus cannot be used for investigating stress dependency of shale permeability luffel et al 1993 gri 1996 to overcome some of the technology challenges mentioned above the aramco research center in houston texas has developed a laboratory technology called aramco nano permeameter anp to measure core scale shale permeability as functions of pore pressure and stress liu et al 2019a b anp has several functions to overcome the limitation of the gri method anp can measure matrix permeability from fractured cores under different pore pressure and stress conditions which will be presented in a companion paper zhang et al this issue the objective of this paper is to present the anp method to overcome the inefficiency of the point by point measurement approach with a focus on the direct measurement of the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability as will be discussed in the next section both knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation have significant impacts on measured shale permeability the direct measurement of their combined effects however has been very rare in the literature 2 effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability there are several reasons why shale permeability is difficult to measure one obvious reason is its extremely small value because the permeability measurement results can be significantly impacted by even very slight leakage of the laboratory system chen et al 2018 in addition the measured shale permeability in the laboratory is impacted by both diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation the gas diffusion is a process for net movement of a substance from a high concentration region to a low concentration region as a result of thermal motion of gas molecules based on the classic statistical physics the gas diffusion coefficient d is given by e g javadpour et al 2014 1 d 1 3 lu where l is the mean free path that is the average distance for a molecule to travel before it hits other molecules and u is the averaged magnitude of thermal motion speed they are given by e g civan 2010 ziarani and aguilera 2012 javadpour et al 2014 2 l k b t 2 π d c 2 p 3 u 8 k b t πw where k b is the boltzmann constant 1 3805 10 23 j k t k is the temperature p pa is the pressure d c m is the collision diameter for gas that is 0 358 nm for n2 that is often used as a working fluid to measure permeability in laboratory as previously indicated and w kg mol is the gas molecular weight in the conventional rocks the pore size is much larger than the mean free path and thus collisions mainly occur among gas molecules rather than between molecules and pore walls in this case fluid flow is dominated by the viscous flow process and the diffusion effect on fluid flow is negligible also note that collisions among gas molecules result in the viscosity defined on the continuum scale in shale and other unconventional rocks the gas mean free path depending on the pore pressure for a given temperature could be larger than the pore radius on the order of nm in this case the collisions among gas molecules are very rare and mainly occur between the pore walls and gas molecules consequently the resistance to the bulk movement of gas molecules is reduced compared to the regime of viscous fluid flow that corresponds to the dominant collisions among gas molecules this diffusion process is called knudsen diffusion and characterized by knudsen number defined as 4 k n l r where r is the pore radius when knudsen diffusion and slippage flow become important the measured or effective permeability is larger than the true or intrinsic permeability to demonstrate this effect fig 1 shows the enhancement factor of permeability f c for a micro tube with a radius of 5 nm a typical value for the size of pore throat in shale as a function of pore pressure for nitrogen the enhancement factor is defined as the effective value for the permeability to its intrinsic value the effective permeability corresponds to the permeability determined from darcy s law with the observed flux and pressure gradient along the micro tube for a given pore pressure based on a large number of numerical experiments for micro tubes that accurately capture both the knudsen diffusion and slippage gas flow beskok and karniadakis 1999 reported a mathematical formulation for f c 5 f c 1 α k n 1 4 k n 1 b k n where b is a constant and equal to 1 and α is the dimensionless rarefaction coefficient and can be empirically determined from the knudsen number civan 2010 while the above equation can accurately calculate the enhancement factor for micro tubes development of the corresponding formulation for porous media is still an area of active research because of the complexity of pore geometry in porous media e g civan 2010 ziarani and aguilera 2012 javadpour et al 2014 nevertheless liu et al 2018 demonstrated that the approximation of pore space in a porous media with a group of identified micro tubes seems to be reasonable for the purpose of calculating f c as shown in fig 1 the enhance factor is significantly higher than one for low pore pressures indicating that measured or effective permeability value can be much higher than the true or intrinsic permeability the enhancement factor f c is equal to one when the effective and intrinsic permeability values are identical however it is important to note that gas flow in a shale reservoir is controlled by the effective permeability its enhancement owing to the diffusion slippage flow is desirable for improving the gas production rate during the later production when gas pressure in the reservoir is relatively low thus it is important to be able to measure such permeability enhancement in the laboratory as a function of pore pressure on the other hand the permeability of unconventional rocks has been shown to be significantly stress sensitive with laboratory experiment results liu 2017 bhandari et al 2015 heller et al 2014 vermylen 2011 dong et al 2010 bustin et al 2008 kwon et al 2004 for a given confining stress the increase in pore pressure or decrease in effective stress enlarges the pore sizes and thus in contrast with the diffusion effect will enhance the measured permeability value among a number of different factors this stress sensitivity is a key contributor to the well known fact that the early production rate declines very rapidly with time the stress dependency of permeability is critical for predicting the performance of unconventional reservoirs and for optimizing reservoir management strategies such as the management of pressure drawdown in production wells both the diffusion and mechanical deformation significantly impact the shale permeability and yet in a competing manner while there are a number of studies on the dependency of shale permeability on stress pore pressure in the literature as previously indicated the direct measurement of the combined effects of the diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability is very rare the laboratory measurement of these combined effects in high resolution is the major objective of this work 3 theoretical foundation for the experimental method as previously indicated the pressure pulse decay method to measure core scale shale permeability follows the point by point approach permeability is measured at a given pore pressure for a given confining stress and then measured again at a different pore pressure so that a stress dependent permeability curve consisting of a number of data points can be generated the method requires multiple test runs and is very time consuming the root cause of the point by point approach is that the pressure pulse decay method is based on analytical solutions to linear or linearized gas flow equations that require small disturbance to the test system to enhance the measurement efficiency the anp method in contrast with the pressure pulse decay method takes advantage of a solution to the nonlinear gas flow equation such that the anp method can measure permeability vs pore pressure curve or function rather than a permeability data point with a single test run liu et al 2019a 2019b while the details of the theory behind the anp method are given in liu et al 2019a 2019b the theory is briefly discussed here for the completeness the mass conservation equation for one dimensional non reactive gas flow along a rock column is given by 6 m t x kρ μ p x where t is time x is spatial coordinate k is permeability for the mobile continuum μ ρ and p are gas viscosity density and pressure respectively and m is the total gas mass per unit volume of the porous medium or apparent gas density written as 7 m φρ where φ is porosity the right hand side of eq 6 can be rewritten as 8 m t dm dp p t since our study is limited to the isothermal condition m is considered a function of pressure only consider an infinitely long shale column with gas flow from the inlet x 0 and the following boundary and initial conditions 9 p x t p i x 0 t 0 p x t p 0 x 0 0 p x t p i x t 0 using the boltzmann transformation as 10 λ xt 1 2 eq 9 can be rewritten as p λ p i λ 11 p λ p 0 λ 0 and eq 6 becomes 12 λ 2 dm dp dp dλ d dλ d p dp dλ where 13 d p kρ μ eq 12 is an ordinary differential equation with λ as the only independent variable which can be solved analytically directly integrating eq 13 within the interval λ yields 14 d p p i p λ 2 dm dp dp dp dλ the above equation indicates that d p can be fully determined when p λ is known in the other words as long as we can determine p λ in one test run the permeability as a function of pore pressure can be determined from d p obtained from eq 14 note that in eq 13 the relations among density viscosity and gas pressure are known for a given test fluid e g nitrogen gas on the basis of the gas mass balance the cumulative gas flow into the sample at x 0 is 15 m t a p i p 0 λ dm dp dp t 1 2 bt 1 2 where b is a slope for the curve of m t versus t 1 2 based on eq 15 and considering that porosity can be approximately considered constant during the test we can determine the porosity of the core sample as 16 φ b a p i p 0 λ dρ dp dp where a is a cross sectional area of the sample eqs 14 and 16 are the key equations used by the anp for efficiently measuring the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability for different pore pressures the next section will discuss howp λ is determined with a single test run finally it may be useful to review the historical root of the theoretical framework discussed above considering that the same framework has been used for measuring different flow and transport properties for processes characterized by non linear diffusive equations the boltzmann transformation eq 10 was put forward by ludwig boltzmann the father of statistical physics to solve non linear diffusion equations under special boundary and initial conditions eq 9 matano 1933 derived an expression for diffusion coefficient as a function of concentration based on the boltzmann transformation for mass transport problems his expression is similar to our eq 14 bruce and klute 1956 then applied the boltzmann matano method to developing a laboratory technique to estimate soil water diffusivity related to relative permeability and capillary pressure curve liu et al 2019a 2019b and this work for the first time apply a similar mathematical technique to efficiently measure gas permeability as a function of pore pressure 4 experimental setup results and discussion to implement the methodology presented in the above section that allows permeability to be measured as a function of pore pressure with a single test run an anp setup was built fig 2 it consists of an upstream gas reservoir a core holder containing a core sample that is subject to confining pressure and a downstream gas reservoir they are connected to three different pumps to provide gas pressures and confining pressure respectively a number of pressure and temperature transducers are used to monitor the pressure and temperature conditions at different locations during the test fig 2 the whole anp setup was placed within an oven with a constant temperature such that the tests were conducted under isothermal conditions three inch long core samples with a diameter of one inch from eagle ford are used for the tests these cores were scanned with ct to make sure that they did not contain fractures to be consistent with the boundary and initial conditions in our theoretical model discussed in the above section the anp setup is equilibrated with a given constant pore pressure in the tests to be discussed in this work we use the atmospheric pressure as the initial pore pressure to avoid the pressure equilibrium process we then increase the gas pressure in the upstream gas reservoir from the atmospheric pressure to 2000 psi and keep it fixed after that we let gas nitrogen herein flow from the upstream gas reservoir through the core sample to the downstream gas reservoir three pressure transducers are used to measure gas pressures as functions of time at three different locations along the core sample fig 2 to minimize the disturbance of the dead volume defined as the volume connected to the core sample s pore space within a pressure transducer to the gas flow in the core sample being tested analog pressure transducers with almost zero dead volumes were used also during a test a constant confining pressure 4000 psi for this study was applied to the core samples as indicated in eq 9 the anp theoretical model requires an infinitely long rock core sample the sample however can never be that long in reality to deal with this issue we introduce the concept of critical time before which the gas flow at a given location is equivalent to the flow occurring in an infinitely long core sample the critical time for the outlet of the sample corresponds to the experiment time when the pressure breaks through in the downstream gas reservoir then the outlet boundary effect will propagate from the outlet in a direction that is opposite to the gas flow direction thus the critical time at any location along the rock sample will be the summation of the critical time at the outlet and the propagation time or the time for the outlet boundary effect to propagate to the location since accumulative gas flow rate from the upstream gas reservoir to an infinitely long core sample is proportional to the square root of time for the given boundary and initial conditions eq 5 the critical time at the inlet occurs when the above relationship between the flow rate and time breaks the difference between the inlet and outlet critical times is the propagation time at the inlet note that propagation time at the outlet is zero by definition then the propagation time at any location between the inlet and outlet is determined with interpolation based on an approximation that propagation distance for the downstream boundary effect l p in fig 3 is proportional to the square root of time for a diffusive process liu et al 2019a 2019b the governing equation for gas flow in a core is mathematically identical to the diffusion equation as indicated in section 3 to determine the relationship between permeability and pore pressure we need to know p λ for each of the three pressure transducers along the core sample fig 2 we measure pressure as a function of time then we can determine p λ by calculating λ for a given time using eq 10 note that the location of a given transducer corresponding to x in eq 10 is known and fixed finally eqs 13 and 14 are used for calculating permeability as a function of pore pressure after obtaining p λ we only used the measurements before the critical times at pressure transducer locations for the permeability determinations theoretically only one pressure transducer was needed for determining p λ and thus for estimating permeability as a function of pore pressure three pressure transducers are employed here fig 2 because the comparison between measurements from different transducers as will be discussed later provides a powerful approach to validate the test methodology and setup several eagle ford rock samples as previously indicated were used for evaluating the anp method as an example fig 4 shows measured gas pressures for sample a as functions of time at the inlet upstream gas reservoir outlet downstream gas reservoir and three pressure transducers along the core sample fig 5 presents p λ curves calculated with pressure history data collected from the three pressure transducers along the core sample these curves essentially collapse into one curve which is consistent with the theory discussed in section 3 for gas flow through a core sample that can be treated as an infinitely long column under the related boundary and initial conditions pressure is a function of λ only note that eq 14 used to calculate permeability is a result of simply combining the mass balance equation with that pressure is a function of λ only therefore the observation from fig 5 indicates that permeability function can be accurately estimated based on eq 14 in addition it ensures that the test setup works appropriately the similar observations are obtained for other rock samples because the pressure transducer 1 fig 2 is closest to the sample inlet and thus has the biggest pressure range in which rock sample can be considered to be infinitely long in terms of gas flow the pressure data from that transducer was analyzed for permeability estimations fig 6 presents permeability as a function of pore pressure at a confining stress of 4000 psi for sample a the permeability curve shows a complex relationship between permeability and pore pressure because of the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation when pore pressure is below 900 psi the permeability increases with further decreasing pore pressure in this regime the permeability change is obviously dominated by knudsen diffusion and slippage flow because their impact becomes more significant at low pore pressures note that the slippage flow corresponds to a flow process when the gas velocity is not zero at pore wells thus slippage flow does not depend on pore size and can occur in both conventional and unconventional rocks while knudsen diffusion occurs only in extremely small pores for pore pressures larger than 900 psi the mechanical deformation becomes more important than the diffusion effect and thus the permeability increases with increasing pore pressure at a given confining stress the increase in pore pressure will enlarge pore and pore throat sizes and thus enhance the permeability the complexity of the relationship between permeability and pore pressure shown in fig 6 highlights the need to measure the combined effects of knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation considering that permeability is such an important parameter for hydrocarbon production from reservoirs the anp method provides a very efficient way to capture the combined effect for example this test only took about 30 min to measure the permeability curve shown in fig 6 it is significantly more efficient than the point by point method simply because the anp method directly measures the permeability curve with a single test run while traditional methods measure one permeability data point with a single test run as previously indicated the collapsing of pressure curves in fig 5 strongly indicates that the anp method for permeability estimation is valid furthermore we also compare the observed permeability data with two permeability data points measured using two independent methods fig 6 one method is the steady state method at a pore pressure of 1000 psi and the same confining pressure of 4000 psi the steady state test is performed for a short core sample 0 5 in long that was obtained by cutting sample a near its inlet the permeability obtained with the steady state method is slightly higher but close to the permeability value observed with the anp method for the same confining and pore pressures also toward the end of the test the flow process between sample inlet and the first pressure transducer should be close to the steady state based on measured flow rate into the core inlet and pressure gradient between the inlet and the first pressure transducer we estimated the permeability with darcy s law the estimated permeability is almost identical to the anp results for the given pore pressure results from both independent methods support the validity of the anp results while sample a has a relatively high permeability on the order of μd for unconventional rocks fig 6 fig 7 as another example shows observed permeability as a function of pore pressure for sample b that has a much lower permeability on the order of nd at high pore pressures at pore pressure lower than 600 psi the relative increase of permeability is more significant than that for sample a indicating that knudsen diffusion has a much more important effect on permeability however at relatively high pore pressures larger than 800 psi the permeability for sample b essentially remains unchanged with pore pressure this suggests that the mechanical deformation effect on permeability is insignificant for sample b under the test conditions fig 7 this makes sense because a lower permeability generally corresponds to a smaller pore size consequently for a given pore pressure the knudsen number becomes larger eq 4 and so is the enhancement factor of permeability eq 5 on the other hand a lower permeability also generally corresponds to a smaller porosity and thus to a rock with larger stiffness in this case mechanical deformation is relatively insignificant within the range of pore pressures used for the test and thus permeability does not change much at high pore pressures in fig 7 when knudsen diffusion effect essentially disappears finally it is important to note that the anp method as a new technique for source rock permeability measurement still has room for improvement in terms of optimizing the design of the permeameter and the test procedure for example fig 6 shows the combined effects of knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation on permeability in many cases it may be preferable to obtain the effects purely from knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation respectively to do so the current test procedure needs to be extended as follows after obtaining the combined effects of knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation e g fig 6 we let the system reach equilibrium such that the pore pressure in the system is the same as that in the upstream gas reservoir then we increase the gas pressure again in the upstream gas reservoir and the confining stress say by 2000 psi and repeat the experimental procedure to obtain permeability pressure curve similar to fig 6 the pore pressure in this second part of the test is so high that the effect of knudsen diffusion slippage flow is insignificant in the experiment results the observed permeability pressure curve is essentially a result of mechanical deformation only considering that mechanical deformation is the same for the same effective stress the difference between permeability values obtained from the first measuring the combined effects and second parts of this test for a given effective stress can be used to calculate an effective permeability value that only results from knudsen diffusion slippage flow this extended test procedure needs further investigation in the future 5 conclusions in a shale gas reservoir rock matrix has extremely low permeability and thus is the bottleneck for shale gas flow from the reservoir to hydraulic fracture and then to the production well we speculate that the next big thing after hydraulic fracturing for the unconventional resources development is to enhance the matrix permeability in an economically feasible way consequently the efficient and accurate characterization of rock permeability in the laboratory is a critical task the current laboratory techniques

point for one test run and are thus time consuming the root cause of this point by point approach is that these laboratory techniques are based on linearized gas flow theory requiring only small pore pressure disturbances to the experiment system liu et al 2019a b and this work introduce a new methodology or the anp method that is based on the nonlinear gas flow theory and allows for direct measurement of permeability pressure function with a single test run this makes the approach highly time efficient the feasibility and validity of the methodology are also demonstrated in this work based on laboratory measurement results and their consistency with theoretical expectations and other independent measurements both knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation impact the shale gas permeability we measured permeability as a function of pore pressure for a given confining stress with our new anp method the observed permeability exhibits a complex relationship with pore pressure as a result of the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation for a given confining pressure the observed permeability initially decreases with pore pressure because of knudsen diffusion and then increases with pore pressure owing to the mechanical deformation effect a rock sample with a lower permeability corresponds to a stronger knudsen diffusion effect and weaker mechanical diffusion effect this complex behavior highlights the need to accurately and efficiently measure the combined effects that may have important impacts on shale gas production

gas flows from the rock matrix to the production well through natural and or hydraulic fractures along this flow path the rock matrix has the largest pore space or gas in place but the smallest permeability the low permeability rock matrix is really the bottleneck of hydrocarbon flow ozkan et al 2011 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2019a b so far the most important technological innovation in the

speculate that the next big thing after hydraulic fracturing is the enhancement of matrix permeability in an economically feasible way to attack this important issue the first step is to determine how to accurately measure the matrix permeability because of its extremely low value the accurate measurement of shale matrix permeability remains a challenge the most commonly used laboratory method to

shale core sample evolutions of the gas pressures from the two gas reservoirs are monitored as a function of time the permeability of shale sample is then determined by fitting the pressure measurements with the relevant analytical solution to gas flow within the test system that includes permeability as a fitting parameter in the pressure pulse decay method a small pressure pulse is introduced into the upstream gas reservoir where the maximum pressure increase is allowed to be a few percent of the initial gas pressure e g dicker and smits 1988 jones 1997 this is because the current pressure decay method relies on analytical solutions to linear or linearized gas flow equations that require small disturbances to the test system such that fluid density and viscosity can be approximated as constants within the core sample as a result of this limitation the traditional pressure pulse decay method belongs to the so called point by point method for the following reason for a given confining pressure and pore pressure one measures one permeability point only with one test run in order to measure another permeability point one needs to change the confining pressure and or pore pressure and re equilibrate the system before taking the permeability measurement to investigate permeability as a function of effective stress requires multiple data points or multiple test runs each of which corresponds to one permeability point under different stress pressure conditions depending on the permeability the re equilibrium process can take a long time jones 1997 thus the point by point method can be very time consuming another widely used laboratory method for shale permeability measurement is the gas research institute gri method luffel et al 1993 gri 1996 when rock cores are taken from deep within the subsurface to the surface they can be subjected to significant stress release this in many cases generates fractures in core samples that can dominate measured laboratory permeability values this makes the laboratory permeability measurement irrelevant to the true permeability value in the reservoir the development of the gri method is partially motivated by overcoming the impact of the induced features in core samples on permeability measurement luffel et al 1993 gri 1996 the gri uses crushed rock samples with a particle size diameter of about 1 mm because it is believed that the induced fractures do not exist at that scale the brief procedure of the gri method is given as follows put the crushed samples into a container and let equilibrium occur between the gas pressures in the container and pores in the rock samples then connect the container to another container with a higher gas pressure the gas pressures within two containers become the same almost simultaneously then the gas pressure in the containers continues to decline because of the penetration of the gas into rock particles the permeability is determined by fitting the observed pressure as a function of time with the associated analytical solution with permeability as a fitting parameter the gri method suffers from several major limitations the gri permeability measurements have been found to be dependent on the particle size of crushed samples and a larger particle size corresponds to a larger measured permeability value cui et al 2009 tinni et al 2012 a question is naturally raised regarding how representative the gri measurements for a given particle size are the gri test is generally conducted at small pore pressures that induce significant impact of diffusion on the measurements as well liu et al 2018 the diffusion effect will be discussed later furthermore the gri method is only conducted under the zero confining stress condition and thus cannot be used for investigating stress dependency of shale permeability luffel et al 1993 gri 1996 to overcome some of the technology challenges mentioned above the aramco research center in houston texas has developed a laboratory technology called aramco nano permeameter anp to measure core scale shale permeability as functions of pore pressure and stress liu et al 2019a b anp has several functions to overcome the limitation of the gri method anp can measure matrix permeability from fractured cores under different pore pressure and stress conditions which will be presented in a companion paper zhang et al this issue the objective of this paper is to present the anp method to overcome the inefficiency of the point by point measurement approach with a focus on the direct measurement of the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability as will be discussed in the next section both knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation have significant impacts on measured shale permeability the direct measurement of their combined effects however has been very rare in the literature 2 effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability there are several reasons why shale permeability is difficult to measure one obvious reason is its extremely small value because the permeability measurement results can be significantly impacted by even very slight leakage of the laboratory system chen et al 2018 in addition the measured shale permeability in the laboratory is impacted by both diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation the gas diffusion is a process for net movement of a substance from a high concentration region to a low concentration region as a result of thermal motion of gas molecules based on the classic statistical physics the gas diffusion coefficient d is given by e g javadpour et al 2014 1 d 1 3 lu where l is the mean free path that is the average distance for a molecule to travel before it hits other molecules and u is the averaged magnitude of thermal motion speed they are given by e g civan 2010 ziarani and aguilera 2012 javadpour et al 2014 2 l k b t 2 π d c 2 p 3 u 8 k b t πw where k b is the boltzmann constant 1 3805 10 23 j k t k is the temperature p pa is the pressure d c m is the collision diameter for gas that is 0 358 nm for n2 that is often used as a working fluid to measure permeability in laboratory as previously indicated and w kg mol is the gas molecular weight in the conventional rocks the pore size is much larger than the mean free path and thus collisions mainly occur among gas molecules rather than between molecules and pore walls in this case fluid flow is dominated by the viscous flow process and the diffusion effect on fluid flow is negligible also note that collisions among gas molecules result in the viscosity defined on the continuum scale in shale and other unconventional rocks the gas mean free path depending on the pore pressure for a given temperature could be larger than the pore radius on the order of nm in this case the collisions among gas molecules are very rare and mainly occur between the pore walls and gas molecules consequently the resistance to the bulk movement of gas molecules is reduced compared to the regime of viscous fluid flow that corresponds to the dominant collisions among gas molecules this diffusion process is called knudsen diffusion and characterized by knudsen number defined as 4 k n l r where r is the pore radius when knudsen diffusion and slippage flow become important the measured or effective permeability is larger than the true or intrinsic permeability to demonstrate this effect fig 1 shows the enhancement factor of permeability f c for a micro tube with a radius of 5 nm a typical value for the size of pore throat in shale as a function of pore pressure for nitrogen the enhancement factor is defined as the effective value for the permeability to its intrinsic value the effective permeability corresponds to the permeability determined from darcy s law with the observed flux and pressure gradient along the micro tube for a given pore pressure based on a large number of numerical experiments for micro tubes that accurately capture both the knudsen diffusion and slippage gas flow beskok and karniadakis 1999 reported a mathematical formulation for f c 5 f c 1 α k n 1 4 k n 1 b k n where b is a constant and equal to 1 and α is the dimensionless rarefaction coefficient and can be empirically determined from the knudsen number civan 2010 while the above equation can accurately calculate the enhancement factor for micro tubes development of the corresponding formulation for porous media is still an area of active research because of the complexity of pore geometry in porous media e g civan 2010 ziarani and aguilera 2012 javadpour et al 2014 nevertheless liu et al 2018 demonstrated that the approximation of pore space in a porous media with a group of identified micro tubes seems to be reasonable for the purpose of calculating f c as shown in fig 1 the enhance factor is significantly higher than one for low pore pressures indicating that measured or effective permeability value can be much higher than the true or intrinsic permeability the enhancement factor f c is equal to one when the effective and intrinsic permeability values are identical however it is important to note that gas flow in a shale reservoir is controlled by the effective permeability its enhancement owing to the diffusion slippage flow is desirable for improving the gas production rate during the later production when gas pressure in the reservoir is relatively low thus it is important to be able to measure such permeability enhancement in the laboratory as a function of pore pressure on the other hand the permeability of unconventional rocks has been shown to be significantly stress sensitive with laboratory experiment results liu 2017 bhandari et al 2015 heller et al 2014 vermylen 2011 dong et al 2010 bustin et al 2008 kwon et al 2004 for a given confining stress the increase in pore pressure or decrease in effective stress enlarges the pore sizes and thus in contrast with the diffusion effect will enhance the measured permeability value among a number of different factors this stress sensitivity is a key contributor to the well known fact that the early production rate declines very rapidly with time the stress dependency of permeability is critical for predicting the performance of unconventional reservoirs and for optimizing reservoir management strategies such as the management of pressure drawdown in production wells both the diffusion and mechanical deformation significantly impact the shale permeability and yet in a competing manner while there are a number of studies on the dependency of shale permeability on stress pore pressure in the literature as previously indicated the direct measurement of the combined effects of the diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability is very rare the laboratory measurement of these combined effects in high resolution is the major objective of this work 3 theoretical foundation for the experimental method as previously indicated the pressure pulse decay method to measure core scale shale permeability follows the point by point approach permeability is measured at a given pore pressure for a given confining stress and then measured again at a different pore pressure so that a stress dependent permeability curve consisting of a number of data points can be generated the method requires multiple test runs and is very time consuming the root cause of the point by point approach is that the pressure pulse decay method is based on analytical solutions to linear or linearized gas flow equations that require small disturbance to the test system to enhance the measurement efficiency the anp method in contrast with the pressure pulse decay method takes advantage of a solution to the nonlinear gas flow equation such that the anp method can measure permeability vs pore pressure curve or function rather than a permeability data point with a single test run liu et al 2019a 2019b while the details of the theory behind the anp method are given in liu et al 2019a 2019b the theory is briefly discussed here for the completeness the mass conservation equation for one dimensional non reactive gas flow along a rock column is given by 6 m t x kρ μ p x where t is time x is spatial coordinate k is permeability for the mobile continuum μ ρ and p are gas viscosity density and pressure respectively and m is the total gas mass per unit volume of the porous medium or apparent gas density written as 7 m φρ where φ is porosity the right hand side of eq 6 can be rewritten as 8 m t dm dp p t since our study is limited to the isothermal condition m is considered a function of pressure only consider an infinitely long shale column with gas flow from the inlet x 0 and the following boundary and initial conditions 9 p x t p i x 0 t 0 p x t p 0 x 0 0 p x t p i x t 0 using the boltzmann transformation as 10 λ xt 1 2 eq 9 can be rewritten as p λ p i λ 11 p λ p 0 λ 0 and eq 6 becomes 12 λ 2 dm dp dp dλ d dλ d p dp dλ where 13 d p kρ μ eq 12 is an ordinary differential equation with λ as the only independent variable which can be solved analytically directly integrating eq 13 within the interval λ yields 14 d p p i p λ 2 dm dp dp dp dλ the above equation indicates that d p can be fully determined when p λ is known in the other words as long as we can determine p λ in one test run the permeability as a function of pore pressure can be determined from d p obtained from eq 14 note that in eq 13 the relations among density viscosity and gas pressure are known for a given test fluid e g nitrogen gas on the basis of the gas mass balance the cumulative gas flow into the sample at x 0 is 15 m t a p i p 0 λ dm dp dp t 1 2 bt 1 2 where b is a slope for the curve of m t versus t 1 2 based on eq 15 and considering that porosity can be approximately considered constant during the test we can determine the porosity of the core sample as 16 φ b a p i p 0 λ dρ dp dp where a is a cross sectional area of the sample eqs 14 and 16 are the key equations used by the anp for efficiently measuring the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation on shale permeability for different pore pressures the next section will discuss howp λ is determined with a single test run finally it may be useful to review the historical root of the theoretical framework discussed above considering that the same framework has been used for measuring different flow and transport properties for processes characterized by non linear diffusive equations the boltzmann transformation eq 10 was put forward by ludwig boltzmann the father of statistical physics to solve non linear diffusion equations under special boundary and initial conditions eq 9 matano 1933 derived an expression for diffusion coefficient as a function of concentration based on the boltzmann transformation for mass transport problems his expression is similar to our eq 14 bruce and klute 1956 then applied the boltzmann matano method to developing a laboratory technique to estimate soil water diffusivity related to relative permeability and capillary pressure curve liu et al 2019a 2019b and this work for the first time apply a similar mathematical technique to efficiently measure gas permeability as a function of pore pressure 4 experimental setup results and discussion to implement the methodology presented in the above section that allows permeability to be measured as a function of pore pressure with a single test run an anp setup was built fig 2 it consists of an upstream gas reservoir a core holder containing a core sample that is subject to confining pressure and a downstream gas reservoir they are connected to three different pumps to provide gas pressures and confining pressure respectively a number of pressure and temperature transducers are used to monitor the pressure and temperature conditions at different locations during the test fig 2 the whole anp setup was placed within an oven with a constant temperature such that the tests were conducted under isothermal conditions three inch long core samples with a diameter of one inch from eagle ford are used for the tests these cores were scanned with ct to make sure that they did not contain fractures to be consistent with the boundary and initial conditions in our theoretical model discussed in the above section the anp setup is equilibrated with a given constant pore pressure in the tests to be discussed in this work we use the atmospheric pressure as the initial pore pressure to avoid the pressure equilibrium process we then increase the gas pressure in the upstream gas reservoir from the atmospheric pressure to 2000 psi and keep it fixed after that we let gas nitrogen herein flow from the upstream gas reservoir through the core sample to the downstream gas reservoir three pressure transducers are used to measure gas pressures as functions of time at three different locations along the core sample fig 2 to minimize the disturbance of the dead volume defined as the volume connected to the core sample s pore space within a pressure transducer to the gas flow in the core sample being tested analog pressure transducers with almost zero dead volumes were used also during a test a constant confining pressure 4000 psi for this study was applied to the core samples as indicated in eq 9 the anp theoretical model requires an infinitely long rock core sample the sample however can never be that long in reality to deal with this issue we introduce the concept of critical time before which the gas flow at a given location is equivalent to the flow occurring in an infinitely long core sample the critical time for the outlet of the sample corresponds to the experiment time when the pressure breaks through in the downstream gas reservoir then the outlet boundary effect will propagate from the outlet in a direction that is opposite to the gas flow direction thus the critical time at any location along the rock sample will be the summation of the critical time at the outlet and the propagation time or the time for the outlet boundary effect to propagate to the location since accumulative gas flow rate from the upstream gas reservoir to an infinitely long core sample is proportional to the square root of time for the given boundary and initial conditions eq 5 the critical time at the inlet occurs when the above relationship between the flow rate and time breaks the difference between the inlet and outlet critical times is the propagation time at the inlet note that propagation time at the outlet is zero by definition then the propagation time at any location between the inlet and outlet is determined with interpolation based on an approximation that propagation distance for the downstream boundary effect l p in fig 3 is proportional to the square root of time for a diffusive process liu et al 2019a 2019b the governing equation for gas flow in a core is mathematically identical to the diffusion equation as indicated in section 3 to determine the relationship between permeability and pore pressure we need to know p λ for each of the three pressure transducers along the core sample fig 2 we measure pressure as a function of time then we can determine p λ by calculating λ for a given time using eq 10 note that the location of a given transducer corresponding to x in eq 10 is known and fixed finally eqs 13 and 14 are used for calculating permeability as a function of pore pressure after obtaining p λ we only used the measurements before the critical times at pressure transducer locations for the permeability determinations theoretically only one pressure transducer was needed for determining p λ and thus for estimating permeability as a function of pore pressure three pressure transducers are employed here fig 2 because the comparison between measurements from different transducers as will be discussed later provides a powerful approach to validate the test methodology and setup several eagle ford rock samples as previously indicated were used for evaluating the anp method as an example fig 4 shows measured gas pressures for sample a as functions of time at the inlet upstream gas reservoir outlet downstream gas reservoir and three pressure transducers along the core sample fig 5 presents p λ curves calculated with pressure history data collected from the three pressure transducers along the core sample these curves essentially collapse into one curve which is consistent with the theory discussed in section 3 for gas flow through a core sample that can be treated as an infinitely long column under the related boundary and initial conditions pressure is a function of λ only note that eq 14 used to calculate permeability is a result of simply combining the mass balance equation with that pressure is a function of λ only therefore the observation from fig 5 indicates that permeability function can be accurately estimated based on eq 14 in addition it ensures that the test setup works appropriately the similar observations are obtained for other rock samples because the pressure transducer 1 fig 2 is closest to the sample inlet and thus has the biggest pressure range in which rock sample can be considered to be infinitely long in terms of gas flow the pressure data from that transducer was analyzed for permeability estimations fig 6 presents permeability as a function of pore pressure at a confining stress of 4000 psi for sample a the permeability curve shows a complex relationship between permeability and pore pressure because of the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation when pore pressure is below 900 psi the permeability increases with further decreasing pore pressure in this regime the permeability change is obviously dominated by knudsen diffusion and slippage flow because their impact becomes more significant at low pore pressures note that the slippage flow corresponds to a flow process when the gas velocity is not zero at pore wells thus slippage flow does not depend on pore size and can occur in both conventional and unconventional rocks while knudsen diffusion occurs only in extremely small pores for pore pressures larger than 900 psi the mechanical deformation becomes more important than the diffusion effect and thus the permeability increases with increasing pore pressure at a given confining stress the increase in pore pressure will enlarge pore and pore throat sizes and thus enhance the permeability the complexity of the relationship between permeability and pore pressure shown in fig 6 highlights the need to measure the combined effects of knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation considering that permeability is such an important parameter for hydrocarbon production from reservoirs the anp method provides a very efficient way to capture the combined effect for example this test only took about 30 min to measure the permeability curve shown in fig 6 it is significantly more efficient than the point by point method simply because the anp method directly measures the permeability curve with a single test run while traditional methods measure one permeability data point with a single test run as previously indicated the collapsing of pressure curves in fig 5 strongly indicates that the anp method for permeability estimation is valid furthermore we also compare the observed permeability data with two permeability data points measured using two independent methods fig 6 one method is the steady state method at a pore pressure of 1000 psi and the same confining pressure of 4000 psi the steady state test is performed for a short core sample 0 5 in long that was obtained by cutting sample a near its inlet the permeability obtained with the steady state method is slightly higher but close to the permeability value observed with the anp method for the same confining and pore pressures also toward the end of the test the flow process between sample inlet and the first pressure transducer should be close to the steady state based on measured flow rate into the core inlet and pressure gradient between the inlet and the first pressure transducer we estimated the permeability with darcy s law the estimated permeability is almost identical to the anp results for the given pore pressure results from both independent methods support the validity of the anp results while sample a has a relatively high permeability on the order of μd for unconventional rocks fig 6 fig 7 as another example shows observed permeability as a function of pore pressure for sample b that has a much lower permeability on the order of nd at high pore pressures at pore pressure lower than 600 psi the relative increase of permeability is more significant than that for sample a indicating that knudsen diffusion has a much more important effect on permeability however at relatively high pore pressures larger than 800 psi the permeability for sample b essentially remains unchanged with pore pressure this suggests that the mechanical deformation effect on permeability is insignificant for sample b under the test conditions fig 7 this makes sense because a lower permeability generally corresponds to a smaller pore size consequently for a given pore pressure the knudsen number becomes larger eq 4 and so is the enhancement factor of permeability eq 5 on the other hand a lower permeability also generally corresponds to a smaller porosity and thus to a rock with larger stiffness in this case mechanical deformation is relatively insignificant within the range of pore pressures used for the test and thus permeability does not change much at high pore pressures in fig 7 when knudsen diffusion effect essentially disappears finally it is important to note that the anp method as a new technique for source rock permeability measurement still has room for improvement in terms of optimizing the design of the permeameter and the test procedure for example fig 6 shows the combined effects of knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation on permeability in many cases it may be preferable to obtain the effects purely from knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation respectively to do so the current test procedure needs to be extended as follows after obtaining the combined effects of knudsen diffusion slippage flow and mechanical deformation e g fig 6 we let the system reach equilibrium such that the pore pressure in the system is the same as that in the upstream gas reservoir then we increase the gas pressure again in the upstream gas reservoir and the confining stress say by 2000 psi and repeat the experimental procedure to obtain permeability pressure curve similar to fig 6 the pore pressure in this second part of the test is so high that the effect of knudsen diffusion slippage flow is insignificant in the experiment results the observed permeability pressure curve is essentially a result of mechanical deformation only considering that mechanical deformation is the same for the same effective stress the difference between permeability values obtained from the first measuring the combined effects and second parts of this test for a given effective stress can be used to calculate an effective permeability value that only results from knudsen diffusion slippage flow this extended test procedure needs further investigation in the future 5 conclusions in a shale gas reservoir rock matrix has extremely low permeability and thus is the bottleneck for shale gas flow from the reservoir to hydraulic fracture and then to the production well we speculate that the next big thing after hydraulic fracturing for the unconventional resources development is to enhance the matrix permeability in an economically feasible way consequently the efficient and accurate characterization of rock permeability in the laboratory is a critical task the current laboratory techniques for source rock permeability measurement follow a point by point approach this requires multiple test runs to obtain a permeability pressure curve because they can only measure one permeability data point for one test run and are thus time consuming the root cause of this point by point approach is that these laboratory techniques are based on linearized gas flow theory requiring only small pore pressure disturbances to the experiment system liu et al 2019a b and this work introduce a new methodology or the anp method that is based on the nonlinear gas flow theory and allows for direct measurement of permeability pressure function with a single test run this makes the approach highly time efficient the feasibility and validity of the methodology are also demonstrated in this work based on laboratory measurement results and their consistency with theoretical expectations and other independent measurements both knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation impact the shale gas permeability we measured permeability as a function of pore pressure for a given confining stress with our new anp method the observed permeability exhibits a complex relationship with pore pressure as a result of the combined effects of knudsen diffusion and mechanical deformation for a given confining pressure the observed permeability initially decreases with pore pressure because of knudsen diffusion and then increases with pore pressure owing to the mechanical deformation effect a rock sample with a lower permeability corresponds to a stronger knudsen diffusion effect and weaker mechanical diffusion effect this complex behavior highlights the need to accurately and efficiently measure the combined effects that may have important impacts on shale gas production 
1518,this study analyzed the dynamics of major ions and trace elements along the groundwater flow path of the coastal sedimentary todos santos aquifer in baja california sur mexico moderately impacted by anthropogenic activities the results indicate that the elements ca2 mg2 ba2 sr2 and li are mobilized from the aquifer matrix during seawater intrusion whereas the alkali elements na k and rb are removed from solution possibly due to cationic exchange process the anions hco3 and so4 2 and the elements i and b are mobilized due to carbonate mineral weathering whereas dissolved silica and the halides br and f behave conservatively during salinization groundwater no3 is provided by sewage infiltration regarding trace elements behavior we identify three groups i elements that are mobilized during saline intrusion fe co v se re ii elements revealing low or no mobilization mo ni cr ta w and iii elements that show an undefined tendency u as ge sb cu mn the u and no3 levels in groundwater should be considered carefully because several wells have concentrations close to the permissible levels this study may be useful as reference for knowing the possible effect of salinization in coastal aquifers under sea level rise scenarios driven by climate change graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords major ions trace elements groundwater seawater intrusion los cabos block mexico 1 introduction seawater intrusion has become one of the principal causes of groundwater quality deterioration in coastal aquifers stressed by urban growth or agricultural and industrial activities many factors such as excessive extraction of groundwater climate change temperature sea level and rainfall changes and the deformation uplift or subsidence of ground surface can affect the freshwater seawater interface in coastal aquifers promoting or precluding seawater intrusion ketabchi et al 2016 ma et al 2018 koohbor et al 2019 additionally other natural and man made processes such as water rock interaction groundwater transit time geothermal mixing irrigation return flow and wastewater infiltration can also threaten groundwater quality in coastal aquifers intensifying the salinization and leading the degradation of groundwater used for potable and irrigation purposes chandrajith et al 2016 yolcubal et al 2019 it is well known that some geochemical processes occur at the water sediment interface during the intrusion of seawater inland one of the most known geochemical effect of seawater intrusion is cation exchange where ca2 is exchanged by na in the aquifer matrix producing an increase of ca2 and a decrease of na concentrations in solution with regard to the freshwater seawater mixing line appelo and postma 2005 like ca elements such as sr mg and b may also be released into the solution during seawater intrusion by cationic exchange mahlknecht et al 2017 khadra et al 2017 whereas na and k show the opposite behavior in that they are retained in the aquifer mineral structure cation exchange has also been suggested to be the main source of ba in groundwater of subterranean estuaries shaw et al 1998 charette and sholkovitz 2006 on the other hand other authors have pointed out that anionic exchange can also occur during salinization and freshening events in coastal aquifers and in sediment column experiments russak et al 2015a b in these studies it has been stated that the enrichment of po4 3 and dissolved silica dsi in solution occur during salinization due to desorption of both from the aquifer sediment matrix where they are exchanged by b and hco3 in addition to ionic exchange processes other geochemical processes such as redox reactions sorption desorption co precipitation change in ionic strength and mineral dissolution can also take place during the advance of the seawater into the aquifers increasing or decreasing the concentrations of major minor and trace elements in groundwater russak et al 2016 khadra et al 2017 for example russak et al 2016 have indicated that li and b are adsorbed into the aquifer during salinization depleting to about half of their expected conservative concentrations in groundwater however other studies have demonstrated the li enrichment in groundwater during seawater intrusion either by cationic exchange or li dissolution santucci et al 2016 souid et al 2018 experimental simulation studies have shown that water salinity controls the as desorption in high as aquifer sediments morelli et al 2017 also recent studies have indicated the mobilization of as cu ni rb and u during seawater intrusion in limestone and dolomite limestone aquifers by either desorption or dissolution of host minerals khadra et al 2017 pore water studies performed in a deltaic wetland of louisiana usa suggest that fe mn and as are released to solution whereas v is sequestered by sediments telfeyan et al 2017 moreover studies by stuyfzand 1992 have suggested that the redox sensitive elements fe and mn can also participate in the cation exchange reactions during salinization and freshening although both elements can precipitate afterwards under high ph and oxidizing conditions likewise mn fe and mo have been found to desorbed from sediments during seawater circulation in aquifers of insular environments due to reducing conditions which also favors the removal of u re and v from solution reckhardt et al 2017 in contrast to the sorption and desorption of elements during seawater penetration into the aquifers there is a group of trace elements that show no sign of mobilization or depletion independent of groundwater salinity such as al cr and pb this behavior is probably due to their insolubility at circum neutral ph and their high affinity to be sorbed into the sediments or aquifer matrix khadra et al 2017 additionally there is another group of elements that behaves conservatively in solution in the form of anions this group comprises the halogen ions cl and br which are considered conservative anions during saline intrusion both negative ions tend to follow the theoretical mixing line between freshwater seawater because they are not affected by ionic exchange or other geochemical or biological processes davis et al 1998 mahlknecht et al 2017 thus both anions are useful as salinity indicators in view of an expected increase of sea level as a consequence of global warming the understanding of trace element behavior during saline intrusion can be of prime importance for quantifying the effect of sea level rise on groundwater quality in coastal areas thus we performed a comprehensive study of major ion and trace element dynamics during seawater intrusion in the arid coastal aquifer of todos santos which is used for the water supply to todos santos town in the baja california sur state mexico given that industrial activities are not performed in todos santos and that agriculture is not intensive in that area the todos santos aquifer seems to be a suitable place for studying the natural geochemical processes occurring during the flow of seawater into aquifers therefore the objectives of this paper were i to evaluate the dynamics of major and trace elements in groundwater during seawater intrusion in an arid sedimentary aquifer which has been moderately impacted by anthropogenic activities and ii to assess the water quality supplied to todos santos in order to detect any threat to human health the main contribution of this work is to know the behavior of major ions and trace elements in groundwater of coastal sedimentary aquifers subjected to salinization processes this may be useful for knowing the effect of the sea level rise on the water quality of this kind of coastal aquifers 2 study area 2 1 general setting todos santos is a small town located in the southwestern part of the baja california peninsula fig 1a this location is a valley bordered by the pacific ocean to the west and la laguna mountain ranges to the east

region are predominantly low organic matter calcaric regosols in the valley and leptosols in the highest zones however fluvisols are also found surrounding the main streams the climate in the region is arid to semi arid in the valley and temperate sub humid in the highest parts on the mountains the region is characterized by long drought periods interrupted by tropical storms and hurricanes which occur during summer thus the mean annual precipitation shows a broad range of values which have varied between 8 5 mm 1961 to 404 mm 2011 frbc todos santos dos 2012 in general the mean annual

culinary herbs cucumber tomato and some tropical fruit trees 2 2 geological background the study area is part of a marine continental sedimentary basin called todos santos el carrizal which is an elongated graben filled with quaternary alluvial deposits with nnw sse orientation coremi 2001 the ancient rocks in this area correspond to a complex of metasedimentary rocks derived from greywacke marl and impure limestone punta lobos gneiss and todos santos marble and phyllite which was derived from the metamorphism of shale and sandstone figs 1 and 2 the jurassic sedimentary rocks underwent low pressure high temperature contact metamorphism caused by granodioritic and gabbroic intrusions during the early cretaceous and small granitic intrusions during the late cretaceous coremi 2000 coremi 2001 this group of intrusive rocks is known as los cabos block aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989a b schaaf et al 2000 clastic and marine sediments forming continental deposits of semi consolidated to consolidated polymictic conglomerates were deposited at the end of the pliocene and during the pleistocene covering the jurassic metasedimentary rocks and the cretaceous plutonic rocks coremi 2001 these sediments vary from clays to gravel and their average thickness fluctuates between 10 and 60 m the marine sediments consist mainly of greenish ocher fine to medium grained sandstones containing abundant marine fossils interstratified with them are friable to weakly carbonate cemented arkosic sandstones this stratum is cyclically interlayered with conglomeratic arkose beds of 5 m thick alternating with ocher fine sandstone strata 0 5 2 m and green siltstone and sandstone beds 3 m where brackish marine fossils and shell fragments are common throughout aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989a overall this type of deposit is common in other miocene pleistocene sedimentary basins of the baja california peninsula martínez gutiérrez and sethi 1997 in the valley the holocene is represented by deposits of sands and silts resulting from the erosion of the mountain ranges which forms broad plains along the main streams toward the coastline there is a narrow plain constituted by granular coastal sediments essentially fine grained sands furthermore alluvial material composed of clayey and silty fine sands ranging from fine to very coarse grains were deposited on the stream beds coremi 2001 conagua 2009 2 3 hydrogeological settings the hydrography of the study area has a dendritic to sub dendritic drainage pattern because of the homogeneous lithology the streams start at the top of the mountain ranges and disappear in the alluvial plain by infiltration into the aquifer however during precipitation events streams discharge into the pacific ocean coremi 2000 coremi 2001 in the valley between latitudes 23 23ʼ 23 32ʼn and longitudes 110 01ʼ 110 14ʼ40ʼʼw there is an unconfined sedimentary aquifer of small dimensions with and area of 155 km2 and a thickness ranging between 10 and 60 m fig 1b the aquifer has a low storage volume because the igneous and metamorphic basement limits the extension of the alluvial sediments at depth however the basement rocks contain fractures faults and other alterations providing pathways for groundwater flow conagua 2009 the aquifer is characterized by high porosity and transmissivity values that range from 1 3 10 3 to 84 8 10 3 m2 s leading to high hydraulic conductivity values conagua 2009 the natural recharge of the aquifer estimated at 18 4 million m3 y dof 2018 conagua 2009 is mainly from rainfall infiltration and by infiltration of the ephemeral streams in the alluvial plain during rains groundwater isotope data have shown that hurricanes and storms have an important effect on the recharge of the todos santos aquifer and other aquifers of the entire region eastoe et al 2015 these data indicate that groundwater is likely to originate as surface water during hurricanes and tropical storms in the low elevation watershed suggesting a rapid response of the aquifer to the precipitation events eastoe et al 2015 that is rainfall infiltration is direct and fast overall hurricanes increase rainfall in a short time compared to the mean monthly precipitation leading to groundwater recharge and the freshening of the aquifer system impacted by seawater intrusion in fact hurricanes have been considered as the cause of the retreat of the seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer of la paz in baja california sur torres martínez et al 2019 similarly these exceptional rain events have been proven to help replenish reservoirs and aquifers in other arid and semi arid regions of northern mexico aguilar barajas et al 2019 important streams such as arroyo la reforma discharge into the ocean during strong rains the equipotential lines constructed from static groundwater levels measured in 2007 show that both surface and groundwater flow from the high range mountains ne to sw direction fig 1a and b discharging into the ocean nevertheless due to the water table is very low in the coastal areas vary from 3 to 5 m in the coastal areas to less than 10 m in the todos santos town discharge by evapotranspiration occurs in wetland areas near the coast and inland agriculture fields conagua 2009 fichera 2019 groundwater extraction estimated at 16 3 million m3 y conagua 2009 is carried out by means of wells distributed both in the recharge areas and near the todos santos town the mean annual groundwater extraction rate is nearly 90 of the recharge rate however because the area is subject to extreme droughts interrupted by strong storms groundwater availability shows a large annual variability for example in 2009 the aquifer displayed an annual deficit of 151 030 m3 whereas in 2015 it was shown to be in balance federman 2015 given this groundwater deficit showed during some years due to the high groundwater extraction the aquifer has been designated as overexploited by the national water commission conagua furthermore long term steady state simulated salinity contour maps fichera 2019 have revealed that lateral saline intrusion occurs in the todos santos aquifer where the seawater freshwater interface reaches up to 607 m inland 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling the groundwater sampling campaign was performed during june 2017 in eighteen wells that supply water to the todos santos town with the exception of the well 13 the wells were mainly located along a line that goes from the recharge areas to the coast following the drainage of arroyo la reforma which is perpendicular to the water table equipotential lines fig 1a at the time of sampling all the wells were operative and equipped with pre installed pumps because of the low thickness of the aquifer system all sampled wells were shallow and equipped with pipes of low diameter between 15 and 20 cm in each well groundwater was pumped and purged until electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature values were stable 5 min for each well which was equivalent to approximately 3 well volumes then the auxiliary parameters ph temperature ec and dissolved oxygen concentrations were recorded by collecting groundwater in a pre rinsed plastic bucket and measuring these parameters immediately using pre calibrated portable meters additionally the groundwater samples were collected in pre washed and pre rinsed polyethylene bottles the bottles were filled completely and transported with ice to the conagua lab in la paz city in the lab each water sample was filtered using 0 45 μm pore size membranes frontal filtration and placed in two pre washed and pre rinsed 250 ml hdpe bottles for the determination of anions and major and trace elements samples for major and trace element analysis were preserved with ultra pure hno3 to avoid element precipitation absorption during storage alkalinity was measured back in the lab on the day of collection by titration using h2so4 0 02 n as titrant until ph 4 3 all the water samples were transported to the laboratories in coolers with ice and then stored at 4 c until analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis the major anions no3 so4 2 cl f were analyzed in the tecnológico de monterrey laboratories by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 1600 equipment the samples for major and trace element analysis were sent to activation laboratories ltd ancaster canada where the concentrations of dissolved major elements na k ca2 mg2 and si transition elements v cr mn fe co ni cu mo ta w and re metalloid elements ge as and sb trace alkali and alkali earth elements li rb sr2 and ba2 trace anions br and other trace elements b se u and i were measured using a perkin elmer sciex elan 9000 icp ms equipment in ultra low mode samples with high concentrations of both major and trace elements were diluted and re run until spectrometric response was normal during the analysis a reagent blank and two water standards were run at the beginning and end of the whole group of samples uncertainties were assessed using laboratory duplicates and verifying the precision calibration of the equipment through the measurements of primary standard solutions the elements al be bi cd pb and zn were also measured using icp ms however these elements were not considered in this study because almost all the samples showed concentrations below the detection limit dl of the analytical technique once the major ion analyses were done the charge balance was cross checked in all water samples sum of cation milliequivalents minus the sum of anion milliequivalents divided by the sum of major ion milliequivalents and multiplied by 100 the absolute charge imbalance ranged between 0 4 and 15 three samples showed an ionic charged imbalance higher than 10 with an average of 5 0 the international standard iv stock 1643 trace metals in water was used to check the accuracy of the icp ms analysis the systematic difference between the standard measurements and the reference values of the considered elements in this study ranged from 0 5 to 12 4 the results of the quality control performed for the analysis of each certified element in the standard iv stock 1643 and the dl of all analyzed elements are included in the supplementary information table s1 3 3 statistical analysis the saturation index si for mineral phases in groundwater were calculated using the software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 hierarchical cluster analysis hca based on euclidean distance and the ward s method was applied to the dataset in order to group water samples with similar chemical characteristics abu alnaeem et al 2018 all the data were log transformed and standardized values minus average divided by standard deviation before hca the student s t test was used to verify significant differences among the water groups established by the hca miller and miller 1989 the non parametric spearman correlation test was conducted to establish relationships between variables all the statistical analyses were carried out through the program statistica 10 0 one concentration of cr and mn and 4 basal concentrations of ni were lower than the dl reported by the analytical technique therefore the results of these values were expressed as dl 2 for statistical purposes 4 results the results of the determination of physicochemical variables major ions and trace elements in groundwater samples collected in the todos santos aquifer are shown in table 1 the location the geographic coordinates and the distance from coastline to inland of the sampled wells are included in the supplementary information table s2 fig 3 depicts the resulting dendogram of the multivariable hca applied to the todos santos dataset the horizontal phenon line clearly delimits two group of samples with a linkage distance above 16 the first group includes the samples 4 5 6 and 7 which were collected in the aquifer recharge areas fig 1a the remaining samples belonging group 2 were taken in wells distributed between 400 m and 3590 m from coastline to inland overall the groundwater of the todos santos aquifer exhibited an almost homogeneous water temperature with values that ranged between 24 2 and 27 2 c the groundwater in the study area was neutral to slightly alkaline in nature ph between 6 83 and 8 43 while the dissolved oxygen concentrations varied from 4 4 to 7 9 mgo2 l indicating the presence of well oxygenated waters over the aquifer values near saturation probably due to the low water table values conagua 2009 these three variables temperature ph and dissolved oxygen did not show significant differences among group 1 and group 2 although some major ions such as k so4 2 and f did not show significant differences among the two groups of samples the seawater abundant ions did group 2 showed average values of 1173 μs cm for ec 717 mg l for total dissolved solids tds and 72 8 mg l 78 2 mg l 28 8 mg l and 207 7 mg l for na ca2 mg2 and cl concentrations respectively overall these chemical parameters were significantly higher p 05 than those of group 1 which showed average values of 433 μs cm for ec 305 mg l for tds and 23 mg l 38 7 mg l 11 3 mg l and 34 3 mg l for na ca2 mg2 and cl concentrations respectively the significantly higher major ion concentrations in samples of group 2 may imply the presence of seawater intrusion in the aquifer from the coastline to up to 3590 m inland the major anions hco3 and no3 also showed significantly higher values in the samples of group 2 than those of samples of group 1 means of 195 7 and 9 0 mg l for hco3 and no3 in group 2 and 133 5 and 4 7 mg l for hco3 and no3 in group 1 however both anions are not abundant in seawater and their higher concentrations in samples of group 2 can be related to mineral weathering hco3 or anthropogenic activities no3 regarding trace ions and elements the water samples of group 2 had significantly higher concentrations of br i li sr2 ba2 b co cu fe ni re sb se and v than those of group 1 whereas other elements such as as cr ge mn mo rb ta u and w did not show significant differences between groups this can be associated to different geochemical processes that depends on the abundance and nature of each chemical element in both seawater and freshwater and are discussed below 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater hydrogeochemistry as commented above cl and br are useful tracers for saline intrusion because they move conservatively in water during transport both anions are ubiquitous in groundwater and they are mainly provided by atmospheric deposition rainfall saline intrusion and halite dissolution in coastal areas rainfall and atmospheric deposition have cl br molar ratios similar to those of oceans 650 690 whereas halite has cl br molar ratios 104 105 much higher than seawater therefore there is a rapid increase in cl br ratios with increasing cl concentrations in groundwater when halite is present in the lithological units of an aquifer cartwright et al 2006 similarly br and cl bearing compounds used as fertilizers or pesticides may also affect the cl br ratios in groundwater changing the signature acquired from marine aerosols and or evaporite rocks davis et al 1998 thomas 2000 as reported in other studies seddique et al 2019 the fact that our data have cl br ratios ranging between 576 and 760 except for sample 19 with a cl br ratio of 910 demonstrates that cl is entirely coming from atmospheric sources and seawater intrusion and that halite and other cl bearing minerals or cl bearing compounds are not present in the aquifer the increased cl as groundwater moves downward through the aquifer implies that cl concentration is only being affected by saline intrusion inside the aquifer the piper diagram fig 4a shows the hydrochemical facies of the todos santos groundwater groundwater samples of group 1 freshwater are ca2 hco3 type whereas groundwater of group 2 evolves from ca2 hco3 to na cl type when salinity is increased indicating that the intrusion of seawater is affecting the groundwater chemistry of group 2 therefore we considered the water of group 2 as a mixture of freshwater and brackish water fig 4b depicts a scatter plot of ca2 plus mg2 versus hco3 plus so4 2 in the water samples of both groups water samples of group 1 fall along the equilibrium line due to both cations and bicarbonate are provided by silicate and carbonate weathering ca2 mg2 and hco3 whereas sulfates may be provided by the weathering of carbonate associated sulfates richardson et al 2019 because calcium sulfate evaporites are not reported in the study area aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989a however the samples of group 2 show clear deviations from the equiline with an excess of ca2 and mg2 over the corresponding anions hco3 plus so4 2 such phenomenon has been widely reported in aquifers affected by seawater intrusion mahlknecht et al 2017 gopinath et al 2019 and it is due the excess of na in the solution which promotes the replacement of na by ca2 in the aquifer matrix cationic exchange increasing the ca2 in solution with respect to its corresponding anions fig 4c and d show the log log scaled binary diagrams of mg na hco3 na and ca na molar rations of groundwater samples of group 1 after the respective correction for atmospheric input using the cl na cl mg and cl ca seawater ratios together with the fields presented by carbonate silicate and evaporite rocks gaillardet et al 1999 groundwater samples of group 2 were not included in these diagrams because cationic exchange erases the groundwater signature acquired during weathering these diagrams depict that freshwater of the study area has interacted more with carbonate than silicate rocks in spite of the sedimentary aquifer mainly comprised of continental and clastic deposits of arkose sands silts and clays with lesser amounts of volcanic fragments this indicates that the weathering of carbonate minerals present in the aquifer matrix such as the abundant marine fossils and the calcareous cement of sandstones and conglomerates exerts a key role in the groundwater chemistry of this sedimentary aquifer an extreme example of this phenomenon has been observed even in a purely silicated catchment where the weathering of trace calcic minerals is responsible for more than 90 of the dissolved ca exported from the watershed oliva et al 2004 this occurs owing to carbonate minerals weather on average 10 and 100 times faster than silicate lithologies meybeck 1987 the si of selected phases together with their uncertainties depicted in the supplementary information fig f1 langmuir and melchior 1985 nordstrom and ball 1989 plummer et al 1990 mclaughlin et al 2013 indicate that although two samples of group 2 show supersaturation with respect to dolomite calcite and aragonite the rest of the groundwater samples are near saturation or in equilibrium with respect to calcite while being undersaturated with respect to aragonite and dolomite on the other hand fig f1 shows that although the si of gypsum anhydrite and halite increase with cl concentrations behavior not shown by the si of calcite aragonite and dolomite the precipitation of these three phases close to the coastline is discarded due to all the samples showing undersaturation 5 2 estimation of seawater intrusion as demonstrated above there are no cl contributions to groundwater other than marine aerosols and seawater intrusion thus the percentage of seawater intruded into the todos santos aquifer can be estimated as follows appelo and postma 2005 1 f sea m sample m freshwater m seawater m freshwater 100 where msample is the molar concentration of cl in the sample mfreshwater is the average of the molar concentration of cl in samples of group 1 freshwater and mseawater is the molar concentration of cl in seawater quinby hunt and turekian 1983 although the increase of groundwater salinity is expected in agricultural lands because of the irrigation return flows chandrajith et al 2016 agriculture is not intensive in the area and is mainly located close to the recharge area where group 1 samples were collected thus we expect that the average value of cl concentrations in samples of group 1 also includes the contribution for groundwater recirculation during irrigation the good correlation r2 1 shown in fig f2 supplementary information between f sea and cl in groundwater samples of group 2 indicates that seawater intrusion provides an overwhelming proportion of cl to groundwater minimizing the contribution of freshwater cl due to marine aerosols similarly fig f2 also shows that the percentage of seawater intruded into the aquifer is still low ranging between 0 2 and 2 7 with an average of 0 9 only one sample showed a value higher than 2 which is considered a taste based reference on which water becomes salty 5 3 dynamics of major ions and trace elements during seawater intrusion in order to test the dynamics of major ions and several trace elements in the todos santos aquifer during the intrusion of seawater we compare their evolution when salinity is increased against the theoretical mixing line between freshwater average concentrations of group 1 and seawater if there are differences in concentrations between the measured values and those expected according to the theoretical mixing line we calculate this difference in concentrations δn using the following mixing equation pennisi et al 2006 2 n x n x sample n x freshwater n cl sample n cl freshwater n x se a water n cl seawater where n x sample n x freshwater and n x seawater denote the concentration of the major ion or the trace element x in the sample freshwater group 1 and seawater respectively whereas n cl sample n cl freshwater and n cl seawater are the concentrations of cl in the sample freshwater group 1 and seawater respectively as the todos santos aquifer is immediately adjacent to the pacific ocean the concentrations of major ions and trace elements in seawater were taken from the detailed composition of oceans at 3 5 salinity reported by quinby hunt and turekian 1983 the spearman correlation coefficients between the excess or lack of the all studied element compound δnx over the theoretical mixing line is presented in supplementary information table s3 5 3 1 alkali and alkali earth elements fig 5 shows the molar concentrations of alkali na k li and rb and alkali earth ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 elements versus the molar concentrations of cl in groundwater together with the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater as expected for all elements except ba2 there is an increase in the element concentrations when salinity increases due to groundwater salinization however the alkali earth elements plot above the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line indicating that they are being removed from the aquifer matrix during saline intrusion increasing the concentration in solution the mobilization of these elements during salinization has also be noticed by khadra et al 2017 in a dolomitic limestone aquifer nevertheless these authors make reference to the immobilization of mg in a limestone aquifer due to the low content of mg in the aquifer matrix precludes its participation in the cationic exchange process in our study mg was the least mobilized alkali earth element which may be associated to the limited mg abundance in the marine fossils and the calcareous cement of conglomerates of the marine sediments contained in the aquifer matrix additionally to the cationic exchange process it is noticed that the anions so4 2 and hco3 increase their concentrations during seawater intrusion because to the weathering of carbonate minerals which also leads the release of ca2 and mg2 by chemical weathering in general carbonate weathering is not neglected because groundwater samples of group 1 are undersaturated with respect to calcite aragonite and dolomite fig f1 this promotes the carbonate dissolution as groundwater moves downward and leads the respective increase of the carbonate associated ions in solution in contrast to alkali earth elements the alkali elements na k and rb have the opposite behavior being adsorbed on the aquifer matrix and plotting below the theoretical mixing line this agrees with a previous study of the la paz aquifer in baja california where na and k were also removed from solution during seawater intrusion mahlknecht et al 2017 these results suggest that cationic exchange process not only leads to the exchange between na and ca2 but also can be extended to the other alkali and alkali earth elements where na k and rb are absorbed onto the aquifer matrix and alkali earth elements are removed from aquifer matrix and become enriched in the solution in general the cationic exchange process can be represented in the equation 3 ca mg b a sr x 2 2 na k rb 2 na k rb x 2 ca 2 mg 2 ba 2 sr 2 the scatter diagram in fig 6 shows the difference of na and k concentrations with regard to the freshwater seawater mixing line δna δk are negative in this case versus the difference of ca2 and mg2 concentrations δca2 δmg2 in meq l although ca2 and mg2 can also be provided by chemical weathering all the values fall around the equiline indicating that the cation exchange process plays a key role in the dynamics of alkali and alkali earth elements during seawater intrusion owing to δn being in μeq l for sr2 ba2 and rb the high uncertainties of the δn associated with the major cations in meq l preclude a clear representation of the relationship between excess or lack of sr2 ba2 and rb like that shown by major cations in fig 6 whereas the alkali elements na k and rb plot below the theoretical seawater mixing line the concentrations of li plot above the line fig 5c although some authors have pointed out that li is depleted from solution during salinization in coastal aquifers and sediment column experiments russak et al 2016 the enrichment in li has been observed in other coastal aquifers affected by saline intrusion e g santucci et al 2016 souid et al 2018 souid et al 2018 attribute this behavior to cation exchange reactions between groundwater and the aquifer material whereas santucci et al 2016 suggest that the li concentration increases with contact time of groundwater with the aquifer matrix in the last case the authors suggest that li may be supplied by the weathering of amphiboles and feldspars even though feldspars are contained in the arkose beds in the todos santos aquifer silicate weathering does not control the groundwater chemistry in this coastal aquifer thus it is likely that the increase in li concentrations are due to na li cation exchange given by the fact that li has the lowest affinity to soil colloids of the alkali elements because of its low charge hydrated radius quotient yalamanchali 2012 furthermore na is more susceptible to adsorption onto several clay minerals than li leading to cation exchange of li surface ions with na and other alkali elements osman et al 1999 baek et al 2018 overall figs 5 and 6 suggest that the elements ca mg sr ba and li are exchanged with the alkali elements na k and rb in the aquifer structure cationic exchange resulting in an increase of the concentrations of ca2 mg2 ba2 sr2 and li over the freshwater seawater mixing line 5 3 2 boron dissolved silica iodine and major and trace anions several works have reported that phosphates po4 3 and dsi can be exchanged by hco3 and boron during sediment salinization by anion exchange process russak et al 2015a 2015b these authors indicate that whereas the concentrations of aqueous po4 3 and dsi increase during salinization the levels of hco3 and boron in solution are reduced conversely in our study the concentrations of hco3 and boron increase during the seawater intrusion process indicating that this anion exchange process is not occurring in the aquifer thus the concentration increase of these and other anions with regard to the theoretical mixing line should be considered as a release either from the aquifer matrix or from anthropogenic activities fig 7a b and c show that the concentrations of hco3 so4 2 and no3 in groundwater of group 2 are higher than those predicted by the theoretical mixing line the concentrations of both hco3 and so4 2 increase with increasing salinity in direction of the flow path where samples with low cl concentrations show hco3 and so4 2 values similar to those in the recharge area conversely the concentrations of no3 show high levels in wells with low salinity located in the todos santos downtown away from the coastline in fact there is a significant correlation between δhco3 and δso4 2 whereas δno3 shows no relationship with δhco3 and δso4 2 table s3 this indicates that whereas the mobilization of hco3 and so4 2 during seawater intrusion occurs due to the weathering of host rocks carbonate and carbonate associated sulfate weathering the increase of no3 with regard to the mixing line is due to anthropogenic sources probably because of the sewage infiltration into the aquifer other elements that have higher concentrations than expected from the freshwater seawater mixing are boron b and iodine i fig 7d and e in general the difference δb and δi increases with salinity and both differences are highly significant correlated with each other and with δhco3 and δso4 2 table s3 therefore if the differences δhco3 and δso4 2 are due to the release of these anions from the aquifer matrix by weathering the highly significant correlations between δhco3 and δso4 2 with δb and δi could suggest that the increase of b and i with regard to the mixing line is also due to a desorption process from the aquifer matrix this process has been previously reported for b in la paz aquifer mahlknecht et al 2017 and in other aquifers as well pennisi et al 2006 in natural waters dissolved b is present in form of its mononuclear species boric acid b oh 3 and borate b oh 4 which coexist in equilibrium and are regulated by ph even though dissolved b can be provided by the dissolution of soluble phases in igneous rocks vengosh and spivack 2000 the groundwater of the todos santos aquifer has interacted mainly with carbonates fig 4c and d suggesting that b should be released from these minerals in fact the wide range of b concentrations in both biogenic and non biogenic carbonates 10 9 71 4 mg kg reported by hemming and hanson 1992 can help to explain the enrichment of b concentrations during mixing as reported in otero et al 2005 b may also be present in synthetic fertilizers however its low concentration in groundwater of the recharge areas where agriculture is performed and the weak relationship between the excess of no3 and b table s3 makes it unlikely that b came from fertilizers like b considerable amounts of i can be present in the ppm range in biogenic carbonates in natural waters the dominant iodine species are iodide i and iodate io3 anions where the variation of speciation is strongly regulated by the content of dissolved oxygen in water this characteristic together with the high concentrations of i in biogenic carbonates allows that the i present in these minerals can be used as a proxy of paleo redox conditions feng and redfern 2018 in our study the excess of i above the mixing line may be due to the dissolution of io3 from the aquifer matrix given that this is the only species present in marine calcifiers feng and redfern 2018 however other processes such as the accumulation of i onto mineral surfaces during past seawater transgression events have been considered to explain the high i concentrations in groundwater of other coastal aquifers affected by seawater intrusion li et al 2017 in contrast to the other elements discussed above dsi fluoride f and br showed concentrations that plot around the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater fig 7f g and h in the case of br this anion showed a highly significant positive correlation with cl r 0 96 p 001 which agrees with its strong conservative behavior and the fact that lithology is not a source of br that is the concentration of br in groundwater samples of group 2 is enhanced only due to seawater intrusion regarding f this anion showed concentrations that ranged between 0 29 and 0 74 mg l which are considered as baseline values li et al 2017 even though some samples show an excess or deficit of about 35 of f with regard to the seawater mixing line 100 δf f most samples follow the theoretical mixing line suggesting that there is not an important source or sink of dissolved f during the freshwater seawater mixing in fact although f in seawater is controlled by fluorite caf2 precipitation all the samples were undersaturated with respect to fluorite fig f1f demonstrating that fluorite precipitation is unlikely despite the increase of ca2 concentrations by cationic exchange during seawater intrusion otherwise the dissolution of fluorite from host rocks seems unlikely during mixing because most of group 2 samples are almost saturated or in equilibrium with respect to calcite precluding fluorite dissolution this agrees with other studies which have shown that the solubility of fluorite and calcite co controls the f concentrations in groundwater li et al 2017 finally the concentrations of dsi range between 18 2 and 27 6 mg l falling within the typical range of 1 30 mg l in natural waters hem 1989 although dsi has been shown to increase during salinization processes in coastal aquifers due to anionic exchange russak et al 2015b it remained almost under conservative conditions during this study fig 7h and only the two samples with the highest cl values had dsi concentrations above the theoretical mixing line this can suggest that dsi is increased during salinization by anionic exchange when the percentage of seawater intrusion is high as reported by russak et al 2015b in their recent study overall dsi behaved almost conservative during this study because the low percentage of seawater intrusion and the fact that the dissolution of silicates during groundwater flow is low given that carbonate mineral dissolution dominates over the silicate rock dissolution similarly given that groundwater has higher concentration of dsi than seawater it is expected that dsi is removed by biological activity during freshwater seawater mixing nevertheless the uptake of dsi by diatoms only occurs in the marine environment where light activates the diatom bloom and not in aquifer systems in general the mobilization of hco3 and so4 2 and the elements b and i during saline intrusion can be related to the weathering and dissolution of carbonate minerals whereas the absence of anionic exchange processes probably due to the low saline intrusion can preclude the mobilization of dsi which participates in these exchange processes 5 3 3 trace elements although the dynamics of major elements during the freshwater seawater mixing process in coastal aquifers have generally been well documented in the literature the dynamics of trace elements have not according to the fig 8 and the spearman correlation matrix computed between the excess of major ions and trace elements over the theoretical seawater mixing line table s3 we can observe the following behavior i trace elements that are mobilized during the seawater intrusion ii trace elements revealing low or no mobilization during seawater intrusion and iii trace elements that seem to be mobilized but some concentrations plot above the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line fig 8 illustrates that the trace elements fe co v se and re are mainly mobilized during the seawater intrusion event increasing their concentration with regard to the seawater mixing line the excess of these elements shows a highly significant positive correlation p 001 with the excess of ca2 and positive correlations with significant levels ranging from p 001 to p 01 with the excess of other elements and ions δhco3 δso4 2 δi δb δli δba2 δsr2 that show mobilization during seawater intrusion table s3 also the excess of these elements have positive correlation with the excess of each other significant values between p 001 and p 01 and negative correlations with the lack negative δn of ions that are removed from solution during the cation exchange process δna and δrb the divalent trace elements fe co and v can be contained in calcite forming rhombohedral carbonates rimstidt et al 1998 and they could be incorporated into the solution during the seawater intrusion event the solubility and the speciation of these elements in water depends on several factors such as the ph redox potential and ionic strength arena et al 2014 ivanets et al 2013 telfeyan et al 2015 however neither the ph nor dissolved oxygen concentrations show major changes along the groundwater flow path in fact slightly alkaline and well oxygenated groundwater dominates in the area this scenario agrees with the low concentrations observed in groundwater for fe 0 9 4 9 μg l 1 v 8 12 44 6 μg l 1 and co 0 0049 0 0414 μg l 1 which could have been higher at acidic ph or reducing conditions therefore this suggests that the ionic strength caused by increased salinity is the factor that promotes the low but significant desorption of these elements from the aquifer matrix given that salinity reduces the activity coefficients and stimulates the ion complexation as it is the case of the complex ion cocl4 2 in the case of se it is mainly incorporated into the crystal structure of calcite in the form of selenite groups seo3 2 replacing carbonate anions renard et al 2013 this species is stable in moderately oxidizing environments however because of the dominance of oxidizing conditions in the todos santos groundwater se iv can be oxidized to se vi enhancing its mobility kumar and riyazuddin 2011 therefore the mobilization of this element during seawater intrusion in the todos santos aquifer and in other sedimentary aquifer systems panagopoulos 2009 santucci et al 2016 could be associated with the weathering of carbonate minerals in a well oxidized environment like se re can also be supplied by carbonate minerals concentrations of re in groundwater in the order of 0 0069 0 0026 μg l 1 the same range reported in this study are associated with the weathering of carbonates which supply re to the solution once in the solution re is stabilized due to the high solubility of the perrhenate oxyanion reo4 in oxidized natural water hodge et al 1996 summarizing the ionic strength cause by increasing salinity can be the cause for the low but significant mobilization of fe co and v during salinization whereas the carbonate weathering in well oxidized waters can play a determining role in the mobilization of se and re in the todos santos aquifer during saline intrusion the groundwater samples of group 2 showed concentrations of mo ni cr ta and w that plot around the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line nevertheless because of the wide range of concentrations in the fresh groundwater fig 8 it is difficult to discern between a conservative or nonconservative behavior of these elements during the salinization process in the case of ni it is important to mention that all samples of group 1 showed ni concentrations below the detection limit dl and therefore we took a unique value dl 2 for ni in fresh groundwater given that the majority of samples lie inside the range of concentrations of fresh groundwater grey area in fig 8 we assume that these elements mo ni cr ta and w show low or no mobilization during seawater intrusion this implies that although these trace elements can behave conservatively during mixing in well oxygenated water the dissolution of carbonate minerals is not their principal source and or these elements are not affected by the ionic strength caused by salinization in general the highly significant positive correlation between the excess of ta and w over the seawater mixing line table s3 can be due to the fact that both elements are mainly found in minerals associated to granitic intrusions pohl et al 2014 regarding mo and cr a study performed in limestone and dolomitic limestone aquifers has shown that both elements are not affected by salinization khadra et al 2017 which is in agreement with our results the same study also reveals that mo is mobilized due to a subsequent desorption from mo rich minerals al or fe oxides however this fact is associated to a regional lithology which is not applicable in this aquifer system as mentioned above several trace elements seem to be mobilized during salinization but some of their concentrations lie around the theoretical seawater mixing line this group includes the elements u as ge sb cu and mn similarly although table s3 shows that the excess of u is highly significantly positively correlated with the excess of ca2 and mg2 p 001 and positively correlated with δhco3 p 01 and δso4 2 p 05 δu is not correlated with the excess of i b and li table s3 elements that also show mobilization during the seawater intrusion this variable behavior of u during freshwater seawater mixing has also been reported in a karst subterranean estuary in yucatán mexico gonneea et al 2014 where the reduction of highly soluble uranyl vi species to u iv in the deepest part of the estuary results in precipitation of insoluble u minerals or sorption onto calcite nevertheless this is irrelevant here because of the dominance of oxidizing conditions in water like δu the excess of cu and sb also show subtle but significant correlations with δca δmg δhco3 and δba p 05 however δcu and δsb are not correlated with the excess of other mobilized elements such as i and b on the other hand elements that have different behavior during similar redox conditions mn and as also show a variable dynamic whereas as is moderately soluble under oxidizing conditions weiner 2007 due to the formation of the oxyanion arsenate aso4 3 both alkaline and oxidizing conditions preclude the solubility of mn due to the formation of insoluble mn oxyhydroxides tebo et al 2005 overall our results do not explain the dynamics of these six elements u as ge sb cu and mn in the sedimentary aquifer of todos santos perhaps different processes could occur in different locations of the study area due to lithological variations or perhaps a combination of chemical and biological parameters can help to explain the behavior of these elements i e mn oxidation is strongly mediated by mn oxidizing bacteria 5 4 water quality assessment in order to assess if the groundwater of the todos santos aquifer is safe for human consumption we compare the results obtained in this study with the international guidelines for drinking water quality proposed by the world health organization who 2011 overall almost all samples showed concentrations below the guideline value proposed by who 2011 for major ions and trace elements nonetheless several groundwater samples collected in the todos santos town showed u values higher than 20 μg l 1 one sample sample 10 showed a value of 33 μg l 1 for u which is higher than the 30 μg l 1 proposed by who as guideline value for u concentration in safe drinking water in addition four samples showed values of no3 n between 10 and 11 mg l these nitrate concentrations are very close to the guideline value of 11 mg l no3 n proposed by who 2011 which is based on the occurrence of methaemoglobinaemia blue baby syndrome in bottle fed children although this study demonstrates that the concentration of some major ions and trace elements increase during the seawater intrusion they have increased by a few mg l in the case of major ions or by a few μg l 1 in the case of trace elements several elements such as co se and mn did show increased concentrations up to one order of magnitude in samples of group 2 in comparison with groundwater samples of group 1 nevertheless these concentrations are considered low in accordance with the who standards even though the overexploitation of groundwater in the todos santos aquifer has induced the flow of seawater inland the percentage of seawater intruded into the aquifer is still low however if the intrusion of seawater increases in the years to come this can further promote the salinization of groundwater and desorption of potential toxic trace elements such is the case of u which seems to be mobilized in some wells during seawater intrusion posing a health concern to consumers similarly leaks in the sewer collection system should be controlled to reduce or minimize the high levels of nitrate concentrations in groundwater 5 5 final remarks despite this paper has shown that the alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 b i the major anions hco3 and so4 2 and the trace elements li fe co v se and re are mainly mobilized during seawater intrusion either by cationic exchange ionic strength and or mineral dissolution the dynamics of these ions elements can change with regard to the geology and lithology of the aquifer and the climate and salinity conditions indeed the chemical and mineralogical composition of the aquifer matrix can increase or decrease the mobilization of these elements according to equilibrium reactions that is aquifers with low content of these element in their matrices or aquifers with low content of carbonate minerals can experience other reactions that minimize the mobilization of the aforementioned ions elements similarly temperate and cold climates can also diminish the mobilization of these ions elements in similar lithology aquifers impacted by saline intrusion given that temperature reduces the chemical weathering rates and the kinetics of the chemical reactions white and blum 1995 on the other hand the salinity of groundwater can also play a determinant role increasing in several cases the ionic strength and the mobilization of several trace elements or promoting new exchange reactions as it is the case of the anionic exchange reactions between po4 3 dsi hco3 and b reported in arid sedimentary aquifers by russak et al 2015a 2015b finally it would be interesting to verify the reversibility of the processes mentioned in this paper during freshening events in the todos santos aquifer to do that it is necessary to collect groundwater samples in the same wells immediately after high precipitation events hurricanes in order to assess which ions elements show a reversible behavior during the opposite process freshening 6 conclusions in spite of the over abstraction of groundwater in the todos santos region the saline intrusion in this coastal sedimentary aquifer is still low reaching values between 0 2 and 2 7 the saline intrusion into the aquifer leads some geochemical processes where some elements are mobilized from sediment to solution and other elements are removed from solution the cation exchange process plays a key role in the dynamics of the alkali and alkali earth elements where the alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 are interchanged by na k and rb in the aquifer matrix this fact leads to the mobilization of alkali earth elements and the removal of na k and rb from solution with regard to the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater conversely li shows an opposite behavior than that showed by the alkali elements increasing its concentration over the seawater mixing line probably by cationic exchange major anions such as hco3 and so4 2 also increase their concentration during seawater intrusion due to the carbonate mineral weathering whereas the increase of groundwater no3 in areas close to the todos santos town can be due to anthropogenic sources specifically the infiltration of sewage on the other hand elements such as b and i also increase in concentrations toward the coastline probably due to aquifer matrix dissolution the conservative anion br shows concentrations that lie entirely around the theoretical mixing line which indicates no source of br in the aquifer matrix this same behavior was shown by dsi and f both behave conservatively because the weathering of carbonate rocks dominates over the weathering of source rocks of both elements silicates and fluorite in the aquifer matrix minimizing the si and f dissolution the trace elements fe co v se and re are clearly mobilized during the saline water intrusion process fe v and co can be mobilized either by an increase in ionic strength and or ion complexation whereas se and re are mobilized because both elements are abundant in carbonate minerals and have a high solubility in well oxygenated water other trace elements such as mo ni cr ta and w are not affected by seawater intrusion these elements can behave conservatively because they are not removed from solution however their concentrations are not increased during the groundwater flow because they are not affected by the ionic strength increase due to saline intrusion several elements such as u as ge sb cu and mn displayed a variable behavior showing mobilization and immobilization in different groundwater samples therefore our results are not conclusive about the dynamics of these elements during the intrusion of seawater in this coastal sedimentary aquifer perhaps measurements of both chemical and biological parameters together including the presence of metal oxidizing bacteria can help to better understand the biogeochemical process occurring during seawater intrusion in this arid aquifer similarly sediment column experiments and geochemical modeling with phreeqc should also be considered even though the salinization of the todos santos aquifer has led to the increase of major ions and trace element in groundwater they have increased by a few mg l major ions or a few μg l 1 trace elements which indicates that todos santos groundwater does not pose a threat to consumers health however the u and no3 concentrations should be considered carefully because several wells showed concentrations very close to the maximum values recommended by the world health organization for safe drinking water similarly the increasing groundwater salinization in the todos santos aquifer should be considered as a possible threat to human health because it can promote and

1518,this study analyzed the dynamics of major ions and trace elements along the groundwater flow path of the coastal sedimentary todos santos aquifer in baja california sur mexico moderately impacted by anthropogenic activities the results indicate that the elements ca2 mg2 ba2 sr2 and li are mobilized from the aquifer matrix during seawater intrusion whereas the alkali elements na k and rb are removed from solution possibly due to cationic exchange process the anions hco3 and so4 2 and the elements i and b are mobilized due to carbonate mineral weathering whereas dissolved silica and the halides br and f behave conservatively during salinization groundwater no3 is provided by sewage infiltration regarding trace elements behavior we identify three groups i elements that are mobilized during saline intrusion fe co v se re ii elements revealing low or no mobilization mo ni cr ta w and iii elements that show an undefined tendency u as ge sb cu mn the u and no3 levels in groundwater should be considered carefully because several wells have concentrations close to the permissible levels this study may be useful as reference for knowing the possible effect of salinization in coastal aquifers under sea level rise scenarios driven by climate change graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords major ions trace elements groundwater seawater intrusion los cabos block mexico 1 introduction seawater intrusion has become one of the principal causes of groundwater quality deterioration in coastal aquifers stressed by urban growth or agricultural and industrial activities many factors such as excessive extraction of groundwater climate change temperature sea level and rainfall changes and the deformation uplift or subsidence of ground surface can affect the freshwater seawater interface in coastal aquifers promoting or precluding seawater intrusion ketabchi et al 2016 ma et al 2018 koohbor et al 2019 additionally other natural and man made processes such as water rock interaction groundwater transit time geothermal mixing irrigation return flow and wastewater infiltration can also threaten groundwater quality in coastal aquifers intensifying the salinization and leading the degradation of groundwater used for potable and irrigation purposes chandrajith et al 2016 yolcubal et al 2019 it is well known that some geochemical processes occur at the water sediment interface during the intrusion of seawater inland one of the most known geochemical effect of seawater intrusion is cation exchange where ca2 is exchanged by na in the aquifer matrix producing an increase of ca2 and a decrease of na concentrations in solution with regard to the freshwater seawater mixing line appelo and postma 2005 like ca elements such as sr mg and b may also be released into the solution during seawater intrusion by cationic exchange mahlknecht et al 2017 khadra et al 2017 whereas na and k show the opposite behavior in that they are retained in the aquifer mineral structure cation exchange has also been suggested to be the main source of ba in groundwater of subterranean estuaries shaw et al 1998 charette and sholkovitz 2006 on the other hand other authors have pointed out that anionic exchange can also occur during salinization and freshening events in coastal aquifers and in sediment column experiments russak et al 2015a b in these studies it has been stated that the enrichment of po4 3 and dissolved silica dsi in solution occur during salinization due to desorption of both from the aquifer sediment matrix where they are exchanged by b and hco3 in addition to ionic exchange processes other geochemical processes such as redox reactions sorption desorption co precipitation change in ionic strength and mineral dissolution can also take place during the advance of the seawater into the aquifers increasing or decreasing the concentrations of major minor and trace elements in groundwater russak et al 2016 khadra et al 2017 for example russak et al 2016 have indicated that li and b are adsorbed into the aquifer during salinization depleting to about half of their expected conservative concentrations in groundwater however other studies have demonstrated the li enrichment in groundwater during seawater intrusion either by cationic exchange or li dissolution santucci et al 2016 souid et al 2018 experimental simulation studies have shown that water salinity controls the as desorption in high as aquifer sediments morelli et al 2017 also recent studies have indicated the mobilization of as cu ni rb and u during seawater intrusion in limestone and dolomite limestone aquifers by either desorption or dissolution of host minerals khadra et al 2017 pore water studies performed in a deltaic wetland of louisiana usa suggest that fe mn and as are released to solution whereas v is sequestered by sediments telfeyan et al 2017 moreover studies by stuyfzand 1992 have suggested that the redox sensitive elements fe and mn can also participate in the cation exchange reactions during salinization and freshening although both elements can precipitate afterwards under high ph and oxidizing conditions likewise mn fe and mo have been found to desorbed from sediments during seawater circulation in aquifers of insular environments due to reducing conditions which also favors the removal of u re and v from solution reckhardt et al 2017 in contrast to the sorption and desorption of elements during seawater penetration into the aquifers there is a group of trace elements that show no sign of mobilization or depletion independent of groundwater salinity such as al cr and pb this behavior is probably due to their insolubility at circum neutral ph and their high affinity to be sorbed into the sediments or aquifer matrix khadra et al 2017 additionally there is another group of elements that behaves conservatively in solution in the form of anions this group comprises the halogen ions cl and br which are considered conservative anions during saline intrusion both negative ions tend to follow the theoretical mixing line between freshwater seawater because they are not affected by ionic exchange or other geochemical or biological processes davis et al 1998 mahlknecht et al 2017 thus both anions are useful as salinity indicators in view of an expected increase of sea level as a consequence of global warming the understanding of trace element behavior during saline intrusion can be of prime importance for quantifying the effect of sea level rise on groundwater quality in coastal areas thus we performed a comprehensive study of major ion and trace element dynamics during seawater intrusion in the arid coastal aquifer of todos santos which is used for the water supply to todos santos town in the baja california sur state mexico given that industrial activities are not performed in todos santos and that agriculture is not intensive in that area the todos santos aquifer seems to be a suitable place for studying the natural geochemical processes occurring during the flow of seawater into aquifers therefore the objectives of this paper were i to evaluate the dynamics of major and trace elements in groundwater during seawater intrusion in an arid sedimentary aquifer which has been moderately impacted by anthropogenic activities and ii to assess the water quality supplied to todos santos in order to detect any threat to human health the main contribution of this work is to know the behavior of major ions and trace elements in groundwater of coastal sedimentary aquifers subjected to salinization processes this may be useful for knowing the effect of the sea level rise on the water quality of this kind of coastal aquifers 2 study area 2 1 general setting todos santos is a small town located in the southwestern part of the baja california peninsula fig 1a this location is a valley bordered by the pacific ocean to the west and la laguna mountain ranges to the east the valley is just over 3 km long varying from 2 5 km in width on the coast to 1 3 km in its highest part the main area of the valley rises from the coast to 160 m a s l conagua 2009 the soils in the region are predominantly low organic matter calcaric regosols in the valley and leptosols in the highest zones however fluvisols are also found surrounding the main streams the climate in the region is arid to semi arid in the valley and temperate sub humid in the highest parts on the mountains the region is characterized by long drought periods interrupted by tropical storms and hurricanes which occur during summer thus the mean annual precipitation shows a broad range of values which have varied between 8 5 mm 1961 to 404 mm 2011 frbc todos santos dos 2012 in general the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 22 c and 161 mm respectively conagua 2009 the population of todos santos is around 6485 gobierno del estado de baja california sur 2015 with a growing tourism market that drives economic growth irrigated agriculture is another important economic activity where the poblano pepper is the principal crop other crops with economic value include basil green bean culinary herbs cucumber tomato and some tropical fruit trees 2 2 geological background the study area is part of a marine continental sedimentary basin called todos santos el carrizal which is an elongated graben filled with quaternary alluvial deposits with nnw sse orientation coremi 2001 the ancient rocks in this area correspond to a complex of metasedimentary rocks derived from greywacke marl and impure limestone punta lobos gneiss and todos santos marble and phyllite which was derived from the metamorphism of shale and sandstone figs 1 and 2 the jurassic sedimentary rocks underwent low pressure high temperature contact metamorphism caused by granodioritic and gabbroic intrusions during the early cretaceous and small granitic intrusions during the late cretaceous coremi 2000 coremi 2001 this group of intrusive rocks is known as los cabos block aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989a b schaaf et al 2000 clastic and marine sediments forming continental deposits of semi consolidated to consolidated polymictic conglomerates were deposited at the end of the pliocene and during the pleistocene covering the jurassic metasedimentary rocks and the cretaceous plutonic rocks coremi 2001 these sediments vary from clays to gravel and their average thickness fluctuates between 10 and 60 m the marine sediments consist mainly of greenish ocher fine to medium grained sandstones containing abundant marine fossils interstratified with them are friable to weakly carbonate cemented arkosic sandstones this stratum is cyclically interlayered with conglomeratic arkose beds of 5 m thick alternating with ocher fine sandstone strata 0 5 2 m and green siltstone and sandstone beds 3 m where brackish marine fossils and shell fragments are common throughout aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989a overall this type of deposit is common in other miocene pleistocene sedimentary basins of the baja california peninsula martínez gutiérrez and sethi 1997 in the valley the holocene is represented by deposits of sands and silts resulting from the erosion of the mountain ranges which forms broad plains along the main streams toward the coastline there is a narrow plain constituted by granular coastal sediments essentially fine grained sands furthermore alluvial material composed of clayey and silty fine sands ranging from fine to very coarse grains were deposited on the stream beds coremi 2001 conagua 2009 2 3 hydrogeological settings the hydrography of the study area has a dendritic to sub dendritic drainage pattern because of the homogeneous lithology the streams start at the top of the mountain ranges and disappear in the alluvial plain by infiltration into the aquifer however during precipitation events streams discharge into the pacific ocean coremi 2000 coremi 2001 in the valley between latitudes 23 23ʼ 23 32ʼn and longitudes 110 01ʼ 110 14ʼ40ʼʼw there is an unconfined sedimentary aquifer of small dimensions with and area of 155 km2 and a thickness ranging between 10 and 60 m fig 1b the aquifer has a low storage volume because the igneous and metamorphic basement limits the extension of the alluvial sediments at depth however the basement rocks contain fractures faults and other alterations providing pathways for groundwater flow conagua 2009 the aquifer is characterized by high porosity and transmissivity values that range from 1 3 10 3 to 84 8 10 3 m2 s leading to high hydraulic conductivity values conagua 2009 the natural recharge of the aquifer estimated at 18 4 million m3 y dof 2018 conagua 2009 is mainly from rainfall infiltration and by infiltration of the ephemeral streams in the alluvial plain during rains groundwater isotope data have shown that hurricanes and storms have an important effect on the recharge of the todos santos aquifer and other aquifers of the entire region eastoe et al 2015 these data indicate that groundwater is likely to originate as surface water during hurricanes and tropical storms in the low elevation watershed suggesting a rapid response of the aquifer to the precipitation events eastoe et al 2015 that is rainfall infiltration is direct and fast overall hurricanes increase rainfall in a short time compared to the mean monthly precipitation leading to groundwater recharge and the freshening of the aquifer system impacted by seawater intrusion in fact hurricanes have been considered as the cause of the retreat of the seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer of la paz in baja california sur torres martínez et al 2019 similarly these exceptional rain events have been proven to help replenish reservoirs and aquifers in other arid and semi arid regions of northern mexico aguilar barajas et al 2019 important streams such as arroyo la reforma discharge into the ocean during strong rains the equipotential lines constructed from static groundwater levels measured in 2007 show that both surface and groundwater flow from the high range mountains ne to sw direction fig 1a and b discharging into the ocean nevertheless due to the water table is very low in the coastal areas vary from 3 to 5 m in the coastal areas to less than 10 m in the todos santos town discharge by evapotranspiration occurs in wetland areas near the coast and inland agriculture fields conagua 2009 fichera 2019 groundwater extraction estimated at 16 3 million m3 y conagua 2009 is carried out by means of wells distributed both in the recharge areas and near the todos santos town the mean annual groundwater extraction rate is nearly 90 of the recharge rate however because the area is subject to extreme droughts interrupted by strong storms groundwater availability shows a large annual variability for example in 2009 the aquifer displayed an annual deficit of 151 030 m3 whereas in 2015 it was shown to be in balance federman 2015 given this groundwater deficit showed during some years due to the high groundwater extraction the aquifer has been designated as overexploited by the national water commission conagua furthermore long term steady state simulated salinity contour maps fichera 2019 have revealed that lateral saline intrusion occurs in the todos santos aquifer where the seawater freshwater interface reaches up to 607 m inland 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling the groundwater sampling campaign was performed during june 2017 in eighteen wells that supply water to the todos santos town with the exception of the well 13 the wells were mainly located along a line that goes from the recharge areas to the coast following the drainage of arroyo la reforma which is perpendicular to the water table equipotential lines fig 1a at the time of sampling all the wells were operative and equipped with pre installed pumps because of the low thickness of the aquifer system all sampled wells were shallow and equipped with pipes of low diameter between 15 and 20 cm in each well groundwater was pumped and purged until electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature values were stable 5 min for each well which was equivalent to approximately 3 well volumes then the auxiliary parameters ph temperature ec and dissolved oxygen concentrations were recorded by collecting groundwater in a pre rinsed plastic bucket and measuring these parameters immediately using pre calibrated portable meters additionally the groundwater samples were collected in pre washed and pre rinsed polyethylene bottles the bottles were filled completely and transported with ice to the conagua lab in la paz city in the lab each water sample was filtered using 0 45 μm pore size membranes frontal filtration and placed in two pre washed and pre rinsed 250 ml hdpe bottles for the determination of anions and major and trace elements samples for major and trace element analysis were preserved with ultra pure hno3 to avoid element precipitation absorption during storage alkalinity was measured back in the lab on the day of collection by titration using h2so4 0 02 n as titrant until ph 4 3 all the water samples were transported to the laboratories in coolers with ice and then stored at 4 c until analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis the major anions no3 so4 2 cl f were analyzed in the tecnológico de monterrey laboratories by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 1600 equipment the samples for major and trace element analysis were sent to activation laboratories ltd ancaster canada where the concentrations of dissolved major elements na k ca2 mg2 and si transition elements v cr mn fe co ni cu mo ta w and re metalloid elements ge as and sb trace alkali and alkali earth elements li rb sr2 and ba2 trace anions br and other trace elements b se u and i were measured using a perkin elmer sciex elan 9000 icp ms equipment in ultra low mode samples with high concentrations of both major and trace elements were diluted and re run until spectrometric response was normal during the analysis a reagent blank and two water standards were run at the beginning and end of the whole group of samples uncertainties were assessed using laboratory duplicates and verifying the precision calibration of the equipment through the measurements of primary standard solutions the elements al be bi cd pb and zn were also measured using icp ms however these elements were not considered in this study because almost all the samples showed concentrations below the detection limit dl of the analytical technique once the major ion analyses were done the charge balance was cross checked in all water samples sum of cation milliequivalents minus the sum of anion milliequivalents divided by the sum of major ion milliequivalents and multiplied by 100 the absolute charge imbalance ranged between 0 4 and 15 three samples showed an ionic charged imbalance higher than 10 with an average of 5 0 the international standard iv stock 1643 trace metals in water was used to check the accuracy of the icp ms analysis the systematic difference between the standard measurements and the reference values of the considered elements in this study ranged from 0 5 to 12 4 the results of the quality control performed for the analysis of each certified element in the standard iv stock 1643 and the dl of all analyzed elements are included in the supplementary information table s1 3 3 statistical analysis the saturation index si for mineral phases in groundwater were calculated using the software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 hierarchical cluster analysis hca based on euclidean distance and the ward s method was applied to the dataset in order to group water samples with similar chemical characteristics abu alnaeem et al 2018 all the data were log transformed and standardized values minus average divided by standard deviation before hca the student s t test was used to verify significant differences among the water groups established by the hca miller and miller 1989 the non parametric spearman correlation test was conducted to establish relationships between variables all the statistical analyses were carried out through the program statistica 10 0 one concentration of cr and mn and 4 basal concentrations of ni were lower than the dl reported by the analytical technique therefore the results of these values were expressed as dl 2 for statistical purposes 4 results the results of the determination of physicochemical variables major ions and trace elements in groundwater samples collected in the todos santos aquifer are shown in table 1 the location the geographic coordinates and the distance from coastline to inland of the sampled wells are included in the supplementary information table s2 fig 3 depicts the resulting dendogram of the multivariable hca applied to the todos santos dataset the horizontal phenon line clearly delimits two group of samples with a linkage distance above 16 the first group includes the samples 4 5 6 and 7 which were collected in the aquifer recharge areas fig 1a the remaining samples belonging group 2 were taken in wells distributed between 400 m and 3590 m from coastline to inland overall the groundwater of the todos santos aquifer exhibited an almost homogeneous water temperature with values that ranged between 24 2 and 27 2 c the groundwater in the study area was neutral to slightly alkaline in nature ph between 6 83 and 8 43 while the dissolved oxygen concentrations varied from 4 4 to 7 9 mgo2 l indicating the presence of well oxygenated waters over the aquifer values near saturation probably due to the low water table values conagua 2009 these three variables temperature ph and dissolved oxygen did not show significant differences among group 1 and group 2 although some major ions such as k so4 2 and f did not show significant differences among the two groups of samples the seawater abundant ions did group 2 showed average values of 1173 μs cm for ec 717 mg l for total dissolved solids tds and 72 8 mg l 78 2 mg l 28 8 mg l and 207 7 mg l for na ca2 mg2 and cl concentrations respectively overall these chemical parameters were significantly higher p 05 than those of group 1 which showed average values of 433 μs cm for ec 305 mg l for tds and 23 mg l 38 7 mg l 11 3 mg l and 34 3 mg l for na ca2 mg2 and cl concentrations respectively the significantly higher major ion concentrations in samples of group 2 may imply the presence of seawater intrusion in the aquifer from the coastline to up to 3590 m inland the major anions hco3 and no3 also showed significantly higher values in the samples of group 2 than those of samples of group 1 means of 195 7 and 9 0 mg l for hco3 and no3 in group 2 and 133 5 and 4 7 mg l for hco3 and no3 in group 1 however both anions are not abundant in seawater and their higher concentrations in samples of group 2 can be related to mineral weathering hco3 or anthropogenic activities no3 regarding trace ions and elements the water samples of group 2 had significantly higher concentrations of br i li sr2 ba2 b co cu fe ni re sb se and v than those of group 1 whereas other elements such as as cr ge mn mo rb ta u and w did not show significant differences between groups this can be associated to different geochemical processes that depends on the abundance and nature of each chemical element in both seawater and freshwater and are discussed below 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater hydrogeochemistry as commented above cl and br are useful tracers for saline intrusion because they move conservatively in water during transport both anions are ubiquitous in groundwater and they are mainly provided by atmospheric deposition rainfall saline intrusion and halite dissolution in coastal areas rainfall and atmospheric deposition have cl br molar ratios similar to those of oceans 650 690 whereas halite has cl br molar ratios 104 105 much higher than seawater therefore there is a rapid increase in cl br ratios with increasing cl concentrations in groundwater when halite is present in the lithological units of an aquifer cartwright et al 2006 similarly br and cl bearing compounds used as fertilizers or pesticides may also affect the cl br ratios in groundwater changing the signature acquired from marine aerosols and or evaporite rocks davis et al 1998 thomas 2000 as reported in other studies seddique et al 2019 the fact that our data have cl br ratios ranging between 576 and 760 except for sample 19 with a cl br ratio of 910 demonstrates that cl is entirely coming from atmospheric sources and seawater intrusion and that halite and other cl bearing minerals or cl bearing compounds are not present in the aquifer the increased cl as groundwater moves downward through the aquifer implies that cl concentration is only being affected by saline intrusion inside the aquifer the piper diagram fig 4a shows the hydrochemical facies of the todos santos groundwater groundwater samples of group 1 freshwater are ca2 hco3 type whereas groundwater of group 2 evolves from ca2 hco3 to na cl type when salinity is increased indicating that the intrusion of seawater is affecting the groundwater chemistry of group 2 therefore we considered the water of group 2 as a mixture of freshwater and brackish water fig 4b depicts a scatter plot of ca2 plus mg2 versus hco3 plus so4 2 in the water samples of both groups water samples of group 1 fall along the equilibrium line due to both cations and bicarbonate are provided by silicate and carbonate weathering ca2 mg2 and hco3 whereas sulfates may be provided by the weathering of carbonate associated sulfates richardson et al 2019 because calcium sulfate evaporites are not reported in the study area aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989a however the samples of group 2 show clear deviations from the equiline with an excess of ca2 and mg2 over the corresponding anions hco3 plus so4 2 such phenomenon has been widely reported in aquifers affected by seawater intrusion mahlknecht et al 2017 gopinath et al 2019 and it is due the excess of na in the solution which promotes the replacement of na by ca2 in the aquifer matrix cationic exchange increasing the ca2 in solution with respect to its corresponding anions fig 4c and d show the log log scaled binary diagrams of mg na hco3 na and ca na molar rations of groundwater samples of group 1 after the respective correction for atmospheric input using the cl na cl mg and cl ca seawater ratios together with the fields presented by carbonate silicate and evaporite rocks gaillardet et al 1999 groundwater samples of group 2 were not included in these diagrams because cationic exchange erases the groundwater signature acquired during weathering these diagrams depict that freshwater of the study area has interacted more with carbonate than silicate rocks in spite of the sedimentary aquifer mainly comprised of continental and clastic deposits of arkose sands silts and clays with lesser amounts of volcanic fragments this indicates that the weathering of carbonate minerals present in the aquifer matrix such as the abundant marine fossils and the calcareous cement of sandstones and conglomerates exerts a key role in the groundwater chemistry of this sedimentary aquifer an extreme example of this phenomenon has been observed even in a purely silicated catchment where the weathering of trace calcic minerals is responsible for more than 90 of the dissolved ca exported from the watershed oliva et al 2004 this occurs owing to carbonate minerals weather on average 10 and 100 times faster than silicate lithologies meybeck 1987 the si of selected phases together with their uncertainties depicted in the supplementary information fig f1 langmuir and melchior 1985 nordstrom and ball 1989 plummer et al 1990 mclaughlin et al 2013 indicate that although two samples of group 2 show supersaturation with respect to dolomite calcite and aragonite the rest of the groundwater samples are near saturation or in equilibrium with respect to calcite while being undersaturated with respect to aragonite and dolomite on the other hand fig f1 shows that although the si of gypsum anhydrite and halite increase with cl concentrations behavior not shown by the si of calcite aragonite and dolomite the precipitation of these three phases close to the coastline is discarded due to all the samples showing undersaturation 5 2 estimation of seawater intrusion as demonstrated above there are no cl contributions to groundwater other than marine aerosols and seawater intrusion thus the percentage of seawater intruded into the todos santos aquifer can be estimated as follows appelo and postma 2005 1 f sea m sample m freshwater m seawater m freshwater 100 where msample is the molar concentration of cl in the sample mfreshwater is the average of the molar concentration of cl in samples of group 1 freshwater and mseawater is the molar concentration of cl in seawater quinby hunt and turekian 1983 although the increase of groundwater salinity is expected in agricultural lands because of the irrigation return flows chandrajith et al 2016 agriculture is not intensive in the area and is mainly located close to the recharge area where group 1 samples were collected thus we expect that the average value of cl concentrations in samples of group 1 also includes the contribution for groundwater recirculation during irrigation the good correlation r2 1 shown in fig f2 supplementary information between f sea and cl in groundwater samples of group 2 indicates that seawater intrusion provides an overwhelming proportion of cl to groundwater minimizing the contribution of freshwater cl due to marine aerosols similarly fig f2 also shows that the percentage of seawater intruded into the aquifer is still low ranging between 0 2 and 2 7 with an average of 0 9 only one sample showed a value higher than 2 which is considered a taste based reference on which water becomes salty 5 3 dynamics of major ions and trace elements during seawater intrusion in order to test the dynamics of major ions and several trace elements in the todos santos aquifer during the intrusion of seawater we compare their evolution when salinity is increased against the theoretical mixing line between freshwater average concentrations of group 1 and seawater if there are differences in concentrations between the measured values and those expected according to the theoretical mixing line we calculate this difference in concentrations δn using the following mixing equation pennisi et al 2006 2 n x n x sample n x freshwater n cl sample n cl freshwater n x se a water n cl seawater where n x sample n x freshwater and n x seawater denote the concentration of the major ion or the trace element x in the sample freshwater group 1 and seawater respectively whereas n cl sample n cl freshwater and n cl seawater are the concentrations of cl in the sample freshwater group 1 and seawater respectively as the todos santos aquifer is immediately adjacent to the pacific ocean the concentrations of major ions and trace elements in seawater were taken from the detailed composition of oceans at 3 5 salinity reported by quinby hunt and turekian 1983 the spearman correlation coefficients between the excess or lack of the all studied element compound δnx over the theoretical mixing line is presented in supplementary information table s3 5 3 1 alkali and alkali earth elements fig 5 shows the molar concentrations of alkali na k li and rb and alkali earth ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 elements versus the molar concentrations of cl in groundwater together with the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater as expected for all elements except ba2 there is an increase in the element concentrations when salinity increases due to groundwater salinization however the alkali earth elements plot above the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line indicating that they are being removed from the aquifer matrix during saline intrusion increasing the concentration in solution the mobilization of these elements during salinization has also be noticed by khadra et al 2017 in a dolomitic limestone aquifer nevertheless these authors make reference to the immobilization of mg in a limestone aquifer due to the low content of mg in the aquifer matrix precludes its participation in the cationic exchange process in our study mg was the least mobilized alkali earth element which may be associated to the limited mg abundance in the marine fossils and the calcareous cement of conglomerates of the marine sediments contained in the aquifer matrix additionally to the cationic exchange process it is noticed that the anions so4 2 and hco3 increase their concentrations during seawater intrusion because to the weathering of carbonate minerals which also leads the release of ca2 and mg2 by chemical weathering in general carbonate weathering is not neglected because groundwater samples of group 1 are undersaturated with respect to calcite aragonite and dolomite fig f1 this promotes the carbonate dissolution as groundwater moves downward and leads the respective increase of the carbonate associated ions in solution in contrast to alkali earth elements the alkali elements na k and rb have the opposite behavior being adsorbed on the aquifer matrix and plotting below the theoretical mixing line this agrees with a previous study of the la paz aquifer in baja california where na and k were also removed from solution during seawater intrusion mahlknecht et al 2017 these results suggest that cationic exchange process not only leads to the exchange between na and ca2 but also can be extended to the other alkali and alkali earth elements where na k and rb are absorbed onto the aquifer matrix and alkali earth elements are removed from aquifer matrix and become enriched in the solution in general the cationic exchange process can be represented in the equation 3 ca mg b a sr x 2 2 na k rb 2 na k rb x 2 ca 2 mg 2 ba 2 sr 2 the scatter diagram in fig 6 shows the difference of na and k concentrations with regard to the freshwater seawater mixing line δna δk are negative in this case versus the difference of ca2 and mg2 concentrations δca2 δmg2 in meq l although ca2 and mg2 can also be provided by chemical weathering all the values fall around the equiline indicating that the cation exchange process plays a key role in the dynamics of alkali and alkali earth elements during seawater intrusion owing to δn being in μeq l for sr2 ba2 and rb the high uncertainties of the δn associated with the major cations in meq l preclude a clear representation of the relationship between excess or lack of sr2 ba2 and rb like that shown by major cations in fig 6 whereas the alkali elements na k and rb plot below the theoretical seawater mixing line the concentrations of li plot above the line fig 5c although some authors have pointed out that li is depleted from solution during salinization in coastal aquifers and sediment column experiments russak et al 2016 the enrichment in li has been observed in other coastal aquifers affected by saline intrusion e g santucci et al 2016 souid et al 2018 souid et al 2018 attribute this behavior to cation exchange reactions between groundwater and the aquifer material whereas santucci et al 2016 suggest that the li concentration increases with contact time of groundwater with the aquifer matrix in the last case the authors suggest that li may be supplied by the weathering of amphiboles and feldspars even though feldspars are contained in the arkose beds in the todos santos aquifer silicate weathering does not control the groundwater chemistry in this coastal aquifer thus it is likely that the increase in li concentrations are due to na li cation exchange given by the fact that li has the lowest affinity to soil colloids of the alkali elements because of its low charge hydrated radius quotient yalamanchali 2012 furthermore na is more susceptible to adsorption onto several clay minerals than li leading to cation exchange of li surface ions with na and other alkali elements osman et al 1999 baek et al 2018 overall figs 5 and 6 suggest that the elements ca mg sr ba and li are exchanged with the alkali elements na k and rb in the aquifer structure cationic exchange resulting in an increase of the concentrations of ca2 mg2 ba2 sr2 and li over the freshwater seawater mixing line 5 3 2 boron dissolved silica iodine and major and trace anions several works have reported that phosphates po4 3 and dsi can be exchanged by hco3 and boron during sediment salinization by anion exchange process russak et al 2015a 2015b these authors indicate that whereas the concentrations of aqueous po4 3 and dsi increase during salinization the levels of hco3 and boron in solution are reduced conversely in our study the concentrations of hco3 and boron increase during the seawater intrusion process indicating that this anion exchange process is not occurring in the aquifer thus the concentration increase of these and other anions with regard to the theoretical mixing line should be considered as a release either from the aquifer matrix or from anthropogenic activities fig 7a b and c show that the concentrations of hco3 so4 2 and no3 in groundwater of group 2 are higher than those predicted by the theoretical mixing line the concentrations of both hco3 and so4 2 increase with increasing salinity in direction of the flow path where samples with low cl concentrations show hco3 and so4 2 values similar to those in the recharge area conversely the concentrations of no3 show high levels in wells with low salinity located in the todos santos downtown away from the coastline in fact there is a significant correlation between δhco3 and δso4 2 whereas δno3 shows no relationship with δhco3 and δso4 2 table s3 this indicates that whereas the mobilization of hco3 and so4 2 during seawater intrusion occurs due to the weathering of host rocks carbonate and carbonate associated sulfate weathering the increase of no3 with regard to the mixing line is due to anthropogenic sources probably because of the sewage infiltration into the aquifer other elements that have higher concentrations than expected from the freshwater seawater mixing are boron b and iodine i fig 7d and e in general the difference δb and δi increases with salinity and both differences are highly significant correlated with each other and with δhco3 and δso4 2 table s3 therefore if the differences δhco3 and δso4 2 are due to the release of these anions from the aquifer matrix by weathering the highly significant correlations between δhco3 and δso4 2 with δb and δi could suggest that the increase of b and i with regard to the mixing line is also due to a desorption process from the aquifer matrix this process has been previously reported for b in la paz aquifer mahlknecht et al 2017 and in other aquifers as well pennisi et al 2006 in natural waters dissolved b is present in form of its mononuclear species boric acid b oh 3 and borate b oh 4 which coexist in equilibrium and are regulated by ph even though dissolved b can be provided by the dissolution of soluble phases in igneous rocks vengosh and spivack 2000 the groundwater of the todos santos aquifer has interacted mainly with carbonates fig 4c and d suggesting that b should be released from these minerals in fact the wide range of b concentrations in both biogenic and non biogenic carbonates 10 9 71 4 mg kg reported by hemming and hanson 1992 can help to explain the enrichment of b concentrations during mixing as reported in otero et al 2005 b may also be present in synthetic fertilizers however its low concentration in groundwater of the recharge areas where agriculture is performed and the weak relationship between the excess of no3 and b table s3 makes it unlikely that b came from fertilizers like b considerable amounts of i can be present in the ppm range in biogenic carbonates in natural waters the dominant iodine species are iodide i and iodate io3 anions where the variation of speciation is strongly regulated by the content of dissolved oxygen in water this characteristic together with the high concentrations of i in biogenic carbonates allows that the i present in these minerals can be used as a proxy of paleo redox conditions feng and redfern 2018 in our study the excess of i above the mixing line may be due to the dissolution of io3 from the aquifer matrix given that this is the only species present in marine calcifiers feng and redfern 2018 however other processes such as the accumulation of i onto mineral surfaces during past seawater transgression events have been considered to explain the high i concentrations in groundwater of other coastal aquifers affected by seawater intrusion li et al 2017 in contrast to the other elements discussed above dsi fluoride f and br showed concentrations that plot around the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater fig 7f g and h in the case of br this anion showed a highly significant positive correlation with cl r 0 96 p 001 which agrees with its strong conservative behavior and the fact that lithology is not a source of br that is the concentration of br in groundwater samples of group 2 is enhanced only due to seawater intrusion regarding f this anion showed concentrations that ranged between 0 29 and 0 74 mg l which are considered as baseline values li et al 2017 even though some samples show an excess or deficit of about 35 of f with regard to the seawater mixing line 100 δf f most samples follow the theoretical mixing line suggesting that there is not an important source or sink of dissolved f during the freshwater seawater mixing in fact although f in seawater is controlled by fluorite caf2 precipitation all the samples were undersaturated with respect to fluorite fig f1f demonstrating that fluorite precipitation is unlikely despite the increase of ca2 concentrations by cationic exchange during seawater intrusion otherwise the dissolution of fluorite from host rocks seems unlikely during mixing because most of group 2 samples are almost saturated or in equilibrium with respect to calcite precluding fluorite dissolution this agrees with other studies which have shown that the solubility of fluorite and calcite co controls the f concentrations in groundwater li et al 2017 finally the concentrations of dsi range between 18 2 and 27 6 mg l falling within the typical range of 1 30 mg l in natural waters hem 1989 although dsi has been shown to increase during salinization processes in coastal aquifers due to anionic exchange russak et al 2015b it remained almost under conservative conditions during this study fig 7h and only the two samples with the highest cl values had dsi concentrations above the theoretical mixing line this can suggest that dsi is increased during salinization by anionic exchange when the percentage of seawater intrusion is high as reported by russak et al 2015b in their recent study overall dsi behaved almost conservative during this study because the low percentage of seawater intrusion and the fact that the dissolution of silicates during groundwater flow is low given that carbonate mineral dissolution dominates over the silicate rock dissolution similarly given that groundwater has higher concentration of dsi than seawater it is expected that dsi is removed by biological activity during freshwater seawater mixing nevertheless the uptake of dsi by diatoms only occurs in the marine environment where light activates the diatom bloom and not in aquifer systems in general the mobilization of hco3 and so4 2 and the elements b and i during saline intrusion can be related to the weathering and dissolution of carbonate minerals whereas the absence of anionic exchange processes probably due to the low saline intrusion can preclude the mobilization of dsi which participates in these exchange processes 5 3 3 trace elements although the dynamics of major elements during the freshwater seawater mixing process in coastal aquifers have generally been well documented in the literature the dynamics of trace elements have not according to the fig 8 and the spearman correlation matrix computed between the excess of major ions and trace elements over the theoretical seawater mixing line table s3 we can observe the following behavior i trace elements that are mobilized during the seawater intrusion ii trace elements revealing low or no mobilization during seawater intrusion and iii trace elements that seem to be mobilized but some concentrations plot above the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line fig 8 illustrates that the trace elements fe co v se and re are mainly mobilized during the seawater intrusion event increasing their concentration with regard to the seawater mixing line the excess of these elements shows a highly significant positive correlation p 001 with the excess of ca2 and positive correlations with significant levels ranging from p 001 to p 01 with the excess of other elements and ions δhco3 δso4 2 δi δb δli δba2 δsr2 that show mobilization during seawater intrusion table s3 also the excess of these elements have positive correlation with the excess of each other significant values between p 001 and p 01 and negative correlations with the lack negative δn of ions that are removed from solution during the cation exchange process δna and δrb the divalent trace elements fe co and v can be contained in calcite forming rhombohedral carbonates rimstidt et al 1998 and they could be incorporated into the solution during the seawater intrusion event the solubility and the speciation of these elements in water depends on several factors such as the ph redox potential and ionic strength arena et al 2014 ivanets et al 2013 telfeyan et al 2015 however neither the ph nor dissolved oxygen concentrations show major changes along the groundwater flow path in fact slightly alkaline and well oxygenated groundwater dominates in the area this scenario agrees with the low concentrations observed in groundwater for fe 0 9 4 9 μg l 1 v 8 12 44 6 μg l 1 and co 0 0049 0 0414 μg l 1 which could have been higher at acidic ph or reducing conditions therefore this suggests that the ionic strength caused by increased salinity is the factor that promotes the low but significant desorption of these elements from the aquifer matrix given that salinity reduces the activity coefficients and stimulates the ion complexation as it is the case of the complex ion cocl4 2 in the case of se it is mainly incorporated into the crystal structure of calcite in the form of selenite groups seo3 2 replacing carbonate anions renard et al 2013 this species is stable in moderately oxidizing environments however because of the dominance of oxidizing conditions in the todos santos groundwater se iv can be oxidized to se vi enhancing its mobility kumar and riyazuddin 2011 therefore the mobilization of this element during seawater intrusion in the todos santos aquifer and in other sedimentary aquifer systems panagopoulos 2009 santucci et al 2016 could be associated with the weathering of carbonate minerals in a well oxidized environment like se re can also be supplied by carbonate minerals concentrations of re in groundwater in the order of 0 0069 0 0026 μg l 1 the same range reported in this study are associated with the weathering of carbonates which supply re to the solution once in the solution re is stabilized due to the high solubility of the perrhenate oxyanion reo4 in oxidized natural water hodge et al 1996 summarizing the ionic strength cause by increasing salinity can be the cause for the low but significant mobilization of fe co and v during salinization whereas the carbonate weathering in well oxidized waters can play a determining role in the mobilization of se and re in the todos santos aquifer during saline intrusion the groundwater samples of group 2 showed concentrations of mo ni cr ta and w that plot around the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line nevertheless because of the wide range of concentrations in the fresh groundwater fig 8 it is difficult to discern between a conservative or nonconservative behavior of these elements during the salinization process in the case of ni it is important to mention that all samples of group 1 showed ni concentrations below the detection limit dl and therefore we took a unique value dl 2 for ni in fresh groundwater given that the majority of samples lie inside the range of concentrations of fresh groundwater grey area in fig 8 we assume that these elements mo ni cr ta and w show low or no mobilization during seawater intrusion this implies that although these trace elements can behave conservatively during mixing in well oxygenated water the dissolution of carbonate minerals is not their principal source and or these elements are not affected by the ionic strength caused by salinization in general the highly significant positive correlation between the excess of ta and w over the seawater mixing line table s3 can be due to the fact that both elements are mainly found in minerals associated to granitic intrusions pohl et al 2014 regarding mo and cr a study performed in limestone and dolomitic limestone aquifers has shown that both elements are not affected by salinization khadra et al 2017 which is in agreement with our results the same study also reveals that mo is mobilized due to a subsequent desorption from mo rich minerals al or fe oxides however this fact is associated to a regional lithology which is not applicable in this aquifer system as mentioned above several trace elements seem to be mobilized during salinization but some of their concentrations lie around the theoretical seawater mixing line this group includes the elements u as ge sb cu and mn similarly although table s3 shows that the excess of u is highly significantly positively correlated with the excess of ca2 and mg2 p 001 and positively correlated with δhco3 p 01 and δso4 2 p 05 δu is not correlated with the excess of i b and li table s3 elements that also show mobilization during the seawater intrusion this variable behavior of u during freshwater seawater mixing has also been reported in a karst subterranean estuary in yucatán mexico gonneea et al 2014 where the reduction of highly soluble uranyl vi species to u iv in the deepest part of the estuary results in precipitation of insoluble u minerals or sorption onto calcite nevertheless this is irrelevant here because of the dominance of oxidizing conditions in water like δu the excess of cu and sb also show subtle but significant correlations with δca δmg δhco3 and δba p 05 however δcu and δsb are not correlated with the excess of other mobilized elements such as i and b on the other hand elements that have different behavior during similar redox conditions mn and as also show a variable dynamic whereas as is moderately soluble under oxidizing conditions weiner 2007 due to the formation of the oxyanion arsenate aso4 3 both alkaline and oxidizing conditions preclude the solubility of mn due to the formation of insoluble mn oxyhydroxides tebo et al 2005 overall our results do not explain the dynamics of these six elements u as ge sb cu and mn in the sedimentary aquifer of todos santos perhaps different processes could occur in different locations of the study area due to lithological variations or perhaps a combination of chemical and biological parameters can help to explain the behavior of these elements i e mn oxidation is strongly mediated by mn oxidizing bacteria 5 4 water quality assessment in order to assess if the groundwater of the todos santos aquifer is safe for human consumption we compare the results obtained in this study with the international guidelines for drinking water quality proposed by the world health organization who 2011 overall almost all samples showed concentrations below the guideline value proposed by who 2011 for major ions and trace elements nonetheless several groundwater samples collected in the todos santos town showed u values higher than 20 μg l 1 one sample sample 10 showed a value of 33 μg l 1 for u which is higher than the 30 μg l 1 proposed by who as guideline value for u concentration in safe drinking water in addition four samples showed values of no3 n between 10 and 11 mg l these nitrate concentrations are very close to the guideline value of 11 mg l no3 n proposed by who 2011 which is based on the occurrence of methaemoglobinaemia blue baby syndrome in bottle fed children although this study demonstrates that the concentration of some major ions and trace elements increase during the seawater intrusion they have increased by a few mg l in the case of major ions or by a few μg l 1 in the case of trace elements several elements such as co se and mn did show increased concentrations up to one order of magnitude in samples of group 2 in comparison with groundwater samples of group 1 nevertheless these concentrations are considered low in accordance with the who standards even though the overexploitation of groundwater in the todos santos aquifer has induced the flow of seawater inland the percentage of seawater intruded into the aquifer is still low however if the intrusion of seawater increases in the years to come this can further promote the salinization of groundwater and desorption of potential toxic trace elements such is the case of u which seems to be mobilized in some wells during seawater intrusion posing a health concern to consumers similarly leaks in the sewer collection system should be controlled to reduce or minimize the high levels of nitrate concentrations in groundwater 5 5 final remarks despite this paper has shown that the alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 b i the major anions hco3 and so4 2 and the trace elements li fe co v se and re are mainly mobilized during seawater intrusion either by cationic exchange ionic strength and or mineral dissolution the dynamics of these ions elements can change with regard to the geology and lithology of the aquifer and the climate and salinity conditions indeed the chemical and mineralogical composition of the aquifer matrix can increase or decrease the mobilization of these elements according to equilibrium reactions that is aquifers with low content of these element in their matrices or aquifers with low content of carbonate minerals can experience other reactions that minimize the mobilization of the aforementioned ions elements similarly temperate and cold climates can also diminish the mobilization of these ions elements in similar lithology aquifers impacted by saline intrusion given that temperature reduces the chemical weathering rates and the kinetics of the chemical reactions white and blum 1995 on the other hand the salinity of groundwater can also play a determinant role increasing in several cases the ionic strength and the mobilization of several trace elements or promoting new exchange reactions as it is the case of the anionic exchange reactions between po4 3 dsi hco3 and b reported in arid sedimentary aquifers by russak et al 2015a 2015b finally it would be interesting to verify the reversibility of the processes mentioned in this paper during freshening events in the todos santos aquifer to do that it is necessary to collect groundwater samples in the same wells immediately after high precipitation events hurricanes in order to assess which ions elements show a reversible behavior during the opposite process freshening 6 conclusions in spite of the over abstraction of groundwater in the todos santos region the saline intrusion in this coastal sedimentary aquifer is still low reaching values between 0 2 and 2 7 the saline intrusion into the aquifer leads some geochemical processes where some elements are mobilized from sediment to solution and other elements are removed from solution the cation exchange process plays a key role in the dynamics of the alkali and alkali earth elements where the alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 are interchanged by na k and rb in the aquifer matrix this fact leads to the mobilization of alkali earth elements and the removal of na k and rb from solution with regard to the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater conversely li shows an opposite behavior than that showed by the alkali elements increasing its concentration over the seawater mixing line probably by cationic exchange major anions such as hco3 and so4 2 also increase their concentration during seawater intrusion due to the carbonate mineral weathering whereas the increase of groundwater no3 in areas close to the todos santos town can be due to anthropogenic sources specifically the infiltration of sewage on the other hand elements such as b and i also increase in concentrations toward the coastline probably due to aquifer matrix dissolution the conservative anion br shows concentrations that lie entirely around the theoretical mixing line which indicates no source of br in the aquifer matrix this same behavior was shown by dsi and f both behave conservatively because the weathering of carbonate rocks dominates over the weathering of source rocks of both elements silicates and fluorite in the aquifer matrix minimizing the si and f dissolution the trace elements fe co v se and re are clearly mobilized during the saline water intrusion process fe v and co can be mobilized either by an increase in ionic strength and or ion complexation whereas se and re are mobilized because both elements are abundant in carbonate minerals and have a high solubility in well oxygenated water other trace elements such as mo ni cr ta and w are not affected by seawater intrusion these elements can behave conservatively because they are not removed from solution however their concentrations are not increased during the groundwater flow because they are not affected by the ionic strength increase due to saline intrusion several elements such as u as ge sb cu and mn displayed a variable behavior showing mobilization and immobilization in different groundwater samples therefore our results are not conclusive about the dynamics of these elements during the intrusion of seawater in this coastal sedimentary aquifer perhaps measurements of both chemical and biological parameters together including the presence of metal oxidizing bacteria can help to better understand the biogeochemical process occurring during seawater intrusion in this arid aquifer similarly sediment column experiments and geochemical modeling with phreeqc should also be considered even though the salinization of the todos santos aquifer has led to the increase of major ions and trace element in groundwater they have increased by a few mg l major ions or a few μg l 1 trace elements which indicates that todos santos groundwater does not pose a threat to consumers health however the u and no3 concentrations should be considered carefully because several wells showed concentrations very close to the maximum values recommended by the world health organization for safe drinking water similarly the increasing groundwater salinization in the todos santos aquifer should be considered as a possible threat to human health because it can promote and

during each month with variable increases and decreases of metal concentrations in filtered lakewater according to seasonal changes dissolved metal particles with an average diameter of 180 115 nm were present in the porewater of the upper and lower sediments with size increases in early spring and decreases in fall particles in the lower sediment porewater were typically more stable as indicated by more negative ζ potential values and the greatest particle stability occurred during summer differences between upper and lower porewater metal particles correspond to changes in sediment s speciation and bond relocation resulting from an input of oxygenated groundwater transport of the dissolved metal particles in and from the sediments likely occurs with a change in the hydraulic gradient during a spring to summer transition that induces redox changes and increases particle stability the presence of mining related minerals and seasonal changes in environmental conditions allow for formation of dissolved metal particles but the limited stability of the particles and or low permeability of the sediments appear to limit but not fully restrict possible transport of metal

the coeur d alene mountains which are part of the bitterroot range of the northern rocky mountains the coeur d alene mountains are composed of quartzite and argillite of the mesoproterozoic belt supergroup which contain the ore bearing formations that have been mined since the 1880s the basin can be divided at the confluence of the river s south fork and north fork which merge near the community of cataldo idaho fig 1 the cataldo area represents the transition from the upper basin district to the lower basin containing the main stem of the river that drives the hydrologic changes of the lateral lakes of the lower basin langman et al 2018 the annual hydrograph of the river at cataldo for 2017 study period fig 4 is shown in relation to the median and 10th and 90th percentile boundaries of streamflow recorded at the usgs cataldo streamgage site 12413500 from 1988 to 2018 the changes in river hydrology reflect seasonal conditions of the onset of continuous freezing temperatures winter snowmelt runoff winter to spring low water season summer and return of precipitation and colder temperatures fall langman et al 2018 the change from spring to summer represents the change from a surface water dominant system to a groundwater dominant system barton 2002 which reverses the hydraulic gradient between the floodplain and river during this low water period clark and mebane 2014 within the floodplain of the lower basin are 11 lateral lakes connected to the river all of which contain heavily contaminated sediments from transport of mine waste from the upper basin sprenke et al 2000 the study site thompson lake lake is located in this biologically productive lateral lake system where remediation efforts have struggled to limit metal loading to the surface water environment balistrieri et al 2010 balistrieri and blank 2008 langman et al 2018 national research council 2005 paulson 2001 in the floodplain of the lower basin sediment analyses indicate concentrations of up to 250 ppm cd and 35 000 ppm zn and a potential total of 250 000 t of pb bookstrom et al 2001 box et al 2001 this contaminated environment has released substantial concentrations of metals to sediment porewater such as zn concentrations up to 70 mg l balistrieri et al 2010 which can leach or diffuse from the sediment environment fig 3 balistrieri and blank 2008 langman et al 2018 the transportable form of the metals during the low water summer season was previously assumed to primarily consist of sediment bound metals clark and mebane 2014 but analysis of total unfiltered and dissolved 450 nm filtered concentrations in the river collected from 2005 to 2015 indicate the likely release and transport of dissolved 450 nm inorganic and or organic metal particles from floodplain e g banks fig 3 and lake bottom sediments langman et al 2018 2 1 lakewater and porewater samples and field parameters from april through november 2017 water samples and sediment cores were collected monthly from the lake figs 1 and 4 lakewater samples were collected with a peristaltic pump from the bottom of the lakewater column at a sample location at the outlet of the lake to the river fig 4 samples were collected upon stability of field parameters recorded with use of a hanna multiparameter probe and flow through cell the probe was calibrated prior to each sampling to ensure proper measurement of ph calibrated to ph of 4 and 7 orp calibrated to a 200 mv vs ag agcl standard temperature and conductivity calibrated to a 1000 μs cm at 25 c standard all lakewater samples were collected as filtered 450 nm samples sediment cores were collected at an adjacent transect parallel to the lakeshore with each subsequent sample collected approximately 1 2 m west of the previous sample location fig 5 sediment cores were collected with a standard hand corer using 0 6 m acetate core sleeves the corer was pushed to the same depth top of the core barrel during each month s sampling sediment cores were capped and inserted into a n2 environment through use of a modified munitions box atmospheric seals plumbed to a portable n2 tank and regulator with insertion of cores to the munitions box caps were punctured and the box was sealed and purged with n2 for approximately 10 min prior to closure of the valves cores remained in the sealed box under the n2 environment until subsampling occurred internal positive pressure was identified for each core box during each month with opening of the sealed top upon return to the processing laboratory at the university of idaho that same day sediment cores were removed from the munitions box and subsampled at the approximate mid layer depth 10 cm from top or bottom of core for the upper and lower halves of the core subsamples were immediately placed in 50 ml falcon tubes containing 450 nm filters and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm sufficient volumes of porewater could not be extracted from all sediments because of limited porosity permeability particularly lower sediment subsamples collected porewater was split for analysis of water chemistry section 2 2 and dissolved particle characteristics section 2 3 dewatered centrifuged sediments were immediately placed in a lyophilizer for 72 h and subsequently stored in a 80 c freezer for preservation 2 2 water chemistry and isotope values all available

stable isotope laboratory boise state university quality control and accuracy of all sample types were checked with instrument blanks replicate samples and calibration standards over the course of sample collection and analysis no false positive results were reported and replicate results were within acceptable range 10 for all analytes 2 3 particle size and ζ potential filtered lakewater and porewater samples were analyzed for particle size distribution and zeta ζ potential using a brookhaven nanobrook zetapals at the university of idaho within 4 h of sample collection and immediately

detection level and blank samples were used to check for interferences all zero prior to sample analysis a 30 s temperature stabilization check was conducted prior to dls analysis three replicate measurements were collected and a maximum standard deviation of 20 was set as the quality control criteria which would require additional measurements to reduce the standard deviation below the quality control criteria only one sample required additional measurements analysis of ζ potential was performed as laser doppler electrophoresis phase analysis light scattering pals the laser beam was passed through the sample undergoing electrophoresis and the scattered light from the moving particles was frequency shifted from which the electrophoretic mobility m2 v 1 s 1 u was determined given

solution c2 n 1 m 2 hunter 1981 2 4 x ray analysis of sediments dehydrated and preserved upper and lower sediments from the monthly cores were analyzed using x ray fluorescence xrf for element composition and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas to evaluate s fe mn oxidation states and bond relocation s only xrf analysis was conducted at the washington state university geoanalytical laboratory using an advant xp sequential xrf spectrometer and construction of fused beads from 5 g of each core sample element concentrations were determined through comparison of x ray intensity for each element with the intensity from duplicate beads of nine u s geological survey standards govindaraju 1994 and two beads of pure vein quartz blanks xas analysis was performed at the 06b1 1 beamline sxrmb at the canadian light source saskatchewan canada samples consisted of bulk sediments and individual grains identified in thin sections non aqueous epoxy double polished to 60 μm and placed on quartz slides beamline 06b1 1 uses a si 111 monochromator to deliver an incident beam energy of 1 7 10 kev which is suitable for resolving s fe and mn k edge spectra a broad beam 3 2 mm and a

processed with the xas program athena ravel and newville 2005 k edge energies for the reference materials were determined as the maxima of the first derivative for the absorption spectra and were shifted to the theoretical values to account for beamline flux for quality control purposes each environmental sample was scanned twice to evaluate any differences and determine if additional scans were needed to reduce the signal to noise ratio minimization of standard deviation near the k edge the final spectrum was calibrated to the energy shift apparent from the applicable standard and the spectrum was edge step normalized within a maximum 15 80 ev normalization range for comparison of environmental samples and reference materials 2 5 metals extraction from sediments an aqueous extraction analysis was conducted with 1 g of preserved sediment samples collected in april july and october this non sequential analysis table 1 employed selective extraction methods to evaluate the availability of remaining solid phase metals of interest extractions occurred in 15 ml acid washed millipore rinsed polypropylene centrifuge tubes a vertical rotator was used to agitate the samples at 20 rpm the solutions were separated from the solids by centrifuge 20 min at 3000 g rauret et al 1999 decanted and 450 nm filtered metal concentrations were determined using icp oes at the analytical sciences laboratory 2 6 correlation analysis a principal component analysis pca was performed to identify correlations between environmental conditions metal concentrations and dissolved particle characteristics the pca was performed on the correlation matrix because of differences in scales e g streamflow vs metal concentration and without rotation because of likely intercorrelations e g fe and mn or streamflow and isotope value the pca was performed with lower sediment and upper sediment values to examine relations in the porewater environment and upper sediment and lakewater values to examine relations across the sediment water interface of the lake bottom 3 results 3 1 system hydrology and source water shift following spring peak flows the river undergoes a transition from surface water to groundwater dominance groundwater is the primary source or baseflow contributor barton 2002 haus et al 2008 which reverses the hydraulic gradient between the floodplain and river clark and mebane 2014 during this hydrologic shift seasonal changes include higher temperatures and increased biological productivity that is substantially greater in the lower basin balistrieri et al 2003 clark and mebane 2014 hickey et al 2008 this reversal is visible in changes in lakewater δ18o values fig 6 a depleted snowmelt signal present in april shifts to a groundwater signal that becomes more enriched through summer and into fall the sampling location was near the lake outlet and is reflective of a higher turnover area with river and or groundwater inputs limited evaporation or stratification effect 3 2 sediment characteristics previous coring of lakebed sediments in the lower basin indicated upward increasing concentrations of cd pb and zn 50 cm depth extent of prior coring sprenke et al 2000 cores collected for this study 60 cm depth split into upper and lower sediments indicate clay dominated sediments with strong variations in as ba cu fe pb mn and zn table 2 the greater coring depth of the current study produced a variation in contaminant concentrations for samples from the lower sediment layer substantial fe was present in the upper sediments median of 16 average of 17 and range of 14 to 19 but lower fe concentrations were present in the lower sediments median of 4 average of 8 and range of 3 to 19 the large range of fe concentrations in the lower sediments is an artifact of the coring depth that appears to have spanned the lower depth of fe contamination 17 to 19 for contaminated samples and 3 to 5 for lesser contaminated samples this coring depth issue also is apparent with pb mn and zn concentrations median difference of 1 4 6043 ppm and 4030 ppm respectively table 2 lower concentration contaminants such as as and cu table 2 also indicate a difference in upper and lower sediment concentrations with lower median concentrations in the lower sediments the lake sediments are contaminated with metals in various sulfide carbonate and oxide mineral forms associated with ore of the upper basin and subsequent weathering balistrieri et al 2003 balistrieri and blank 2008 sprenke et al 2000 the upper sediments were selected for aqueous extraction analysis due to the potential for the variable contributions of metals across the sediment lakewater interface results of the aqueous extraction analysis indicate limited availability of soluble extractant 1 ultrapure water fe pb mn and zn during april july and october but much greater availability of weakly sorbed extractant 2 mgcl solution pb mn and zn during all three months fig 7 for metals in less available forms oxides carbonates and sulfides fe was highly present as oxides carbonates in april july and october with correspondingly low concentrations of fe sulfides during all three seasons fig 8 inverse to the greater concentrations of weakly sorbed pb mn and zn these metals were not highly present as oxides carbonates or sulfides in comparison to fe fig 8 yet these lower sources of pb mn and zn produced relatively high presence of pb mn and zn forms that could readily enter the porewater environment with dissolution soluble or cation exchange weakly sorbed 3 3 seasonal shift in sediment sulfur oxidation a primary control of metal release or capture from weathering of metal sulfides is the s oxidation state which is a primary control on the release or scavenging of metals during oxidation and mineral decomposition blowes et al 2014 dockrey et al 2014 rickard and luther 2007 schippers 2004 schippers and sand 1999 sevinç şengör et al 2007 the oxidation state of sediment s was examined for potential alteration of species that could indicate changes in environmental conditions e g redox and potential for release or scavenging of metals sediment s species changed with the seasonal conditions and the largest change towards oxidized s species occurred in the lower sediments fig 9 this lower sediment redox change consisted of a seasonal trend towards more oxidized species from spring into summer followed by a lessening of oxidized species in the fall the shift towards oxidized species is indicated by a substantial accumulation of sulfonate or sulfite thiosulfate forms s5 indicator peak near 2481 ev as shown in fig 9 this accumulation in an intermediate s form along with retention of reduced species suggests likely polythionate forms that shift in dominance with an input removal of an oxidizer the xanes analysis of upper sediments indicate less change in s species distribution and a noticeable change towards more oxidized species only is apparent in samples collected during late summer and fall fig 9 this is an unexpected result given the presence of oxygenated water near the lake bottom at the outlet do range of 7 1 8 8 mg l throughout the sampling period the change to more oxidized s forms in the lower sediments began in june fig 9 when the lakewater δ18o values began to shift fig 6 with the hydraulic change to a groundwater dominated system the sediment s species shift indicates likely reducing conditions in the spring and the introduction of o2 or other oxidizer to the lower sediments with the shift to groundwater dominance upward intrusion the upper sediment s species shift to oxidized forms is less pronounced and delayed compared to the lower sediments but also suggests a likely input of o2 with groundwater intrusion the temporal lag limited volume of upward groundwater movement and or relatively low oxygen content of o2 in the intruding groundwater lessens the effect of the introduction of o2 into the upper sediments compared to the lower sediments 3 4 shift in sediment reduction oxidation environment the shift towards an oxidizing environment in lower sediments with the shift towards groundwater dominance also is apparent with a change in fe species but not mn species at the grain scale fig 10 iron species shifted towards fe3 from april to july and into october in the lower sediments arrow indicators in fig 10 but a similar shift is not apparent in the upper sediments additionally mn species do not indicate a distinct shift in oxidation states with the seasonal change fig 10 the difference in standard electrode potential of the environmentally preferred fe3 fe2 and mn4 mn2 pairs is substantial 0 77 e v and 1 23 e v respectively and provides a view of the strength of redox change with the seasonal cycle the shift towards oxidized species with the more reactive fe in the lower sediments compared to the upper sediments and limited to no change in mn species suggests a probable input of oxygenated groundwater that has a limited oxidizing capacity relatively low dissolved oxygen content the change in sediment fe species parallels the change in s sediment species with the greater oxidation occurring in the lower sediments with a much lower influence of the oxidant in the upper sediments 3 5 shift in sulfur bonds measurement of the absorption coefficient beyond the s k edge xafs region can indicate changes in coordination number bond length and local disorder of adjacent atoms alp et al 1990 newville 2014 sham 2008 the xafs region reflects dipole transitions from core to unoccupied states governed by the surrounding environment absorbing atoms that reflects characteristics of adjacent atoms alp et al 1990 penner hahn 2005 yang et al 2015b due to the mixed nature of the sediments and seasonal environmental changes xafs region analysis was performed to identify relative shifts in adjacent atom characteristics through changes in 1st sphere spectra in frequency filtered reverse fourier transform with k weight 2 and hanning window or cosine squared taper reciprocal space q space or fourier filtered χ k the resulting complex number of the q space spectra has equivalent real q and imaginary q numbers equal to real k and imaginary k numbers the real number portion of the analysis for the s xafs region is presented in fig 11 for comparison of seasonal changes in s bonding within upper and lower sediments to previously identified shifts in s species fig 9 and fe speciation fig 10 the adjacent atoms bonded to the s in the upper sediments appear to shift from spring april may to early summer june july with a 1st sphere response fig 11 arrow indicators the lower sediments produced a similar s 1st sphere shift but at a substantially larger amplitude fig 11 this larger amplitude shift in the 1st sphere bonds of s in the lower sediments fig 11 parallels the greater oxidation of s from spring into summer in the lower sediments compared to the limited change in s species in the upper sediments during the same time period fig 9 3 6 lakewater and porewater physicochemical trends lakewater physicochemical trends indicate a corresponding seasonal change in temperature with the shift from spring surface water snowmelt driven to groundwater dominance as temperature increased conductivity so4 and doc increased in lakewater fig 12 a similar doc change is visible in porewater from the upper sediment layer as doc increased the porewater fe2 fe3 ratio decreased and s2 s6 ratio remained relatively steady the return of colder temperatures in september october reduced lakewater conductivity and so4 likely because of the return of precipitation langman et al 2018 but doc in lakewater and porewater remained elevated fig 12 3 7 lakewater and porewater metal trends concentrations of metals in lakewater and porewater indicate the largest concentrations of fe pb mn and zn typically occurred in the upper porewater followed by lower porewater and lakewater fig 13 porewater fe and mn concentrations were the least variable while pb and zn concentrations in lower porewater varied by about 3 orders of magnitude upper porewater pb was similar throughout the year and upper porewater zn indicated a decreasing trend from spring to fall fig 13 lakewater metal concentrations were highly variable with pb variability zn variability fe variability mn variability fig 13 3 8 lakewater and porewater dissolved particle trends analysis of dissolved particle characteristics in the filtered porewater of the upper and lower sediments indicate an average effective diameter of 185 100 nm and ζ potential of 9 5 mv for the upper sediment porewater and an average effective diameter of 175 140 nm and ζ potential of 9 11 mv for lower sediment porewater lakewater particle characteristics were highly variable with an average effective diameter of 160 200 nm and ζ potential of 6 6 mv likely because of the lower particle concentrations no multi modal distributions were detected in lakewater or porewater samples indicating normal distributions of dissolved particles no seasonal trend was apparent for effective diameter in upper and lower porewater although the largest particle sizes occurred in late spring through summer ζ potential in upper and lower porewater did indicate a seasonal trend that produced the greatest particle stability most negative in june fig 14 the more negative ζ potential values of summer are indicative of more stable greater repulsion particles although these values do indicate incipient instability typically categorized for the 10 to 30 mv range values greater than 30 mv would indicate moderate stability and greater potential for sustained transport the lack of an associated trend in effective diameter suggests limited ability to effectively determine particle distribution or highly variable formation and release of particles in the porewater environment although a zetapals analyzer is not a direct measurement of particle abundance count rates from ζ potential analysis provide a relative change in availability abundance between samples the changes in ζ potential count rates during the study period for each of the sample types indicates a decrease in potential abundance for sediment porewater particles from spring to summer but an increase in lakewater particles during the same period and an inverse of this abundance relation between porewater and lakewater from summer to fall fig 15 the decrease in potential abundance of porewater particles may partially explain the increased particle stability fig 14 4 discussion multiple lines of evidence indicate a shift in seasonal environmental conditions in the lakebed sediments and the shift is strongest in the lower sediments figs 9 12 this shift corresponds to the change in hydraulic conditions from surface water to groundwater dominance fig 6 which appears to induce a change in redox conditions from spring into summer for the sediments only lakewater remained well oxygenated the redox shift is an introduction of an oxidant with groundwater intrusion that is strongest in the lower sediments as indicated by changes in s and fe oxidation states figs 9 and 10 and a decrease in the fe2 fe3 ratio for the upper porewater fig 12 such redox shifts likely are the reason for the previous identification of metal cycling between solid and aqueous phases bostick et al 2001 harrington et al 1998 haus et al 2008 horowitz et al 1995 kuwabara et al 2003 moberly et al 2008 which is apparent with the indication of s bond relocation from spring to summer samples fig 11 this environmental shift likely is the catalyst for variation in available metals fig 7 and oxide carbonate vs sulfide forms fig 8 in the sediments there is a lack of a similar trend in porewater and lakewater metal concentrations fig 13 and particle effective diameter fig 14 but a trend in ζ potential and relative abundance of particles suggests increased stability of dissolved metal particles in upper and lower porewater during summer figs 14 and 15 when the sediments shifted to a more oxygenated environment the study period covered a single annual period of the change in surface water to groundwater dominance that introduced the oxidant to the lakebed sediments it is unknown whether the strength of this oxidizing event shifts from year to year with annual changes in basin hydrology the seasonal variation in environmental conditions can be viewed from changes in surface conditions e g river streamflow or groundwater intrusion e g lakewater δ18o changes in river streamflow and lakewater δ18o are different views of the same environmental shift tied to the change in seasonal conditions river streamflow and lakewater δ18o were evaluated by pca along with aqueous metal concentrations doc and dissolved particle characteristics to examine the influence of the environmental shift on metal concentrations and their perceived particle characteristics the pca was performed with multiple data sets to examine potential shifts across two interfaces the sediment lakewater interface lakewater and upper porewater and within the sediment zone upper and lower porewater the major contributors to the variance 0 5 correlation value associated with the first and second principal components were discerned in bold for each solute as a positive or negative inverse correlation this view of each solute and the explanation of variance along a component highlights the relation of certain solutes to be released into porewater or lakewater their particle effective diameter and stability ζ potential and subsequent ability to be transported at the sediment lakewater interface pca results indicate a correlation 0 5 of river streamflow shown as inverse correlation in red with zn and ζ potential in lakewater and pb and zn in upper porewater table 3 component 1 the second component suggests a correlation of river streamflow and lakewater fe mn and zn and upper porewater fe and ζ potential inverse to the river streamflow influence δ18o values were correlated with mn and doc in lakewater and doc in upper porewater which suggests no influence on fe pb or zn concentrations and particle characteristics from changes in doc the relations are relatively weak given the low explanation of variance 33 and 26 for first and second components respectively although summed this explanation of variance is 59 overall component correlations suggest a relation of changes in river streamflow with changes in fe pb and zn concentrations and the particle characteristics of ζ potential in upper porewater that does not translate to similar relations in lakewater within the sediment zone river streamflow is correlated shown as inverse correlation in red with fe and zn in upper porewater and fe mn zn and ζ potential in lower porewater table 3 component 1 δ18o values are correlated with doc in upper and lower porewater and effective diameter in upper porewater independent of river streamflow and δ18o fe and ζ potential were correlated in upper porewater along with pb and effective diameter in lower porewater additionally pb mn and zn were correlated in upper porewater similar to the upper porewater lakewater pca results explanation of variance is relatively low for each component 42 and 23 but sum to a majority of the variance 65 overall changes in river streamflow reflect changes in fe mn pb and zn concentrations at locations in the sediments that can be correlated with select particle characteristics while changes in δ18o values relate to changes in doc that do not correspond to changes in metal concentrations and have very limited correlation with dissolved particle characteristics 5 conclusions examination of the metal contaminated sediments porewater and lakewater of thompson lake along the coeur d alene river indicates a dynamic hydrobiochemical system that undergoes substantial seasonal changes in this northerly climate available soluble and weakly sorbed contaminant metals of fe pb mn and zn are present in the lakebed sediments and provide a source of metals for release into the porewater and lakewater environments a primary environmental shift in reduction oxidation potential occurs in the lakebed sediments that is linked to the decrease of streamflow and the intrusion of groundwater from spring into summer this environmental shift causes a change in fe and s speciation and alteration of s bonds with adjacent atoms indicative of shifting metal coordination in the sediments lakewater metal concentrations did not correlate with this environmental shift or metal concentrations in the upper porewater but similar changes were detected in upper and lower porewaters suggestive of changes in release of dissolved metal particles with the seasonal changes that correspond to particle stability ζ potential this lack of correlation between upper porewater and lakewater suggests limited stability of the metal particles and or limited physical transport of the metal particles from the sediments to the lakewater although substantive metal concentrations were present in lakewater the limitation of physical transport may be reflected in the difference in redox conditions between upper and lower sediments where the larger shift occurred in the lower sediments likely because of the intrusion of oxygenated groundwater and a smaller influence of this oxidant in the upper sediments because of oxygen consumption and or limited permeability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

1519,formation of dissolved metal particles 450 nm in mining impacted environments is a concern because of their potential for greater mobility and ecotoxicity compared to free ion and or sediment bound metals metal contaminated environments may produce soluble metal loid particles whose stability and transportability are determined by environmental conditions and particle composition the coeur d alene river basin of northern idaho usa is impacted by legacy mine waste estimated 56 million tonnes of waste rock containing 900 000 t of pb and 700 000 t of zn were discharged into the coeur d alene river and its tributaries during mining of argentiferous galena sphalerite deposits these legacy disposal practices resulted in substantial metal contamination including as cd fe pb mn and zn of floodplain sediments monthly lakewater samples and sediment cores were collected along the shoreline of a metal contaminated lateral lake of the coeur d alene river porewater was extracted from upper and lower sediments to evaluate the formation and stability of dissolved metal particles during seasonal changes substantial concentrations of fe pb mn and zn were present in 450 nm filtered porewater during each month with variable increases and decreases of metal concentrations in filtered lakewater according to seasonal changes dissolved metal particles with an average diameter of 180 115 nm were present in the porewater of the upper and lower sediments with size increases in early spring and decreases in fall particles in the lower sediment porewater were typically more stable as indicated by more negative ζ potential values and the greatest particle stability occurred during summer differences between upper and lower porewater metal particles correspond to changes in sediment s speciation and bond relocation resulting from an input of oxygenated groundwater transport of the dissolved metal particles in and from the sediments likely occurs with a change in the hydraulic gradient during a spring to summer transition that induces redox changes and increases particle stability the presence of mining related minerals and seasonal changes in environmental conditions allow for formation of dissolved metal particles but the limited stability of the particles and or low permeability of the sediments appear to limit but not fully restrict possible transport of metal particles to the overlying lakewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mine waste dissolved metal particle particle stability porewater metal transport 1 introduction the impact of legacy

the coeur d alene mountains which are part of the bitterroot range of the northern rocky mountains the coeur d alene mountains are composed of quartzite and argillite of the mesoproterozoic belt supergroup which contain the ore bearing formations that have been mined since the 1880s the basin can be divided at the confluence of the river s south fork and north fork which merge near the community of cataldo idaho fig 1 the cataldo area represents the transition from the upper basin district to the lower basin containing the main stem of the river that drives the hydrologic changes of the lateral lakes of the lower basin langman et al 2018 the annual hydrograph of the river at cataldo for 2017 study period fig 4 is shown in relation to the median and 10th and 90th percentile boundaries of streamflow recorded at the usgs cataldo streamgage site 12413500 from 1988 to 2018 the changes in river hydrology reflect seasonal conditions of the onset of continuous freezing

change from a surface water dominant system to a groundwater dominant system barton 2002 which reverses the hydraulic gradient between the floodplain and river during this low water period clark and mebane 2014 within the floodplain of the lower basin are 11 lateral lakes connected to the river all of which contain heavily contaminated sediments from transport of mine waste from the upper basin

environment balistrieri et al 2010 balistrieri and blank 2008 langman et al 2018 national research council 2005 paulson 2001 in the floodplain of the lower basin sediment analyses indicate concentrations of up to 250 ppm cd and 35 000 ppm zn and a potential total of 250 000 t of pb bookstrom et al 2001 box et al 2001 this contaminated environment has released substantial concentrations

2018 the transportable form of the metals during the low water summer season was previously assumed to primarily consist of sediment bound metals clark and mebane 2014 but analysis of total unfiltered and dissolved 450 nm filtered concentrations in the river collected from 2005 to 2015 indicate the likely release and transport of dissolved 450 nm inorganic and or organic metal particles from floodplain e g banks fig 3 and lake bottom sediments langman et al 2018 2 1 lakewater and porewater samples and field parameters from april through november 2017 water samples and sediment cores were collected monthly from the lake figs 1 and 4 lakewater samples were collected with a peristaltic pump from the bottom of the lakewater column at a sample location at the outlet of the lake to the river fig 4 samples were collected upon stability of field parameters recorded with use of a hanna multiparameter probe and flow through cell the probe was calibrated prior to each sampling to ensure proper measurement of ph calibrated to ph of 4 and 7 orp calibrated to a 200 mv vs ag agcl standard temperature and conductivity calibrated to a 1000 μs cm at 25 c standard all lakewater samples were collected as filtered 450 nm samples sediment cores were collected at an adjacent transect parallel to the lakeshore with each subsequent sample collected approximately 1 2 m west of the previous sample location fig 5 sediment cores were collected with a standard hand corer using 0 6 m acetate core sleeves the corer was pushed to the same depth top of the core barrel during each month s sampling sediment cores were capped and inserted into a n2 environment through use of a modified munitions box atmospheric seals plumbed to a portable n2 tank and regulator with insertion of cores to the munitions box caps were punctured and the box was sealed and purged with n2 for approximately 10 min prior to closure of the valves cores remained in the sealed box under the n2 environment until subsampling occurred internal positive pressure was identified for each core box during each month with opening of the sealed top upon return to the processing laboratory at the university of idaho that same day sediment cores were removed from the munitions box and subsampled at the approximate mid layer depth 10 cm from top or bottom of core for the upper and lower halves of the core subsamples were immediately placed in 50 ml falcon tubes containing 450 nm filters and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm sufficient volumes of porewater could not be extracted from all sediments because of limited porosity permeability particularly lower sediment subsamples collected porewater was split for analysis of water chemistry section 2 2 and dissolved particle characteristics section

stable isotope laboratory boise state university quality control and accuracy of all sample types were checked with instrument blanks replicate samples and calibration standards over the course of sample collection and analysis no false positive results were reported and replicate results were within acceptable range 10 for all analytes 2 3 particle size and ζ potential filtered lakewater and

measurements were collected and a maximum standard deviation of 20 was set as the quality control criteria which would require additional measurements to reduce the standard deviation below the quality control criteria only one sample required additional measurements analysis of ζ potential was performed as laser doppler electrophoresis phase analysis light scattering pals the laser beam was

composition and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas to evaluate s fe mn oxidation states and bond relocation s only xrf analysis was conducted at the washington state university geoanalytical laboratory using an advant xp sequential xrf spectrometer and construction of fused beads from 5 g of each core sample element concentrations were determined through comparison of x ray intensity for each element with the intensity from duplicate beads of nine u s geological survey standards govindaraju 1994 and two beads of pure vein quartz blanks xas analysis was performed at the 06b1 1 beamline sxrmb at the canadian light source saskatchewan canada samples consisted of bulk sediments and individual grains identified in thin sections non aqueous epoxy double polished to 60 μm and placed on

processed with the xas program athena ravel and newville 2005 k edge energies for the reference materials were determined as the maxima of the first derivative for the absorption spectra and were shifted to the theoretical values to account for beamline flux for quality control purposes each environmental sample was scanned twice to evaluate any differences and determine if additional scans were needed to reduce the signal to noise ratio minimization of standard deviation near the k edge the final spectrum was calibrated to the energy shift apparent from the applicable standard and the spectrum was edge step normalized within a maximum 15 80 ev normalization range for comparison of environmental samples and reference materials 2 5 metals extraction from sediments an aqueous extraction analysis was conducted with 1 g of preserved sediment samples collected in april july and october this non sequential analysis table 1 employed selective extraction methods to evaluate the availability of remaining solid phase metals of interest extractions occurred in 15 ml acid washed millipore rinsed polypropylene centrifuge tubes a vertical rotator was used to agitate the samples at 20 rpm the solutions were separated from the solids by centrifuge 20 min at 3000 g rauret et al 1999 decanted and 450 nm filtered metal concentrations were determined using icp oes at the analytical sciences laboratory 2 6 correlation analysis a principal component analysis pca was performed to identify correlations between environmental conditions metal concentrations and dissolved particle characteristics the pca was performed on the correlation matrix because of differences in scales e g streamflow vs metal concentration and without rotation because of likely intercorrelations e g fe and mn or streamflow and isotope value the pca was performed with lower sediment and upper sediment values to examine relations in the porewater environment and upper sediment and lakewater values to examine relations across the sediment water interface of the lake bottom 3 results 3 1 system hydrology and source water shift following spring peak flows the river undergoes a transition from surface water to groundwater dominance groundwater is the primary source or baseflow contributor barton 2002 haus et al 2008 which reverses the hydraulic gradient between the floodplain and river clark and mebane 2014 during this hydrologic shift seasonal changes include higher temperatures and increased biological productivity that is substantially greater in the lower basin balistrieri et al 2003 clark and mebane 2014 hickey et al 2008 this reversal is visible in changes in lakewater δ18o values fig 6 a depleted snowmelt signal present in april shifts to a groundwater signal that becomes more enriched through summer and into fall the sampling location was near the lake outlet and is reflective of a higher turnover area with river and or groundwater inputs limited evaporation or stratification effect 3 2 sediment characteristics previous coring of lakebed sediments in the lower basin indicated upward increasing concentrations of cd pb and zn 50 cm depth extent of prior coring sprenke et al 2000 cores collected for this study 60 cm depth split into upper and lower sediments indicate clay dominated sediments with strong variations in as ba cu fe pb mn and zn table 2 the greater coring depth of the current study produced a variation in contaminant concentrations for samples from the lower sediment layer substantial fe was present in the upper sediments median of 16 average of 17 and range of 14 to 19 but lower fe concentrations were present in the lower sediments median of 4 average of 8 and range of 3 to 19 the large range of fe concentrations in the lower sediments is an artifact of the coring depth that appears to have spanned the lower depth of fe contamination 17 to 19 for contaminated samples and 3 to 5 for lesser contaminated samples this coring depth issue also is apparent with pb mn and zn concentrations median difference of 1 4 6043 ppm and 4030 ppm respectively table 2 lower concentration contaminants such as as and cu table 2 also indicate a difference in upper and lower sediment concentrations with lower median concentrations in the lower sediments the lake sediments are contaminated with metals in various sulfide carbonate and oxide mineral forms associated with ore of the upper basin and subsequent weathering balistrieri et al 2003 balistrieri and blank 2008 sprenke et al 2000 the upper sediments were selected for aqueous extraction analysis due to the potential for the variable contributions of metals across the sediment lakewater interface results of the aqueous extraction analysis indicate limited availability of soluble extractant 1 ultrapure water fe pb mn and zn during april july and october but much greater availability of weakly sorbed extractant 2 mgcl solution pb mn and zn during all three months fig 7 for metals in less available forms oxides carbonates and sulfides fe was highly present as oxides carbonates in april july and october with correspondingly low concentrations of fe sulfides during all three seasons fig 8 inverse to the greater concentrations of weakly sorbed pb mn and zn these metals were not highly present as oxides carbonates or sulfides in comparison to fe fig 8 yet these lower sources of pb mn and zn produced relatively high presence of pb mn and zn forms that could readily enter the porewater environment with dissolution soluble or cation exchange weakly sorbed 3 3 seasonal shift in sediment sulfur oxidation a primary control of metal release or capture from weathering of metal sulfides is the s oxidation state which is a primary control on the release or scavenging of metals during oxidation and mineral decomposition blowes et al 2014 dockrey et al 2014 rickard and luther 2007 schippers 2004 schippers and sand 1999 sevinç şengör et al 2007 the oxidation state of sediment s was examined for potential alteration of species that could indicate changes in environmental conditions e g redox and potential for release or scavenging of metals sediment s species changed with the seasonal conditions and the largest change towards oxidized s species occurred in the lower sediments fig 9 this lower sediment redox change consisted of a seasonal trend towards more oxidized species from spring into summer followed by a lessening of oxidized species in the fall the shift towards oxidized species is indicated by a substantial accumulation of sulfonate or sulfite thiosulfate forms s5 indicator peak near 2481 ev as shown in fig 9 this accumulation in an intermediate s form along with retention of reduced species suggests likely polythionate forms that shift in dominance with an input removal of an oxidizer the xanes analysis of upper sediments indicate less change in s species distribution and a noticeable change towards more oxidized species only is apparent in samples collected during late summer and fall fig 9 this is an unexpected result given the presence of oxygenated water near the lake bottom at the outlet do range of 7 1 8 8 mg l throughout the sampling period the change to more oxidized s forms in the lower sediments began in june fig 9 when the lakewater δ18o values began to shift fig 6 with the hydraulic change to a groundwater dominated system the sediment s species shift indicates likely reducing conditions in the spring and the introduction of o2 or other oxidizer to the lower sediments with the shift to groundwater dominance upward intrusion the upper sediment s species shift to oxidized forms is less pronounced and delayed compared to the lower sediments but also suggests a likely input of o2 with groundwater intrusion the temporal lag limited volume of upward groundwater movement and or relatively low oxygen content of o2 in the intruding groundwater lessens the effect of the introduction of o2 into the upper sediments compared to the lower sediments 3 4 shift in sediment reduction oxidation environment the shift towards an oxidizing environment in lower sediments with the shift towards groundwater dominance also is apparent with a change in fe species but not mn species at the grain scale fig 10 iron species shifted towards fe3 from april to july and into october in the lower sediments arrow indicators in fig 10 but a similar shift is not apparent in the upper sediments additionally mn species do not indicate a distinct shift in oxidation states with the seasonal change fig 10 the difference in standard electrode potential of the environmentally preferred fe3 fe2 and mn4 mn2 pairs is substantial 0 77 e v and 1 23 e v respectively and provides a view of the strength of redox change with the seasonal cycle the shift towards oxidized species with the more reactive fe in the lower sediments compared to the upper sediments and limited to no change in mn species suggests a probable input of oxygenated groundwater that has a limited oxidizing capacity relatively low dissolved oxygen content the change in sediment fe species parallels the change in s sediment species with the greater oxidation occurring in the lower sediments with a much lower influence of the oxidant in the upper sediments 3 5 shift in sulfur bonds measurement of the absorption coefficient beyond the s k edge xafs region can indicate changes in coordination number bond length and local disorder of adjacent atoms alp et al 1990 newville 2014 sham 2008 the xafs region reflects dipole transitions from core to unoccupied states governed by the surrounding environment absorbing atoms that reflects characteristics of adjacent atoms alp et al 1990 penner hahn 2005 yang et al 2015b due to the mixed nature of the sediments and seasonal environmental changes xafs region analysis was performed to identify relative shifts in adjacent atom characteristics through changes in 1st sphere spectra in frequency filtered reverse fourier transform with k weight 2 and hanning window or cosine squared taper reciprocal space q space or fourier filtered χ k the resulting complex number of the q space spectra has equivalent real q and imaginary q numbers equal to real k and imaginary k numbers the real number portion of the analysis for the s xafs region is presented in fig 11 for comparison of seasonal changes in s bonding within upper and lower sediments to previously identified shifts in s species fig 9 and fe speciation fig 10 the adjacent atoms bonded to the s in the upper sediments appear to shift from spring april may to early summer june july with a 1st sphere response fig 11 arrow indicators the lower sediments produced a similar s 1st sphere shift but at a substantially larger amplitude fig 11 this larger amplitude shift in the 1st sphere bonds of s in the lower sediments fig 11 parallels the greater oxidation of s from spring into summer in the lower sediments compared to the limited change in s species in the upper sediments during the same time period fig 9 3 6 lakewater and porewater physicochemical trends lakewater physicochemical trends indicate a corresponding seasonal change in temperature with the shift from spring surface water snowmelt driven to groundwater dominance as temperature increased conductivity so4 and doc increased in lakewater fig 12 a similar doc change is visible in porewater from the upper sediment layer as doc increased the porewater fe2 fe3 ratio decreased and s2 s6 ratio remained relatively steady the return of colder temperatures in september october reduced lakewater conductivity and so4 likely because of the return of precipitation langman et al 2018 but doc in lakewater and porewater remained elevated fig 12 3 7 lakewater and porewater metal trends concentrations of metals in lakewater and porewater indicate the largest concentrations of fe pb mn and zn typically occurred in the upper porewater followed by lower porewater and lakewater fig 13 porewater fe and mn concentrations were the least variable while pb and zn concentrations in lower porewater varied by about 3 orders of magnitude upper porewater pb was similar throughout the year and upper porewater zn indicated a decreasing trend from spring to fall fig 13 lakewater metal concentrations were highly variable with pb variability zn variability fe variability mn variability fig 13 3 8 lakewater and porewater dissolved particle trends analysis of dissolved particle characteristics in the filtered porewater of the upper and lower sediments indicate an average effective diameter of 185 100 nm and ζ potential of 9 5 mv for the upper sediment porewater and an average effective diameter of 175 140 nm and ζ potential of 9 11 mv for lower sediment porewater lakewater particle characteristics were highly variable with an average effective diameter of 160 200 nm and ζ potential of 6 6 mv likely because of the lower particle concentrations no multi modal distributions were detected in lakewater or porewater samples indicating normal distributions of dissolved particles no seasonal trend was apparent for effective diameter in upper and lower porewater although the largest particle sizes occurred in late spring through summer ζ potential in upper and lower porewater did indicate a seasonal trend that produced the greatest particle stability most negative in june fig 14 the more negative ζ potential values of summer are indicative of more stable greater repulsion particles although these values do indicate incipient instability typically categorized for the 10 to 30 mv range values greater than 30 mv would indicate moderate stability and greater potential for sustained transport the lack of an associated trend in effective diameter suggests limited ability to effectively determine particle distribution or highly variable formation and release of particles in the porewater environment although a zetapals analyzer is not a direct measurement of particle abundance count rates from ζ potential analysis provide a relative change in availability abundance between samples the changes in ζ potential count rates during the study period for each of the sample types indicates a decrease in potential abundance for sediment porewater particles from spring to summer but an increase in lakewater particles during the same period and an inverse of this abundance relation between porewater and lakewater from summer to fall fig 15 the decrease in potential abundance of porewater particles may partially explain the increased particle stability fig 14 4 discussion multiple lines of evidence indicate a shift in seasonal environmental conditions in the lakebed sediments and the shift is strongest in the lower sediments figs 9 12 this shift corresponds to the change in hydraulic conditions from surface water to groundwater dominance fig 6 which appears to induce a change in redox conditions from spring into summer for the sediments only lakewater remained well oxygenated the redox shift is an introduction of an oxidant with groundwater intrusion that is strongest in the lower sediments as indicated by changes in s and fe oxidation states figs 9 and 10 and a decrease in the fe2 fe3 ratio for the upper porewater fig 12 such redox shifts likely are the reason for the previous identification of metal cycling between solid and aqueous phases bostick et al 2001 harrington et al 1998 haus et al 2008 horowitz et al 1995 kuwabara et al 2003 moberly et al 2008 which is apparent with the indication of s bond relocation from spring to summer samples fig 11 this environmental shift likely is the catalyst for variation in available metals fig 7 and oxide carbonate vs sulfide forms fig 8 in the sediments there is a lack of a similar trend in porewater and lakewater metal concentrations fig 13 and particle effective diameter fig 14 but a trend in ζ potential and relative abundance of particles suggests increased stability of dissolved metal particles in upper and lower porewater during summer figs 14 and 15 when the sediments shifted to a more oxygenated environment the study period covered a single annual period of the change in surface water to groundwater dominance that introduced the oxidant to the lakebed sediments it is unknown whether the strength of this oxidizing event shifts from year to year with annual changes in basin hydrology the seasonal variation in environmental conditions can be viewed from changes in surface conditions e g river streamflow or groundwater intrusion e g lakewater δ18o changes in river streamflow and lakewater δ18o are different views of the same environmental shift tied to the change in seasonal conditions river streamflow and lakewater δ18o were evaluated by pca along with aqueous metal concentrations doc and dissolved particle characteristics to examine the influence of the environmental shift on metal concentrations and their perceived particle characteristics the pca was performed with multiple data sets to examine potential shifts across two interfaces the sediment lakewater interface lakewater and upper porewater and within the sediment zone upper and lower porewater the major contributors to the variance 0 5 correlation value associated with the first and second principal components were discerned in bold for each solute as a positive or negative inverse correlation this view of each solute and the explanation of variance along a component highlights the relation of certain solutes to be released into porewater or lakewater their particle effective diameter and stability ζ potential and subsequent ability to be transported at the sediment lakewater interface pca results indicate a correlation 0 5 of river streamflow shown as inverse correlation in red with zn and ζ potential in lakewater and pb and zn in upper porewater table 3 component 1 the second component suggests a correlation of river streamflow and lakewater fe mn and zn and upper porewater fe and ζ potential inverse to the river streamflow influence δ18o values were correlated with mn and doc in lakewater and doc in upper porewater which suggests no influence on fe pb or zn concentrations and particle characteristics from changes in doc the relations are relatively weak given the low explanation of variance 33 and 26 for first and second components respectively although summed this explanation of variance is 59 overall component correlations suggest a relation of changes in river streamflow with changes in fe pb and zn concentrations and the particle characteristics of ζ potential in upper porewater that does not translate to similar relations in lakewater within the sediment zone river streamflow is correlated shown as inverse correlation in red with fe and zn in upper porewater and fe mn zn and ζ potential in lower porewater table 3 component 1 δ18o values are correlated with doc in upper and lower porewater and effective diameter in upper porewater independent of river streamflow and δ18o fe and ζ potential were correlated in upper porewater along with pb and effective diameter in lower porewater additionally pb mn and zn were correlated in upper porewater similar to the upper porewater lakewater pca results explanation of variance is relatively low for each component 42 and 23 but sum to a majority of the variance 65 overall changes in river streamflow reflect changes in fe mn pb and zn concentrations at locations in the sediments that can be correlated with select particle characteristics while changes in δ18o values relate to changes in doc that do not correspond to changes in metal concentrations and have very limited correlation with dissolved particle characteristics 5 conclusions examination of the metal contaminated sediments porewater and lakewater of thompson lake along the coeur d alene river indicates a dynamic hydrobiochemical system that undergoes substantial seasonal changes in this northerly climate available soluble and weakly sorbed contaminant metals of fe pb mn and zn are present in the lakebed sediments and provide a source of metals for release into the porewater and lakewater environments a primary environmental shift in reduction oxidation potential occurs in the lakebed sediments that is linked to the decrease of streamflow and the intrusion of groundwater from spring into summer this environmental shift causes a change in fe and s speciation and alteration of s bonds with adjacent atoms indicative of shifting metal coordination in the sediments lakewater metal concentrations did not correlate with this environmental shift or metal concentrations in the upper porewater but similar changes were detected in upper and lower porewaters suggestive of changes in release of dissolved metal particles with the seasonal changes that correspond to particle stability ζ potential this lack of correlation between upper porewater and lakewater suggests limited stability of the metal particles and or limited physical transport of the metal particles from the sediments to the lakewater although substantive metal concentrations were present in lakewater the limitation of physical transport may be reflected in the difference in redox conditions between upper and lower sediments where the larger shift occurred in the lower sediments likely because of the intrusion of oxygenated groundwater and a smaller influence of this oxidant in the upper sediments because of oxygen consumption and or limited permeability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
