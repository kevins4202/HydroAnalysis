10195,dryland cotton farmers need to carefully manage the available water content awc in the root zone to reduce cost of mapping a digital soil mapping dsm approach might be useful the purpose of this study was seeing if we could create dsm of the awc at the field scale in the first instance digital data in the form of proximal sensed electromagnetic i e em and gamma ray γ ray spectrometry data were collected along with elevation using a grid based sampling design 52 soil sample locations were selected and sampled topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m in the laboratory the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp were determined using a pressure plate apparatus the digital and soil i e fc and pwp data were then calibrated with multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise mlr models compared for each depth e g adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 the stepwise mlr were shown to be superior subsequently the dsm of fc and pwp were examined in terms of prediction agreement lin s concordance leave one out cross validation results showed substantial 1 1 agreement between measured and predicted fc 0 80 and pwp 0 79 at all depths the final dsms of fc and pwp and by difference awc were indicative of the two main geomorphological geological units with large awc 0 3 m3 m 3 associated with the clay rich vertosols and small awc 0 15 m3 m 3 the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone owing to the short scale variation and the fact that the local alluvium and pilliga sandstone were close together and the fact that the digital data varied in different ways larger confidence interval ci values were evident where these areas were juxtaposed nevertheless the final dsm allows the farmer to better manage awc keywords digital soil mapping electromagnetic induction gamma ray spectrometry soil available water content field capacity permanent wilting point 1 introduction the australian cotton industry is predominantly irrigated however approximately 10 is grown under dryland conditions a fundamental management decision for dryland farmers is determining planting time with a critical factor influencing whether to plant or not being amount of stored moisture because it can help dryland farmers optimize row spacing moreover information about field capacity i e fc maximum water stored and permanent wilting point i e pwp minimum moisture at which a plant wilts is required this is particularly the case for vertosols which characteristically have 35 clay content while these heavy clays have large fc i e 0 32 θ 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the available water holding capacity awc is constrained by the pwp also being large i e 0 20 θ 0 24 cm3cm 3 gardiner and miller 2004 therefore knowing the awc can help farmers make management decisions about planting time and row spacing the determination of the awc is usually determined in the laboratory using either pressure plate cresswell et al 2008 hanging column filter paper leong et al 2002 evaporation or vapour equilibration nam et al 2010 methods in field measurements include the use of a tensiometer or resistance blocks however these methods are time consuming and only provide point source information because the awc has been shown to be a function of soil texture mccutcheon et al 2006 and because the various soil particle size fractions vary spatially muzzamal et al 2018 there is the potential to use a digital soil mapping dsm approach to provide this information specifically digital data has been correlated with particle size fractions and mapped at the field weller et al 2007 farm khongnawang et al 2019 and district mora vallejo et al 2008 scale to map particle size fractions electromagnetic em induction instruments have commonly been used because they measure apparent soil electrical conductivity eca which has been shown to be influenced by clay e g saey et al 2011 moreover other properties that influence awc including cation exchange capacity cec zhao et al 2020 mineralogy nagra et al 2017 and organic matter huang et al 2017 have also been mapped more recently gamma ray γ ray spectrometry data has been used to map clay arshad et al 2020 cec cec li et al 2018 and infer mineralogy differences triantafilis et al 2013 with respect to dsm of awc gooley et al 2014 used a stepwise multiple linear regression stepwise mlr to predict average rootzone 0 0 9 m fc and pwp using ground based em and airborne γ ray data at the district scale 40 000 ha recently research has also shown that environmental indices from remote sensed platforms e g landsat 7 airborne γ ray can be used to map awc at district malone et al 2009 country hong et al 2013 and continental padarian et al 2014 scales however these dsm cannot be used by farmers to make decisions owing to issues of spectral and spatial resolution the aim of this study was to demonstrate how a dsm approach could be used to predict fc and pwp and by difference estimate awc at the field scale in the topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m in the first instance fc and pwp were determined using pressure plate apparatus a multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise mlr were developed between soil and digital data i e eca and γ ray spectrometry with position e g easting also considered the best model calibration was determined considering adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 and accuracy rmse with prediction agreement lin s concordance of the dsm of fc and pwp compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study field is 23 ha in size and located within a commercial farm 370 m above sea level 30 06 30 s 149 55 35 e which is near narrabri in new south wales australia fig 1a the climate is semi arid with a mean annual rainfall of 643 mm and potential evaporation over 1800 mm the rainfall is summer dominant with a mean maximum in january 79 8 mm and minimum in august 37 5 mm dryland cotton is the main cash crop and is grown in summer wheat is grown in the winter with chick peas and other crops grown in rotation the study field is located to the east of edgeroi and lies on the foot slopes of the nandewar range specifically it lies between the couradda national park to the north and the bobbiwaa state conservation area to the south the footslopes are underlain by pilliga sandstone with the study field soil derived from second terraced fan of local alluvium triantafilis et al 2001 the soil of the study field is predominantly vertosol variations in subsoil colour occur from red brown subsoils on upper slopes south east and associated with pilliga sandstone to dark grey subsoils on mid slopes to yellow subsoil on lower slopes north west as shown in fig 1 d the elevation is highest in the south east but falls away gradually to the north west 2 2 digital data collection and co location the digital data considered includes acquisition from a proximally sensed em instrument γ ray spectrometer and elevation from a gps a dualem 421 mississauga ontario canada was used to collect eca briefly the instrument has a transmitter coil located at one end it also includes a series of horizontal co planar hcp and perpendicular prp receiver array pairs the distance between the transmitter to the hcp receivers are 1 2 and 4 m and because the instrument operates at a low frequency 9 khz these spacings give a theoretical depth of exploration doe of 0 1 5 m 1mhcon 0 3 0 m 2mhcon and 0 6 0 m 4mhcon respectively the distance between the transmitter and prp coils are 1 1 2 1 and 4 1 m which gives theoretical doe of 0 0 5 m 1mpcon 0 1 0 m 2mpcon and 0 2 0 m 4mpcon respectively a radiation solutions rs 700 radiation solutions mississauga ontario canada measurement device was used to collect γ ray spectrometry data from a radiation solutions crystal pack rsx 1 the crystal pack which is coated with nai measures the γ rays being emitted from radioelements and energy windows including potassium k 1 37 1 57 mev uranium u 1 66 1 86 mev thorium th 2 41

digital data was collected along 42 transects the transects were 12 m apart the dualem 421s was strapped onto a pvc sled and towed behind a tractor with a novatel smartv1 gps novatel inc hexagon calgary alberta canada antenna used to provide positional information the rsx 1 crystal pack was situated in front of the same tractor and held approximately 1 5 m off the ground within a pre fabricated aluminum frame a toughbook cf 19 panasonic kadoma osaka japan was used to collect γ ray data using rs software radiation solutions mississauga ontario canada a radiation solutions gps antenna was used to provide positional information the coordinates were later converted into easting and northing utm 84 both eca and gps data were collected using a panasonic toughbook cf 19 and logged using hgis v 10 5 software starpal inc fort collins colorado usa the total number of γ ray 11 331 and eca 11 415 was approximately equal to co locate the digital data all three data i e γ ray eca and elevation were interpolated onto the same 5 5 m grid using local ordinary kriging using vesper v2 0 australian centre for precision agriculture software minasny et al 2005 and considering 20 30 neighbours 2 3 soil sampling and laboratory analysis a soil sampling campaign was undertaken and included the collection of soil samples from 52 locations on an approximately regular grid with samples taken at spacing of 70 m fig 1 b shows the location of the soil samples soil samples were collected at 0 3 m depth increments and from topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m the samples were air dried crushed and sieved 2 mm laboratory analysis involved determination of soil physical properties including soil particle size fractions e g clay silt and sand and based on the hydrometer method beretta et al 2014 various chemical properties were also determined including the ph from a 1 part soil to 5 part water extract ph1 5 the soil electrical conductivity was similarly determined from this extract ec1 5 ms m 1 subsequently ece ds m 1 was estimated from ec1 5 using conversion factor for various soil textures determined from the australian soil texture triangle and as adopted from slavich and petterson 1993 by the department of primary industries as follows clay ec1 5 6 7 clay loam 8 6 and sandy clay loam 9 5 tucker s 1974 method was used to determine the cec cmol kg 1 using a mechanical leaching device briefly samples were washed with 60 ethanol to remove any soluble salts followed by extraction with 1 m nh4cl the extracts were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the exchangeable cations determine were summed to estimate the cec a pressure plate was used to determine fc and pwp cresswell et al 2008 the samples were left to equilibrate several days before determination of gravimetric moisture content w conversion into θ was achieved using an estimate of bulk density ρ g cm 3 and considering the following pedo transfer function ptf to calculate ρ from particle size analysis data and depth 1 ρ g cm 3 1813 6 111 27 log depth m 4 949 clay silt 1000 this pedotransfer function was suggested and used by minasny et al 2006 to predict soil organic carbon from soil organic matter in the edgeroi district 2 4 multiple linear regression mlr modelling and interpolation a multiple linear regression mlr model of the form 2 y β 0 β 1 w 0 β 2 w 1 β 3 w 2 ε where y is vector of the target property i e fc and pwp and w k represent the kth predictor digital data e g eca while β 0 is the intercept β is the slope and ɛ is the model s residual to develop a mlr model between the various sources of digital data and for example fc 0 0 3 m the following mlr model was fitted 3 fc 0 0 3 m

model parameters to find the best set of digital data as predictors the fixed effects were determined prior to model building and by using backwards elimination until all predictors had a probability of being selected 0 05 2 5 validation and evaluating prediction accuracy bias and concordance herein a leave one site out cross validation is used to validate our fc and pwp prediction this was done owing to a limited number of sample sites specifically we removed a whole site including all depths a model was fitted using the remaining calibration dataset of 51 sites and applied to the site removed this was done 52 times several indices which measure prediction accuracy i e root mean square error rmse were considered with respect to measured and predicted fc and pwp the rmse was calculated as follows 4 rmse 1 n t 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 and considering the measured y i and predicted y ˆ i number n of data if a rmse value is small i e close to 0 the greater is the prediction accuracy similarly unbiased predictions have me near zero the lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin s concordance is also used as a measure of the agreement between measured and predicted pwp and fc specifically how close do the predictions fall along a 45 degree line lin 1989 and is calculated using the following equation 5 lin s concordance 2 ρ σ y σ y ˆ σ y 2 σ y ˆ 2 μ y μ y ˆ 2 where σ y and σ y ˆ are corresponding variances ρ is the correlation coefficient pearson s r between measured and predicted data and μ y and μ y ˆ are means for measured and predicted data mcbride 2005 described the agreement classes as almost perfect 0 9 substantial 0 8 0 9 moderate 0 65 0 8 and poor 0 65 agreement with the intention of providing a better indication of trade off between bias and variance in the models the akaike information criterion aic was calculated because it delivers a balance between goodness of fit and the number of parameters used in prediction of fc or pwp and calculated from the residual sum of squares r as follows 6 aic n ln r 2 p where n is the number of prediction points and p the number of parameters in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary data analysis table 1 a shows the summary statistics of the digital data collected in terms of eca the 1mpcon had the smallest mean 10 ms m 1 followed by 2mpcon 21 ms m 1 with the deeper measuring hcon generally larger than equivalent pcon the smallest cv was for 1mhcon 37 and this indicates all eca had high cv wilding 1985 the 1mhcon 0 3 2mhcon 0 3 and 4mhcon 0 2 were all normally distributed 0 5 with 1mpcon 0 8 2mpcon 0 7 and 4mpcon 0 4 slightly skewed 0 5 1 0 in comparison the γ ray data had small cv 15 in particular tc u and th 7 with the skewness normally distributed for k 0 1 u 0 and th 0 5 table 1 b shows the summary statistics of the digital data at the 52 soil sample locations where the digital data had equivalent summary statistics to that collected in the field table 2 shows the summary statistics of the various soil properties in terms of average clay the topsoil 61 was largest and decreased with increasing depth with subsurface 59 and subsoil 55 also large clay the sand increased with depth e g topsoil mean 28 with the silt content generally small e g topsoil mean 11 at all depths on average the soil texture was heavy clay in the topsoil grading into a medium clay in the subsoil with increasing depth average ph increased from slightly acidic ph1 5 in the topsoil 6 90 to slightly alkaline in the subsoil 7 81 at all depths the average salinity was slightly saline e g topsoil 2 39 ds m 1 moreover average cec decreased with increasing depth and was indicative of high clay i e 30 cmol kg 1 with moderate shrink swell capacity and structural resilience 3 2 correlation coefficient between soil and digital data table 3 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between measured soil properties at all depths according to moore and kirkland 2007 the fc and pwp were moderately 0 5 r2 0 7 correlated with each other with respect to the remaining soil properties fc 0 53 and pwp 0 41 were moderately and weakly 0 3 r2 0 5 correlated with clay respectively while the r2 between fc and pwp were statistically significant with other soil properties they were all very weak r2 0 3 table 4 shows the r2 between measured soil properties and digital data at the 52 soil sampling locations while many of the soil properties were statistically correlated with fc the r2 were generally weak in the topsoil table 4 a shows fc was weakly correlated with 2mpcon 0 35 and tc 0 36 table 4 b shows subsurface fc was strongly r2 0 70 correlated moore and kirkland 2007 with 2mpcon 0 71 and moderately correlated with 4mpcon 0 68 and weakly correlated with tc 0 13 table 4 c shows subsoil fc was moderately correlated with 2mpcon 0 62 and again weakly correlated with tc 0 13 table 4 also shows equivalent correlations between pwp and equivalent digital data described above however the correlations were generally weaker 3 3 spatial distribution of digital data fig 1 e shows the spatial distribution of 2mpcon which was large 25 ms m 1 in the northern part and in the lower landscape positions 360 m the 2mpcon was also large in a continuous belt which extends along the southern boundary to the southeast corner and through a large section in the center and represent the location of the clay rich 35 vertosols associated with the second terraced fan of local alluvium triantafilis et al 2001 in between these large values the 2mpcon decreases rapidly to intermediate small 10 15 ms m 1 and small 10 ms m 1 these areas represent the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone triantafilis et al 2001 fig 1 f shows the spatial distribution of tc which was largest 410 cps along the eastern margin and associated with the highest elevation 375 m this was close to the contact with the pilliga sandstone foothills from here and down the slope toward the northeast the tc generally decreased gradually where at the lower slope positions i e 360 m the tc was small 350 cps 3 4 multiple linear regression mlr vs stepwise mlr table 5 a shows the mlr summary statistics considering all digital data used to predict topsoil fc specifically it shows that the coefficient of determination r2 0 59 was moderate with the adj r2 smaller 0 44 the analysis of variance showed the rmse was 0 045 m3 m 3 with the aic 147 moreover only the 1mhcon 0 046 and 2mpcon 0 0491 were significant p 0 05 statistically not shown table 5 a also shows the stepwise mlr summary statistics considering only the statistically significant digital data including 2mpcon 0 0001 northing 0 0003 t c 0 0014 1mpcon 0 0280 and 1mhcon 0 0196 this was determined using a forward sequential stepwise mlr variable selection procedure with significance level of 0 25 set as probability to enter and 0 05 to remove sas 2012 the digital data the r2 0 57 while moderate was smaller than the mlr but the adj r2 was larger 0 52 the analysis of variance showed the rmse 0 042 and aic 171 were also smaller given the stepwise mlr outperformed mlr the former was used to predict fc table 5 b shows the model summary statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsurface fc considering the statistically significant 2mpcon 0 0001 and k 0 0375 the r2 0 74 was strong and much larger than for the topsoil with the adj r2 also larger 0 73 however the analysis of variance showed the rmse 0 054 and aic 150 were both larger than the topsoil fc stepwise mlr table 5 c shows the model statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsoil fc considering the statistically significant northing 0 0003 1mpcon 0 0022 2mhcon 0 0098 tc 0 0190 and 2mpcon 0 0485 the r2 0 73 was again strong with adj r2 larger 0 70 than the topsoil and equivalent to subsurface the analysis of variance showed rmse 0 058 and aic 116 were also larger than the topsoil and subsurface these statistics indicate that with increasing depth the stepwise mlr models have better correlations but larger rmse table 6 a shows the model summary statistics for the mlr and forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict topsoil pwp considering the statistically significant tc 0 0001 1mpcon 0 0001 and northing 0 0109 interestingly the tc was the most statistically significant digital data nevertheless and as for the topsoil fc the mlr model to predict pwp had a moderate r2 0 69 which was larger than to predict topsoil fc moreover it was larger than the r2 0 57 for the stepwise mlr model to predict topsoil fc likewise the adj r2 was larger 0 62 for the stepwise mlr the analysis of variance also showed that the stepwise mlr had rmse 0 042 and aic 168 comparable with the topsoil fc 0 42 and 171 stepwise mlr table 6 b shows the model summary statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsurface pwp considering the statistically significant 2mpcon 0 0001 k 0 002 and 1mpcon 0 367 the r2 0 71 was strong and larger than for the topsoil with the adj r2 also larger 0 68 the analysis of variance showed the rmse 0 046 and aic 163 were also both larger than the topsoil pwp stepwise mlr table 6 c shows the model statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsoil pwp considering only easting 0 0129 1mpcon 0 0004 northing 0 0007 4mhcon 0 0025 and 2mpcon 0 0144 the r2 0 73 was strong and adj r2 was larger 0 69 than topsoil and equivalent to subsurface the analysis of variance again showed rmse 0 049 and aic 153 were larger than the topsoil these statistics indicate with increasing depth the stepwise mlr have better correlations but larger rmse the results achieved herein are comparable to the results achieved by gooley et al 2014 who aimed to develop a calibration between proximal sensed eca e g em38 and remote sensed γ ray data across two large irrigated cotton growing areas of the lower macquarie valley they also found that using stepwise mlr was superior to model a relationship between average 0 0 9 m fc adj r2 0 55 and pwp adj r2 0 47 than mlr their calibration relationships were at the lower end of moderate and weak and were not as strong as herein this was attributable to the pwp and fc data being averaged over three depths i e 0 0 9 m and that the γ ray data was not point based but encompassed a large footprint owing to being measured from an aircraft 3 5 model agreement fc and pwp fig 2 shows the measured versus predicted agreement using the stepwise mlr models fig 2 a shows the results for fc overall and considering all three depths combined the agreement lin s concordance 0 80 was substantial with agreement also moderate when considering only the topsoil 0 79 but it was substantial when considering only the subsurface 0 83 and subsoil 0 84 fc alone it should be noted that the range in predicted topsoil fc was smallest 0 23 m3 m 3 with the range in subsoil fc 0 47 m3 m 3 largest fig 2 b shows the results for pwp which were also moderate 0 79 considering all three depths combined with agreement moderate in the topsoil 0 72 and again substantial in the subsurface 0 85 and subsoil 0 84 pwp again the range in predicted topsoil pwp was smallest 0 24 m3 m 3 with the range in subsoil pwp 0 37 m3 m 3 largest these results were attributable to the generally better correlation coefficients in the subsurface and subsoil 3 6 digital soil maps fc and pwp fig 3 a shows the digital soil map dsm of predicted topsoil fc using the stepwise mlr in the northern part and in the lower landscape positions 360 m topsoil fc was intermediate large 0 4 0 45 m3 m 3 or large 0 45 m3 m 3 the fc was also large and or intermediate large in a continuous belt that extended along the southern boundary to the southeast corner and through a large section in the center these values of fc are what would be expected for clay soil gardiner and miller 2004 and represent the location of the vertosols associated with the second terraced fan of local alluvium in between these large values predicted fc decreases to intermediate small 0 3 0 35 m3 m 3 and small 0 30 m3 m 3 with the latter representing the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone fig 3 d shows the associated 95 confidence interval ci was generally small 0 04 m3 m 3 across the whole field and for a wide range of fc there were a few areas where the ci was intermediate small 0 04 0 06 m3 m 3 and larger this was most evident in the lower lying area in the northern central part of the field where the fc was also intermediate small or small we attribute this to the fact that as shown in the spatial distribution of 2mpcon fig 1e and tc fig 1f both digital data exhibited different short scale variation with respect to the former its variation was in the effect of a halo radiating out from small values whereas the latter showed a trend of increasing values from north to south other areas with equivalent ci were apparent in small contiguous areas and in the southern corner in particular where the largest ci 0 1 m3 m 3 was associated with the drainage line where the largest values of fc 0 45 m3 m 3 were predicted we attribute these values of ci to the edge effect and the short scale variation associated with the narrow band of 2mpcon in this location but also because the tc varied in a different way to the eca fig 3 b shows the dsm of predicted subsurface fc was equivalent with the main difference being the greater extent of predicted large and small fc fig 3 c which shows the dsm of predicted subsoil fc shows that the intermediate large or large fc in the center was generally equivalent to topsoil predicted fc with the extent of small fc much larger than in the topsoil and subsurface owing to the greater rmse of the stepwise mlr with increasing depth the ci while generally exhibiting the same spatial pattern as for the topsoil showed progressively large ci values with the subsoil having the greatest extent of large ci 0 1 m3 m 3 this was evident in the southern corner and in a small area in the north and western corners in all instances this was associated with areas where fc was large 0 45 m3 m 3 and because the eca e g 2mpcon and γ ray e g tc data varied in different ways moreover it was also a function of the short scale variation in both digital data and the proximity of these areas to the edges of the field nevertheless and for either depth the dsm of fc showed similar patterns to the measured eca because the statistically significant digital data used in the stepwise mlr was the eca data e g 2mpcon in the topsoil and subsurface fig 4 a shows the dsm of predicted topsoil pwp using the stepwise mlr the spatial distribution of predicted topsoil pwp did not generally conform to that shown in fig 3 a c for predicted fc this was because the most statistically significant digital data was tc as such the predicted pwp reflected the spatial distribution of tc the ci was generally small across the whole field however with increasing proximity to the field edges the ci increased to intermediate small fig 4 b and c shows respectively the dsm of predicted subsurface and subsoil pwp using the stepwise mlr the spatial patterns were equivalent to the patterns shown for the fc however and as expected the predicted pwp were smaller the ci was also generally smaller across the whole field compared to the subsurface and subsoil fc ci we attribute these results to the fact that the rmse of the stepwise mlr models developed to predicted pwp had a smaller rmse as compared with those developed to predict fc 3 7 digital soil map of awc fig 5 shows the digital soil map dsm of awc m3 m 3 at three depths and predicted by subtracting the predicted pwp shown in fig 4 from predicted fc shown in fig 3 fig 5 a shows the dsm of topsoil awc 0 3 m3 m 3 was largest adjacent to the southern margin of the field these values of awc are indicative of large clay content gardiner and miller 2004 soil like the vertosols which characterize the second terraced fan of local alluvium in the study field the vertosols herein were deposited in what appears to be a former drainage line located between the pilliga sandstone foothill to the south and another foothill in the eastern part of this field a similar line or area of intermediate large 0 25 0 3 m3 m 3 subsurface and subsoil awc were evident in fig 5 b and c respectively and which show a second drainage line in an easterly direction fig 5 a also shows the smallest 0 15 m3 m 3 topsoil awc was interspersed between the vertosols and indicative of loamy soil textures of the pilliga sandstone soil fig 5 b and c shows the dsm of subsurface and subsoil awc respectively which more clearly align with the eca data and which better discern the clay rich vertosols and the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone in terms of the latter and as suggested by gardiner and miller 2004 these predicted awc are in line with loamy sand 0 08 0 09 m3 m 3 sandy loam 0 12 0 14 m3 m 3 loam 0 13 m3 m 3 4 conclusions the aim of this study was to develop dsm of the fc and pwp in the topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m across a dryland cotton farm using digital data i e eca γ ray spectrometry elevation and positional data a comparison of two modelling approaches mlr and stepwise mlr showed that for both fc and pwp the stepwise mlr was superior at most depths compared to the mlr approach because the adj r2 was larger for example the adj r2 of mlr for prediction of topsoil fc was smaller 0 44 than the stepwise mlr 0 52 which included only the statistically significant digital data i e 2mpcon northing t c 1mpcon and 1mhcon the final dsm of fc and pwp and by difference the dsm of awc for each depth increment were indicative of the two main geomorphological geological units which characterized the study field specifically the larger awc 0 3 m3 m 3 were associated with the southern margin of the field and other areas associated with various drainage lines where the vertosols are characterized by large clay content gardiner and miller 2004 and define areas of the field of the second terraced fan of local alluvium conversely the smallest 0 15 m3 m 3 awc was interspersed between the vertosols and indicative of the loamy soil textures of the pilliga sandstone owing to the short scale variation and the fact that the local alluvium and pilliga sandsone were close together and the fact that the digital data varied in different ways large ci values were evident where these areas were juxtaposed nevertheless the results here are an advance and more accurate than those achieve by gooley et al 2014 who created dsm of predicted average rootzone 0 0 9 m fc and pwp with moderate to weak precision r2 0 56 and 0 46 across two predominantly areas southeast of warren and trangie macquarie valley herein our results were superior owing to the fact that we collected in both instances digital data i e eca and γ ray which were proximal and collected on detailed transects spaced only 12 m apart and on the same day in gooley et al 2014 while they used proximal sensed eca i e em38 and em34 3 γ ray and dem data were acquired from a remote sensed platform i e airborne in the case of the former the data was collected on an approximate 0 5 1 km grid whereas the latter was collected on transects spaced 400 m apart

were collected along with elevation using a grid based sampling design 52 soil sample locations were selected and sampled topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m in the laboratory the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp were determined using a pressure plate apparatus the digital and soil i e fc and pwp data were then calibrated with multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise mlr models compared for each depth e g adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 the stepwise mlr were shown to be superior subsequently the dsm of fc and pwp were examined in terms of prediction agreement lin s concordance leave one out cross validation results showed substantial 1 1 agreement between measured and predicted fc 0 80 and pwp 0 79 at all depths the final dsms of fc and pwp and by difference awc were indicative of the two main geomorphological geological units with large awc 0 3 m3 m 3 associated with the clay rich vertosols and small awc 0 15 m3 m 3 the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone owing to the short scale variation and the fact that the local alluvium and pilliga sandstone were close together and the fact that the digital data varied in different ways larger confidence interval ci values were evident where these areas were juxtaposed nevertheless the final dsm allows the farmer to better manage awc keywords digital soil mapping electromagnetic induction gamma ray spectrometry soil available water content field capacity permanent wilting point 1 introduction the australian cotton industry is predominantly irrigated however approximately 10 is grown under dryland conditions a fundamental management decision for dryland farmers is determining planting time with a critical factor influencing whether to plant or not being amount of stored moisture because it can help dryland farmers optimize row spacing moreover information about field capacity i e fc maximum water stored and permanent wilting point i e pwp minimum moisture at which a plant wilts is required this is particularly the case for vertosols which characteristically have 35 clay content while these heavy clays have large fc i e 0 32 θ 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the available water holding capacity awc is constrained by the pwp also being large i e 0 20 θ 0 24 cm3cm 3 gardiner and miller 2004 therefore knowing the awc can help farmers make management decisions about planting time and row spacing the determination of the awc is usually determined in the laboratory using either pressure plate cresswell et al 2008 hanging column filter paper leong et al 2002 evaporation or vapour equilibration nam et al 2010 methods in field measurements include the use of a tensiometer or resistance blocks however these methods are time consuming and only provide point source information because the awc has been shown to be a function of soil texture mccutcheon et al 2006 and because the various soil particle size fractions vary spatially muzzamal et al 2018 there is the potential to use a digital soil mapping dsm approach to provide this information specifically digital data has been correlated with particle size fractions and mapped at the field weller et al 2007 farm khongnawang et al 2019 and district mora vallejo et al 2008 scale to map particle size fractions electromagnetic em induction instruments have commonly been used because they measure apparent soil electrical conductivity eca which has been shown to be influenced by clay e g saey et al 2011 moreover other properties that influence awc including cation exchange capacity cec zhao et al 2020 mineralogy nagra et al 2017 and organic matter huang et al 2017 have also been mapped more recently gamma ray γ ray spectrometry data has been used to map clay arshad et al 2020 cec cec li et al 2018 and infer mineralogy differences triantafilis et al 2013 with respect to dsm of awc gooley et al 2014 used a stepwise multiple linear regression stepwise mlr to predict average rootzone 0 0 9 m fc and pwp using ground based em and airborne γ ray data at the district scale 40 000 ha recently research has also shown that environmental indices from remote sensed platforms e g landsat 7 airborne γ ray can be used to map awc at district malone et al 2009 country hong et al 2013 and continental padarian et al 2014 scales however these dsm cannot be used by farmers to make decisions owing to issues of spectral and spatial resolution the aim of this study was to demonstrate how a dsm approach could be used to predict fc and pwp and by difference estimate awc at the field scale in the topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m in the first instance fc and pwp were determined using pressure plate apparatus a multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise mlr were developed between soil

accuracy rmse with prediction agreement lin s concordance of the dsm of fc and pwp compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study field is 23 ha in size and located within a commercial farm 370 m above sea level 30 06 30 s 149 55 35 e which is near narrabri in new south wales australia fig 1a the climate is semi arid with a mean annual rainfall of 643 mm and potential evaporation over 1800 mm the rainfall is summer dominant with a mean maximum in january 79 8 mm and minimum in august 37 5 mm dryland cotton is the main cash crop and is grown in summer wheat is grown in the winter with chick peas and other crops grown in rotation the study field is located to the east of edgeroi and lies on the foot slopes of the nandewar range specifically it lies between the couradda national park to the north and the bobbiwaa state conservation area to the south the footslopes are underlain by pilliga sandstone with the study field soil derived from second terraced fan of local alluvium triantafilis et al 2001 the soil of the study field is predominantly vertosol variations in subsoil colour occur from red brown subsoils on upper slopes south east and associated with pilliga sandstone to dark grey subsoils on mid slopes to yellow subsoil on lower slopes north west as shown in fig 1 d the elevation is highest in the south east but falls away gradually to the north west 2 2 digital data collection and co location the digital data considered includes acquisition from a proximally sensed em instrument γ ray spectrometer and elevation from a gps a dualem 421 mississauga ontario canada was used to collect eca briefly the instrument has a transmitter coil located at one end it also includes a series of horizontal co planar hcp and perpendicular prp receiver array pairs the distance between the transmitter to the hcp receivers are 1 2 and 4 m and because the instrument operates at a low frequency 9 khz these spacings give a theoretical depth of exploration doe of 0 1 5 m 1mhcon 0 3 0 m 2mhcon and 0 6 0 m 4mhcon respectively the distance between the transmitter and prp coils are 1 1 2 1 and 4 1 m which gives theoretical doe of 0 0 5 m 1mpcon 0 1 0 m 2mpcon and 0 2

digital data was collected along 42 transects the transects were 12 m apart the dualem 421s was strapped onto a pvc sled and towed behind a tractor with a novatel smartv1 gps novatel inc hexagon calgary alberta canada antenna used to provide positional information the rsx 1 crystal pack was situated in front of the same tractor and held approximately 1 5 m off the ground within a pre fabricated aluminum frame a toughbook cf 19 panasonic kadoma osaka japan was used to collect γ ray data using rs software radiation solutions mississauga ontario canada a radiation solutions gps antenna was used to provide positional information the coordinates were later converted into easting and northing utm 84 both eca and gps data were collected using a panasonic toughbook cf 19 and logged using hgis v 10 5 software starpal inc fort collins colorado usa the total number of γ ray 11 331 and eca 11 415 was approximately equal to co locate the digital data all three data i e γ ray eca and elevation were interpolated onto the same 5 5 m grid using local ordinary kriging using vesper v2 0 australian centre for precision agriculture software minasny et al 2005 and considering 20 30 neighbours 2 3 soil sampling and laboratory analysis a soil sampling campaign was undertaken and included the collection of soil samples from 52 locations on an approximately regular grid with samples taken at spacing of 70 m fig 1 b shows the location of the soil samples soil samples were collected at 0 3 m depth increments and from topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m the samples were air dried crushed and sieved 2 mm laboratory analysis involved determination of soil physical properties including soil particle size fractions e g clay silt and sand and based on the hydrometer method beretta et al 2014 various chemical properties were also determined including the ph from a 1 part soil to 5 part water extract ph1 5 the soil electrical conductivity was similarly determined from this extract ec1 5 ms m 1 subsequently ece ds m 1 was estimated from ec1 5 using conversion factor for various soil textures determined from the australian soil texture triangle and as adopted from slavich and petterson 1993 by the department of primary industries as follows clay ec1 5 6 7 clay loam 8 6 and sandy clay loam 9 5 tucker s 1974 method was used to determine the cec cmol kg 1 using a mechanical leaching device briefly samples were washed with 60 ethanol to remove any soluble salts followed by extraction with 1 m nh4cl the extracts were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the exchangeable cations determine were summed to estimate the cec a pressure plate was used to determine fc and pwp cresswell et al 2008 the samples were left to equilibrate several days before determination of gravimetric moisture content w conversion into θ was achieved using an estimate of bulk density ρ g cm 3 and considering the following pedo transfer function ptf to calculate ρ from particle size analysis data and depth 1 ρ g cm 3 1813 6 111 27 log depth m 4 949 clay silt 1000 this pedotransfer function was suggested and used by minasny et al 2006 to predict soil organic carbon from soil organic matter in the edgeroi district 2 4 multiple linear regression mlr modelling and interpolation a multiple linear regression mlr model of the form 2 y β 0 β 1 w 0 β 2 w 1 β 3 w 2 ε where y is vector of the target property i e fc and pwp and w k represent the kth predictor digital data e g eca while β 0 is the intercept β is the slope and ɛ is the model s residual to develop a mlr model between the various sources of digital data and for example fc 0 0 3 m the following mlr model was fitted 3 fc 0 0 3 m

model parameters to find the best set of digital data as predictors the fixed effects were determined prior to model building and by using backwards elimination until all predictors had a probability of being selected 0 05 2 5 validation and evaluating prediction accuracy bias and concordance herein a leave one site out cross validation is used to validate our fc and pwp prediction this was done owing to a limited number of sample sites specifically we removed a whole site including all depths a model was fitted using the remaining calibration dataset of 51 sites and applied to the site removed this was done 52 times several indices which measure prediction accuracy i e root mean square error rmse were considered with respect to measured and predicted fc and pwp the rmse was calculated as follows 4 rmse 1 n t 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 and considering the measured y i and predicted y ˆ i number n of data if a rmse value is small i e close to 0 the greater is the prediction accuracy similarly unbiased predictions have me near zero the lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin s concordance is also used as a measure of the agreement between measured and predicted pwp and fc specifically how close do the predictions fall along a 45 degree line lin 1989 and is calculated using the following equation 5 lin s concordance 2 ρ σ y σ y ˆ σ y 2 σ y ˆ 2 μ y μ y ˆ 2 where σ y and σ y ˆ are corresponding variances ρ is the correlation coefficient pearson s r between measured and predicted data and μ y and μ y ˆ are means for measured and predicted data mcbride 2005 described the agreement classes as almost perfect 0 9 substantial 0 8 0 9 moderate 0 65 0 8 and poor 0 65 agreement with the intention of providing a better indication of trade off between bias and variance in the models the akaike information criterion aic was calculated because it delivers a balance between goodness of fit and the number of parameters used in prediction of fc or pwp and calculated from the residual sum of squares r as follows 6 aic n ln r 2 p where n is the number of prediction points and p the number of parameters in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary data analysis table 1 a shows the summary statistics of the digital data collected in terms of eca the 1mpcon had the smallest mean 10 ms m 1 followed by 2mpcon 21 ms m 1 with the deeper measuring hcon generally larger than equivalent pcon the smallest cv was for 1mhcon 37 and this indicates all eca had high cv wilding 1985 the 1mhcon 0 3 2mhcon 0 3 and 4mhcon 0 2 were all normally distributed 0 5 with 1mpcon 0 8 2mpcon 0 7 and 4mpcon 0 4 slightly skewed 0 5 1 0 in comparison the γ ray data had small cv 15 in particular tc u and th 7 with the skewness normally distributed for k 0 1 u 0 and th 0 5 table 1 b shows the summary statistics of the digital data at the 52 soil sample locations where the digital data had equivalent summary statistics to that collected in the field table 2 shows the summary statistics of the various soil properties in terms of average clay the topsoil 61 was largest and decreased with increasing depth with subsurface 59 and subsoil 55 also large clay the sand increased with depth e g topsoil mean 28 with the silt content generally small e g topsoil mean 11 at all depths on average the soil texture was heavy clay in the topsoil grading into a medium clay in the subsoil with increasing depth average ph increased from slightly acidic ph1 5 in the topsoil 6 90 to slightly alkaline in the subsoil 7 81 at all depths the average salinity was slightly saline e g topsoil 2 39 ds m 1 moreover average cec decreased with increasing depth and was indicative of high clay i e 30 cmol kg 1 with moderate shrink swell capacity and structural resilience 3 2 correlation coefficient between soil and digital data table 3 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between measured soil properties at all depths according to moore and kirkland 2007 the fc and pwp were moderately 0 5 r2 0 7 correlated with each other with respect to the remaining soil properties fc 0 53 and pwp 0 41 were moderately and weakly 0 3 r2 0 5 correlated with clay respectively while the r2 between fc and pwp were statistically significant with other soil properties they were all very weak r2 0 3 table 4 shows the r2 between measured soil properties and digital data at the 52 soil sampling locations while many of the soil properties were statistically correlated with fc the r2 were generally weak in the topsoil table 4 a shows fc was weakly correlated with 2mpcon 0 35 and tc 0 36 table 4 b shows subsurface fc was strongly r2 0 70 correlated moore and kirkland 2007 with 2mpcon 0 71 and moderately correlated with 4mpcon 0 68 and weakly correlated with tc 0 13 table 4 c shows subsoil fc was moderately correlated with 2mpcon 0 62 and again weakly correlated with tc 0 13 table 4 also shows equivalent correlations between pwp and equivalent digital data described above however the correlations were generally weaker 3 3 spatial distribution of digital data fig 1 e shows the spatial distribution of 2mpcon which was large 25 ms m 1 in the northern part and in the lower landscape positions 360 m the 2mpcon was also large in a continuous belt which extends along the southern boundary to the southeast corner and through a large section in the center and represent the location of the clay rich 35 vertosols associated with the second terraced fan of local alluvium triantafilis et al 2001 in between these large values the 2mpcon decreases rapidly to intermediate small 10 15 ms m 1 and small 10 ms m 1 these areas represent the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone triantafilis et al 2001 fig 1 f shows the spatial distribution of tc which was largest 410 cps along the eastern margin and associated with the highest elevation 375 m this was close to the contact with the pilliga sandstone foothills from here and down the slope toward the northeast the tc generally decreased gradually where at the lower slope positions i e 360 m the tc was small 350 cps 3 4 multiple linear regression mlr vs stepwise mlr table 5 a shows the mlr summary statistics considering all digital data used to predict topsoil fc specifically it shows that the coefficient of determination r2 0 59 was moderate with the adj r2 smaller 0 44 the analysis of variance showed the rmse was 0 045 m3 m 3 with the aic 147 moreover only the 1mhcon 0 046 and 2mpcon 0 0491 were significant p 0 05 statistically not shown table 5 a also shows the stepwise mlr summary statistics considering only the statistically significant digital data including 2mpcon 0 0001 northing 0 0003 t c 0 0014 1mpcon 0 0280 and 1mhcon 0 0196 this was determined using a forward sequential stepwise mlr variable selection procedure with significance level of 0 25 set as probability to enter and 0 05 to remove sas 2012 the digital data the r2 0 57 while moderate was smaller than the mlr but the adj r2 was larger 0 52 the analysis of variance showed the rmse 0 042 and aic 171 were also smaller given the stepwise mlr outperformed mlr the former was used to predict fc table 5 b shows the model summary statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsurface fc considering the statistically significant 2mpcon 0 0001 and k 0 0375 the r2 0 74 was strong and much larger than for the topsoil with the adj r2 also larger 0 73 however the analysis of variance showed the rmse 0 054 and aic 150 were both larger than the topsoil fc stepwise mlr table 5 c shows the model statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsoil fc considering the statistically significant northing 0 0003 1mpcon 0 0022 2mhcon 0 0098 tc 0 0190 and 2mpcon 0 0485 the r2 0 73 was again strong with adj r2 larger 0 70 than the topsoil and equivalent to subsurface the analysis of variance showed rmse 0 058 and aic 116 were also larger than the topsoil and subsurface these statistics indicate that with increasing depth the stepwise mlr models have better correlations but larger rmse table 6 a shows the model summary statistics for the mlr and forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict topsoil pwp considering the statistically significant tc 0 0001 1mpcon 0 0001 and northing 0 0109 interestingly the tc was the most statistically significant digital data nevertheless and as for the topsoil fc the mlr model to predict pwp had a moderate r2 0 69 which was larger than to predict topsoil fc moreover it was larger than the r2 0 57 for the stepwise mlr model to predict topsoil fc likewise the adj r2 was larger 0 62 for the stepwise mlr the analysis of variance also showed that the stepwise mlr had rmse 0 042 and aic 168 comparable with the topsoil fc 0 42 and 171 stepwise mlr table 6 b shows the model summary statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsurface pwp considering the statistically significant 2mpcon 0 0001 k 0 002 and 1mpcon 0 367 the r2 0 71 was strong and larger than for the topsoil with the adj r2 also larger 0 68 the analysis of variance showed the rmse 0 046 and aic 163 were also both larger than the topsoil pwp stepwise mlr table 6 c shows the model statistics for the forward sequential stepwise mlr to predict subsoil pwp considering only easting 0 0129 1mpcon 0 0004 northing 0 0007 4mhcon 0 0025 and 2mpcon 0 0144 the r2 0 73 was strong and adj r2 was larger 0 69 than topsoil and equivalent to subsurface the analysis of variance again showed rmse 0 049 and aic 153 were larger than the topsoil these statistics indicate with increasing depth the stepwise mlr have better correlations but larger rmse the results achieved herein are comparable to the results achieved by gooley et al 2014 who aimed to develop a calibration between proximal sensed eca e g em38 and remote sensed γ ray data across two large irrigated cotton growing areas of the lower macquarie valley they also found that using stepwise mlr was superior to model a relationship between average 0 0 9 m fc adj r2 0 55 and pwp adj r2 0 47 than mlr their calibration relationships were at the lower end of moderate and weak and were not as strong as herein this was attributable to the pwp and fc data being averaged over three depths i e 0 0 9 m and that the γ ray data was not point based but encompassed a large footprint owing to being measured from an aircraft 3 5 model agreement fc and pwp fig 2 shows the measured versus predicted agreement using the stepwise mlr models fig 2 a shows the results for fc overall and considering all three depths combined the agreement lin s concordance 0 80 was substantial with agreement also moderate when considering only the topsoil 0 79 but it was substantial when considering only the subsurface 0 83 and subsoil 0 84 fc alone it should be noted that the range in predicted topsoil fc was smallest 0 23 m3 m 3 with the range in subsoil fc 0 47 m3 m 3 largest fig 2 b shows the results for pwp which were also moderate 0 79 considering all three depths combined with agreement moderate in the topsoil 0 72 and again substantial in the subsurface 0 85 and subsoil 0 84 pwp again the range in predicted topsoil pwp was smallest 0 24 m3 m 3 with the range in subsoil pwp 0 37 m3 m 3 largest these results were attributable to the generally better correlation coefficients in the subsurface and subsoil 3 6 digital soil maps fc and pwp fig 3 a shows the digital soil map dsm of predicted topsoil fc using the stepwise mlr in the northern part and in the lower landscape positions 360 m topsoil fc was intermediate large 0 4 0 45 m3 m 3 or large 0 45 m3 m 3 the fc was also large and or intermediate large in a continuous belt that extended along the southern boundary to the southeast corner and through a large section in the center these values of fc are what would be expected for clay soil gardiner and miller 2004 and represent the location of the vertosols associated with the second terraced fan of local alluvium in between these large values predicted fc decreases to intermediate small 0 3 0 35 m3 m 3 and small 0 30 m3 m 3 with the latter representing the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone fig 3 d shows the associated 95 confidence interval ci was generally small 0 04 m3 m 3 across the whole field and for a wide range of fc there were a few areas where the ci was intermediate small 0 04 0 06 m3 m 3 and larger this was most evident in the lower lying area in the northern central part of the field where the fc was also intermediate small or small we attribute this to the fact that as shown in the spatial distribution of 2mpcon fig 1e and tc fig 1f both digital data exhibited different short scale variation with respect to the former its variation was in the effect of a halo radiating out from small values whereas the latter showed a trend of increasing values from north to south other areas with equivalent ci were apparent in small contiguous areas and in the southern corner in particular where the largest ci 0 1 m3 m 3 was associated with the drainage line where the largest values of fc 0 45 m3 m 3 were predicted we attribute these values of ci to the edge effect and the short scale variation associated with the narrow band of 2mpcon in this location but also because the tc varied in a different way to the eca fig 3 b shows the dsm of predicted subsurface fc was equivalent with the main difference being the greater extent of predicted large and small fc fig 3 c which shows the dsm of predicted subsoil fc shows that the intermediate large or large fc in the center was generally equivalent to topsoil predicted fc with the extent of small fc much larger than in the topsoil and subsurface owing to the greater rmse of the stepwise mlr with increasing depth the ci while generally exhibiting the same spatial pattern as for the topsoil showed progressively large ci values with the subsoil having the greatest extent of large ci 0 1 m3 m 3 this was evident in the southern corner and in a small area in the north and western corners in all instances this was associated with areas where fc was large 0 45 m3 m 3 and because the eca e g 2mpcon and γ ray e g tc data varied in different ways moreover it was also a function of the short scale variation in both digital data and the proximity of these areas to the edges of the field nevertheless and for either depth the dsm of fc showed similar patterns to the measured eca because the statistically significant digital data used in the stepwise mlr was the eca data e g 2mpcon in the topsoil and subsurface fig 4 a shows the dsm of predicted topsoil pwp using the stepwise mlr the spatial distribution of predicted topsoil pwp did not generally conform to that shown in fig 3 a c for predicted fc this was because the most statistically significant digital data was tc as such the predicted pwp reflected the spatial distribution of tc the ci was generally small across the whole field however with increasing proximity to the field edges the ci increased to intermediate small fig 4 b and c shows respectively the dsm of predicted subsurface and subsoil pwp using the stepwise mlr the spatial patterns were equivalent to the patterns shown for the fc however and as expected the predicted pwp were smaller the ci was also generally smaller across the whole field compared to the subsurface and subsoil fc ci we attribute these results to the fact that the rmse of the stepwise mlr models developed to predicted pwp had a smaller rmse as compared with those developed to predict fc 3 7 digital soil map of awc fig 5 shows the digital soil map dsm of awc m3 m 3 at three depths and predicted by subtracting the predicted pwp shown in fig 4 from predicted fc shown in fig 3 fig 5 a shows the dsm of topsoil awc 0 3 m3 m 3 was largest adjacent to the southern margin of the field these values of awc are indicative of large clay content gardiner and miller 2004 soil like the vertosols which characterize the second terraced fan of local alluvium in the study field the vertosols herein were deposited in what appears to be a former drainage line located between the pilliga sandstone foothill to the south and another foothill in the eastern part of this field a similar line or area of intermediate large 0 25 0 3 m3 m 3 subsurface and subsoil awc were evident in fig 5 b and c respectively and which show a second drainage line in an easterly direction fig 5 a also shows the smallest 0 15 m3 m 3 topsoil awc was interspersed between the vertosols and indicative of loamy soil textures of the pilliga sandstone soil fig 5 b and c shows the dsm of subsurface and subsoil awc respectively which more clearly align with the eca data and which better discern the clay rich vertosols and the loamy soil of the pilliga sandstone in terms of the latter and as suggested by gardiner and miller 2004 these predicted awc are in line with loamy sand 0 08 0 09 m3 m 3 sandy loam 0 12 0 14 m3 m 3 loam 0 13 m3 m 3 4 conclusions the aim of this study was to develop dsm of the fc and pwp in the topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m and subsoil 0 6 0 9 m across a dryland cotton farm using digital data i e eca γ ray spectrometry elevation and positional data a comparison of two modelling approaches mlr and stepwise mlr showed that for both fc and pwp the stepwise mlr was superior at most depths compared to the mlr approach because the adj r2 was larger for example the adj r2 of mlr for prediction of topsoil fc was smaller 0 44 than the stepwise mlr 0 52 which included only the statistically significant digital data i e 2mpcon northing t c 1mpcon and 1mhcon the final dsm of fc and pwp and by difference the dsm of awc for each depth increment were indicative of the two main geomorphological geological units which characterized the study field specifically the larger awc 0 3 m3 m 3 were associated with the southern margin of the field and other areas associated with various drainage lines where the vertosols are characterized by large clay content gardiner and miller 2004 and define areas of the field of the second terraced fan of local alluvium conversely the smallest 0 15 m3 m 3 awc was interspersed between the vertosols and indicative of the loamy soil textures of the pilliga sandstone owing to the short scale variation and the fact that the local alluvium and pilliga sandsone were close together and the fact that the digital data varied in different ways large ci values were evident where these areas were juxtaposed nevertheless the results here are an advance and more accurate than those achieve by gooley et al 2014 who created dsm of predicted average rootzone 0 0 9 m fc and pwp with moderate to weak precision r2 0 56 and 0 46 across two predominantly areas southeast of warren and trangie macquarie valley herein our results were superior owing to the fact that we collected in both instances digital data i e eca and γ ray which were proximal and collected on detailed transects spaced only 12 m apart and on the same day in gooley et al 2014 while they used proximal sensed eca i e em38 and em34 3 γ ray and dem data were acquired from a remote sensed platform i e airborne in the case of the former the data was collected on an approximate 0 5 1 km grid whereas the latter was collected on transects spaced 400 m apart

system with high plant density 12 104 plants ha 1 was introduced to achieve the dual goal of high yields and water saving the study aims at identifying optimal irrigation quotas for three climatic conditions i e changji an arid region annual precipitation 141 mm qitai a semi arid region 269 mm and xinyuan a semi humid region 476 mm field experiments were carried out to explore dynamics of crop evapotranspiration etc mm of maize across arid to semi humid climate in 2018 and 2019 six experimental treatments were designed according to local precipitation including five irrigation levels under a high plant density of 12 104 plants ha 1 and a conventional irrigation level under a common planting density of 9 104 plants ha 1 taken as the control there existed a quadratic relationship between gy and irrigation amounts and between gy and etc a negative linear relationship was observed between wue and irrigation amounts and between wue and etc daily water consumption intensity dwci mm d 1 of maize increased from ve to vt stage reached maximum values of 9 3 mm d 1 changji 6 4 mm d 1 qitai and 5 0 mm d 1 xinyuan respectively during vt to r3 stage and then declined until maturity indicating that vt to r3 stage is a high water consumption period water sensitive period of maize generally the occurrence of maximum dwci and its sensitive period were delayed with increase of precipitation from arid to semi humid climate the optimum irrigation quota recommended was 720 mm for changji 540 mm for qitai and 180 mm for xinyuan respectively compared to the control the recommended irrigation quota saved 11 60 irrigation water and improved average wue by 11 65 without sacrificing maize yields 15 mg ha 1 we conclude that dual goal of high yields and high wue of maize can be achieved with high plant density using optimal irrigation quotas and regimes especially under semi arid climate keywords mulched drip irrigation drought indices high yields water requirement zea mays l 1 introduction water shortage is a major problem that restricts agroecosystem productivity debaeke and aboudrare 2004 with the expansion of irrigated land and over exploitation of water resources the phenomenon of water shortage is accelerating in agricultural sector as the largest water consumer agriculture accounts for more than 60 of water withdrawn from resources worldwide hao et al 2015 rafiee and kalhor 2016 in china water used for irrigation accounts for more than 70 of groundwater withdrawn qin et al 2019a due to the increase in world population demand for cereal grains such as wheat and maize zea mays l are projected to increase by 60 70 by 2050 tilman et al 2011 the demand may further escalate the conflict between agricultural production and water shortage if appropriate measures are not taken q fang et al 2010 therefore great efforts should be made to achieve the dual goal of reducing agricultural water consumption and boosting grain yields qin et al 2019b mulched drip irrigation has been used as a water saving technique to boost crop productivity g z liu et al 2017 this technique improves soil temperature reduces soil evaporation decreases deep soil 120 cm water infiltration shortens crop growing period qin et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 and improves water use efficiency wue and grain yield fan et al 2017 besides high density planting has shown great potential in increasing grain yields of maize especially in northwestern china which has adequate solar radiation wu et al 2017 nowadays the cultivation system that integrates mulched drip irrigation and high density planting has been widely adopted in arid and semi arid irrigated areas of northwestern china wang et al 2011 he et al 2013 however this intensive system relies heavily on high water and nutrient inputs which accelerate the conflict between water supply and demand cui et al 2018 recently the local government has encouraged researchers to explore comprehensive approaches to increase wue zhang et al 2017 these approaches include integrating precision seeding high yield variety and high density planting with appropriate deficit irrigation during non sensitive period of maize as well as chemical regulation etc to reduce excessive water use in 2017 the xinjiang uygur autonomous government restricted the total water supply to maize crops in qitai 720 mm and changji 810 mm thus it is important to further reduce water use without compromising on grain yield maize is a major cereal crop in the arid regions of northwestern china li et al 2014 due to high photosynthetic efficiency and convenient management maize has become the second largest crop of china and contributed 40 to china s cereal production in 2019 qin et al 2019b thus maize plays an essential role in ensuring food security in china li et al 2016 over the past few years scientists have developed several approaches among which high density planting is considered the key to achieving high yield and high wue in maize bandy 2014 qin et al 2020 since 2005 xinjiang researchers have aimed to identify high yielding maize varieties and optimize field management in northwestern china j li et al 2015 g z liu et al 2017 consequently a cultivation system that integrated mulched drip irrigation with high density planting was proposed for maize here the traditional plant density of 7 5 104 plants ha 1 was increased to 12 104 plants ha 1 zhang et al 2019 in 2017 the highest maize yield of 22 8 mg ha 1 was achieved in china from a small area of qitai 0 15 ha and a new yield record of 18 5 mg ha 1 from a large area of xinyuan 700 ha under high plant density with normal irrigation zhang et al 2017 however the climatic conditions especially precipitation vary significantly across xinjiang northwestern china the optimal irrigation quota and regimes for these climatic conditions remain unclear considerable efforts have been made to maximize grain yield with limited water resources especially in arid and semi arid regions worldwide sepaskhah and khajehabdollahi 2005 thapa et al 2019 zou et al 2020 in the eastern mediterranean areas the maximum maize yield of 10 4 mg ha 1 was obtained with a maximum wue of 1 77 kg m 3 under drip irrigation bozkurt et al 2011 in southwestern iran s arid areas spring maize under the optimal irrigation amount of 478 mm produced the highest yield of 9 88 mg ha 1 with a wue of 2 08 kg m 3 lack et al 2012 in the us corn belt the maize wue ranged from 1 08 to 1 62 kg m 3 with grain yields that ranged from 13 to 14 mg ha 1 howell et al 1997 in northwestern china s semi arid area maize under drip irrigation produced the highest yield of 19 1 mg ha 1 with a wue of 2 70 kg m 3 under a plant density of 12 104 plants ha 1 zhang et al 2017 it is obvious that china obtains higher maize yields than other arid and semi arid regions of the world probably due to the above mentioned approaches that integrated several key technologies however the climate varies in northwestern china throughout the year especially in xinjiang typically xinjiang has a complex topography with the lowest altitude of 155 m in the turpan basin and the highest altitude of 8611 m in qogir west peak causing significant climate differences s f fang et al 2010 meanwhile the annual precipitation varies markedly from 50 to 650 mm across xinjiang causing dramatic water supply variation h j liu et al 2017 therefore irrigation regime and amount should be specifically recommended for each climatic condition for sustainable agriculture only a few studies have attempted to achieve high yield and high wue across arid to semi humid regions we hypothesized that high yield and high wue in maize could be achieved with climatic condition specific optimal irrigation regime and amount we defined the optimal irrigation amount as the amount of irrigation water that produced the highest yield and wue the objectives of this study were i to determine the optimal irrigation amount for spring maize across different climates arid semi arid and semi humid climates ii to study the water requirement of high yielding spring maize under drip irrigation and high plant density 12 0 104 plants ha 1 and iii to present practical approaches for high yield and high wue in spring maize for each climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted at the

operating pressure in 2018 and 2019 the cultivar was planted at a density of 12 104 plants ha 1 with mulched drip irrigation a density of 9 104 plants ha 1 adopted by local farmers was taken as the control a precision water meter lxs 40f ningbo water meter inc china was installed at the water pipe s discharge end to monitor irrigation amount the irrigation levels for the three sites were

site with a plant density of 9 104 plants ha 1 was set as the control in this study a planting density of 9 104 plants ha 1 under local irrigation levels at the three sites was taken as the control except the control ck five irrigation levels were adopted under a plant density of 12 104 plants ha 1 detailed description of treatments at the three sites were presented in table 2 at changji farm maize was sown on may 3 2018 and april 25 2019 and harvested on october 5 2018 and september 26 2019 at qitai farm the sowing dates were april 19 2018 and april 21 2019 and the harvest dates were october 10 2018 and october 3 2019 at xinyuan farm maize was sown on april 28 in both 2018 and 2019 and harvested on september 30 2018 and september 23 2019 after sowing all experimental fields were immediately irrigated with 0 45 mm of water based on the soil water shortage sws in the topsoil 0 20 cm to guarantee rapid seed germination and uniform seedling emergence table 2 the plants were not irrigated from ve emergence to v6 in changji ve to v10 in qitai and ve to v12 in xinyuan to induce slight drought and promote root penetration by avoiding lodging which usually occurs in vt r3 tasseling milk stage the amount of water applied as single irrigation was calculated using equation eq 1 the first irrigation was usually applied in mid to late june the irrigation interval and duration were decided based on the local governments guidance 1 q s q total q ve t where q s is the quota of water applied per irrigation event mm q total is the total amount of water used for each treatment mm q ve is the amount of water applied at ve for uniform seedling emergence mm t is the number of irrigation events during maize growth based on the initial nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k contents in the 0 100 cm soil profile base fertilizers including urea 150 kg ha 1 n potassium phosphate 225 kg ha 1 nh4 2hpo4 and potassium sulfate 75 kg ha 1 k2o were applied before sowing to ensure a non limited supply of nutrients for high density maize plants to achieve a maximum expected yield of 18 mg ha 1 additional urea totally 600 kg ha 1 n was applied at r6 vt and r3 stages of maize to all treatments at a ratio of 3 4 3 weeds and pests were managed according to the local governments recommendations 2 4 soil water content crop evapotranspiration daily water consumption intensity and water consumption coefficient soil water content swc v v was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm by time domain reflectometry tdr using a tube probe trime iph imko germany in each plot three 150 cm long tubes were deployed beside the drip tapes and two between the drip tapes data were represented as the average of swc values for the entire plot before sowing swc was measured using the oven drying method swc was measured every ten days from the first irrigation to harvest additional measurements were performed before and after each irrigation and precipitation event specially the swc 0 100 cm at vt r3 and r6 stages of maize at changji qitai and xinyuan sites in 2018 and 2019 were shown in the supplementary materials figs s1 s3 total crop water consumption namely the actual evapotranspiration etc mm was calculated during the growing season using the soil water balance equation rana and katerji 2000 as follows 2 e t c i p c r r f d p δ s where et c is crop evapotranspiration mm including crop transpiration mm and soil evaporation mm during the maize growing season i is the total amount of water applied mm p is seasonal precipitation mm c r is the capillary rise mm r f is runoff mm d p is deep percolation mm and δs is the change in sws mm in eq 2 c r was considered zero because the groundwater table was 70 80 m below the surface runoff was also assumed to be negligible because the plot was ﬂat d p was considered zero because swc below 60 cm did not reach field capacity on any sampling date at qitai and xinyuan farms and swc below 80 cm did neither at changji farm previous studies have shown that under mulched drip irrigation root weight of maize and changes of sws were mainly concentrated in the 0 60 soil layer at qitai and xinyuan farms and in the 0 80 soil layer at changji farm zhou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 and those below 60 cm soil layer changji 80 cm were relatively stable zhang et al 2017 in this study daily water consumption intensity dwci mm d 1 in eq 3 and phase water consumption coefficient kp in eq 4 were both used to identify the highest water consumption period water sensitive period of maize as follows 3 dwci wc p gp d where wc p is phase water consumption mm during a given growth period and gp d is the duration in days of a given growth period 4 k p w c p e t c 100 where k p is the phase water consumption coefficient during a specific growth period wc p is phase water consumption mm and et c is total crop evapotranspiration mm during the entire growing season the coefficient 100 in eq 5 converts the unit of k p to 2 5 grain yield at physiological maturity maize plants in an area of 66 m2 from the middle six rows of each plot were harvested manually the total number of plants and ears were counted and the number of ears per plant was determined number of grains per ear was measured for each ear grain weight was determined by oven drying three samples of 1000 kernels from each treatment at 80 c for 72 h to constant weight the grains were separated cleaned and weighed grain yield was expressed at 14 moisture content determined using a portable moisture meter pm 8188 kett

grain yield mg ha 1 et c is crop evapotranspiration mm calculated according to eq 2 and i is irrigation amount mm the coefficient 100 in eqs 5 and 6 converts mg ha 1 mm 1 to kg m 3 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was used to test the differences in grain yield wue and etc among the treatments correlation analysis was performed using spss software version 19 0 spss institute inc usa to determine the association between grain yield and irrigation amount as well as between wue and irrigation amount fisher s least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the mean values at p 0 05 lsd 0 05 sigmaplot version 12 0 and graphpad prism version 8 0 were used to create the graphs 3 results 3 1 grain yield crop evapotranspiration and water use efficiency grain yield varied with the climatic conditions on average the highest yield of 18 9 mg ha 1 was achieved at qitai in both 2018 and 2019 followed by xinyuan 16 4 mg ha 1 and changji 14 0 mg ha 1 among the different irrigation treatments i5 resulted in the highest grain yield at changji and i3 at qitai at xinyuan the highest grain yield was achieved with i2 or i3 except at changji reduced irrigation produced equivalent or significantly higher yields compared with control using 33 less water than control the effect of interaction between location and irrigation amount was significant on etc in both years maize etc ranged from 583 to 991 mm at changji 566 931 mm at qitai and 343 729 mm at xinyuan in both years a significant effect of interaction on wue and iwue was observed between the irrigation amount and location in 2018 average wue of reduced irrigation i1 i4 was 24 higher at changji 23 higher at qitai and 51 higher at xinyuan than that of ck in 2019 it was 8 27 and 46 higher at the three farms respectively maize etc increased linearly with irrigation amount whereas wue and iwue decreased table 3 to conclude reduced irrigation generated significantly higher wue or iwue than ck at the three sites in both years 3 2 correlation of grain yield and water use efficiency with crop evapotranspiration and irrigation level the relationship between grain yield and irrigation amount was fitted to a quadratic function r 2 0 964 p 0 05 fig 3 the optimal irrigation amount for maximum yield was 762 907 mm for changji 601 639 mm for qitai and 238 257 mm for xinyuan when the irrigation amount exceeded the optimal value grain yield gradually declined similarly a significant quadratic relationship was observed between grain yield and etc r 2 0 992 p 0 05 fig 3 the optimal etc for maximum yield was 873 6 1084 6 mm for changji 759 8 848 7 mm for qitai and 555 6 660 0 mm for xinyuan when etc exceeded the optimal value grain yield gradually declined in all the three climatic regions both wue and iwue decreased linearly with irrigation amount and etc fig 4 3 3 evapotranspiration dynamics 3 3 1 dynamics of daily water consumption intensity during both growing seasons dwci increased with irrigation amount across the three climatic regions fig 5 during the entire growing period ck and i5 resulted in the highest mean dwci of 10 5 mm d 1 at changji 8 5 mm d 1 at qitai and 9 4 mm d 1 at xinyuan respectively which suggests that high planting density does not increase dwci with the same irrigation amount dwci increased from ve to v12 and peaked at vt 80 days after sowing das at changji while it peaked at r2 90 das at qitai and r3 100 das at xinyuan further dwci declined gradually at all the three sites these results suggest that water consumption is high from vt to r3 water sensitive period across the three climatic regions 3 3 2 dynamics of phase water consumption coefficient based on mean kp of spring maize in 2018 and 2019 stages of maize water requirement can be characterized into four stages taken the optimum irrigation treatments for instance the four stages and their corresponding mean kp values are ve v6 14 v6 vt 34 vt r3 23 and r3 r6 29 stages at changji farm ve v10 22 v10 vt 21 vt r3 24 and r3 r6 33 stages at qitai farm ve v12 38 v12 vt 13 vt r3 28 and r3 r6 21 stages at xinyuan farm respectively fig 6 with the increase of precipitation length of the first kp stage non sensitive period increased in the three climatic regions showing significant climatic influence on it in both years the maximum kp occurred during v6 to tv at changji r3 to r6 at qitai and ve to v12 at xinyuan respectively 4 discussion 4 1 optimal irrigation amount for maximizing grain yield in maize studies have shown a more than 50 increase in grain yield with improved field management practices chen et al 2015 including irrigation schedule optimization however different climatic regions have separate optimal irrigation quota and regimes in this study the maize grain yield was maximum at an irrigation amount of 720 mm in changji arid climate 540 mm in qitai semi arid climate and 180 mm in xinyuan semi humid climate 11 60 lower than those adopted by the local farmers the average wue 1 9 kg m 3 for changji 2 6 kg m 3 for qitai and 3 7 kg m 3 for xinyuan under these optimal irrigation amounts increased by 11 65 compared with the ck which indicates that higher grain yields 15 mg ha 1 can be achieved with relatively lower irrigation amounts furthermore a quadratic correlation was detected between grain yield and irrigation amount and a negative correlation was observed between wue and irrigation amount at the three sites consistent with the previous studies kuscu and demir 2013 kresović et al 2016 the average wue of spring maize was comparable with that in the irrigated farmlands and larger than that in the dry farmlands of china 1 54 kg m 3 deng et al 2006 however under the same wue with reduced irrigation the average yield 15 0 mg ha 1 was significantly larger than that of irrigated spring maize of china 6 0 mg ha 1 li et al 2016 the high planting density 9 104 to 12 104 plants ha 1 and the optimal irrigation quota and the regime probably created a more suitable swc in the root zone of maize at vt stage in 2018 mean swc 10 3 of i4 at changji 19 9 of i3 at qitai 29 8 of i2 at xinyuan and at r3 stage in 2019 mean swc 12 3 of i4 at changji 21 3 of i3 at qitai 28 2 of i2 at xinyuan in the three climatic regions figs s1 s3 4 2 water requirement of high yielding maize under mulched drip irrigation variations in dwci and kp were investigated across the experimental sites classified based on the drought index as arid semi arid and semi humid an earlier study under a low plant density 9 104 plants ha 1 with the grain yield of 9 5 mg ha 1 suggested a dwci dynamics similar to the present study however the average dwci value was 15 lower in the studied area probably due its lower density planting and shorter sunshine hours in the north china plain liu et al 2011 furthermore the grain yields were significantly higher 15 mg ha 1 with optimal irrigation than the three sites local levels with the traditional practices with climatic conditions varying dwci peaked during different stages at the three sites vt in changji r2 in qitai and r3 in xinyuan peak dwci values 4 7 9 6 mm d 1 during vt to r3 were significantly higher than in the arid areas of northwestern china 4 5 7 0 mm d 1 with an average maize yield of 11 2 mg ha 1 wu et al 2017 moreover the maximum dwci stage and sensitive period were delayed with the increase in precipitation typically maximum dwci is observed when maize plants enter into reproductive phase zhang et al 2017 however in our study maximum dwci delayed as the climate became wetter probably due to the abundant precipitation that postponed maximum lai of maize xu et al 2017 in this study maize etc varied with the climatic conditions 842 mm in the arid region 729 mm in the semi arid region and 472 mm in the semi humid region similarly kp also varied with the climatic conditions probably due to the differences in growth duration e g 152 d for changji 170 d for qitai and 150 d for xinyuan and seasonal precipitation e g 95 mm for changji 174 mm for qitai and 268 mm for xinyuan air temperature ta c is a critical environmental factor that influences grain formation dry matter accumulation leaf expansion and temporal canopy changes in maize hou et al 2014 in this study the average ta during the critical growth period vt r3 in the arid region was 4 c higher than in the semi arid and semi humid regions which probably led to higher etc but lower yield moreover in maize grain yield and biomass are primarily determined during a limited period about 20 d around silking gabaldon et al 2016 however a good soil moisture status at r3 can mitigate the adverse effects of high air temperature on maize yields in our study the optimal irrigation treatments resulted in swc at r3 comparable with the high irrigation treatments conserving 33 5 15 5 and 20 3 more moisture in the 0 100 cm soil depth than the low irrigation levels in changji qitai and xinyuan respectively figs s1 s3 4 3 synergistic improvement in maize grain yield and water use efficiency the ultimate goal of irrigation is to maximize grain yields by minimizing water overuse deng et al 2006 kang et al 2017 however low wue has been a common global problem affecting sustainable agriculture in a sub humid climate of turkey kuscu et al 2013 reported an average wue of 1 66 kg m 3 for drip irrigated maize in contrast a significantly higher average wue of 1 84 kg m 3 was obtained using drought tolerant maize hybrids in texas high plains with a semi arid climate zhao et al 2018 in china drip irrigation and plastic film mulching are widely used to reduce soil evaporation and improve the wue of maize li et al 2016 however due to a wide range of climates significant differences were observed in yields and wue of maize in china s rainfed areas the average maize yield was 9 4 mg ha 1 and wue was 2 1 kg m 3 li et al 2013 ji et al 2015 drip irrigation increased the average yield by 6 8 and wue by 10 9 compared with the rainfed areas ji et al 2015 while mulched drip irrigation increased maize grain yield by up to 6 5 and wue by up to 4 5 compared with flood irrigation y li et al 2015 under low density planting 9 104 plants ha 1 wue 1 7 3 1 kg m 3 similar to high density planting was obtained however grain yield was significantly lower 10 2 11 6 mg ha 1 liu et al 2011 however in the present study under high density planting the average maize grain yield exceeded 15 1 mg ha 1 and the average wue reached 1 9 3 7 kg m 3 using optimal irrigation schedules the finding suggests that a combination of mulched drip irrigation and dense planting is an effective way to obtain high yield and high wue in maize under arid to semi humid climates previous studies have shown that an increase in planting density increased grain and biomass yields the magnitude of increase was similar between low and high densities in northwestern china resulting in similar harvest indices xu et al 2017 with the hybrid xy 335 a compact cultivar with optimum leaf size leaf orientation and structure and extended stay green canopy which intercepts more solar radiation hou et al 2014 drought is common under predicted climate change scenarios especially in arid and semi arid areas hussain et al 2018 to maximize yield and wue in maize and deal with the problems of water shortage suggestions are put forward for local farmers and policy makers 1 adopt high yielding density tolerant cultivars 2 optimize irrigation schedules according to kp and dwci values e g reduce irrigation events during non sensitive periods ve v12 and ensure optimum irrigation quota and intervals during critical growth periods vt r3 to make our results more useful to guide the local farmers we summarize an optimized irrigation schedule for maximizing yields and wue in the three climate regions fig 7 farmers may refer to the proposed irrigation quotas and intervals when irrigating maize plants 5 conclusion grain yields and evapotranspiration dynamics were investigated in this study across arid to semi humid climates dwci increased from ve to v12 peaked during vt to r3 stage and then declined from r3 to r6 indicating vt to r3 as maize s sensitive period the increase in precipitation postponed the appearance of maximum dwci consequently the water sensitive period was delayed 10 15 d in maize of semi arid and semi humid regions this study proposes an irrigation amount of 720 mm for changji 540 mm for qitai and 180 mm for xinyuan to achieve the dual goal of high yields 15 1 mg ha 1 and high wue 1 9 kg m 3 in spring maize furthermore the optimal allocation of irrigation amounts is depicted fig 7 under high planting density 12 104 plants ha 1 with optimal irrigation a wue 1 9 3 4 kg m 3 comparable with that under low planting density 9 104 plants ha 1 adopted by local farmers was obtained with higher grain yields 15 7 18 9 kg m 3 to conclude our findings indicate that the combination of mulched drip

from arid to semi humid climate the optimum irrigation quota recommended was 720 mm for changji 540 mm for qitai and 180 mm for xinyuan respectively compared to the control the recommended irrigation quota saved 11 60 irrigation water and improved average wue by 11 65 without sacrificing maize yields 15 mg ha 1 we conclude that dual goal of high yields and high wue of maize can be achieved with high plant density using optimal irrigation quotas and regimes especially under semi arid climate keywords mulched drip irrigation drought indices high yields water requirement zea mays l 1 introduction water shortage is a major problem that restricts agroecosystem productivity debaeke and aboudrare 2004 with the expansion of irrigated land and over exploitation of water resources the phenomenon of water shortage is accelerating in agricultural sector as the largest water consumer agriculture accounts for more than 60 of water withdrawn from resources worldwide hao et al 2015 rafiee and kalhor 2016 in china water used for irrigation accounts for more than 70 of groundwater withdrawn qin et al 2019a due to the increase in world population demand for cereal grains such as wheat and maize zea mays l are projected to increase by 60 70 by 2050 tilman et al 2011 the demand may further escalate the conflict between agricultural production and water shortage if appropriate measures are not taken q fang et al 2010 therefore great efforts should be made to achieve the dual goal of reducing agricultural water consumption and boosting grain yields qin et al 2019b mulched drip irrigation has been used as a water saving technique to boost crop productivity g z liu et al 2017 this technique improves soil temperature reduces soil evaporation decreases deep soil 120 cm water infiltration shortens crop growing period qin et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 and improves water use efficiency wue and grain yield fan et al 2017 besides high density planting has shown great potential in increasing grain yields of maize especially in northwestern china which has adequate solar radiation wu et al 2017 nowadays the cultivation system that integrates mulched drip irrigation and high density planting has been widely adopted in arid and semi arid irrigated areas of northwestern china wang et al 2011 he et al 2013 however this intensive system relies heavily on high water and nutrient inputs which accelerate the conflict between water supply and demand cui et al 2018 recently the local government has encouraged researchers to explore comprehensive approaches to increase wue zhang et al 2017 these approaches include integrating precision seeding high yield variety and high density planting with appropriate deficit irrigation during non sensitive period of maize as well as chemical regulation etc to reduce excessive water use in 2017 the xinjiang uygur autonomous government restricted the total water supply to maize crops in qitai 720 mm and changji 810 mm thus it is important to further reduce water use without compromising on grain yield maize is a major cereal crop in the arid regions of northwestern china li et al 2014 due to high photosynthetic efficiency and convenient management maize has become the second largest crop of china and contributed 40 to china s cereal production in 2019 qin et al 2019b thus maize plays an essential role in ensuring food security in china li et al 2016 over the past few years scientists have developed several approaches among which high density planting is considered the key to achieving high yield and high wue in maize bandy 2014 qin et al 2020 since 2005 xinjiang researchers have aimed to identify high yielding maize varieties and optimize field management in northwestern china j li et al 2015 g z liu et al 2017 consequently a cultivation system that integrated mulched drip irrigation with high density planting was proposed for maize here the traditional plant density of 7 5 104 plants ha 1 was increased to 12 104 plants ha 1 zhang et al 2019 in 2017 the highest maize yield of 22 8 mg ha 1 was achieved in china from a small area of qitai 0 15 ha and a new yield record of 18 5 mg ha 1 from a large area of xinyuan 700 ha under high plant density with normal irrigation zhang et al 2017 however the climatic conditions especially precipitation vary significantly across xinjiang northwestern china the optimal irrigation quota and regimes for these climatic conditions remain unclear considerable efforts have been made to maximize grain yield with limited water resources especially in arid and semi arid regions worldwide sepaskhah and khajehabdollahi 2005 thapa et al 2019 zou et al 2020 in the eastern mediterranean areas the maximum maize yield of 10 4 mg ha 1 was obtained with a maximum wue of 1 77 kg m 3 under drip irrigation bozkurt et al 2011 in southwestern iran s arid areas spring maize under the optimal irrigation amount of 478 mm produced the highest yield of 9 88 mg ha 1 with a wue of 2 08 kg m 3 lack et al 2012 in the us corn belt the maize wue ranged from 1 08 to 1 62 kg m 3 with grain yields that ranged from 13 to 14 mg ha 1 howell et al 1997 in northwestern china s semi arid area maize under drip irrigation produced the highest yield of 19 1 mg ha 1 with a wue of 2 70 kg m 3 under a plant density of 12 104 plants ha 1 zhang et al 2017 it is obvious that china obtains higher maize yields than other arid and semi arid regions of the world probably due to the above mentioned approaches that integrated several key technologies however the climate varies in northwestern china throughout the year especially in xinjiang typically xinjiang has a complex topography with the lowest altitude of 155 m in the turpan basin and the highest altitude of 8611 m in qogir west peak causing significant climate differences s f fang et al 2010 meanwhile the annual precipitation varies markedly from 50 to 650 mm across xinjiang causing dramatic water supply variation h j liu et al 2017 therefore irrigation regime and amount should be specifically recommended for each climatic condition for sustainable agriculture only a few studies have attempted to achieve high yield and high wue across arid to semi humid regions we hypothesized that high yield and high wue in maize could be achieved with climatic condition specific optimal irrigation regime and amount we defined the optimal irrigation amount as the amount of irrigation water that produced the highest yield and wue the objectives of this study were i to determine the optimal irrigation amount for spring maize across different climates arid semi arid and semi humid climates ii to study the water requirement of high yielding spring maize under drip irrigation and high plant density 12 0 104 plants ha 1 and iii to present practical approaches for high yield and high wue in spring maize for each climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted at the

operating pressure in 2018 and 2019 the cultivar was planted at a density of 12 104 plants ha 1 with mulched drip irrigation a density of 9 104 plants ha 1 adopted by local farmers was taken as the control a precision water meter lxs 40f ningbo water meter inc china was installed at the water pipe s discharge end to monitor irrigation amount the irrigation levels for the three sites were determined based on the local irrigation quota and annual precipitation local irrigation quota the highest irrigation level in our study 810 mm at changji 720 mm at qitai and 540 mm at xinyuan of each site with a plant density of 9 104 plants ha 1 was set as the control in this study a planting density of 9 104 plants ha 1 under local irrigation levels at the three sites was taken as the control except the control ck five irrigation levels were adopted under a plant density of 12 104 plants ha 1 detailed description of treatments at the three sites were presented in table 2 at changji farm maize was sown on may 3 2018 and april 25 2019 and harvested on october 5 2018 and september 26 2019 at qitai farm the sowing dates were april 19 2018 and april 21 2019 and the harvest dates were october 10 2018 and october 3 2019 at xinyuan farm maize was sown on april 28 in both 2018 and 2019 and harvested on september 30 2018 and september 23 2019 after sowing all experimental fields were immediately irrigated with 0 45 mm of water based on the soil water shortage sws in the topsoil 0 20 cm to guarantee rapid seed germination and uniform seedling emergence table 2 the plants were not irrigated from ve emergence to v6 in changji ve to v10 in qitai and ve to v12 in xinyuan to induce slight drought and promote root penetration by avoiding lodging which usually occurs in vt r3 tasseling milk stage the amount of water applied as single irrigation was calculated using equation eq 1 the first irrigation was usually applied in mid to late june the irrigation interval and duration were decided based on the local governments guidance 1 q s q total q ve t where q s is the quota of water applied per irrigation event mm q total is the total amount of water used for each

potassium k contents in the 0 100 cm soil profile base fertilizers including urea 150 kg ha 1 n potassium phosphate 225 kg ha 1 nh4 2hpo4 and potassium sulfate 75 kg ha 1 k2o were applied before sowing to ensure a non limited supply of nutrients for high density maize plants to achieve a maximum expected yield of 18 mg ha 1 additional urea totally 600 kg ha 1 n was applied at r6 vt and r3 stages of maize to all treatments at a ratio of 3 4 3 weeds and pests were managed according to the local governments recommendations 2 4 soil water content crop evapotranspiration daily water consumption intensity and water consumption coefficient soil water content swc v v was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm by time domain reflectometry tdr using a tube probe trime iph imko germany in each plot three 150 cm long tubes were deployed beside the drip tapes and two between the drip tapes data were represented as the average of swc values for the entire plot before sowing swc was measured using the oven drying method swc was measured every ten days from the first irrigation to harvest additional measurements were performed before and after each irrigation and precipitation event specially the swc 0 100 cm at vt r3 and r6 stages of maize at changji qitai and xinyuan sites in 2018 and 2019 were shown in the supplementary materials figs s1 s3 total crop water consumption namely the actual evapotranspiration etc mm was calculated during the growing season using the soil water balance equation rana and katerji 2000 as follows 2 e t c i p c r r f d p δ s where et c is crop evapotranspiration mm including crop transpiration mm and soil evaporation mm during the maize growing season i is the total amount of water applied mm p is seasonal precipitation mm c r is the capillary rise mm r f is runoff mm d p is deep percolation mm and δs is the change in sws mm in eq 2 c r was considered zero because the groundwater table was 70 80 m below the surface runoff was also assumed to be negligible because the plot was ﬂat d p was considered zero because swc below 60 cm did not reach field capacity on any sampling date at qitai and xinyuan farms and swc below 80 cm did neither at changji farm previous studies have shown that under mulched drip irrigation root weight of maize and changes of sws were mainly concentrated in the 0 60 soil layer at qitai and xinyuan farms and in the 0 80 soil layer at changji farm zhou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 and those below 60 cm soil layer changji 80 cm were relatively stable zhang et al 2017 in this study daily water consumption intensity dwci mm d 1 in eq 3 and phase water consumption coefficient kp in eq 4 were both used to identify the highest water consumption period water sensitive period of maize as follows 3 dwci wc p gp d where wc p is phase water consumption mm during a given growth period and gp d is the duration in days of a given growth period 4 k p w c p e t c 100 where k p is the phase water consumption coefficient during a specific growth period wc p is phase water consumption mm and et c is total crop evapotranspiration mm during the entire growing season the coefficient 100 in eq 5 converts the unit of k p to 2 5 grain yield at physiological maturity maize plants in an area of 66 m2 from the middle six rows of each plot were harvested manually the total number of plants and ears were counted and the number of ears per plant was determined number of grains per ear was measured for each ear grain weight was determined by oven drying three samples of 1000 kernels from each treatment at 80 c for 72 h to constant weight the grains were separated cleaned and weighed grain yield was expressed at 14 moisture content determined using a portable moisture meter pm 8188 kett

analysis analysis of variance anova was used to test the differences in grain yield wue and etc among the treatments correlation analysis was performed using spss software version 19 0 spss institute inc usa to determine the association between grain yield and irrigation amount as well as between wue and irrigation amount fisher s least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the mean values at p 0 05 lsd 0 05 sigmaplot version 12 0 and graphpad prism version 8 0 were used to create the graphs 3 results 3 1 grain yield crop evapotranspiration and water use efficiency grain yield varied with the climatic conditions on average the highest yield of 18 9 mg ha 1 was achieved at qitai in both 2018 and 2019 followed by xinyuan 16 4 mg ha 1 and changji 14 0 mg ha 1 among the different irrigation treatments i5 resulted in the highest grain yield at changji and i3 at qitai at xinyuan the highest grain yield was achieved with i2 or i3 except at changji reduced irrigation produced equivalent or significantly higher yields compared with control using 33 less water than control the effect of interaction between location and irrigation amount was significant on etc in both years maize etc ranged from 583 to 991 mm at changji 566 931 mm at qitai and 343 729 mm at xinyuan in both years a significant effect of interaction on wue and iwue was observed between the irrigation amount and location in 2018 average wue of reduced irrigation i1 i4 was 24 higher at changji 23 higher at qitai and 51 higher at xinyuan than that of ck in 2019 it was 8 27 and 46 higher at the three farms respectively maize etc increased linearly with irrigation amount whereas wue and iwue decreased table 3 to conclude reduced irrigation generated significantly higher wue or iwue than ck at the three sites in both years 3 2 correlation of grain yield and water use efficiency with crop evapotranspiration and irrigation level the relationship between grain yield and irrigation amount was fitted to a quadratic function r 2 0 964 p 0 05 fig 3 the optimal irrigation amount for maximum yield was 762 907 mm for changji 601 639 mm for qitai and 238 257 mm for xinyuan when the irrigation amount exceeded the optimal value grain yield gradually declined similarly a significant quadratic relationship was observed between grain yield and etc r 2 0 992 p 0 05 fig 3 the optimal etc for maximum yield was 873 6 1084 6 mm for changji 759 8 848 7 mm for qitai and 555 6 660 0 mm for xinyuan when etc exceeded the optimal value grain yield gradually declined in all the three climatic regions both wue and iwue decreased linearly with irrigation amount and etc fig 4 3 3 evapotranspiration dynamics 3 3 1 dynamics of daily water consumption intensity during both growing seasons dwci increased with irrigation amount across the three climatic regions fig 5 during the entire growing period ck and i5 resulted in the highest mean dwci of 10 5 mm d 1 at changji 8 5 mm d 1 at qitai and 9 4 mm d 1 at xinyuan respectively which suggests that high planting density does not increase dwci with the same irrigation amount dwci increased from ve to v12 and peaked at vt 80 days after sowing das at changji while it peaked at r2 90 das at qitai and r3 100 das at xinyuan further dwci declined gradually at all the three sites these results suggest that water consumption is high from vt to r3 water sensitive period across the three climatic regions 3 3 2 dynamics of phase water consumption coefficient based on mean kp of spring maize in 2018 and 2019 stages of maize water requirement can be characterized into four stages taken the optimum irrigation treatments for instance the four stages and their corresponding mean kp values are ve v6 14 v6 vt 34 vt r3 23 and r3 r6 29 stages at changji farm ve v10 22 v10 vt 21 vt r3 24 and r3 r6 33 stages at qitai farm ve v12 38 v12 vt 13 vt r3 28 and r3 r6 21 stages at xinyuan farm respectively fig 6 with the increase of precipitation length of the first kp stage non sensitive period increased in the three climatic regions showing significant climatic influence on it in both years the maximum kp occurred during v6 to tv at changji r3 to r6 at qitai and ve to v12 at xinyuan respectively 4 discussion 4 1 optimal irrigation amount for maximizing grain yield in maize studies have shown a more than 50 increase in grain yield with improved field management practices chen et al 2015 including irrigation schedule optimization however different climatic regions have separate optimal irrigation quota and regimes in this study the maize grain yield was maximum at an irrigation amount of 720 mm in changji arid climate 540 mm in qitai semi arid climate and 180 mm in xinyuan semi humid climate 11 60 lower than those adopted by the local farmers the average wue 1 9 kg m 3 for changji 2 6 kg m 3 for qitai and 3 7 kg m 3 for xinyuan under these optimal irrigation amounts increased by 11 65 compared with the ck which indicates that higher grain yields 15 mg ha 1 can be achieved with relatively lower irrigation amounts furthermore a quadratic correlation was detected between grain yield and irrigation amount and a negative correlation was observed between wue and irrigation amount at the three sites consistent with the previous studies kuscu and demir 2013 kresović et al 2016 the average wue of spring maize was comparable with that in the irrigated farmlands and larger than that in the dry farmlands of china 1 54 kg m 3 deng et al 2006 however under the same wue with reduced irrigation the average yield 15 0 mg ha 1 was significantly larger than that of irrigated spring maize of china 6 0 mg ha 1 li et al 2016 the high planting density 9 104 to 12 104 plants ha 1 and the optimal irrigation quota and the regime probably created a more suitable swc in the root zone of maize at vt stage in 2018 mean swc 10 3 of i4 at changji 19 9 of i3 at qitai 29 8 of i2 at xinyuan and at r3 stage in 2019 mean swc 12 3 of i4 at changji 21 3 of i3 at qitai 28 2 of i2 at xinyuan in the three climatic regions figs s1 s3 4 2 water requirement of high yielding maize under mulched drip irrigation variations in dwci and kp were investigated across the experimental sites classified based on the drought index as arid semi arid and semi humid an earlier study under a low plant density 9 104 plants ha 1 with the grain yield of 9 5 mg ha 1 suggested a dwci dynamics similar to the present study however the average dwci value was 15 lower in the studied area probably due its lower density planting and shorter sunshine hours in the north china plain liu et al 2011 furthermore the grain yields were significantly higher 15 mg ha 1 with optimal irrigation than the three sites local levels with the traditional practices with climatic conditions varying dwci peaked during different stages at the three sites vt in changji r2 in qitai and r3 in xinyuan peak dwci values 4 7 9 6 mm d 1 during vt to r3 were significantly higher than in the arid areas of northwestern china 4 5 7 0 mm d 1 with an average maize yield of 11 2 mg ha 1 wu et al 2017 moreover the maximum dwci stage and sensitive period were delayed with the increase in precipitation typically maximum dwci is observed when maize plants enter into reproductive phase zhang et al 2017 however in our study maximum dwci delayed as the climate became wetter probably due to the abundant precipitation that postponed maximum lai of maize xu et al 2017 in this study maize etc varied with the climatic conditions 842 mm in the arid region 729 mm in the semi arid region and 472 mm in the semi humid region similarly kp also varied with the climatic conditions probably due to the differences in growth duration e g 152 d for changji 170 d for qitai and 150 d for xinyuan and seasonal precipitation e g 95 mm for changji 174 mm for qitai and 268 mm for xinyuan air temperature ta c is a critical environmental factor that influences grain formation dry matter accumulation leaf expansion and temporal canopy changes in maize hou et al 2014 in this study the average ta during the critical growth period vt r3 in the arid region was 4 c higher than in the semi arid and semi humid regions which probably led to higher etc but lower yield moreover in maize grain yield and biomass are primarily determined during a limited period about 20 d around silking gabaldon et al 2016 however a good soil moisture status at r3 can mitigate the adverse effects of high air temperature on maize yields in our study the optimal irrigation treatments resulted in swc at r3 comparable with the high irrigation treatments conserving 33 5 15 5 and 20 3 more moisture in the 0 100 cm soil depth than the low irrigation levels in changji qitai and xinyuan respectively figs s1 s3 4 3 synergistic improvement in maize grain yield and water use efficiency the ultimate goal of irrigation is to maximize grain yields by minimizing water overuse deng et al 2006 kang et al 2017 however low wue has been a common global problem affecting sustainable agriculture in a sub humid climate of turkey kuscu et al 2013 reported an average wue of 1 66 kg m 3 for drip irrigated maize in contrast a significantly higher average wue of 1 84 kg m 3 was obtained using drought tolerant maize hybrids in texas high plains with a semi arid climate zhao et al 2018 in china drip irrigation and plastic film mulching are widely used to reduce soil evaporation and improve the wue of maize li et al 2016 however due to a wide range of climates significant differences were observed in yields and wue of maize in china s rainfed areas the average maize yield was 9 4 mg ha 1 and wue was 2 1 kg m 3 li et al 2013 ji et al 2015 drip irrigation increased the average yield by 6 8 and wue by 10 9 compared with the rainfed areas ji et al 2015 while mulched drip irrigation increased maize grain yield by up to 6 5 and wue by up to 4 5 compared with flood irrigation y li et al 2015 under low density planting 9 104 plants ha 1 wue 1 7 3 1 kg m 3 similar to high density planting was obtained however grain yield was significantly lower 10 2 11 6 mg ha 1 liu et al 2011 however in the present study under high density planting the average maize grain yield exceeded 15 1 mg ha 1 and the average wue reached 1 9 3 7 kg m 3 using optimal irrigation schedules the finding suggests that a combination of mulched drip irrigation and dense planting is an effective way to obtain high yield and high wue in maize under arid to semi humid climates previous studies have shown that an increase in planting density increased grain and biomass yields the magnitude of increase was similar between low and high densities in northwestern china resulting in similar harvest indices xu et al 2017 with the hybrid xy 335 a compact cultivar with optimum leaf size leaf orientation and structure and extended stay green canopy which intercepts more solar radiation hou et al 2014 drought is common under predicted climate change scenarios especially in arid and semi arid areas hussain et al 2018 to maximize yield and wue in maize and deal with the problems of water shortage suggestions are put forward for local farmers and policy makers 1 adopt high yielding density tolerant cultivars 2 optimize irrigation schedules according to kp and dwci values e g reduce irrigation events during non sensitive periods ve v12 and ensure optimum irrigation quota and intervals during critical growth periods vt r3 to make our results more useful to guide the local farmers we summarize an optimized irrigation schedule for maximizing yields and wue in the three climate regions fig 7 farmers may refer to the proposed irrigation quotas and intervals when irrigating maize plants 5 conclusion grain yields and evapotranspiration dynamics were investigated in this study across arid to semi humid climates dwci increased from ve to v12 peaked during vt to r3 stage and then declined from r3 to r6 indicating vt to r3 as maize s sensitive period the increase in precipitation postponed the appearance of maximum dwci consequently the water sensitive period was delayed 10 15 d in maize of semi arid and semi humid regions this study proposes an irrigation amount of 720 mm for changji 540 mm for qitai and 180 mm for xinyuan to achieve the dual goal of high yields 15 1 mg ha 1 and high wue 1 9 kg m 3 in spring maize furthermore the optimal allocation of irrigation amounts is depicted fig 7 under high planting density 12 104 plants ha 1 with optimal irrigation a wue 1 9 3 4 kg m 3 comparable with that under low planting density 9 104 plants ha 1 adopted by local farmers was obtained with higher grain yields 15 7 18 9 kg m 3 to conclude our findings indicate that the combination of mulched drip irrigation and dense planting is an effective way to obtain the dual goal of high grain yields and high wue in maize of arid to semi humid regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10197,stable isotope signature of plant water contains essential information on water transport pathway and plant transpiration which has been shown to be a powerful tracer in plant physiological and ecological processes however stable isotopes fractionation in processes of plant water transport and the relationship between transpiration rate e and effective pathway length l and their possible mechanisms are still largely mysterious and confusing here we tested stable isotope signature of maize stem and leaf based on anatomical measurements and modeling and propose a deuterium deviation in leaf water δd to understand variability leaf water isotope enrichment and transpiration we found isotopes fractionation occurred in maize stems in arid area leaf transpiration rate was strongly affected by δd the data revealed l has a negative power relationship with e with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 and the proportional deviation of leaf 18o enrichment 1 δl δe is negatively correlated with e under low e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 and a positively relationship under high e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 suggesting that a pivotal role of effective path length in driving variations in leaf transpiration rate the deuterium deviation δd may have great potential to serve as a new diagnostic tool for understanding pathways of water transport in plant care should be taken when examining source water and estimating roots water uptake using the stable isotope method in arid areas and further study is needed to be carried out and confirm the conclusions across a range of environmental

compositions of transpiration are relatively rare and the few direct measurements of δtrans that exist suggest that δtrans is often not equal to the water source δs harwood et al 1998 simonin et al 2013 wang et al 2012 yakir and sternberg 2000 isotopes fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen in processes of plant water uptake and transport are still largely uncertain in particular for the halophytes and plants in arid areas while deuterium excess d excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 is widely used in atmospheric and meteorological science risi et al 2013 and ice core data analysis luz et al 2009 it is rarely used to interpret isotope fractionation processes in plant physiology however d excess may contain additional information than the isotopologues taken separately because it combines both 2h and 18o isotopic signals gerlein safdi et al 2018 li et al 2017 voelker et al 2014 it would have great potential to serve as a new diagnostic tool for understanding pathways of water transport in plant if deuterium excess could be applied to plant tissues ehleringer et al 2010 in order to better understand the water transport pathway and plant transpiration mechanism related to isotope fractionation of stem and leaf water the variation extent in d excess of leaf water and the relationships between plant transpiration rate e and d excess in leaf water should be considered leaf water isotopic composition and isotope enrichment may contain information on the transport pathways within and beyond the plant stem xylem barbour et al 2017 gradients in isotope enrichment of leaf water may vary with the different water movement pathways between leaf evaporating surface and the vein barbour and farquhar 2004 however ambiguous results were found in subsequent test of this suggestion even the gradients in enrichment within the mesophyll was questioned barbour et al 2017 the causal relationships between pathways water movement and leaf anatomical properties are difﬁcult to establish due to the complexity of the strongly interrelated nature of leaf anatomical traits and outside xylem water transport barbour et al 2017 sack et al 2015 it will provide a tractable way forward when linking the speciﬁc hydraulic characteristics with the patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment particularly with respect to water movement pathways from veins to the leaf sites of evaporation cernusak et al 2016 plavcová et al 2018 stable isotope enrichment leaf water δl will beneﬁt many applications of selecting and establishing models to analyze this process

whole leaf water is often less than that predicted for leaf evaporation sites bögelein et al 2017 ferrio et al 2012 loucos et al 2015 song et al 2015 the leaf water isotope enrichment in evaporation sites δe is predicted well by craig gordon model but that of bulk leaf water is often overestimated enriched water back diffusion from evaporative site was limited by the advection of plant transpiration stream with less enriched water péclet effect farquhar and gan 2003 holloway phillips et al 2016 in sampling across many different species vein leaf saturated moisture contents and vein densities holloway phillips et al 2016 demonstrated the significance of accounting for the relative pool sizes of the mesophyll and vascular water to explain péclet effect to scale the péclet effect to that relevant for sampling of bulk leaf water and obtain more information on transport pathways within vein mesophyll system both the tortuosity of the water associated with the veins and the pathways within the leaf must be considered a péclet effective pathway length l for convenience was commonly used ellsworth et al 2013 farquhar and gan 2003 loucos et al 2015 ripullone et al 2008 song et al 2013 however the relationship between l and e and the possible mechanisms behind l e dynamics are still uncertain especially in the field crop in arid areas in this study we report water stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope data for maize stem and leaf from arid areas of northwest china and determine the leaf water stable isotope enrichment δl deuterium excess in leaf water defined as deuterium deviations δd in this study and effective pathway length l our objectives are 1 to clarify the isotopes fractionation effect in processes of plant water absorption and transport 2 to obtain data under iss and nss and explore how transpiration rate vary with respect to leaf effective pathway length and deuterium deviations and discuss possible mechanisms dynamics behind their relationships and 3 to develop a better understanding of the transpiration mechanism and theoretical system of stable isotope to map a path for future work into understanding water transport pathways 2 isotope theory under the isotopic steady state iss the water leaving leaf surface has the same isotopic composition as stem water enrichment of leaf evaporative sites e above source water under the

bulk leaf water in isotopic steady state is conventionally modelled from the péclet effect and the δe as the following farquhar and lloyd 1993 6 δ l δ e 1 e is the péclet number and defined as farquhar and lloyd 1993 7 el cd where c mol m 3 is the water molar concentration equal to 55 6 103 mol m 3 and d m2 s 1 is the diffusivity in liquid water d 119 10 9 exp 637 t 136 15 cuntz et al 2007

that the eﬀective path length l can be calculated by ﬁtting eqs 1 6 and 7 to the measured δl and δv at non steady state nss the enrichment of leaf water δl can be predicted by a model iteratively at a

solved at a certain time step t in this calculation the approach of calculating l during nss requires two measured values at both the current δl t and previous δl t 1 time step simonin et al 2013 according to isotopic theory the enrichment of different water samples δ sample relative to the source water can be linked back to the relative isotope ratios r 11 δ sample r sample r source 1 isotope composition was expressed in per mil as 12 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample rsource and rstandard are the 18o 16o or 2h 1h ratios of the sample water source and the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard respectively thus we can obtain a relation between sample and δsample 13 δ sample δ sample 1 r source r standard 1 1000 by combining the expressions for δ18o and δ2h and eqs 1 and 13 we know the deuterium excess d excess as a function of the relative humidity h for conceptual simplicity we refer to deviations excess in plant leaf water δd with reference to the global meteoric water line gmwl since the intercept of gmwl is 10 caused by kinetic fractionation during the ocean free water evaporation thus deuterium deviations in leaf will have more negative values can be defined as 14 δ d δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 the transpiration rate e mmol m 2 s 1 can be estimated as the vapor pressure inside the leaves is assumed to be saturation 15 e g s e i h e a p atm

method was used and the irrigation scheduling was designed according to our previous studies wu et al 2018 fertilizer supply and other agronomic measures during the growing season was consistent with the local management 3 2 1 water isotopes the sampling and measuring time was from 14 may to 7 august 2014 and from 19 may to 3 september 2015 the water samples of soil maize stem leaf and ambient atmospheric vapor were collected the sample of plants and soil were randomly chosen within a 30 m diameter in the experimental field based on anatomical measurements maize stems and leaves were collected and were cut into 5 10 cm segments fig 1 the leaves of different canopy positions lower middle and upper were chosen to cut into smaller fragments and the veins and mesophyll were separated at the middle growth stage of maize doy 154 206 in 2014 and doy 160 208 in 2015 we chose two sunny and cloudy days for diurnal variation measurements during the diurnal measurements maize stems and leaves were collected at 2 h intervals during 00 00 24 00 then plant samplings were immediately placed inside the zip bag and water was extracted using the vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica china ambient atmospheric water vapor the mixture of transpiration evaporation and atmospheric water vapor was collected using a cold trap multi channel equipment awvct04 lica china following under such setup 1 0 1 5 ml liquid water can be collected from the ambient atmospheric water vapor per hour soil water samples were collected from the depths of 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 110 cm sampling time of ambient atmospheric water vapor and soil was the same as maize leaf and stem all the samples were collected with three replications at least and were stored in airtight container at 0

measurements relative humidity leaf stomatal conductance and temperatures of leaf and air were measured throughout the maize growing season using li 6400 portable photosynthesis systems li6400xt licor inc lincoln ne usa equipped with a red green blue light source li6400 18 li cor inc qiu et al 2019 ocheltree et al 2012 it should be pointed out that the measurements need to be considered in different canopy layers lower middle and upper and in different site of one certain leaf leaf base leaf mid part and leaf apex measurements were recorded before 0 5 1 h of the maize stem and leaf sampling leaf water content w kg m 2 per unit ground area was measured by weighing the fresh and dry leaves 4 results 4 1 stable oxygen 18o and hydrogen 2h isotope composition descriptive statistics of water oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition δ18o and δ2h from all the sample types soil maize stems leaves and air vapor are presented in table 1 it shows linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o of the water samples δ2h 6 0 δ18o 6 9 soil r2 0 94 δ2h 6 1 δ18o 8 3 stem r2 0 97 δ2h 3 2 δ18o 33 9 leaf r2 0 91 and δ2h 5 9 δ18o 10 5 vapor r2 0 88 the leaf water line with lower intercept and slope values reflected a strong evaporation effect on the surface of leaf water not surprisingly leaves water were the most enriched with δ18o and δ2h ranging from 11 08 to 16 99 and from 69 14 to 20 47 with mean values of 3 26 and 23 12 respectively to reduce redundancy we focused on the discussion of oxygen isotope composition δ18o only in future sections since the distribution of δ2h and δ18o showed a good uniformity significant differences were found in the isotopic compositions of different maize organs stem vein and mesophyll fig 1a the δ18o of mesophyll was much higher than that of vein and stem the distribution range of mesophyll δ18o was 7 70 16 99 with mean of 12 65 maize stem water isotope composition was less than that of vein water with δ18o ranging from 12 24 to 4 95 and mean of 9 78 but here in particular differences were found in water isotope composition of upper stem and lower stem stem base the mean value of δ18o in upper stem 10 21 was higher than lower stem 8 76 isotope composition of maize leaf water show similar distribution in different canopy positions fig 1b ranging from 11 08 to 16 99 bulk leaf water however δ18o data in a leaf suggest that there were significant differences among the leaf base leaf middle part and leaf apex fig 1c δ18o in the leaf apex was more enriched in comparison to the leaf base and leaf middle part ranging from 4 46 to 16 99 and mean of 10 59 as expected isotopic enrichment within the leaf increased from the base to the apex diurnal variations of the isotope compositions of leaf δleaf stem δstem and soil δsoil water show that δstem and δsoil had a similar distribution and variation both in sunny and cloudy day fig 2a soil water isotope composition was a little higher than maize stem water because of the strong evaporation of shallow soil water causing isotopic fractionation allison and hughes 1983 braud et al 2009 however the δstem showed a crest value at noon of sunny day which higher than the soil water indicating that isotopes fractionation occurred in processes of plant water absorption in study site it shows an increase in δleaf from early morning to midday and then decreased until early morning the next day the fluctuation range and the crest in cloudy day however were lower than that of sunny day this is due to the strong solar radiation in sunny day resulting in stronger isotopes enrichment in leaves fig 2b showed that the leaf water isotope composition exhibited a negative correlation with relative humidity rh with an r2 of 0 68 indicating that relative humidity was a crucial influential factor for leaf water isotope composition but the δstem displayed a relatively stable value regardless of relative humidity 4 1 1 leaf water 18o enrichment δl and deuterium deviation δd similar to the variations of δleaf there was an increase trend from early morning to midday and a decrease trend from midday to early morning the next day of the leaf water 18o enrichment δl fig 3 there were slight differences of δl among maize leaf in upper middle and lower layer however significant differences were found among the δl of leaf base leaf mid part and leaf apex fig 3b both in sunny and cloudy days mean 18o enrichment δl of leaf water and deuterium deviation δd were showed in fig 4 water extracted from the leaf apex and leaf blade was more enriched than the source water stem water by 15 24 along the leaf blade a progressive isotope enrichment was observed within vein water enrichment of vein water over source water was higher near the leaf apex with the midrib vein achieving of 11 and the upper vein achieving of 16 as the source water flows out of the vein and moves to the stomata it enriches in 18o evaporately and a slight enrichment of vein water was obtained due to the mixing of the isotopically distinct water back diffusion helliker et al 2000 similarly deuterium deviation δd showed a significant difference between the vein and mesophyll the δd in the mesophyll e g leaf blade and leaf apex was 150 170 0 more negative than for the vein base fig 4 our results can be used as new evidence that leaves isotopic enrichment is not occurring along the midrib but along the axis of the secondary veins this is probably because of the high water flow and low hydraulic resistance in the midrib and the large amount of unenriched water in the midrib diluting enriched water of back diffusion gerlein safdi et al 2017 4 1 2 leaf transpiration rate e and effective path length l the deuterium deviation δd in plant water pools reconstructed from the global meteoric water line gmwl clearly indicated that leaf transpiration rate e should be strongly affected by δd fig 5 lower δd values more negative were associated with higher transpiration rates the linear regression fitted to e and δd was e 0 04δd 0 36 r2 0 646 p 0 05 with small slope and intercept value might be the result of maize leaf physiological functioning the relationships between effective path length l calculating l at iss and nss and leaf transpiration rate e are showed in fig 6 l and e showed a significant inverse relationship negative power with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 r2 0 546 p 0 05 in the dataset l tended to remain within a narrow small values range when e was in the high values e 2 mmol m 2 s 1 l increased sharply when e reached the low range of values e 1 mmol m 2 s 1 and decrease towards zero when analyzing the leaf water 18o enrichment δl and effective path length l clear and significant p 0 05 negative relationship was observed between l and δl with non linear regression of δl 2 78ln l 29 93 r2 0 590 fig 6b this reflects the fact that average δl decreases if the effective path length l is long or when transpiration rate e is high the way that l and e changed in maize leaves relative to the available water source minimized their differences in δl eqs 5 and 6 ellsworth et al 2013 farquhar and lloyd 1993 5 discussion 5 1 isotopes fractionation in processes of plant water transport our results show that differences were found in water isotope composition of maize upper stem and lower stem stem base and the mean value of δstem was not consistent with that of water source i e δsoil besides a crest value at noon of sunny day was found in δstem which was higher than the soil water thus we suggest that isotopes fractionation occurred in processes of water transport in maize stems in arid areas stable isotope 18o in plant stem water had better response to the variation of soil water water source dai et al 2014 wu et al 2016 and the water isotope compositions are unchanged by plant roots uptake and during transport through the stem in most species dawson and ehleringer 1991 meißner et al 2013 white et al 1985 however isotopes fractionation of 2h were found in some wetland species salt tolerant halophytic plant and certain woody xerophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 lin and da sl sternberg 1993 zhao et al 2016 probably because in the halophytic and xerophytic plants water with a large fraction taken up thought plant roots transverses cell membranes in the endodermis before entering the root xylem and cause isotope fractionation of 2h in root stem xylem water ellsworth and williams 2007 the region of our study is scarce in water resource with a mean annual evaporation of 2000 mm and annual precipitation of 164 mm maize leaves were enriched with isotopes in this arid environment figs 3 and 4 relationships between leaf isotope enrichment δl relative to water source soil and stem and the ratio of ambient to intercellular vapor pressure ea ei for maize leaves are showed in fig 7 both isotope enrichment relative to soil water source δ l soil and stem water source δ l stem exhibited a significant negative correlation with ea ei the two regression lines should have coincided under the isotopic steady state iss fig 7a if there was no isotope fractionation during water transport in maize stem however both the slope and intercept of δ l siol ea ei were significant differences from δ l stem ea ei indicating the isotope fractionation had occurred during water uptake and the magnitude of isotope fractionation should be closely related to the deviation of the intercept and positively correlated with transpiration rates lin and da sl sternberg 1993 song et al 2015 in light of the results care should be taken when examining source water and estimating roots water uptake using the stable isotope method in halophytic and xerophytic species 5 2 leaf water isotopic signals of δl and potential applications of δd maize leaves 18o enrichment δl showed a significant difference between the vein and mesophyll and had distinct diurnal variations in sunny and cloudy day δl exhibited a significant negative correlation with ea ei in both iss and nss leaf groups indicating δl is an important factor in applications of many plant physiological and ecological processes similar to leaf isotope enrichment the deuterium deviation δd provided some key information for the study of water transport pathway and plant transpiration our data revealed that δd in leaf apex was 150 170 0 more negative than for the vein base this might be the result of several effects such as the changing leaf water volume tapering of the leaf veins or leaf blade and uneven transpiration rate ogée et al 2007 there were significantly negative relationships between deuterium deviation δd and transpiration rate e that is deuterium deviation δd may have great potential to add a new diagnostic tool for understanding pathways of water transport in plant and provide an effective quantifying method for explaining water transport pathway and plant transpiration leaf water stable isotope enrichment significantly influences the isotope signatures of a number of atmospheric and biological processes barbour et al 2017 cernusak et al 2016 actually most leaves is less affected by evaporative enrichment due to they have a large amount of water in their associated tissue and veins which likely has its own péclet effect farquhar and gan 2003 the isotopic enrichment δl of bulk leaf water is often less than that predicted for evaporation sites δe by craig gordon model farquhar and gan 2003 farquhar and cernusak 2005 a concentration gradient of enriched water between vein and stomata was created during the enrichment process in leaf which results in the enriched water back diffusion helliker et al 2000 cernusak et al 2013 gerlein safdi et al 2017 but ogée et al 2007 suggest the isotopic gradient along the leaf slightly affected by the mesophyll liquid water longitudinal diffusion in our study δl of bulk leaf water was less than the measurement of mesophyll and isotope of the leaf apex and leaf blade was more enriched than the vein base by 7 18 fig 4 thus it is easy to understand why bulk leaf water δl mean value was low besides significant differences of δl were found among leaf water with different canopy positions and between sunny and cloudy day fig 3 suggesting that stronger evaporation in upper leaves caused by strong solar radiation enriched the 18o in leaf evaporation site the leaf water isotope enrichment in evaporation sites should be closely related to transpiration rate e and the relative humidity rh holloway phillips et al 2016 kaushal and ghosh 2018 lehmann et al 2017 song et al 2013 2015 wang et al 2012 our results exhibited a significant negative correlation between leaf transpiration rate e and deuterium deviation δd fig 5 hence δd should be useful for understanding variability leaf water isotope enrichment and transpiration rate associated with rh and past climatic cycles similar study of deuterium deviation in plant leaves water came from zhao et al 2014 they found significantly positive relationships between deuterium excess in plant dleaf and rh and opposite diurnal variations for dleaf during the sunny days deuterium excess or deviation in plant may provide direct evidence that dynamics of surface air moisture at continental locations can be significantly altered by plant transpiration especially during sunny days zhao et al 2014 another study showed a strong linear relationship between d excess in leaf and δ17o li et al 2017 they believed this relationship should be typical for any evaporation process or any fractionation governed by kinetic effects 5 3 the relationship between l and e and possible mechanisms we estimated effective path length l of maize in the model framework of the péclet effect the data revealed l has a negative power relationship with e with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 r2 0 546 suggesting that a pivotal role of effective path length in driving variations in leaf transpiration rate similar results were reported by song et al 2015 they showed that l was signiﬁcantly related to e in cotton l 22 3e 0 74 p 0 01 in another study kahmen et al 2010 reported that l was found to be positively related to 1 e by investigating leaf isotope enrichment in 17 species in agreement with current results a similar relationship between l and e has been obtained in response to water status ferrio et al 2010 ripullone et al 2008 and across plants leaf ontogeny barnard et al 2010 on the contrary several past results obtained under high e conditions on crop species showed that relatively constant or small l values in spite of variations in e barbour et al 2000 flanagan et al 1991a ripullone et al 2008 the mechanisms of such confused relationship however are still unclear some speculation come from previous researches suggesting that effective path length l may reflect changes in the mesophyll hydraulic properties which in turn are related with transpiration rates ferrio et al 2012 ripullone et al 2008 sack and holbrook 2006 song et al 2013 zhou et al 2011 ocheltree et al 2012 the mechanism behind the l e dynamics must analyze the relationship between 1 δl δe and e and relate to the pathways of water movement through a leaf holloway phillips et al 2016 loucos et al 2015 song et al 2013 2015 large values of l may be due to the lack of the predicted relationship between 1 δ18ol δ18oe and e inherent in the péclet effect loucos et al 2015 l must increase to extremely high values under low e if the proportional deviation of leaf water and evaporative site water 18o enrichment is constant with e because of the exponential formulation of the péclet effect loucos et al 2015 ripullone et al 2008 song et al 2015 the weak relationship between 1 δ18ol δ18oe and e can then be interpreted as a result of inverse negative power relationship between l and e ripullone et al 2008 song et al 2015 our results in fig 8 could be used to support this view suggesting a negative relationship between 1 δl δe and e under low e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 and a positively relationship under high e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 similar results reported by song et al 2013 f sw 1 δsw δe being negatively related to e under low e across six species sampling periods but being somewhat positively related to e under high e conditions under either iss or nss however some studies showed nss dynamics can result in a negative relationship between 1 δ18ol δ18oe and e in low stomatal conductance species and large leaf water concentrations species cernusak and kahmen 2013 ogée et al 2007 farquhar and gan 2003 found that 1 δsw δe did not signiﬁcantly correlate with e in castor bean contradicting the pattern of positive relationship between 1 δl δe and e reported by an early research in the same species barbour et al 2000 given the observed lack of a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between 1 δl δe and e song et al 2013 2015 reason that l should exhibit an inverse relationship with e in theory actually different effective path lengths l are associated with different water movement pathways and the symplastic resistance to flow the overall effective path length l of the maize leaves in our study was probably determined by the relative contribution of the pathways to the whole water ﬂow it is highly likely that the pathways of water movement will vary between species and will change dynamically with the change of e kim and steudle 2007 morillon and chrispeels 2001 song et al 2013 however further study is needed to confirm the conclusions across a range of environmental conditions and species which requires a large range of data points of transpiration rates and isotope composition 6 conclusions the data presented here show that maize stem water isotope composition was not consistent with that of water source differs significantly across isotope composition of maize upper stem and lower stem stem base furthermore both the slope and intercept of δ l siol ea ei were significant differences from δ l stem ea ei suggesting that isotopes fractionation occurred in processes of water transport in maize stems in arid areas this finding is important because it greatly affects the accuracy of source water calculation and roots water uptake estimation using the stable isotope method we also found deuterium deviation δl provided some key information for the study of water transport and plant transpiration as it exhibited a significant negative correlation with ea ei under both iss and nss conditions our data revealed effective path length l has a negative power relationship with e with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 r2 0 546 suggesting a pivotal role of effective path length in driving variations in leaf transpiration rate however further study about mechanisms behind l e dynamics requires a large range of data points of transpiration rates and isotope composition across a range of environmental

10197,stable isotope signature of plant water contains essential information on water transport pathway and plant transpiration which has been shown to be a powerful tracer in plant physiological and ecological processes however stable isotopes fractionation in processes of plant water transport and the relationship between transpiration rate e and effective pathway length l and their possible mechanisms are still largely mysterious and confusing here we tested stable isotope signature of maize stem and leaf based on anatomical measurements and modeling and propose a deuterium deviation in leaf water δd to understand variability leaf water isotope enrichment and transpiration we found isotopes fractionation occurred in maize stems in arid area leaf transpiration rate was strongly affected by δd the data revealed l has a negative power relationship with e with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 and the proportional deviation of leaf 18o enrichment 1 δl δe is negatively correlated with e under low e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 and a positively relationship under high e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 suggesting that a pivotal role of effective path length in driving variations in leaf transpiration rate the deuterium deviation δd may have great potential to serve as a new diagnostic tool for understanding pathways of water transport in plant care should be taken when examining source water and estimating roots water uptake using the stable isotope method in arid areas and further study is needed to be carried out and confirm the conclusions across a range of environmental

et al 2003 loucos et al 2015 indeed water of different pools in the agriculture forestry ecosystem will have very distinctive isotopic compositions gerlein safdi et al 2018 which can be effectively distinguished during the whole root water uptake process kaseke et al 2017 previous studies suggested that water uptake and transport from soil to the stem of most plants occurs without hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation and the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of transpiration δtrans are operationally deﬁned as being equal to the xylem water of plant stem under isotopic steady state iss dawson and ehleringer 1991 flanagan et al 1991b simonin et al 2013 wu et al 2016 white et al 1985 however studies revealed that direct measurements of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of transpiration are relatively rare and the few direct measurements of δtrans that exist suggest that δtrans is often not equal to the water source δs harwood et al 1998 simonin et al 2013 wang et al 2012 yakir and sternberg 2000 isotopes fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen in processes of plant water uptake and transport are still largely uncertain in particular for the halophytes and plants in arid areas while deuterium excess d excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 is widely used in atmospheric and meteorological science risi et al 2013 and ice core data analysis luz et al 2009 it is rarely used to interpret isotope fractionation processes in plant physiology however d excess may contain additional information than the isotopologues taken separately because it combines both 2h and 18o isotopic signals gerlein safdi et al 2018 li et al 2017 voelker et al 2014 it would have great potential to serve as a new diagnostic tool for understanding pathways of water transport in plant if deuterium excess could be applied to plant tissues ehleringer et al 2010 in order to better understand the water transport pathway and plant transpiration mechanism related to isotope fractionation of stem and leaf water the variation extent in d excess of leaf water and the relationships between plant transpiration rate e and d excess in leaf water should be considered leaf water isotopic composition and isotope enrichment may contain information on the transport pathways within and beyond the plant stem xylem barbour et al 2017 gradients in isotope enrichment of leaf water may vary with the different water movement pathways between leaf evaporating surface and the vein barbour and farquhar 2004 however ambiguous results were found in subsequent test of this suggestion even the gradients in enrichment within the mesophyll was questioned barbour et al 2017 the causal relationships between pathways water movement and leaf anatomical properties are difﬁcult to establish due to the complexity of the strongly interrelated nature of leaf anatomical traits and outside xylem water transport barbour et al 2017 sack et al 2015 it will provide a tractable way forward when linking the speciﬁc hydraulic characteristics with the patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment particularly with respect to water movement pathways from veins to the leaf sites of evaporation cernusak et al 2016 plavcová et al 2018 stable isotope enrichment leaf water δl will beneﬁt many applications of selecting and establishing models to analyze this process

sites δe is predicted well by craig gordon model but that of bulk leaf water is often overestimated enriched water back diffusion from evaporative site was limited by the advection of plant transpiration stream with less enriched water péclet effect farquhar and gan 2003 holloway phillips et al 2016 in sampling across many different species vein leaf saturated moisture contents and vein densities holloway phillips et al 2016 demonstrated the significance of accounting for the relative pool sizes of the mesophyll and vascular water to explain péclet effect to scale the péclet effect to that relevant for sampling of bulk leaf water and obtain more information on transport pathways within vein mesophyll system both the tortuosity of the water associated with the veins and the pathways within the leaf must be considered a péclet effective pathway length l for convenience was commonly used ellsworth et al 2013 farquhar and gan 2003 loucos et al 2015 ripullone et al 2008 song et al 2013 however the relationship between l and e and the possible mechanisms behind l e dynamics are still uncertain especially in the field crop in arid areas in this study we report water stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope data for maize stem and leaf from arid areas of northwest china and determine the leaf water stable isotope enrichment δl deuterium excess in leaf water defined as deuterium deviations δd in this study and effective pathway length l our objectives are 1 to clarify the isotopes fractionation effect in processes of plant water absorption and transport 2 to obtain data under iss and nss and explore how transpiration rate vary with respect to leaf effective pathway length and deuterium deviations and discuss possible mechanisms dynamics behind their relationships and 3 to develop a better understanding of the transpiration mechanism and theoretical system of stable isotope to map a path for future work into understanding water transport pathways

bulk leaf water in isotopic steady state is conventionally modelled from the péclet effect and the δe as the following farquhar and lloyd 1993 6 δ l δ e 1 e is the péclet number and defined as farquhar and lloyd 1993 7 el cd where c mol m 3 is the water molar concentration equal to 55 6 103 mol m 3 and d m2 s 1 is the diffusivity in liquid water d 119 10 9 exp 637 t 136 15 cuntz et al 2007

that the eﬀective path length l can be calculated by ﬁtting eqs 1 6 and 7 to the measured δl and δv at non steady state nss the enrichment of leaf water δl can be predicted by a model iteratively at a

solved at a certain time step t in this calculation the approach of calculating l during nss requires two measured values at both the current δl t and previous δl t 1 time step simonin et al 2013 according to isotopic theory the enrichment of different water samples δ sample relative to the source water can be linked back to the relative isotope ratios r 11 δ sample r sample r source 1 isotope composition was expressed in per mil as 12 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample rsource and rstandard are the 18o 16o or 2h 1h ratios of the sample water source and the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard respectively thus we can obtain a relation between sample and δsample 13 δ sample δ sample 1 r source r standard 1 1000 by combining the expressions for δ18o and δ2h and eqs 1 and 13 we know the deuterium excess d excess as a function of the relative humidity h for conceptual simplicity we refer to deviations excess in plant leaf water δd with reference to the global meteoric water line gmwl since the intercept of gmwl is 10 caused by kinetic fractionation during the ocean free water evaporation thus deuterium deviations in leaf will have more negative

method was used and the irrigation scheduling was designed according to our previous studies wu et al 2018 fertilizer supply and other agronomic measures during the growing season was consistent with the local management 3 2 1 water isotopes the sampling and measuring time was from 14 may to 7 august 2014 and from 19 may to 3 september 2015 the water samples of soil maize stem leaf and ambient atmospheric vapor were collected the sample of plants and soil were randomly chosen within a 30 m diameter in the experimental field based on anatomical measurements maize stems and leaves were collected and were cut into 5 10 cm segments fig 1 the leaves of different canopy positions lower middle and upper were chosen to cut into smaller fragments and the veins and mesophyll were separated at the middle growth stage of maize doy 154 206 in 2014 and doy 160 208 in 2015 we chose two sunny and cloudy days for diurnal variation measurements during the diurnal measurements maize stems and leaves were collected at 2 h intervals during 00 00 24 00 then plant samplings were immediately placed inside the zip bag and water was extracted using the vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica china ambient atmospheric water vapor the mixture of transpiration evaporation and atmospheric water vapor was collected using a cold trap multi channel equipment awvct04 lica china following under such setup 1 0 1 5 ml liquid water can be collected from the ambient atmospheric water vapor per hour soil water samples were collected from the depths of 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 110 cm sampling time of ambient atmospheric water vapor and soil was the same as maize leaf and stem all the samples were collected with three replications at least and were stored in airtight container at 0 4 samples were analyzed for δ2h and δ18o by liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2130i picarro usa the analytical precision was 2 0 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o 3 2 2 environmental and physiological measurements relative humidity leaf stomatal conductance and temperatures of leaf and air were measured throughout the maize growing season using li 6400 portable photosynthesis systems li6400xt licor inc lincoln ne usa equipped with a red green blue light source li6400 18 li cor inc qiu et al 2019 ocheltree et al 2012 it should be pointed out that the measurements need to be considered in different canopy layers lower middle and upper and in different site of one certain leaf leaf base leaf mid part and leaf apex measurements were recorded before 0 5 1 h of the maize stem and leaf sampling leaf water content w kg m 2 per unit ground area was measured by weighing the fresh and dry leaves 4 results 4 1 stable oxygen 18o and hydrogen 2h isotope composition descriptive statistics of water oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition δ18o and δ2h from all the sample types soil maize stems leaves and air vapor are presented in table 1 it shows linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o of the water samples δ2h 6 0 δ18o 6 9 soil r2 0 94 δ2h 6 1 δ18o 8 3 stem r2 0 97 δ2h 3 2 δ18o 33 9 leaf r2 0 91 and δ2h 5 9 δ18o 10 5 vapor r2 0 88 the leaf water line with lower intercept and slope values reflected a strong evaporation effect on the surface of leaf water not surprisingly leaves water were the most enriched with δ18o and δ2h ranging from 11 08 to 16 99 and from 69 14 to 20 47 with mean values of 3 26 and 23 12 respectively to reduce redundancy we focused on the discussion of oxygen isotope composition δ18o only in future sections since the distribution of δ2h and δ18o showed a good uniformity significant differences were found in the isotopic compositions of different maize organs stem vein and mesophyll fig 1a the δ18o of mesophyll was much higher than that of vein and stem the distribution range of mesophyll δ18o was 7 70 16 99 with mean of 12 65 maize stem water isotope composition was less than that of vein water with δ18o ranging from 12 24 to 4 95 and mean of 9 78 but here in particular differences were found in water isotope composition of upper stem and lower stem stem base the mean value of δ18o in upper stem 10 21 was higher than lower stem 8 76 isotope composition of maize leaf water show similar distribution in different canopy positions fig 1b ranging from 11 08 to 16 99 bulk leaf water however δ18o data in a leaf suggest that there were significant differences among the leaf base leaf middle part and leaf apex fig 1c δ18o in the leaf apex was more enriched in comparison to the leaf base and leaf middle part ranging from 4 46 to 16 99 and mean of 10 59 as expected isotopic enrichment within the leaf increased from the base to the apex diurnal variations of the isotope compositions of leaf δleaf stem δstem and soil δsoil water show that δstem and δsoil had a similar distribution and variation both in sunny and cloudy day fig 2a soil water isotope composition was a little higher than maize stem water because of the strong evaporation of shallow soil water causing isotopic fractionation allison and hughes 1983 braud et al 2009 however the δstem showed a crest value at noon of sunny day which higher than the soil water indicating that isotopes fractionation occurred in processes of plant water absorption in study site it shows an increase in δleaf from early morning to midday and then decreased until early morning the next day the fluctuation range and the crest in cloudy day however were lower than that of sunny day this is due to the strong solar radiation in sunny day resulting in stronger isotopes enrichment in leaves fig 2b showed that the leaf water isotope composition exhibited a negative correlation with relative humidity rh with an r2 of 0 68 indicating that relative humidity was a crucial influential factor for leaf water isotope composition but the δstem displayed a relatively stable value regardless of relative humidity 4 1 1 leaf water 18o enrichment δl and deuterium deviation δd similar to the variations of δleaf there was an increase trend from early morning to midday and a decrease trend from midday to early morning the next day of the leaf water 18o enrichment δl fig 3 there were slight differences of δl among maize leaf in upper middle and lower layer however significant differences were found among the δl of leaf base leaf mid part and leaf apex fig 3b both in sunny and cloudy days mean 18o enrichment δl of leaf water and deuterium deviation δd were showed in fig 4 water extracted from the leaf apex and leaf blade was more enriched than the source water stem water by 15 24 along the leaf blade a progressive isotope enrichment was observed within vein water enrichment of vein water over source water was higher near the leaf apex with the midrib vein achieving of 11 and the upper vein achieving of 16 as the source water flows out of the vein and moves to the stomata it enriches in 18o evaporately and a slight enrichment of vein water was obtained due to the mixing of the isotopically distinct water back diffusion helliker et al 2000 similarly deuterium deviation δd showed a significant difference between the vein and mesophyll the δd in the mesophyll e g leaf blade and leaf apex was 150 170 0 more negative than for the vein base fig 4 our results can be used as new evidence that leaves isotopic enrichment is not occurring along the midrib but along the axis of the secondary veins this is probably because of the high water flow and low hydraulic resistance in the midrib and the large amount of unenriched water in the midrib diluting enriched water of back diffusion gerlein safdi et al 2017 4 1 2 leaf transpiration rate e and effective path length l the deuterium deviation δd in plant water pools reconstructed from the global meteoric water line gmwl clearly indicated that leaf transpiration rate e should be strongly affected by δd fig 5 lower δd values more negative were associated with higher transpiration rates the linear regression fitted to e and δd was e 0 04δd 0 36 r2 0 646 p 0 05 with small slope and intercept value might be the result of maize leaf physiological functioning the relationships between effective path length l calculating l at iss and nss and leaf transpiration rate e are showed in fig 6 l and e showed a significant inverse relationship negative power with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 r2 0 546 p 0 05 in the dataset l tended to remain within a narrow small values range when e was in the high values e 2 mmol m 2 s 1 l increased sharply when e reached the low range of values e 1 mmol m 2 s 1 and decrease towards zero when analyzing the leaf water 18o enrichment δl and effective path length l clear and significant p 0 05 negative relationship was observed between l and δl with non linear regression of δl 2 78ln l 29 93 r2 0 590 fig 6b this reflects the fact that average δl decreases if the effective path length l is long or when transpiration rate e is high the way that l and e changed in maize leaves relative to the available water source minimized their differences in δl eqs 5 and 6 ellsworth et al 2013 farquhar and lloyd 1993 5 discussion 5 1 isotopes fractionation in processes of plant water transport our results show that differences were found in water isotope composition of maize upper stem and lower stem stem base and the mean value of δstem was not consistent with that of water source i e δsoil besides a crest value at noon of sunny day was found in δstem which was higher than the soil water thus we suggest that isotopes fractionation occurred in processes of water transport in maize stems in arid areas stable isotope 18o in plant stem water had better response to the variation of soil water water source dai et al 2014 wu et al 2016 and the water isotope compositions are unchanged by plant roots uptake and during transport through the stem in most species dawson and ehleringer 1991 meißner et al 2013 white et al 1985 however isotopes fractionation of 2h were found in some wetland species salt tolerant halophytic plant and certain woody xerophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 lin and da sl sternberg 1993 zhao et al 2016 probably because in the halophytic and xerophytic plants water with a large fraction taken up thought plant roots transverses cell membranes in the endodermis before entering the root xylem and cause isotope fractionation of 2h in root stem xylem water ellsworth and williams 2007 the region of our study is scarce in water resource with a mean annual evaporation of 2000 mm and annual precipitation of 164 mm maize leaves were enriched with isotopes in this arid environment figs 3 and 4 relationships between leaf isotope enrichment δl relative to water source soil and stem and the ratio of ambient to intercellular vapor pressure ea ei for maize leaves are showed in fig 7 both isotope enrichment relative to soil water source δ l soil and stem water source δ l stem exhibited a significant negative correlation with ea ei the two regression lines should have coincided under the isotopic steady state iss fig 7a if there was no isotope fractionation during water transport in maize stem however both the slope and intercept of δ l siol ea ei were significant differences from δ l stem ea ei indicating the isotope fractionation had occurred during water uptake and the magnitude of isotope fractionation should be closely related to the deviation of the intercept and positively correlated with transpiration rates lin and da sl sternberg 1993 song et al 2015 in light of the results care should be taken when examining source water and estimating roots water uptake using the stable isotope method in halophytic and xerophytic species 5 2 leaf water isotopic signals of δl and potential applications of δd maize leaves 18o enrichment δl showed a significant difference between the vein and mesophyll and had distinct diurnal variations in sunny and cloudy day δl exhibited a significant negative correlation with ea ei in both iss and nss leaf groups indicating δl is an important factor in applications of many plant physiological and ecological processes similar to leaf isotope enrichment the deuterium deviation δd provided some key information for the study of water transport pathway and plant transpiration our data revealed that δd in leaf apex was 150 170 0 more negative than for the vein base this might be the result of several effects such as the changing leaf water volume tapering of the leaf veins or leaf blade and uneven transpiration rate ogée et al 2007 there were significantly negative relationships between deuterium deviation δd and transpiration rate e that is deuterium deviation δd may have great potential to add a new diagnostic tool for understanding pathways of water transport in plant and provide an effective quantifying method for explaining water transport pathway and plant transpiration leaf water stable isotope enrichment significantly influences the isotope signatures of a number of atmospheric and biological processes barbour et al 2017 cernusak et al 2016 actually most leaves is less affected by evaporative enrichment due to they have a large amount of water in their associated tissue and veins which likely has its own péclet effect farquhar and gan 2003 the isotopic enrichment δl of bulk leaf water is often less than that predicted for evaporation sites δe by craig gordon model farquhar and gan 2003 farquhar and cernusak 2005 a concentration gradient of enriched water between vein and stomata was created during the enrichment process in leaf which results in the enriched water back diffusion helliker et al 2000 cernusak et al 2013 gerlein safdi et al 2017 but ogée et al 2007 suggest the isotopic gradient along the leaf slightly affected by the mesophyll liquid water longitudinal diffusion in our study δl of bulk leaf water was less than the measurement of mesophyll and isotope of the leaf apex and leaf blade was more enriched than the vein base by 7 18 fig 4 thus it is easy to understand why bulk leaf water δl mean value was low besides significant differences of δl were found among leaf water with different canopy positions and between sunny and cloudy day fig 3 suggesting that stronger evaporation in upper leaves caused by strong solar radiation enriched the 18o in leaf evaporation site the leaf water isotope enrichment in evaporation sites should be closely related to transpiration rate e and the relative humidity rh holloway phillips et al 2016 kaushal and ghosh 2018 lehmann et al 2017 song et al 2013 2015 wang et al 2012 our results exhibited a significant negative correlation between leaf transpiration rate e and deuterium deviation δd fig 5 hence δd should be useful for understanding variability leaf water isotope enrichment and transpiration rate associated with rh and past climatic cycles similar study of deuterium deviation in plant leaves water came from zhao et al 2014 they found significantly positive relationships between deuterium excess in plant dleaf and rh and opposite diurnal variations for dleaf during the sunny days deuterium excess or deviation in plant may provide direct evidence that dynamics of surface air moisture at continental locations can be significantly altered by plant transpiration especially during sunny days zhao et al 2014 another study showed a strong linear relationship between d excess in leaf and δ17o li et al 2017 they believed this relationship should be typical for any evaporation process or any fractionation governed by kinetic effects 5 3 the relationship between l and e and possible mechanisms we estimated effective path length l of maize in the model framework of the péclet effect the data revealed l has a negative power relationship with e with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 r2 0 546 suggesting that a pivotal role of effective path length in driving variations in leaf transpiration rate similar results were reported by song et al 2015 they showed that l was signiﬁcantly related to e in cotton l 22 3e 0 74 p 0 01 in another study kahmen et al 2010 reported that l was found to be positively related to 1 e by investigating leaf isotope enrichment in 17 species in agreement with current results a similar relationship between l and e has been obtained in response to water status ferrio et al 2010 ripullone et al 2008 and across plants leaf ontogeny barnard et al 2010 on the contrary several past results obtained under high e conditions on crop species showed that relatively constant or small l values in spite of variations in e barbour et al 2000 flanagan et al 1991a ripullone et al 2008 the mechanisms of such confused relationship however are still unclear some speculation come from previous researches suggesting that effective path length l may reflect changes in the mesophyll hydraulic properties which in turn are related with transpiration rates ferrio et al 2012 ripullone et al 2008 sack and holbrook 2006 song et al 2013 zhou et al 2011 ocheltree et al 2012 the mechanism behind the l e dynamics must analyze the relationship between 1 δl δe and e and relate to the pathways of water movement through a leaf holloway phillips et al 2016 loucos et al 2015 song et al 2013 2015 large values of l may be due to the lack of the predicted relationship between 1 δ18ol δ18oe and e inherent in the péclet effect loucos et al 2015 l must increase to extremely high values under low e if the proportional deviation of leaf water and evaporative site water 18o enrichment is constant with e because of the exponential formulation of the péclet effect loucos et al 2015 ripullone et al 2008 song et al 2015 the weak relationship between 1 δ18ol δ18oe and e can then be interpreted as a result of inverse negative power relationship between l and e ripullone et al 2008 song et al 2015 our results in fig 8 could be used to support this view suggesting a negative relationship between 1 δl δe and e under low e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 and a positively relationship under high e e 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 similar results reported by song et al 2013 f sw 1 δsw δe being negatively related to e under low e across six species sampling periods but being somewhat positively related to e under high e conditions under either iss or nss however some studies showed nss dynamics can result in a negative relationship between 1 δ18ol δ18oe and e in low stomatal conductance species and large leaf water concentrations species cernusak and kahmen 2013 ogée et al 2007 farquhar and gan 2003 found that 1 δsw δe did not signiﬁcantly correlate with e in castor bean contradicting the pattern of positive relationship between 1 δl δe and e reported by an early research in the same species barbour et al 2000 given the observed lack of a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between 1 δl δe and e song et al 2013 2015 reason that l should exhibit an inverse relationship with e in theory actually different effective path lengths l are associated with different water movement pathways and the symplastic resistance to flow the overall effective path length l of the maize leaves in our study was probably determined by the relative contribution of the pathways to the whole water ﬂow it is highly likely that the pathways of water movement will vary between species and will change dynamically with the change of e kim and steudle 2007 morillon and chrispeels 2001 song et al 2013 however further study is needed to confirm the conclusions across a range of environmental conditions and species which requires a large range of data points of transpiration rates and isotope composition 6 conclusions the data presented here show that maize stem water isotope composition was not consistent with that of water source differs significantly across isotope composition of maize upper stem and lower stem stem base furthermore both the slope and intercept of δ l siol ea ei were significant differences from δ l stem ea ei suggesting that isotopes fractionation occurred in processes of water transport in maize stems in arid areas this finding is important because it greatly affects the accuracy of source water calculation and roots water uptake estimation using the stable isotope method we also found deuterium deviation δl provided some key information for the study of water transport and plant transpiration as it exhibited a significant negative correlation with ea ei under both iss and nss conditions our data revealed effective path length l has a negative power relationship with e with a single power function of l 284 77e 1 02 r2 0 546 suggesting a pivotal role of effective path length in driving variations in leaf transpiration rate however further study about mechanisms behind l e dynamics requires a large range of data points of transpiration rates and isotope composition across a range of environmental

dry matter accumulation ratio root active absorption area and diameters of the vascular bundle and xylem vessels increased significantly the average yield of summer maize under the st treatment was 11 2 higher than that of the nt treatment over the four study years the water use efficiency was also 16 5 higher in the st treatment these results demonstrate that the st treatment of summer maize improved the infiltration of precipitation and irrigation into the soil reduced the e promoted root growth and increased the maize kernel weight thereby collectively achieving improved water use efficiency and summer maize yields keywords north china plain summer maize tillage methods water saving and consumption root growth and physiology water use efficiency 1 introduction for countries and regions with large populations and limited land resources multiple cropping systems are an effective way to address issues of food security if field heat is allowed gao et al 2020 however in some areas water shortages restrict the development of multiple cropping systems in the north china plain ncp the primary agricultural area of china and the world double cropping systems consisting of winter wheat summer maize have been used widely kuang et al 2020 this system makes full use of the crop growth time and effectively improves crop yields thereby providing economic stabilization and social development in the region xiao and tao 2014 however the ncp is in a semi arid and semi humid area and the monsoon climate is significant so the annual precipitation is low and occurs primarily in the summer thus the double cropping system in the ncp has enough heat but a shortage of water resources gleeson et al 2012 to ensure continuous crop yields irrigation is provided by groundwater exploitation but the long term overexploitation of the groundwater in the ncp has resulted in the largest groundwater funnel in the world pan et al 2014 therefore there is an urgent need to use precipitation and irrigation more efficiently and reduce the ineffective consumption of water to protect the agricultural ecological environment tillage is an important practice that improves the soil physical structure changes water infiltration promotes the water storage and supply capacity and regulates root growth and development govaerts et al 2006 cai et al 2014 liu et al 2015 soltanabadi et al 2008 appropriate tillage methods can accelerate the infiltration of surface water and reduce ineffective evaporation vita et al 2007 sun et al 2018 conversely unsuitable tillage methods can reduce surface water infiltration accelerate ineffective evaporation affect the downward growth of roots and ultimately reduce crop yields bogunovic et al 2018 in the ncp the primary planting model is the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system and during the summer growing season summer maize receives more rainfall than the crops covering the other seasons for many years no tillage techniques have been used for summer maize following the harvest of winter wheat and shallow rotary tillage has been adopted for winter wheat usually shallower than the 15 cm soil layer guan et al 2014 although heat resources can be fully used no tillage leads to higher soil compaction which causes early root senescence and plant lodging because the compacted soil is not conducive to water infiltration and the rooting of the maize plants ren et al 2018 thus increases in the summer maize yields are limited to overcome these limitations the ncp must adopt optimized soil tillage techniques to improve the soil physical and chemical properties which will then increase the soil water storage and supply capacity subsoiling has been used to winter wheat production in china but not to maize when applied to summer maize subsoiling results in more efficient precipitation irrigation storage however optimized subsoiling techniques require overcoming or minimizing the negative effects of soil subsoiling separation and seed sowing operations in order to avoid agricultural production delays loss of heat resources high mechanical operation associated costs and uneven sowing to address these issues we developed a maize subsoiling precision seeding machine zhao and zhang 2012 for small scale farmers in china to ensure the sowing quality the machine integrates subsoiling and sowing through alternating loosening and sowing processes in this study we used this machine to conduct subsoiling tillage in summer maize from 2014 to 2017 and investigated the effects on ⅰ the soil bulk density porosity and other physical properties ⅱ the infiltration of irrigation and precipitation the water distribution dynamics in the different soil layers the inhibition of soil evaporation and reductions in farmland water consumption and ⅲ the root and water distributions in the different soil layers and the corresponding physiological characteristics of the roots the effects of the subsoiling tillage on the root water apposition of summer maize the yield formation and the relationship between the yield and water use efficiency wue were also analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description

water infiltration depth the soil water content volumetric water content was determined with a trime pico portable moisture measuring instrument after the planting the volumetric water content of the 0 200 cm soil mass with a 20 cm soil layer interval was measured every 5 7 days after irrigation or precipitation with the help of the support structure fixed around the measuring pipe the water content was measured using the observation lane which prevented crop and soil structure damage around the measuring pipe and the corresponding volume of water was added for calibration to calculate the infiltration depth of irrigation or precipitation if the difference in the value of the water content after irrigation or precipitation and the water content before irrigation or precipitation was greater than zero in a given soil layer then the water was considered to have infiltrated the soil layer the deepest soil layer subject to water infiltration i e values greater than zero was recorded as the infiltration depth 2 3 3 soil evaporation and field evapotranspiration rate the soil evaporation e was measured using micro lysimeter which consisted of an outer barrel diameter 110 mm height

into the root zone due to the deep soil profile high infiltration rate and large water holding capacity runoff was never observed in the field when the groundwater depth is 2 5 m the values of d and cr can be ignored sang and wang 2016 the groundwater depth in the test area is 122 1 m so d 0 and cr 0 2 3 4 root activity and active absorption area the plants were sampled at the v3 v6 v12 vt r3 and r6 summer maize growth stages using the whole specimen method liu et al 2007 every third plant in a row was sampled with a 1 2 line spacing 30 cm on both sides and a 2 3 plant spacing 16 cm from the 2 plants on the edge of the row root samples were collected for each 20 cm soil layer collecting methods are shown in fig 3 following washing the root activity was analysed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ttc reduction method steponkus and lanphear 1967 and the active absorption area of the roots during milky ripening was determined by methylene adsorption method wu and xia 2006 2 3 5 root dry matter accumulation and root amplitude according to the square whole specimen method the 0 100 cm root layers were collected in 20 cm intervals at the mature stage cleaned dried at 120 c for 30 min to inactivate the enzymes and subsequently dried at 80 c to a constant weight the dry matter weight of the roots was measured on an analytical balance root sections from the 0 40 cm soil layer 10 cm layers was also collected at the mature stage fig 3b and the root width between plants and rows was measured with a ruler 2 3 6 root tissue structure during the milk stage the field excavation method was used to excavate three consecutive maize roots liu et al 2009 the second and third round roots were dug from the root system in the 10 20 cm soil layer following washing a representative 30 segment root was selected and fixed in formalin acetic acid alcohol faa fixative and the root tissue structure was observed by paraffin sectioning and staining with saffron each slice thickness was 12 µm each root cross section was measured using cellsens software olympus corp 2 3 7 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue was calculated as 6 w u e k g m m y e t where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and et is evapotranspiration mm see equation 5 above 2 3 8 grain yield and yield components before the harvest the number of ears per unit area was counted in each plot and 40 random plants per plot were selected to determine the kernel numbers per ear and 100 grain weight forty consecutive ears were harvested by hand from the three middle rows of each plot to determine the yield at 14 moisture and ear characteristics including the kernel number per row barren tip and 100 grain weight 2 4 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss 21 0 for windows software package a least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 was used to separate the treatment means exhibiting significant differences 3 results 3 1 soil bulk density and porosity compared to the nt treatment the soil bulk density of the st treatment in the 0 30 cm soil layer decreased by 6 4 on average over the entire growth period the st treatment effect of reducing the soil bulk density varied across the soil layers the maximum soil bulk density reduction was observed in the 20 30 cm soil layer which was 7 8 lower than that of the nt treatment group fig 4a c the total soil porosity was significantly increased by the st treatment during the entire growth period the total porosity of the 0 30 cm soil layer under the st treatment was 7 1 higher than that of the nt treatment the largest increase 8 9 occurred in the 20 30 cm soil layer fig 4d f the soil porosity includes non capillary and capillary porosity and non capillary porosity is closely related to the soil aeration infiltration and water storage capacity the increased total porosity in the st group is primarily due to the increased non capillary porosity the non capillary porosity of the 0 30 cm soil layer increased by 14 1 over the entire growth period compared to nt there were no differences and there was obvious regularity between the different treatments regarding capillary porosity fig 4j i comparative analyses revealed similar trends in 2017 and 2016 3 2 water storage and consumption of summer maize farmland under different tillage methods 3 2 1 dynamics of soil water content in 2 m soil the water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer fluctuated significantly under nt treatment but less so under st treatment fig 5 the soil water content below 40 cm increased gradually with maize growth under st treatment however the water contents of the different soil layers were inconsistent possibly due to differences in the weather conditions of the four testing years as well as variations in the precipitation and irrigation for example there was a severe drought in 2014 and irrigation was needed to ensure normal maize growth after irrigation the 30 isoline of the water content in the 40 120 cm soil layer treated with st was elevated compared to nt the rapid infiltration of irrigation also led to a higher water storage capacity in the soil below 80 cm under st treatment at the end of the summer maize growth period the 33 isoline of the soil water content shifted from 160 cm at the seeding stage to 120 cm at the maturity stage under the st treatment and dropped to 180 cm at the maturity stage under the nt treatment fig 5a b the four annual tests fig 6 also revealed that the st treatment induced marginal water content changes in the soil layer above 40 cm and significant increases in the middle 40 80 cm and deeper layers 80 120 cm and 120 200 cm overall the soil water content in the 40 200 cm soil layer treated with st was 25 45 mm higher than the nt treatment group 3 2 2 infiltration and distribution of water in the soil after precipitation and irrigation when the precipitation intensity was 25 mm d 1 the infiltration depth did not differ between the two treatments p 0 05 fig 7a c when the precipitation intensity was 25 45 mm d 1 the water infiltrated deeper in the st treatment than in the nt treatment p 0 05 fig 7a c and 42 9 of the precipitation in the st treatment infiltrated to the 50 cm soil layer but it only infiltrated to the 40 cm soil layer in the nt treatment when the precipitation intensity increased to 45 65 mm d 1 or the irrigation amount reached 45 65 mm the maximum water infiltration depth reached 80 cm under st treatment while was less than 70 cm under nt treatment fig 7a b when the precipitation intensity exceeded 65 mm d 1 or the irrigation amount exceeded 65 mm water infiltrated into the 100 cm soil layer in the st treatment but only to the 80 cm soil layer in the nt treatment fig 7a b the daily precipitation or irrigation amount was 45 65 mm the soil water content was measured 24 h after precipitation or irrigation it was found that the water storage ratio of the 20 cm soil layer was 64 6 of the corresponding precipitation or irrigation amount under st treatment which was significantly higher than the 42 7 found under nt treatment particularly in the 20 40 cm soil layer the average water storage capacity under st treatment was 41 0 which was clearly higher than the 29 4 observed under nt treatment fig 8 a c in addition the water storage capacity under st treatment was higher than that under nt treatment under the 40 cm soil layer 3 2 3 soil evaporation e and field evapotranspiration et rate dynamic analyses of the daily evaporation and field evapotranspiration rate were conducted fig 9 the e and et rate were higher for the nt treatment the numbers of days in which the et rate were higher than 8 mm d 1 6 mm d 1 and 4 mm d 1 were 0 6 and 4 days for the st treatment respectively where as the numbers of days for the nt treatment were 5 31 and 18 days respectively over the four summer maize seasons the average et under st treatment was 3 36 mm d 1 or 5 6 lower than that of the nt treatment and the average e of the st treatment was 1 38 mm d 1 or 11 5 lower than the nt treatment fig 10 a d the et at the seedling and ear stages were significantly lower under the st treatment with average decreases of 7 7 and 7 6 respectively the difference in the et between the two treatments at the flowering stage was non significant the accumulation of e at the seedling ear and flowering milking stages over the four test years was significantly lower under the st treatment than under the nt treatment 3 3 root growth physiology and morphological characteristics of summer maize under different tillage methods 3 3 1 root dry matter accumulation and root amplitude the different tillage treatments aﬀected the root dry matter proportion of the summer maize fig 11 a d the root dry matter proportion of the 0 20 cm soil layer in the st treatment was 8 5 lower than that of the nt treatment during the four growth stages in the 20 40 cm soil layer the root dry matter proportion of the st treatment was 6 7 higher than that of the nt treatment in the 40 60 cm soil layer the root dry matter proportion of the st treatment was significantly higher than it was for the nt treatment except for in 2017 when there were no differences between the treatments the root dry matter proportion in the 60 100 cm soil layer did not differ between the st and nt additionally as shown in fig 11 e h the average inter row and inter plant root width in the 20 40 cm soil layer was 14 6 cm for the st treatment which was significantly higher than it was for the nt treatment average 12 4 cm 3 3 2 root active absorption area and root activity the st treatment significantly increased the root active absorption area during the grain filling stage fig 12 a d the proportion of the root active absorption area for the st treatment during the four summer maize seasons was 7 3 higher in the 20 40 cm soil layer and 2 6 higher in the 40 60 cm soil layer compared to the nt treatment moreover the st treatment significantly improved the root activity in the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 12 the root activity of the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers for the st treatment over the four summer maize seasons were 33 0 and 35 7 higher respectively compared to those of the nt treatment fig 12 e l the increases in the root activity varied across seasons the greatest increase occurred in 2015 when the root activity of the st treatment was 59 5 higher in the 0 20 cm soil layer and 100 9 higher in the 20 40 cm soil layer overall the root distribution of the st treatment was more uniform especially the proportion of dry matter accumulation and root active absorption area at 40 cm and below with subsoiling treatment the proportion of root systems in the deep soil increased significantly consistent with increased soil water contents in the same layer this trend likely plays an important role in the root water apposition of summer maize improving the soil water use capacity and promoting crop growth 3 3 3 root tissue structure compared to the nt treatment st decreased the thickness of the root cortex and the proportion of the pith area in the vascular bundle by 9 1 and 4 2 respectively st also increased the vascular bundle and xylem vessel diameters by 17 8 and 17 4 respectively table 2 the number of cortical layers increased in 2014 severe drought and decreased in 2016 abundant precipitation table 2 3 4 summer maize yield and water use efficiency under different tillage methods the average yield of the st treatment for the four summer maize seasons was 11 041 6 kg ha 1 11 2 higher than that of the nt treatment table 3 higher st yields were associated with a higher 100 grain weight from 2014 to 2017 and more kernels per ear in 2014 and 2016 ear bald tip was also distinctly reduced under the st treatments in 2014 2016 and 2017 improved crop water use efficiency is a key objective of agricultural water saving projects the effects of subsoiling tillage in summer maize farmlands have been well documented in previous studies this tillage changes the soil physical properties significantly accelerates precipitation and irrigation infiltration improves the soil water storage capacity in the middle and deep layers and inhibits surface evaporation all of which help to maintain the soil water these changes also induce the deep rooting of the root system and improve the dry matter accumulation and active absorption area of the middle and deep soil roots which delays early root system senescence and promotes maize growth and yield the results of this four year experiment also show that the st treatment significantly increased the yield and wue of summer maize the st treatment improved the wue by 12 4 23 5 compared to the nt treatment and it increased the water storage capacity of the 2 m soil layer table 4 4 discussion the key technologies for efficient farmland water use include improving the soil physical structure by optimizing the farming methods increasing the water infiltration rate reducing surface water evapotranspiration and increasing the soil water storage capacity vita et al 2007 different farming methods have advantages and disadvantages for the soil composition and crop yield rochette et al 2009 bossio et al 2010 for example deep soil tillage can reduce the soil bulk density of the plow layer improve permeability and facilitate root development but long term soil plowing is not conducive to saving water ferro et al 2014 mu et al 2018 no tillage can reduce soil evaporation and maintain the stability of the soil community structure but long term no tillage increases the bulk density of the upper soil which is not conducive to irrigation and precipitation infiltration no tillage also influences crop root development and total yields mu et al 2018 borghei et al 2008 studies have demonstrated the efficacy of st treatments in enhancing the capacity of the soil to retain water either alone or in combination with no till or rotary tillage these water saving techniques could improve the water use efficiency of the current and future seasons mohanty et al 2007 soltanabadi et al 2008 hou et al 2011 however studies investigating subsoiling technology have been limited to the soil physical structures sessiz et al 2010 haytham et al 2015 hydrothermal dynamics root formation bian et al 2016 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 and ageing mohanty et al 2007 soltanabadi et al 2008 given that the root soil water is an integrated ecosystem it is essential to study the st regulation of these processes systematically and to explore the relationships between the root system and soil water storage to improve the water use efficiency 4 1 soil physical properties optimized soil physical properties can improve the spatial temporal distribution of crop roots and increase the water and nutrient supplies to achieve higher crop yields borghei et al 2008 kuang et al 2020 tillage is the most direct method for optimizing the physical soil properties and changing the solid liquid gas ratio hou et al 2012 in the ncp the long term shallow rotation tillage of winter wheat and the no tillage of summer maize have significantly elevated the plough pan and worsened the physical properties of the soil guan et al 2014 which affects crop root growth prior work showed that the crop yield is reduced by soil compaction under a continuous no tillage system peixoto et al 2019 whereas our study showed that the st treatment increased the soil porosity and that the increased proportion of non capillary porosity enhanced the soil water storage capacity we found that subsoiling tillage could reduce the soil bulk density and increase the soil porosity and soil water content in the middle deep layer 20 120 cm guan et al 2014 peixoto et al 2019 these results are consistent with prior reports and suggest that subsoiling tillage loosens the soil and makes it more porous which helps to maintain the soil water and improve the crop root environment 4 2 soil water storage and root development plant roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil and produce hormones and amino acids ferro et al 2014 guan et al 2014 these metabolic substances are then transported in the xylem sap to the aboveground parts of the plant for physiological activities and biomass accumulation noguchi et al 2005 root development may also influence the plant s water and nutrient use efficiency therefore healthy roots are a key component of high crop yields bian et al 2016 the effect of different tillage methods on the crop root system is significant govaerts et al 2006 guan et al 2014 for example long term no tillage is unfavourable for maize root growth leading to decreased root biomass a smaller spatial distribution and premature senescence hou et al 2016 subsoiling enhances root system growth including the downward movement of the center of gravity of the root and the maintenance of physiological activities guan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 cai et al 2014 our results are consistent with these observations the active absorption layer of the root is closely related to the growth period of the crop and a previous study showed that before the jointing stage of maize the active absorption layer of the root was above 20 cm after the jointing stage the active absorption layer continuously moved downward to 30 40 cm at the milky mature stage from which the roots absorbed the most water and nutrients guan et al 2006 we found in our research that in ncp area no tillage in successive years in maize planting season and shallow rotary tillage in wheat planting season resulted in plow pan moving up and plowing layer becoming shallower which negatively affected water infiltration and storage breaking the plow pan through subsoiling tillage can effectively promote water infiltration into the deeper soil layer and lead to the phenomenon of the infiltration of precipitation and irrigation into the middle and deep soil layers the better infiltration of irrigation and rainfall water under st might reduce the surface soil water contents which reduced the soil evaporation in addition the increased growth under st increased the lai larger lai would result in the change in the ratio of crop transpiration and soil evaporation our study showed that subsoiling promoted the distribution of maize roots below the plough layer and increased the dry matter accumulation of the roots in the 20 40 cm soil layer these results were similar to those reported by guan et al 2006 the active absorption area and root activity were also significantly improved st treatment reduced the number of root cortex layers and increased the xylem vessel diameter which facilitated the transmembrane transport of water from the soil to the plant in summary the st treatment effectively equalized the root spatial temporal distribution promoted root activity via improved soil water capacity and changed the concordant root tissue structure to improve the water absorption and transmission function of the roots 4 3 influence of subsoiling tillage on maize yield components studies have shown that deep soil loosening or subsoiling tillage and conventional tillage methods can increase the water use efficiency and yield of wheat mu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 li et al 2016 subsoiling tillage can also improve the dry matter accumulation and fertilizer utilization efficiency of wheat corn and other crops bogunovic et al 2018 raper and bergtold 2007 borghei et al 2008 sessiz et al 2010 our study showed that the average annual yield under st treatment was 11 041 6 kg ha 1 which was 11 2 higher than that under nt treatment the st treatment did not affect the ear number per unit area but significantly affected the grain weight except in 2014 table 3 the increase in grain weight may be due to the higher water storage capability of the soil and the improved root growth during the late growth stage there were severe drought conditions in 2014 and the st treatment was associated with the largest yield increase among the four test years 16 9 compared to the nt treatment due to the increased grain number per ear table 3 yield variations in 2014 and 2016 indicate that the st treatment is better than the nt treatment for drought or heat stress conditions these results suggest that the st treatment can partly overcome the reductions in grain numbers per ear and 100 grain weight which may be due to the elongation of the anthesis silking interval insufficient grain filling during the later stages and more barren tips under drought or heat stress conditions 4 4 practical application of subsoiling tillage in china agricultural production is mostly small scale and family based with small operation units low efficiency and weak resistance to risk which reduces the enthusiasm of grain producing farmers in areas with limited water and heat resources it is necessary to implement improved management strategies to simplify the operation process increase stable yields and match the agricultural machinery and agronomic demands to the existing small mechanical equipment of the farmers prior reports have shown that the combination of three tillage methods subsoiling plowing and no tillage can improve the soil structure water storage wue and grain yield liu et al 2015 therefore the flexible application of multiple tillage methods is also an important measure for improving the soil structure and crop yield soltanabadi et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 although subsoiling tillage can improve the soil physical properties and maize yield it is necessary to consider the tillage method of winter wheat to establish an optimal tillage strategy for wheat maize double cropping systems in the ncp in this study shallow rotary tillage has been consistently used for winter wheat after four annual tests it is clear that the st treatment of summer maize has considerable advantages related to high yields and efficiency as well as ecological benefits in an area that is water and heat resource restricted such as the ncp nonetheless to improve the stability and adaptability of planting gradually additional studies are required to clarify the agronomic mechanisms of the st treatment i e the long term effects on the soil physical and chemical properties changes to the soil microorganisms and greenhouse gas emissions considering the post effect of subsoiling on the soil and the input of required mechanical power subsoiling is generally conducted at different year intervals which has been reported in many studies zhang et al 2017 he et al 2019 therefore the next step of our research will be aimed at studying subsoiling intervals under different soil types in maize fields to promote the implementation of efficient soil rotation patterns with subsoiling at the core of wheat maize double cropping systems we expect that the improved technologies and accumulated practical experience from large scale land circulation in china the transfer of land management rights namely land use rights by farmers to other farmers or economic organizations will accelerate and bolster the tillage and planting methodologies to further develop large scale agriculture 5 conclusions the subsoiling tillage of summer maize can significantly promote the infiltration of irrigation and high intensity precipitation into the middle and deep soil layers reduce the et and e optimize the root tissue structure induce horizontal and vertical root elongation and form a spatial temporal coupling of the root system and the water storage layer these improvements can lead to a water root positioning coordinate which coordinates the water supply and demand balance alleviates root senescence and improves the yields and wue higher soil water storage during the summer maize season is also favorable for winter wheat in the ncp where water resources are severely

10198,farmland water management includes improving soil properties optimizing root distribution promoting rainfall and irrigation infiltration reducing soil water evaporation increasing water storage and utilizing precipitation and irrigation efficiently through appropriate tillage methods these factors are important for summer maize planting systems in areas of extreme water deficiency and hot rainy seasons such as the north china plain ncp a four season field experiment was conducted on summer maize to compare the influences and mechanisms of two tillage methods no tillage nt and subsoiling tillage st on the water conservation and yield the st treatment promoted irrigation and rainfall infiltration and the water storage capacity in the 2 m soil layer increased by 18 3 mm in the st treatment over the entire growth period compared to the nt treatment the field evapotranspiration et and soil evaporation e intensities of the st treatment were 5 6 and 11 5 lower than those of the nt treatment respectively compared to the nt treatment the st treatment increased the root width in the 20 40 cm soil layer by 17 8 on average and the proportion of root activity by 36 7 the root

improved the infiltration of precipitation and irrigation into the soil reduced the e promoted root growth and increased the maize kernel weight thereby collectively achieving improved water use efficiency and summer maize yields keywords north china plain summer maize tillage methods water saving and consumption root growth and physiology water use efficiency 1 introduction for countries and regions with large populations and limited land resources multiple cropping systems are an effective way to address issues of food security if field heat is allowed gao et al 2020 however in some areas water shortages restrict the development of multiple cropping systems in the north china plain ncp the primary agricultural area of china and the world double cropping systems consisting of winter wheat summer maize have been used widely kuang et al 2020 this system makes full use of the crop growth time and effectively improves crop yields thereby providing economic stabilization and social development in the region xiao and tao 2014 however the ncp is in a semi arid and semi humid area and the monsoon climate is significant so the annual precipitation is low and occurs primarily in the summer thus the double cropping system in the ncp has enough heat but a shortage of water resources gleeson et al 2012 to ensure continuous crop yields irrigation is provided by groundwater exploitation but the long term overexploitation of the groundwater in the ncp has resulted in the largest groundwater funnel in the world pan et al 2014 therefore there is an urgent need to use precipitation and irrigation more efficiently and reduce the ineffective consumption of water to protect the agricultural ecological environment tillage is an important practice that improves the soil physical structure changes water infiltration promotes the water storage and supply capacity and regulates root growth and development govaerts et al 2006 cai et al 2014 liu et al 2015 soltanabadi et al 2008 appropriate tillage methods can accelerate the infiltration of surface water and reduce ineffective evaporation vita et al 2007 sun et al 2018 conversely unsuitable tillage methods can reduce surface water infiltration accelerate ineffective evaporation affect the downward growth of roots and ultimately reduce crop yields bogunovic et al 2018 in the ncp the primary planting model is the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system and during the summer growing season summer maize receives more rainfall than the crops covering the other seasons for many years no tillage techniques have been used for summer maize following the harvest of winter wheat and shallow rotary tillage has been adopted for winter wheat usually shallower than the 15 cm soil layer guan et al 2014 although heat resources can be fully used no tillage leads to higher soil compaction which causes early root senescence and plant lodging because the compacted soil is not conducive to water infiltration and the rooting of the maize plants ren et al 2018 thus increases in the summer maize yields are limited to overcome these limitations the ncp must adopt optimized soil tillage techniques to improve the soil physical and chemical properties which will then increase the soil water storage and supply capacity subsoiling has been used to winter wheat production in china but not to maize when applied to summer maize subsoiling results in more efficient precipitation irrigation storage however optimized subsoiling techniques require overcoming or minimizing the negative effects of soil subsoiling separation and seed sowing operations in order to avoid agricultural production delays loss of heat resources high mechanical operation associated costs and uneven sowing to address these issues we developed a maize subsoiling precision seeding machine zhao and zhang 2012 for small scale farmers in china to ensure the sowing quality the machine integrates subsoiling and sowing through alternating loosening and sowing processes in this study we used this machine to conduct subsoiling tillage in summer maize from 2014 to 2017 and investigated the effects on ⅰ the soil bulk density porosity and other physical properties ⅱ the infiltration of irrigation and precipitation the water distribution dynamics in the different soil layers the inhibition of soil evaporation and reductions in farmland water consumption and ⅲ the root and water distributions in the different soil layers and the corresponding physiological characteristics of the roots the effects of the subsoiling tillage on the root water apposition of summer maize the yield formation and the relationship between the yield and water use efficiency wue were also analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description

water infiltration depth the soil water content volumetric water content was determined with a trime pico portable moisture measuring instrument after the planting the volumetric water content of the 0 200 cm soil mass with a 20 cm soil layer interval was measured every 5 7 days after irrigation or precipitation with the help of the support structure fixed around the measuring pipe the water content was measured using the observation lane which prevented crop and soil structure damage around the measuring pipe and the corresponding volume of water was added for calibration to calculate the infiltration depth of irrigation or precipitation if the difference in the value of the water content after irrigation or precipitation and the water content before irrigation or precipitation was greater than zero in a given soil layer then the water was considered to have infiltrated the soil layer the deepest soil layer subject to water infiltration i e values greater than zero was recorded as the infiltration depth 2 3 3 soil evaporation and field evapotranspiration rate the soil evaporation e was measured using micro lysimeter which consisted of an outer barrel diameter 110 mm height

four evaporators were used per plot the soil quality was measured daily and the undisturbed soil was replaced every 3 5 days after rainfall or irrigation after the replacement of the undisturbed soil the replaced soil was backfilled into the previous set of buckets sun et al 2002 the evaporation among plants was calculated as follows 4 e i 10 m i m i 1 s where ei is the amount of daily evaporation

into the root zone due to the deep soil profile high infiltration rate and large water holding capacity runoff was never observed in the field when the groundwater depth is 2 5 m the values of d and cr can be ignored sang and wang 2016 the groundwater depth in the test area is 122 1 m so d 0 and cr 0 2 3 4 root activity and active absorption area the plants were sampled at the v3 v6 v12 vt r3 and r6 summer maize growth stages using the whole specimen method liu et al 2007 every third plant in a row was sampled with a 1 2 line spacing 30 cm on both sides and a 2 3 plant spacing 16 cm from the 2 plants on the edge of the row root samples were collected for each 20 cm soil layer collecting methods are shown in fig 3 following washing the root activity was analysed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ttc reduction method steponkus and lanphear 1967 and the active absorption area of the roots during milky ripening was determined by methylene adsorption method wu and xia 2006 2 3 5 root dry matter accumulation and root amplitude according to the square whole specimen method the 0 100 cm root layers were collected in 20 cm intervals at the mature stage cleaned dried at 120 c for 30 min to inactivate the enzymes and subsequently dried at 80 c to a constant weight the dry matter weight of the roots was measured on an analytical balance root sections from the 0 40 cm soil layer 10 cm layers was also collected at the mature stage fig 3b and the root width between plants and rows was measured with a ruler 2 3 6 root tissue structure during the milk stage the field excavation method was used to excavate three consecutive maize roots liu et al 2009 the second and third round roots were dug from the root system in the 10 20 cm soil layer following washing a representative 30 segment root was selected and fixed in formalin acetic acid alcohol faa fixative and the root tissue structure was observed by paraffin sectioning and staining with saffron each slice thickness was 12 µm each root cross section was measured using cellsens software olympus corp 2 3 7 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue was calculated as 6 w u e k g m m y e t where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and et is evapotranspiration mm see equation 5 above 2 3 8 grain yield and yield components before the harvest the number of ears per unit area was counted in each plot and 40 random plants per plot were selected to determine the kernel numbers per ear and 100 grain weight forty consecutive ears were harvested by hand from the three middle rows of each plot to determine the yield at 14 moisture and ear characteristics including the kernel number per row barren tip and 100 grain weight 2 4 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss 21 0 for windows software package a least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 was used to separate the treatment means exhibiting significant differences 3 results 3 1 soil bulk density and porosity compared to the nt treatment the soil bulk density of the st treatment in the 0 30 cm soil layer decreased by 6 4 on average over the entire growth period the st treatment effect of reducing the soil bulk density varied across the soil layers the maximum soil bulk density reduction was observed in the 20 30 cm soil layer which was 7 8 lower than that of the nt treatment group fig 4a c the total soil porosity was significantly increased by the st treatment during the entire growth period the total porosity of the 0 30 cm soil layer under the st treatment was 7 1 higher than that of the nt treatment the largest increase 8 9 occurred in the 20 30 cm soil layer fig 4d f the soil porosity includes non capillary and capillary porosity and non capillary porosity is closely related to the soil aeration infiltration and water storage capacity the increased total porosity in the st group is primarily due to the increased non capillary porosity the non capillary porosity of the 0 30 cm soil layer increased by 14 1 over the entire growth period compared to nt there were no differences and there was obvious regularity between the different treatments regarding capillary porosity fig 4j i comparative analyses revealed similar trends in 2017 and 2016 3 2 water storage and consumption of summer maize farmland under different tillage methods 3 2 1 dynamics of soil water content in 2 m soil the water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer fluctuated significantly under nt treatment but less so under st treatment fig 5 the soil water content below 40 cm increased gradually with maize growth under st treatment however the water contents of the different soil layers were inconsistent possibly due to differences in the weather conditions of the four testing years as well as variations in the precipitation and irrigation for example there was a severe drought in 2014 and irrigation was needed to ensure normal maize growth after irrigation the 30 isoline of the water content in the 40 120 cm soil layer treated with st was elevated compared to nt the rapid infiltration of irrigation also led to a higher water storage capacity in the soil below 80 cm under st treatment at the end of the summer maize growth period the 33 isoline of the soil water content shifted from 160 cm at the seeding stage to 120 cm at the maturity stage under the st treatment and dropped to 180 cm at the maturity stage under the nt treatment fig 5a b the four annual tests fig 6 also revealed that the st treatment induced marginal water content changes in the soil layer above 40 cm and significant increases in the middle 40 80 cm and deeper layers 80 120 cm and 120 200 cm overall the soil water content in the 40 200 cm soil layer treated with st was 25 45 mm higher than the nt treatment group 3 2 2 infiltration and distribution of water in the soil after precipitation and irrigation when the precipitation intensity was 25 mm d 1 the infiltration depth did not differ between the two treatments p 0 05 fig 7a c when the precipitation intensity was 25 45 mm d 1 the water infiltrated deeper in the st treatment than in the nt treatment p 0 05 fig 7a c and 42 9 of the precipitation in the st treatment infiltrated to the 50 cm soil layer but it only infiltrated to the 40 cm soil layer in the nt treatment when the precipitation intensity increased to 45 65 mm d 1 or the irrigation amount reached 45 65 mm the maximum water infiltration depth reached 80 cm under st treatment while was less than 70 cm under nt treatment fig 7a b when the precipitation intensity exceeded 65 mm d 1 or the irrigation amount exceeded 65 mm water infiltrated into the 100 cm soil layer in the st treatment but only to the 80 cm soil layer in the nt treatment fig 7a b the daily precipitation or irrigation amount was 45 65 mm the soil water content was measured 24 h after precipitation or irrigation it was found that the water storage ratio of the 20 cm soil layer was 64 6 of the corresponding precipitation or irrigation amount under st treatment which was significantly higher than the 42 7 found under nt treatment particularly in the 20 40 cm soil layer the average water storage capacity under st treatment was 41 0 which was clearly higher than the 29 4 observed under nt treatment fig 8 a c in addition the water storage capacity under st treatment was higher than that under nt treatment under the 40 cm soil layer 3 2 3 soil evaporation e and field evapotranspiration et rate dynamic analyses of the daily evaporation and field evapotranspiration rate were conducted fig 9 the e and et rate were higher for the nt treatment the numbers of days in which the et rate were higher than 8 mm d 1 6 mm d 1 and 4 mm d 1 were 0 6 and 4 days for the st treatment respectively where as the numbers of days for the nt treatment were 5 31 and 18 days respectively over the four summer maize seasons the average et under st treatment was 3 36 mm d 1 or 5 6 lower than that of the nt treatment and the average e of the st treatment was 1 38 mm d 1 or 11 5 lower than the nt treatment fig 10 a d the et at the seedling and ear stages were significantly lower under the st treatment with average decreases of 7 7 and 7 6 respectively the difference in the et between the two treatments at the flowering stage was non significant the accumulation of e at the seedling ear and flowering milking stages over the four test years was significantly lower under the st treatment than under the nt treatment 3 3 root growth physiology and morphological characteristics of summer maize under different tillage methods 3 3 1 root dry matter accumulation and root amplitude the different tillage treatments aﬀected the root dry matter proportion of the summer maize fig 11 a d the root dry matter proportion of the 0 20 cm soil layer in the st treatment was 8 5 lower than that of the nt treatment during the four growth stages in the 20 40 cm soil layer the root dry matter proportion of the st treatment was 6 7 higher than that of the nt treatment in the 40 60 cm soil layer the root dry matter proportion of the st treatment was significantly higher than it was for the nt treatment except for in 2017 when there were no differences between the treatments the root dry matter proportion in the 60 100 cm soil layer did not differ between the st and nt additionally as shown in fig 11 e h the average inter row and inter plant root width in the 20 40 cm soil layer was 14 6 cm for the st treatment which was significantly higher than it was for the nt treatment average 12 4 cm 3 3 2 root active absorption area and root activity the st treatment significantly increased the root active absorption area during the grain filling stage fig 12 a d the proportion of the root active absorption area for the st treatment during the four summer maize seasons was 7 3 higher in the 20 40 cm soil layer and 2 6 higher in the 40 60 cm soil layer compared to the nt treatment moreover the st treatment significantly improved the root activity in the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 12 the root activity of the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers for the st treatment over the four summer maize seasons were 33 0 and 35 7 higher respectively compared to those of the nt treatment fig 12 e l the increases in the root activity varied across seasons the greatest increase occurred in 2015 when the root activity of the st treatment was 59 5 higher in the 0 20 cm soil layer and 100 9 higher in the 20 40 cm soil layer overall the root distribution of the st treatment was more uniform especially the proportion of dry matter accumulation and root active absorption area at 40 cm and below with subsoiling treatment the proportion of root systems in the deep soil increased significantly consistent with increased soil water contents in the same layer this trend likely plays an important role in the root water apposition of summer maize improving the soil water use capacity and promoting crop growth 3 3 3 root tissue structure compared to the nt treatment st decreased the thickness of the root cortex and the proportion of the pith area in the vascular bundle by 9 1 and 4 2 respectively st also increased the vascular bundle and xylem vessel diameters by 17 8 and 17 4 respectively table 2 the number of cortical layers increased in 2014 severe drought and decreased in 2016 abundant precipitation table 2 3 4 summer maize yield and water use efficiency under different tillage methods the average yield of the st treatment for the four summer maize seasons was 11 041 6 kg ha 1 11 2 higher than that of the nt treatment table 3 higher st yields were associated with a higher 100 grain weight from 2014 to 2017 and more kernels per ear in 2014 and 2016 ear bald tip was also distinctly reduced under the st treatments in 2014 2016 and 2017 improved crop water use efficiency is a key objective of agricultural water saving projects the effects of subsoiling tillage in summer maize farmlands have been well documented in previous studies this tillage changes the soil physical properties significantly accelerates precipitation and irrigation infiltration improves the soil water storage capacity in the middle and deep layers and inhibits surface evaporation all of which help to maintain the soil water these changes also induce the deep rooting of the root system and improve the dry matter accumulation and active absorption area of the middle and deep soil roots which delays early root system senescence and promotes maize growth and yield the results of this four year experiment also show that the st treatment significantly increased the yield and wue of summer maize the st treatment improved the wue by 12 4 23 5 compared to the nt treatment and it increased the water storage capacity of the 2 m soil layer table 4 4 discussion the key technologies for efficient farmland water use include improving the soil physical structure by optimizing the farming methods increasing the water infiltration rate reducing surface water evapotranspiration and increasing the soil water storage capacity vita et al 2007 different farming methods have advantages and disadvantages for the soil composition and crop yield rochette et al 2009 bossio et al 2010 for example deep soil tillage can reduce the soil bulk density of the plow layer improve permeability and facilitate root development but long term soil plowing is not conducive to saving water ferro et al 2014 mu et al 2018 no tillage can reduce soil evaporation and maintain the stability of the soil community structure but long term no tillage increases the bulk density of the upper soil which is not conducive to irrigation and precipitation infiltration no tillage also influences crop root development and total yields mu et al 2018 borghei et al 2008 studies have demonstrated the efficacy of st treatments in enhancing the capacity of the soil to retain water either alone or in combination with no till or rotary tillage these water saving techniques could improve the water use efficiency of the current and future seasons mohanty et al 2007 soltanabadi et al 2008 hou et al 2011 however studies investigating subsoiling technology have been limited to the soil physical structures sessiz et al 2010 haytham et al 2015 hydrothermal dynamics root formation bian et al 2016 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 and ageing mohanty et al 2007 soltanabadi et al 2008 given that the root soil water is an integrated ecosystem it is essential to study the st regulation of these processes systematically and to explore the relationships between the root system and soil water storage to improve the water use efficiency 4 1 soil physical properties optimized soil physical properties can improve the spatial temporal distribution of crop roots and increase the water and nutrient supplies to achieve higher crop yields borghei et al 2008 kuang et al 2020 tillage is the most direct method for optimizing the physical soil properties and changing the solid liquid gas ratio hou et al 2012 in the ncp the long term shallow rotation tillage of winter wheat and the no tillage of summer maize have significantly elevated the plough pan and worsened the physical properties of the soil guan et al 2014 which affects crop root growth prior work showed that the crop yield is reduced by soil compaction under a continuous no tillage system peixoto et al 2019 whereas our study showed that the st treatment increased the soil porosity and that the increased proportion of non capillary porosity enhanced the soil water storage capacity we found that subsoiling tillage could reduce the soil bulk density and increase the soil porosity and soil water content in the middle deep layer 20 120 cm guan et al 2014 peixoto et al 2019 these results are consistent with prior reports and suggest that subsoiling tillage loosens the soil and makes it more porous which helps to maintain the soil water and improve the crop root environment 4 2 soil water storage and root development plant roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil and produce hormones and amino acids ferro et al 2014 guan et al 2014 these metabolic substances are then transported in the xylem sap to the aboveground parts of the plant for physiological activities and biomass accumulation noguchi et al 2005 root development may also influence the plant s water and nutrient use efficiency therefore healthy roots are a key component of high crop yields bian et al 2016 the effect of different tillage methods on the crop root system is significant govaerts et al 2006 guan et al 2014 for example long term no tillage is unfavourable for maize root growth leading to decreased root biomass a smaller spatial distribution and premature senescence hou et al 2016 subsoiling enhances root system growth including the downward movement of the center of gravity of the root and the maintenance of physiological activities guan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 cai et al 2014 our results are consistent with these observations the active absorption layer of the root is closely related to the growth period of the crop and a previous study showed that before the jointing stage of maize the active absorption layer of the root was above 20 cm after the jointing stage the active absorption layer continuously moved downward to 30 40 cm at the milky mature stage from which the roots absorbed the most water and nutrients guan et al 2006 we found in our research that in ncp area no tillage in successive years in maize planting season and shallow rotary tillage in wheat planting season resulted in plow pan moving up and plowing layer becoming shallower which negatively affected water infiltration and storage breaking the plow pan through subsoiling tillage can effectively promote water infiltration into the deeper soil layer and lead to the phenomenon of the infiltration of precipitation and irrigation into the middle and deep soil layers the better infiltration of irrigation and rainfall water under st might reduce the surface soil water contents which reduced the soil evaporation in addition the increased growth under st increased the lai larger lai would result in the change in the ratio of crop transpiration and soil evaporation our study showed that subsoiling promoted the distribution of maize roots below the plough layer and increased the dry matter accumulation of the roots in the 20 40 cm soil layer these results were similar to those reported by guan et al 2006 the active absorption area and root activity were also significantly improved st treatment reduced the number of root cortex layers and increased the xylem vessel diameter which facilitated the transmembrane transport of water from the soil to the plant in summary the st treatment effectively equalized the root spatial temporal distribution promoted root activity via improved soil water capacity and changed the concordant root tissue structure to improve the water absorption and transmission function of the roots 4 3 influence of subsoiling tillage on maize yield components studies have shown that deep soil loosening or subsoiling tillage and conventional tillage methods can increase the water use efficiency and yield of wheat mu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 li et al 2016 subsoiling tillage can also improve the dry matter accumulation and fertilizer utilization efficiency of wheat corn and other crops bogunovic et al 2018 raper and bergtold 2007 borghei et al 2008 sessiz et al 2010 our study showed that the average annual yield under st treatment was 11 041 6 kg ha 1 which was 11 2 higher than that under nt treatment the st treatment did not affect the ear number per unit area but significantly affected the grain weight except in 2014 table 3 the increase in grain weight may be due to the higher water storage capability of the soil and the improved root growth during the late growth stage there were severe drought conditions in 2014 and the st treatment was associated with the largest yield increase among the four test years 16 9 compared to the nt treatment due to the increased grain number per ear table 3 yield variations in 2014 and 2016 indicate that the st treatment is better than the nt treatment for drought or heat stress conditions these results suggest that the st treatment can partly overcome the reductions in grain numbers per ear and 100 grain weight which may be due to the elongation of the anthesis silking interval insufficient grain filling during the later stages and more barren tips under drought or heat stress conditions 4 4 practical application of subsoiling tillage in china agricultural production is mostly small scale and family based with small operation units low efficiency and weak resistance to risk which reduces the enthusiasm of grain producing farmers in areas with limited water and heat resources it is necessary to implement improved management strategies to simplify the operation process increase stable yields and match the agricultural machinery and agronomic demands to the existing small mechanical equipment of the farmers prior reports have shown that the combination of three tillage methods subsoiling plowing and no tillage can improve the soil structure water storage wue and grain yield liu et al 2015 therefore the flexible application of multiple tillage methods is also an important measure for improving the soil structure and crop yield soltanabadi et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 although subsoiling tillage can improve the soil physical properties and maize yield it is necessary to consider the tillage method of winter wheat to establish an optimal tillage strategy for wheat maize double cropping systems in the ncp in this study shallow rotary tillage has been consistently used for winter wheat after four annual tests it is clear that the st treatment of summer maize has considerable advantages related to high yields and efficiency as well as ecological benefits in an area that is water and heat resource restricted such as the ncp nonetheless to improve the stability and adaptability of planting gradually additional studies are required to clarify the agronomic mechanisms of the st treatment i e the long term effects on the soil physical and chemical properties changes to the soil microorganisms and greenhouse gas emissions considering the post effect of subsoiling on the soil and the input of required mechanical power subsoiling is generally conducted at different year intervals which has been reported in many studies zhang et al 2017 he et al 2019 therefore the next step of our research will be aimed at studying subsoiling intervals under different soil types in maize fields to promote the implementation of efficient soil rotation patterns with subsoiling at the core of wheat maize double cropping systems we expect that the improved technologies and accumulated practical experience from large scale land circulation in china the transfer of land management rights namely land use rights by farmers to other farmers or economic organizations will accelerate and bolster the tillage and planting methodologies to further develop large scale agriculture 5 conclusions the subsoiling tillage of summer maize can significantly promote the infiltration of irrigation and high intensity precipitation into the middle and deep soil layers reduce the et and e optimize the root tissue structure induce horizontal and vertical root elongation and form a spatial temporal coupling of the root system and the water storage layer these improvements can lead to a water root positioning coordinate which coordinates the water supply and demand balance alleviates root senescence and improves the yields and wue higher soil water storage during the summer maize season is also favorable for winter wheat in the ncp where water resources are severely

results indicated that contaminants were efficiently removed from the ades when using the a sbpbr after treatment the degradation rates of cod tn an and tp were 73 78 80 67 89 74 and 95 39 respectively the outlet concentrations of cod tn an and tp were 355 09 17 90 83 97 9 37 35 42 2 65 and 0 87 29 mg l respectively in the initial stage of the process day 1 the most abundant bacteria present in the abs algal bacterial symbiosis system included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi among these those with the highest abundance values were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes abundance values were 24 33 and 19 97 respectively a sbpbr contained various microorganisms including aerobic bacteria fungus and chlorella in a reciprocal interaction bacteria and microalgae were able to use each other s metabolites under intermittent aeration conditions organic c n and p present in the macromolecules were converted to smaller species c was transformed to co2 and organic c in addition n and p stayed as part of small molecules that were used by aerobic bacteria and fungus when abs operation reached stability hydrolytic acidifying bacteria which belonged to acidobacteria were able to degrade different organic compounds including saccharides keywords photobioreactor pbr algal bacterial symbosis abs anaerobic digestion effluent ade bacterial community changes 1 introduction sustainable technologies for wastewater treatment display several advantages over traditional ones for example sustainable techniques are able to use wastewater as a resource for energy generation for this reason they have attracted the attention of experts in different areas huang et al 2015 biogas technology uses livestock and poultry manure to convert organic waste into bio energy however they result in large amounts of anaerobic digestion effluents ades these effluents usually contain high levels of organic matter that is barely degradable as well as inorganic salts containing n and p with an unbalanced c n p ratio thus ades are very difficult to treat huang et al 2015 saidu et al 2013 in this context sustainable and efficient wastewater processes that are able to treat this type of residues are important in the field of environmental technology past reports have indicated that microalgae are an excellent option for the biotreatment of wastewater since they efficiently remove inorganic salts they grow rapidly and display high adaptability foladori et al 2018 hernández et al 2016 rada ariza et al 2017 fan et al 2017 also different systems have been developed where abs are used in the pbrs taking advantage of the synergistic effect between bacteria and algae with abs it has been possible to degrade organic matter and other toxic and hazardous compounds present in wastewaters as well as to remove inorganic salts xie et al 2018 shi 2013 treated beer wastewater with an abs composed of spirulina and mycelium pellets of flammulina velutipes they showed that with this system the removal rate of cod tn and tp in the beer wastewater were 77 81 84 28 and 50 88 respectively these values were higher as compared to those obtained in a system where only microalgae were present these values were 70 59 70 17 and 37 99 in the same order liu 2012 reported similar results when they compared the performance of an abs with that of a system where only chlorella was used on another study abou shanab et al 2013 treated pig farm wastewater using six different microalgae ourococcus multisporus nitzschia cf pusilla chlamydomonas mesicana scenedesmus obliquus chlorella vulgaris and micractinium reisseri these researchers determined that the highest tn and tp removal rates were observed in wastewaters treated with micraactinium reisseri in this case tn and tp removal rates were 62 and 68 respectively in addition elmasry et al 2013 proved that a cod concentration of 1900 mg l presented the best growth rate of chlorella zofingiensis herein the corresponding tn tp and cod removal rates reached 82 7 98 2 and 79 8 respectively their results also indicated that after 24 h phenol removal reached a 95 to the best of our knowledge previous abs research has been mainly focused on the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters thus in order to determine potential new options for the sustainable remediation of ades in the present investigation three different bioreactors were used they included a abs inlet water of unsterilized ade b single microalgae inlet water of sterilized ade and c activated sludge bioreactors these systems were used to compare their performances on the treatment of ades of livestock and poultry manure we analyzed the effect of treatment conditions on cod tn an and tp in addition we determined the microbial diversity and explored the mechanism of ades degradation in the abs systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the activated sludge used in the present experiments was obtained from the wastewater treatment plant of a factory located in northern shenyang in the liaoning province the inoculated activated sludge was transported on a 25 l airtight plastic container during the transportation process the temperature decreased to 20 c however the activity was maintained later cultivation was performed with the addition of a small amount of ade maintaining a temperature of 30 c the microalga used in the present research was chlorella chlorella zofingiensis which was purchased from the institute of aquatic sciences cas and stored at 30 c when needed chlorella was placed on an oven at 20 c for 30 min for defrosting later it was cultivated at 27 c and 400 lux using the bg 11 nutrient media until the logarithmic growth phase was reached the treatments used in the present research consisted of mixtures of bg11 nutrient media containing 10 of seed solution and wastewater at ratios of 3 1 1 1 and 1 3 in addition wastewater without microorganisms was used as control treatment ades samples used in our experiments were obtained from a pilot plant used for dry fermentation of chicken manure after centrifugation at 4000 r min for 3 min sterilized and non sterilized ades were 10 fold diluted and used as the inlet water in the case of nonsterile inlet water the values for ph cod nh4 n an tn and tp were 7 24 0 4 1354 29 45 23 345 25 21 22 433 89 34 12 and 18 89 4 37 mg l respectively ph values and cod an tn and tp concentrations for sterilized inlet water were 7 03 0 32 765 33 34 17 279 86 16 82 315 19 34 12 and 14 19 3 17 mg l respectively 2 2 experimental equipment the algae assisted sequencing batch photo bioreactor a sbpbr designed for the present research consisted of a cylindrical double water bath made of organic glass the diameter height and effective volume were 40 cm 80 cm and 8 l respectively two groups of led light sources were included in the a sbpbr to provide a continuous irradiation of 3000 lux for 24 h in the lower part of the reactor a cavity provided aeration twice a day in periods of 12 h microalgae were cultivated at a constant temperature of 30 c different conditions were used for the experiments which were performed using a volume of 7 l of non sterile ade each set of conditions was labeled as r1 r2 and r3 r1 contained 500 ml chlorella od686 1 43 and 500 ml of sieved activated sludge for r2 7 l sterilized ade and 500 ml chlorella od686 1 43 were mixed experiments were performed in triplicate and the detailed information for each treatment is shown in table 1 the period of the sequencing batch experiment was 10 d during the operation 10 ml samples were taken centrifuged at 4000 r min for 3 min and concentrations of cod an tn and tp recorded the quantity of microalgae and bacteria were determined each 5 days data indicated average values 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 cod quantification for cod quantification 10 ml of potassium dichromate and 100 ml of distilled water were mixed in a 250 ml conical beaker subsequently 30 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid were incorporated and the resultant mixture was placed on an ice bath after cooling 3 drops of the ferrous iron indicator were added and the samples were titrated with ammonium ferrous sulfate until the yellow solution changed to bluish green and finally to reddish brown elmasry et al 2013 2 3 2 quantification of nh4 n tn and tp 10 ml samples were taken and centrifugated at 4000 r min for 3 min later concentrations of an tn and tp were determined in the supernatants according to the methodology indicated in the national standard methods for water quality determination tn was quantified with uv vis spectrometry after sample digestion with alkaline potassium persulfate according to gb t 11894 1989 an was quantified according to the astmd 1426 2003 standard method in addition tp was determined following the gb t 11893 1989 methodology which indicates the use of ammonium molybdate followed by uv vis quantification editorial committee of the state environmental protection administration s methods for monitoring and analysis of water and wastewater 2002 2 3 3 microalgae growth curve determination microalgae were cultivated at 30 c with an irradiation of 4000 lux microalgae growth was measured as increment in biomass which was quantified with uv vis spectrometry using a wavelength of 680 nm quantification was performed every two days in triplicate and average was reported the relationship between the microalgae biomass and absorbance followed a linear correlation in a certain range the resulting equation was x 0 290 od686 0 05 r 2 0 996 where x was the algae concentration g l od686 the absorbance value at the wavelength of 680 nm zhang et al 2015 2 3 4 determination of bacteria quantity and abundance genomic dna was extracted from the samples using the ctab or sds method the purity and concentration of dna were determined by algae gel electrophoresis for this purpose an appropriate amount of dna sample was placed in a centrifuge tube which was further diluted to 1 ng ul using sterilized water the diluted genomic dna was used as template and the specific primer with barcode was used according to the selected sequencing area pcr was performed on a phusion high fidelity pcr master mix using a gc buffer and a high efficient fidelity enzyme to guarantee the amplification efficiency and accuracy in order to identify the diversity of the bacteria we selected a primer of the 16sr4 region 515f and 806 r 2 4 data analysis

results and discussion 3 1 effect of treatment conditions on ade parameters 3 1 1 effect of treatment conditions on cod results for cod in ades treated with abs r1 sludge system r2 and pure algae system r3 are shown in fig 1 during the initial stage of the reaction 0 d the initial cod concentrations in the r1 r2 and r3 systems were 1354 29 45 23 1354 29 45 23 and 765 33 34 17 mg l respectively cod showed a decreasing trend in the first 10 days of ades treatment in the sbpbr in addition on day 3 the daily degradation rates in the r1 and r2 treatments reached the maximum values of 17 22 and 16 75 respectively on the other hand the maximum daily degradation rate in the r3 system 4 31 was observed on day 6 after the maximum point the daily cod degradation rate showed a decreasing trend with values between 4 47 and 2 86 at the end of the reaction the cumulative cod degradation rates in the three systems were 73 78 62 37 and 31 35 respectively the corresponding cod concentrations were 355 09 17 90 509 61 22 56 and 523 94 439 18 mg l respectively fig 1 shows that total cod values in ades were reduced in the three systems however the mechanisms were different the r2 system corresponded to the activated sludge treatment technology microorganisms included zoogloea an aerobic bacteria and fungus which are able to degrade organic components under aerobic conditions macromolecules were hydrolyzed into smaller molecules which were used for the metabolism and growth of the microorganisms in addition the generated co2 was discharged to the water body the r2 system corresponded to a sequencing batch reaction on days 1 and 2 the system was on an adaptive stage where the metabolic activity of the microbes was relatively weak only easily degradable organic compounds in water were utilized the daily cod degradation rates on the 1st and 2nd day were 10 31 and 6 81 respectively the system entered an increasing logarithmic phase on the 3rd and 4th day also after two days of adaptation the metabolic activity dramatically increased in this stage microbes metabolized small molecules which promoted their growth the daily cod degradation rates on the 3rd and 4th day were 16 15 and 12 00 respectively the system stabilized between days 5 and 10 where hardly degradable organic matter was metabolized through an endogenous respiratory process the corresponding daily cod degradation rate values were between 3 69 and 0 75 at the end of the reaction the cumulative cod degradation rate was 62 37 pure microalgae and sterilized ades were added to the r3 system as a consequence the amount of bacteria was small and their effect on the r3 system was neglected thus only the degradation effect of microalgae on cod was considered microalgae used an inorganic carbon source for their growth and metabolism specifically co2 and hco3 moreover co2 was the first one used by the microalgae followed by hco3 however hco3 had to be transformed to co2 before being adsorbed and immobilized by these microorganisms xie et al 2017 during the 1st and 2nd day of the reaction the daily cod degradation rates were relatively low displaying values of 2 11 and 1 34 respectively later with the utilization of co2 by the microorganisms the daily cod degradation rates gradually increased to values between 4 37 and 2 66 during days 3 10 colman et al 2002 moroney 2001 miller and colman 1980 sultemeyer et al 1991 rosenberg et al 2015 at the end of the process the cumulative cod degradation rate was 31 54 in the r1 system activated sludge and abs were used for ades treatment thus zoogloea and fungus degraded the organic carbon present in the ades the phyla present in the samples included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi according to the data proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant with percentages of 24 33 and 19 97 respectively it was observed that the consumption of co2 dramatically increased the specific growth velocity and whole biomass production rate of the microalgal cells in addition co2 accelerated the photosynthetic process in chlorella the produced oxygen was able to further increase the metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria and fungus rodgers et al 2008 on the 1st and 2nd day of the reaction in r1 easily degradable organic matter present in the ades were hydrolyzed and acidified by aerobic bacteria and fungus the generated co2 promoted the growth and propagation of algae the results indicated that daily cod degradation rates were 7 26 and 12 73 respectively on the 3rd and 4th day aerobic bacteria entered the logarithmic phase with an increase in metabolic activity thus the concentration of co2 increased co2 was absorbed and assimilated by the algae which promoted their propagation the daily cod degradation rate reached values of 17 22 and 12 64 respectively between days 5 and 10 the system entered a stable stage as well as an endogenous respiration stage the cod degradation by aerobic bacteria decreased to some extent however in the logarithmic stage of microalgae propagation the degradation of cod was relatively high displaying degradation rate values between 2 96 and 4 57 at the end of the reaction the cumulative cod degradation rate was 73 78 3 1 2 effect of treatments on tn and an n in the ades was mainly present as an whose proportion to total n tn was 78 64 thus the removal of an describes the purification process of tn figs 2 and 3 display the degradation of tn and an in the three systems abs r1 sludge system r2 and pure microalgae system r3 in the initial stage of the reaction day zero the initial concentrations of tn and an were 398 70 15 21 and 313 76 17 32 423 78 13 63 and 333 71 18 65 and 292 46 18 01 and 256 51 16 76 mg l in the r1 r2 and r3 systems respectively in the three different treatments at day 10 the n content was significantly reduced in addition concentrations of tn and an showed a decreasing trend it was also observed that the daily degradation rate of tn and an reached a maximum on days 5th 7th and 4th with values of 12 90 and 14 01 5 47 and 8 18 and 9 05 and 12 64 respectively moreover the daily tn and an degradation rates displayed a decreasing trend with values between 8 29 and 7 17 1 45 2 55 and 4 23 3 44 respectively the n present in the ades was not totally consumed at the end of the reaction the cumulative degradation rates of tn and an in the ades used in the three systems were 80 67 and 89 74 31 22 and 43 78 and 65 76 and 73 21 respectively according to the results shown in figs 2 and 3 the three systems were able to degrade tn and an to some extent however they displayed different mechanisms r2 which corresponded to the activated sludge treatment used a mechanism that relied on the synergistic effect between nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria for n removal for example under aerobic condition an in the water body was transformed to nitrite and later to nitrate by the nitrifier microorganism however under anoxic conditions nitrate was transformed to n2 which was discharged out of the system by denitrifying bacteria in the r2 system zoogloea composed of aerobic bacteria and fungus underwent assimilation and dissimilation in this case dissimilation transformed organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen which was later absorbed and utilized by the microbes this nitrogen can be used in protein synthesis the extra nitrogen present in the system was removed by nitrifying denitrifying processes however in the present experiment the hydraulic retention time hrt was relatively short 10 days in the process due to long generation time nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria propagated slowly thus the n removal in the r2 system was relatively poor at the end of the reaction the cumulative degradation rate of tn and an in ades were 31 22 and 43 78 respectively the r3 system only contained microalgae specifically chlorella thus potential n degradation by bacteria was neglected in this case chlorella used n present in the ades for biomass production on the 5th day of the reaction the removal rate of an and tn dramatically decreased it is likely that pbr stability decreased because chlorella released organic matter during the growth process r1 system used abs which involved intermittent periods of aeration between day and night to provide aerobic anoxic and anaerobic environments in the aerobic aeration stage organic nitrogen was decomposed to an by ammonization in addition the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic environments provided conditions for simultaneous nitrifying and denitrifying reactions snd liu et al 2017 also by an overamination process an present in the ades may be absorbed and utilized for chlorella growth and propagation chlorella photosynthesis released oxygen which was used by aerobic microorganisms during the stage where no aeration was provided in addition an was oxidized by the nitrifiers thus the degradation of nitrogen was further enhanced aerobic microorganisms changed n containing organic compounds to an nitrite and nitrate by amination and nitrification this provided inorganic n sources for the growth of microalgae further decreasing the concentrations of tn and an in the ades saidu et al 2013 sheng et al 2010 3 1 3 effect of treatments on tp concentrations in wastewater treatment processes p is usually removed though absorption and deposition fig 4 displays the results for the removal of tp in the three different systems used in the present investigation data showed that in the initial stage of the reaction 0d the initial tp concentrations were 17 32 4 37 18 58 2 93 and 13 22 1 66 mg l in the r1 r2 and r3 systems respectively in addition during the 10 days of the sequencing batch photo bioreaction treatment tp concentrations showed a decreasing trend also on the 5th 6th and 6th day of treatment the daily tp degradation rate reached the maximum values of 12 89 5 45 and 11 97 in the r1 r2 and r3 systems respectively furthermore on the 9th day the daily tp degradation rate in the r1 system increased to 10 99 at the end of the reaction the cumulative tp degradation rates in the three systems were 95 39 21 44 and 90 89 in the same order it was observed that tp degradation in the three systems was similar to that of tn in the r2 system which involved an activated sludge treatment the mechanism for p removal by phosphorus accumulating bacteria involved p adsorption when oxygen was present and p release when oxygen was absent under anaerobic and anoxic conditions macromolecules such as protein fat and saccharides were decomposed and rapidly degraded by hydrolytic acidifying bacteria under anaerobic conditions polyphosphate meta chromatic granules was decomposed by phosphorus accumulating bacteria to produce atp in addition a rapidly degradable matrix generated by hydrolytic acidifying bacteria was adsorbed and actively transportated to form polyhydrobutanoic acid phb while p was released into the environment ramanan et al 2016 fuentes et al 2016 mujtaba and lee 2017 under aerobic conditions phosphorus accumulating bacteria decomposed phb as well as the external matrix po4 3 was transported into the cells to synthesize atp and nucleic acid extra po4 3 was used to synthesize polyphosphate similar to the process where nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria are involved phosphorus accumulating bacteria propagated slowly thus the p removal in the r2 system was relatively poor at the end of the reaction the cumulative degradation rate of tp was 21 44 p removal mainly occurred through assimilation and adsorption of po4 3 to synthesize atp and nucleic acid by the phosphorus accumulating bacteria r1 and r3 systems achieved proper p removal the r3 system only contained microalgae thus potential p degradation by bacteria was neglected in this case the results obtained for p degradation were similar to those for n which was mainly degraded by chlorella this microalgae uses abundant amounts of p to achieve its biomass production on the other hand in the r1 abs system p was removed by means of adsorption by microbes the presence of chlorella in the system resulted in a relatively large specific surface area with good adsorption characteristics wei et al 2011 it has been shown that in abs pollutants can be adsorbed into the sludge solid phase chen et al 2016 via diffusion as a result of differences in contaminant concentration between the bulk and liquid phase zoogloea in abs displayed a higher p absorption capacity in addition besides bacterial growth p was adsorbed and used by algae which also promoted the decrease in tp concentrations in the r1 system 3 2 microbial diversity in abs changes in microbial community in abs r1 were determined using high throughput sequencing fig 5 fig 5 a shows the microbial community changes in the abs at the phylum level in the initial stage of the reaction day 1 the phyla present in the samples included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi according to the data proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant with percentages of 24 33 and 19 97 respectively these data were similar to those previously reported when the operation of abs was stabilized hydrolytic acidifying bacteria acidobacteria was able to degrade saccharides present in the organic matter data indicated that the presence of these bacteria increased from 14 38 on the 1st day to 17 45 on the 5th day later organic matter levels decreased and the corresponding proportions of these acidobacteria decreased to 14 56 on the 10th day in the initial stage of the reaction day 1 the abundance of chloroflexi was relatively low in all samples 8 59 as reaction proceeded the proportion of chloroflexi increased to 12 33 and 15 35 on the 5th and 10th day respectively some chloroflexi bacteria play important roles in the nitrifying and denitrifying processes given the time needed for generation of nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria it took a relatively long time to reach proper conditions for chloroflexi propagation once this occurred the proportion of chloroflexi showed an increasing trend fig 5 b shows the microbial community changes in the abs at the class level results provide information on the abundance of alpha proteobacteria beta proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria and delta proteobacteria proteobacteria as well as flavobacteriia sphingbacteriia and cytophagia bacteroidetes at days 1 5 and 10 data indicated that abundance of beta proteobacteria and gamma proteobacteria in abs samples was relatively high in the initial stage the 1st day the corresponding proportion were 9 35 and 6 89 respectively when the system reached stability these numbers decreased specifically on the 5th day of operation the corresponding proportions were 6 98 and 4 87 respectively later on day 10 the values decreased to 5 89 and 4 36 correspondingly it was found that most denitrifying bacteria belonged to beta and gamma proteobacteria in addition some bacteria belonging to beta proteobacteria also facilitated the c and n cycle processes gao et al 2011 rivadeneyra torres et al 2013 moreover some bacteria including flavobacterium micropruina and lacibacter promoted p removal results also indicated that the abundance of actinobacteria belonging to the actinobacteria class was relatively higher this result further confirms that the symbiotic system of bacteria and algae results in an enhanced p uptake by the microorganisms in the initial stage the 1st day the corresponding proportion was 14 33 as reaction proceeded abundance was 16 99 and 17 21 on the 5th and 10th day respectively it has been demonstrated that some bacteria belonging to the actinobacteria class effectively degrade organic matter tang et al 2016 3 3 mechanism of ades degradation in the abs experimental results demonstrated that a sbpbr effectively removed contaminants present in the ades according to the data the cod degradation rate was 73 78 the outlet cod concentration was 355 09 17 90 mg l the degradation rate of tn and an were 80 67 and 89 74 respectively the outlet tn and an concentrations were 83 87 9 37 and 35 42 2 65 mg l correspondingly the degradation rate of tp was 95 39 the outlet tp concentration was 0 87 0 29 mg l the c n and p in ades can be used for algae and microorganisms metabolism and growth in the a sbpbr sbpbr contained various microorganisms including aerobic bacteria fungus and chlorella in a reciprocal interaction bacteria and microalgae were able to use each other s metabolites the extracellular enzymes secreted by the bacteria were absorbed by the microalgae present in the ades forming micelles and promoting the growth and proliferation of the bacteria algae symbiotic ecosystem this enhanced the assimilation and absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus under intermittent aeration conditions organic c n and p present in the macromolecules were converted to different species c was transformed to co2 and organic c in addition n and p stayed as part of small molecules that were used by aerobic bacteria and fungus moreover some of the co2 dissolved in water was an important inorganic carbon source for microalgae o2 which was produced by photosynthesis served for the growth of the aerobic bacteria in abs do indicated an increase in microalgal growth in addition microbial activity of zoogloea also increased it was also determined that the increment of the microbial community favored the activities of ammonifiers and nitrifiers the absorption of light energy outside zoogloea in the microalgal community also provided buffering and adapting time for the stable growth of ammonifiers in abs this promoted the nitrification process in other words the process of n transformation in the system microalgae absorbed organic compounds containing n and p and used them as nutrients for their growth process the absorbed n and p were transformed inside the cells to form amino acids proteins atp and lipids among others at the same time microalgal cells were able to provide support for nitrifiers facilitating their retention and growth thus these two types of microorganisms formed a close symbiotic relationship during the synergistic process of microalgae and bacteria growth and metabolism they both were able to use n and p for the synthesis of useful molecules more importantly under proper growth conditions algae were able to absorb extra p which further aided in the removal of nutrients present in the wastewaters thus in the a sbpbr used in the present research the proper balance between bacteria and microalgae as well as the adequate conditions for growth were fundamental for an efficient ades treatment the nature of the system as well as the environmental conditions favored the propagation of microalgae flora which maintained the balance of abs as a summary a sbpbr promoted growth rate cell activities and n and p absorption by microalgae in addition microalgal reproduction stimulated the growth of aerobic bacteria including nitrifiers and promoted the nitrification process of the system also the growth of aerobic bacteria and microalgae stimulated zoogloea reproduction which resulted in an increase in viscosity the anaerobic microenvironment formed by the zoogloea favored n removal based on this process the n and p removal effects of a sbpbr were significantly enhanced other researchers have observed a certain degree of competition and reciprocal inhibition between bacteria and microalgae in activated sludge mayali and azam 2004 when resources are limited competition between bacteria and microalgae leads to flora growth inhibition for example mayali et al demonstrated that bacteria were able to produce certain toxins which resulted in algae inhibition rivadeneyra torres et al 2013 mayo and noike 1996 also it has been found that algae were able to secrete exotoxins which display an antibiotic effect mayo and noike 1996 in addition shi et al showed that some bacteria destroyed the cell wall of algae leading to the algae cell lysis and death shi et al 2013 however these studies have focused on the interaction between one or few bacteria and microalgae to the best of our knowledge little research has considered the interaction between flora and community structures of bacteria and microalgae with the results obtained in the present research no clear conclusion about the competition behavior of the community structure between bacteria and microalgae was reached furthermore the key influencing factor in the interaction between bacteria and algae in a sbpbr was also not clear for this reason further research is needed 4 conclusions 1 a sbpbr effectively removed contaminants present in the ades after treatment with the a sbpbr the cod degradation rate in the ades was 73 78 the outlet cod concentration was 355 09 17 90 mg l the tn and an degradation rates were 80 67 and 89 74 respectively the outlet concentrations of tn and an were 83 87 9 37 and 35 42 2 65 mg l correspondingly the degradation rate of tp was 95 39 and the outlet tp concentration was 0 87 0 29 mg l 2 the data related to bacterial community changes at the phylum level showed that during the initial stage of the process day 1 the phyla present in the abs included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi the highest abundance values corresponded to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which were 24 33 and 19 97 respectively at the class level alpha proteobacteria belta proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria and delta proteobacteria proteobacteria as well as flavobacteriia sphingbacteriia and cytophagia bacteroidetes were the most abundant 3 the balance and stable growth of bacteria and microalgae species effectively decreased the concentrations of c n and p present in the ades in relation to the mechanism the microalgal community formed in abs presented a proper activity this activity increased local do values around microalgal cell and stimulated microbial activities in zoogloea the organic carbon in ades was decomposed and cod concentration decreased the increase of do values indicated an increase in the activities of ammonifiers and nitrifiers this enhanced the growth rate and cell activity of microalgae promoting n and p adsorption by these microorganisms the proper growth of aerobic bacteria and microalgae promoted the increase of the zoogloea thickness film the inner anaerobic microenvironment formation in zoogloea was favorable for n removal in the denitrification process based on this n and p removal in a sbpbr were dramatically enhanced declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

10199,large volumes of anaerobic digestion effluents ades are generated by intense livestock and poultry farm activities if untreated these effluents represent a threat to the environment previous data have indicated that microalgae are able to grow in photobioreactors pbr where high concentrations of inorganic salts are present in the present research algae assisted sequencing batch photo bio reactor a sbpbr with single micro algae systems and single activated sludge systems were developed we studied the effects of the treatments on different parameters including cod tn an and tp we analyzed changes in bacterial community diversity using the high throughput sequencing analysis the degradation mechanism of the ades was studied by means of algal bacterial symbiosis experimental results indicated that contaminants were efficiently removed from the ades when using the a sbpbr after treatment the degradation rates of cod tn an and tp were 73 78 80 67 89 74 and 95 39 respectively the outlet concentrations of cod tn an and tp were 355 09 17 90 83 97 9 37 35 42 2 65 and 0 87 29 mg l respectively in the initial stage of the process day 1 the most abundant bacteria present in the abs algal bacterial symbiosis system included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi among these those with the highest abundance values were

which belonged to acidobacteria were able to degrade different organic compounds including saccharides keywords photobioreactor pbr algal bacterial symbosis abs anaerobic digestion effluent ade bacterial community changes 1 introduction sustainable technologies for wastewater treatment display several advantages over traditional ones for example sustainable techniques are able to use wastewater as a resource for energy generation for this reason they have attracted the attention of experts in different areas huang et al 2015 biogas technology uses livestock and poultry manure to convert organic waste into bio energy however they result in large amounts of anaerobic digestion effluents ades these effluents usually contain high levels of organic matter that is barely degradable as well as inorganic salts containing n and p with an unbalanced c n p ratio thus ades are very difficult to treat huang et al 2015 saidu et al 2013 in this context sustainable and efficient wastewater processes that are able to treat this type of residues are important in the field of environmental technology past reports have indicated that microalgae are an excellent option for the biotreatment of wastewater since they efficiently remove inorganic salts they grow rapidly and display high adaptability foladori et al 2018 hernández et al 2016 rada ariza et al 2017 fan et al 2017 also different systems have been developed where abs are used in the pbrs taking advantage of the synergistic effect between bacteria and algae with abs it has been possible to degrade organic matter and other toxic and hazardous compounds present in wastewaters as well as to remove inorganic salts xie et al 2018 shi 2013 treated beer wastewater with an abs composed of spirulina and mycelium pellets of flammulina velutipes they showed that with this system the removal rate of cod tn and tp in the beer wastewater were 77 81 84 28 and 50 88 respectively these values were higher as compared to those obtained in a system where only microalgae were present these values were 70 59 70 17 and 37 99 in the same order liu 2012 reported similar results when they compared the performance of an abs with that of a system where only chlorella was used on another study abou shanab et al 2013 treated pig farm wastewater using six different microalgae ourococcus multisporus nitzschia cf pusilla chlamydomonas mesicana scenedesmus obliquus chlorella vulgaris and micractinium reisseri these researchers determined that the highest tn and tp removal rates were observed in wastewaters treated with micraactinium reisseri in this case tn and tp removal rates were 62 and 68 respectively in addition elmasry et al 2013 proved that a cod concentration of 1900 mg l presented the best growth rate of chlorella zofingiensis herein the corresponding tn tp and cod removal rates reached 82 7 98 2 and 79 8 respectively their results also indicated that after 24 h phenol removal reached a 95 to the best of our knowledge previous abs research has been mainly focused on the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters thus in order to determine potential new options for the sustainable remediation of ades in the present investigation three different bioreactors were used they included a abs inlet water of unsterilized ade b single microalgae inlet water of sterilized ade and c activated sludge bioreactors these systems were used to compare their performances on the treatment of ades of livestock and poultry manure we analyzed the effect of treatment conditions on cod tn an and tp in addition we determined the microbial diversity and explored the mechanism of ades degradation in the abs systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the activated sludge used in the present experiments was obtained from the wastewater treatment plant of a factory located in northern shenyang in the liaoning province the inoculated activated sludge was transported on a 25 l airtight plastic container during the transportation process the temperature decreased to 20 c however the activity was maintained later cultivation was performed with the addition of a small amount of ade maintaining a temperature of 30 c the microalga used in the present research was chlorella chlorella zofingiensis which was purchased from the institute of aquatic sciences cas and stored at 30 c when needed chlorella was placed on an oven at 20 c for 30 min for defrosting later it was cultivated at 27 c and 400 lux using the bg 11 nutrient media until the logarithmic growth phase was reached the treatments used in the present research consisted of mixtures of bg11 nutrient media containing 10 of seed solution and wastewater at ratios of 3 1 1 1 and 1 3 in addition wastewater without microorganisms was used as control treatment ades samples used in our experiments were obtained from a pilot plant used for dry fermentation of chicken manure after centrifugation at 4000 r min for 3 min sterilized and non sterilized ades were 10 fold diluted and used as the inlet water in the case of nonsterile inlet water the values for ph cod nh4 n an tn and tp were 7 24 0 4 1354 29 45 23 345 25 21 22 433 89 34 12 and 18 89 4 37 mg l respectively ph values and cod an tn and tp concentrations for sterilized inlet water were 7 03 0 32 765 33 34 17 279 86 16 82 315 19 34 12 and 14 19 3 17 mg

glass the diameter height and effective volume were 40 cm 80 cm and 8 l respectively two groups of led light sources were included in the a sbpbr to provide a continuous irradiation of 3000 lux for 24 h in the lower part of the reactor a cavity provided aeration twice a day in periods of 12 h microalgae were cultivated at a constant temperature of 30 c different conditions were used for the experiments which were performed using a volume of 7 l of non sterile ade each set of conditions was labeled as r1 r2 and r3 r1 contained 500 ml chlorella od686 1 43 and 500 ml of sieved activated sludge for r2 7 l sterilized ade and 500 ml chlorella od686 1 43 were mixed experiments were performed in triplicate and the detailed information for each treatment is shown in table 1 the period of the sequencing batch experiment was 10 d during the operation 10 ml samples were taken centrifuged at 4000 r min for 3 min and concentrations of cod an tn and tp recorded the quantity of microalgae and bacteria were determined each 5 days data indicated average values 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 cod quantification for cod quantification 10 ml of potassium dichromate and 100 ml of distilled water were mixed in a 250 ml conical beaker subsequently 30 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid were incorporated and the resultant mixture was placed on an ice bath after cooling 3 drops of the ferrous iron indicator were added and the samples were titrated with ammonium ferrous sulfate until the yellow solution changed to bluish green and finally to reddish brown elmasry et al 2013 2 3 2 quantification of nh4 n tn and tp 10 ml samples were taken and centrifugated at 4000 r min for 3 min later concentrations of an tn and tp were determined in the supernatants according to the methodology indicated in the national standard methods for water quality determination tn was quantified with uv vis spectrometry after sample digestion with alkaline potassium persulfate according to gb t 11894 1989 an was quantified according to the astmd 1426 2003 standard method in addition tp was determined following the gb t 11893 1989 methodology which indicates the use of ammonium molybdate followed by uv vis quantification editorial committee of the state environmental protection administration s methods for monitoring and analysis of water and wastewater 2002 2 3 3 microalgae growth

wavelength of 680 nm quantification was performed every two days in triplicate and average was reported the relationship between the microalgae biomass and absorbance followed a linear correlation in a certain range the resulting equation was x 0 290 od686 0 05 r 2 0 996 where x was the algae concentration g l od686 the absorbance value at the wavelength of 680 nm zhang et al 2015 2 3 4 determination of bacteria quantity and abundance genomic dna was extracted from the samples using the ctab or sds method the purity and concentration of dna were determined by algae gel electrophoresis for this purpose an appropriate amount of dna sample was placed in a centrifuge tube which was further diluted to 1 ng ul using sterilized water the diluted genomic dna was used as template and the specific primer with barcode was used according to the selected sequencing area pcr was performed on a phusion high fidelity pcr master mix using a gc buffer and a high efficient fidelity enzyme to guarantee the amplification efficiency and accuracy in order to identify the diversity of the bacteria we selected a primer of the 16sr4 region 515f and 806 r 2 4 data analysis

results and discussion 3 1 effect of treatment conditions on ade parameters 3 1 1 effect of treatment conditions on cod results for cod in ades treated with abs r1 sludge system r2 and pure algae system r3 are shown in fig 1 during the initial stage of the reaction 0 d the initial cod concentrations in the r1 r2 and r3 systems were 1354 29 45 23 1354 29 45 23 and 765 33 34 17 mg l respectively cod showed a decreasing trend in the first 10 days of ades treatment in the sbpbr in addition on day 3 the daily degradation rates in the r1 and r2 treatments reached the maximum values of 17 22 and 16 75 respectively on the other hand the maximum daily degradation rate in the r3 system 4 31 was observed on day 6 after the maximum point the daily cod degradation rate showed a decreasing trend with values between 4 47 and 2 86 at the end of the reaction the cumulative cod degradation rates in the three systems were 73 78 62 37 and 31 35 respectively the corresponding cod concentrations were 355 09 17 90 509 61 22 56 and 523 94 439 18 mg l respectively fig 1 shows that total cod values in ades were reduced in the three systems however the mechanisms were different the r2 system corresponded to the activated sludge treatment technology microorganisms included zoogloea an aerobic bacteria and fungus which are able to degrade organic components under aerobic conditions macromolecules were hydrolyzed into smaller molecules which were used for the metabolism and growth of the microorganisms in addition the generated co2 was discharged to the water body the r2 system corresponded to a sequencing batch reaction on days 1 and 2 the system was on an adaptive stage where the metabolic activity of the microbes was relatively weak only easily degradable organic compounds in water were utilized the daily cod degradation rates on the 1st and 2nd day were 10 31 and 6 81 respectively the system entered an increasing logarithmic phase on the 3rd and 4th day also after two days of adaptation the metabolic activity dramatically increased in this stage microbes metabolized small molecules which promoted their growth the daily cod degradation rates on the 3rd and 4th day were 16 15 and 12 00 respectively the system stabilized between days 5 and 10 where hardly degradable organic matter was metabolized through an endogenous respiratory process the corresponding daily cod degradation rate values were between 3 69 and 0 75 at the end of the reaction the cumulative cod degradation rate was 62 37 pure microalgae and sterilized ades were added to the r3 system as a consequence the amount of bacteria was small and their effect on the r3 system was neglected thus only the degradation effect of microalgae on cod was considered microalgae used an inorganic carbon source for their growth and metabolism specifically co2 and hco3 moreover co2 was the first one used by the microalgae followed by hco3 however hco3 had to be transformed to co2 before being adsorbed and immobilized by these microorganisms xie et al 2017 during the 1st and 2nd day of the reaction the daily cod degradation rates were relatively low displaying values of 2 11 and 1 34 respectively later with the utilization of co2 by the microorganisms the daily cod degradation rates gradually increased to values between 4 37 and 2 66 during days 3 10 colman et al 2002 moroney 2001 miller and colman 1980 sultemeyer et al 1991 rosenberg et al 2015 at the end of the process the cumulative cod degradation rate was 31 54 in the r1 system activated sludge and abs were used for ades treatment thus zoogloea and fungus degraded the organic carbon present in the ades the phyla present in the samples included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi according to the data proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant with percentages of 24 33 and 19 97 respectively it was observed that the consumption of co2 dramatically increased the specific growth velocity and whole biomass production rate of the microalgal cells in addition co2 accelerated the photosynthetic process in chlorella the produced oxygen was able to further increase the metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria and fungus rodgers et al 2008 on the 1st and 2nd day of the reaction in r1 easily degradable organic matter present in the ades were hydrolyzed and acidified by aerobic bacteria and fungus the generated co2 promoted the growth and propagation of algae the results indicated that daily cod degradation rates were 7 26 and 12 73 respectively on the 3rd and 4th day aerobic bacteria entered the logarithmic phase with an increase in metabolic activity thus the concentration of co2 increased co2 was absorbed and assimilated by the algae which promoted their propagation the daily cod degradation rate reached values of 17 22 and 12 64 respectively between days 5 and 10 the system entered a stable stage as well as an endogenous respiration stage the cod degradation by aerobic bacteria decreased to some extent however in the logarithmic stage of microalgae propagation the degradation of cod was relatively high displaying degradation rate values between 2 96 and 4 57 at the end of the reaction the cumulative cod degradation rate was 73 78 3 1 2 effect of treatments on tn and an n in the ades was mainly present as an whose proportion to total n tn was 78 64 thus the removal of an describes the purification process of tn figs 2 and 3 display the degradation of tn and an in the three systems abs r1 sludge system r2 and pure microalgae system r3 in the initial stage of the reaction day zero the initial concentrations of tn and an were 398 70 15 21 and 313 76 17 32 423 78 13 63 and 333 71 18 65 and 292 46 18 01 and 256 51 16 76 mg l in the r1 r2 and r3 systems respectively in the three different treatments at day 10 the n content was significantly reduced in addition concentrations of tn and an showed a decreasing trend it was also observed that the daily degradation rate of tn and an reached a maximum on days 5th 7th and 4th with values of 12 90 and 14 01 5 47 and 8 18 and 9 05 and 12 64 respectively moreover the daily tn and an degradation rates displayed a decreasing trend with values between 8 29 and 7 17 1 45 2 55 and 4 23 3 44 respectively the n present in the ades was not totally consumed at the end of the reaction the cumulative degradation rates of tn and an in the ades used in the three systems were 80 67 and 89 74 31 22 and 43 78 and 65 76 and 73 21 respectively according to the results shown in figs 2 and 3 the three systems were able to degrade tn and an to some extent however they displayed different mechanisms r2 which corresponded to the activated sludge treatment used a mechanism that relied on the synergistic effect between nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria for n removal for example under aerobic condition an in the water body was transformed to nitrite and later to nitrate by the nitrifier microorganism however under anoxic conditions nitrate was transformed to n2 which was discharged out of the system by denitrifying bacteria in the r2 system zoogloea composed of aerobic bacteria and fungus underwent assimilation and dissimilation in this case dissimilation transformed organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen which was later absorbed and utilized by the microbes this nitrogen can be used in protein synthesis the extra nitrogen present in the system was removed by nitrifying denitrifying processes however in the present experiment the hydraulic retention time hrt was relatively short 10 days in the process due to long generation time nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria propagated slowly thus the n removal in the r2 system was relatively poor at the end of the reaction the cumulative degradation rate of tn and an in ades were 31 22 and 43 78 respectively the r3 system only contained microalgae specifically chlorella thus potential n degradation by bacteria was neglected in this case chlorella used n present in the ades for biomass production on the 5th day of the reaction the removal rate of an and tn dramatically decreased it is likely that pbr stability decreased because chlorella released organic matter during the growth process r1 system used abs which involved intermittent periods of aeration between day and night to provide aerobic anoxic and anaerobic environments in the aerobic aeration stage organic nitrogen was decomposed to an by ammonization in addition the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic environments provided conditions for simultaneous nitrifying and denitrifying reactions snd liu et al 2017 also by an overamination process an present in the ades may be absorbed and utilized for chlorella growth and propagation chlorella photosynthesis released oxygen which was used by aerobic microorganisms during the stage where no aeration was provided in addition an was oxidized by the nitrifiers thus the degradation of nitrogen was further enhanced aerobic microorganisms changed n containing organic compounds to an nitrite and nitrate by amination and nitrification this provided inorganic n sources for the growth of microalgae further decreasing the concentrations of tn and an in the ades saidu et al 2013 sheng et al 2010 3 1 3 effect of treatments on tp concentrations in wastewater treatment processes p is usually removed though absorption and deposition fig 4 displays the results for the removal of tp in the three different systems used in the present investigation data showed that in the initial stage of the reaction 0d the initial tp concentrations were 17 32 4 37 18 58 2 93 and 13 22 1 66 mg l in the r1 r2 and r3 systems respectively in addition during the 10 days of the sequencing batch photo bioreaction treatment tp concentrations showed a decreasing trend also on the 5th 6th and 6th day of treatment the daily tp degradation rate reached the maximum values of 12 89 5 45 and 11 97 in the r1 r2 and r3 systems respectively furthermore on the 9th day the daily tp degradation rate in the r1 system increased to 10 99 at the end of the reaction the cumulative tp degradation rates in the three systems were 95 39 21 44 and 90 89 in the same order it was observed that tp degradation in the three systems was similar to that of tn in the r2 system which involved an activated sludge treatment the mechanism for p removal by phosphorus accumulating bacteria involved p adsorption when oxygen was present and p release when oxygen was absent under anaerobic and anoxic conditions macromolecules such as protein fat and saccharides were decomposed and rapidly degraded by hydrolytic acidifying bacteria under anaerobic conditions polyphosphate meta chromatic granules was decomposed by phosphorus accumulating bacteria to produce atp in addition a rapidly degradable matrix generated by hydrolytic acidifying bacteria was adsorbed and actively transportated to form polyhydrobutanoic acid phb while p was released into the environment ramanan et al 2016 fuentes et al 2016 mujtaba and lee 2017 under aerobic conditions phosphorus accumulating bacteria decomposed phb as well as the external matrix po4 3 was transported into the cells to synthesize atp and nucleic acid extra po4 3 was used to synthesize polyphosphate similar to the process where nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria are involved phosphorus accumulating bacteria propagated slowly thus the p removal in the r2 system was relatively poor at the end of the reaction the cumulative degradation rate of tp was 21 44 p removal mainly occurred through assimilation and adsorption of po4 3 to synthesize atp and nucleic acid by the phosphorus accumulating bacteria r1 and r3 systems achieved proper p removal the r3 system only contained microalgae thus potential p degradation by bacteria was neglected in this case the results obtained for p degradation were similar to those for n which was mainly degraded by chlorella this microalgae uses abundant amounts of p to achieve its biomass production on the other hand in the r1 abs system p was removed by means of adsorption by microbes the presence of chlorella in the system resulted in a relatively large specific surface area with good adsorption characteristics wei et al 2011 it has been shown that in abs pollutants can be adsorbed into the sludge solid phase chen et al 2016 via diffusion as a result of differences in contaminant concentration between the bulk and liquid phase zoogloea in abs displayed a higher p absorption capacity in addition besides bacterial growth p was adsorbed and used by algae which also promoted the decrease in tp concentrations in the r1 system 3 2 microbial diversity in abs changes in microbial community in abs r1 were determined using high throughput sequencing fig 5 fig 5 a shows the microbial community changes in the abs at the phylum level in the initial stage of the reaction day 1 the phyla present in the samples included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi according to the data proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant with percentages of 24 33 and 19 97 respectively these data were similar to those previously reported when the operation of abs was stabilized hydrolytic acidifying bacteria acidobacteria was able to degrade saccharides present in the organic matter data indicated that the presence of these bacteria increased from 14 38 on the 1st day to 17 45 on the 5th day later organic matter levels decreased and the corresponding proportions of these acidobacteria decreased to 14 56 on the 10th day in the initial stage of the reaction day 1 the abundance of chloroflexi was relatively low in all samples 8 59 as reaction proceeded the proportion of chloroflexi increased to 12 33 and 15 35 on the 5th and 10th day respectively some chloroflexi bacteria play important roles in the nitrifying and denitrifying processes given the time needed for generation of nitrifier and denitrifying bacteria it took a relatively long time to reach proper conditions for chloroflexi propagation once this occurred the proportion of chloroflexi showed an increasing trend fig 5 b shows the microbial community changes in the abs at the class level results provide information on the abundance of alpha proteobacteria beta proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria and delta proteobacteria proteobacteria as well as flavobacteriia sphingbacteriia and cytophagia bacteroidetes at days 1 5 and 10 data indicated that abundance of beta proteobacteria and gamma proteobacteria in abs samples was relatively high in the initial stage the 1st day the corresponding proportion were 9 35 and 6 89 respectively when the system reached stability these numbers decreased specifically on the 5th day of operation the corresponding proportions were 6 98 and 4 87 respectively later on day 10 the values decreased to 5 89 and 4 36 correspondingly it was found that most denitrifying bacteria belonged to beta and gamma proteobacteria in addition some bacteria belonging to beta proteobacteria also facilitated the c and n cycle processes gao et al 2011 rivadeneyra torres et al 2013 moreover some bacteria including flavobacterium micropruina and lacibacter promoted p removal results also indicated that the abundance of actinobacteria belonging to the actinobacteria class was relatively higher this result further confirms that the symbiotic system of bacteria and algae results in an enhanced p uptake by the microorganisms in the initial stage the 1st day the corresponding proportion was 14 33 as reaction proceeded abundance was 16 99 and 17 21 on the 5th and 10th day respectively it has been demonstrated that some bacteria belonging to the actinobacteria class effectively degrade organic matter tang et al 2016 3 3 mechanism of ades degradation in the abs experimental results demonstrated that a sbpbr effectively removed contaminants present in the ades according to the data the cod degradation rate was 73 78 the outlet cod concentration was 355 09 17 90 mg l the degradation rate of tn and an were 80 67 and 89 74 respectively the outlet tn and an concentrations were 83 87 9 37 and 35 42 2 65 mg l correspondingly the degradation rate of tp was 95 39 the outlet tp concentration was 0 87 0 29 mg l the c n and p in ades can be used for algae and microorganisms metabolism and growth in the a sbpbr sbpbr contained various microorganisms including aerobic bacteria fungus and chlorella in a reciprocal interaction bacteria and microalgae were able to use each other s metabolites the extracellular enzymes secreted by the bacteria were absorbed by the microalgae present in the ades forming micelles and promoting the growth and proliferation of the bacteria algae symbiotic ecosystem this enhanced the assimilation and absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus under intermittent aeration conditions organic c n and p present in the macromolecules were converted to different species c was transformed to co2 and organic c in addition n and p stayed as part of small molecules that were used by aerobic bacteria and fungus moreover some of the co2 dissolved in water was an important inorganic carbon source for microalgae o2 which was produced by photosynthesis served for the growth of the aerobic bacteria in abs do indicated an increase in microalgal growth in addition microbial activity of zoogloea also increased it was also determined that the increment of the microbial community favored the activities of ammonifiers and nitrifiers the absorption of light energy outside zoogloea in the microalgal community also provided buffering and adapting time for the stable growth of ammonifiers in abs this promoted the nitrification process in other words the process of n transformation in the system microalgae absorbed organic compounds containing n and p and used them as nutrients for their growth process the absorbed n and p were transformed inside the cells to form amino acids proteins atp and lipids among others at the same time microalgal cells were able to provide support for nitrifiers facilitating their retention and growth thus these two types of microorganisms formed a close symbiotic relationship during the synergistic process of microalgae and bacteria growth and metabolism they both were able to use n and p for the synthesis of useful molecules more importantly under proper growth conditions algae were able to absorb extra p which further aided in the removal of nutrients present in the wastewaters thus in the a sbpbr used in the present research the proper balance between bacteria and microalgae as well as the adequate conditions for growth were fundamental for an efficient ades treatment the nature of the system as well as the environmental conditions favored the propagation of microalgae flora which maintained the balance of abs as a summary a sbpbr promoted growth rate cell activities and n and p absorption by microalgae in addition microalgal reproduction stimulated the growth of aerobic bacteria including nitrifiers and promoted the nitrification process of the system also the growth of aerobic bacteria and microalgae stimulated zoogloea reproduction which resulted in an increase in viscosity the anaerobic microenvironment formed by the zoogloea favored n removal based on this process the n and p removal effects of a sbpbr were significantly enhanced other researchers have observed a certain degree of competition and reciprocal inhibition between bacteria and microalgae in activated sludge mayali and azam 2004 when resources are limited competition between bacteria and microalgae leads to flora growth inhibition for example mayali et al demonstrated that bacteria were able to produce certain toxins which resulted in algae inhibition rivadeneyra torres et al 2013 mayo and noike 1996 also it has been found that algae were able to secrete exotoxins which display an antibiotic effect mayo and noike 1996 in addition shi et al showed that some bacteria destroyed the cell wall of algae leading to the algae cell lysis and death shi et al 2013 however these studies have focused on the interaction between one or few bacteria and microalgae to the best of our knowledge little research has considered the interaction between flora and community structures of bacteria and microalgae with the results obtained in the present research no clear conclusion about the competition behavior of the community structure between bacteria and microalgae was reached furthermore the key influencing factor in the interaction between bacteria and algae in a sbpbr was also not clear for this reason further research is needed 4 conclusions 1 a sbpbr effectively removed contaminants present in the ades after treatment with the a sbpbr the cod degradation rate in the ades was 73 78 the outlet cod concentration was 355 09 17 90 mg l the tn and an degradation rates were 80 67 and 89 74 respectively the outlet concentrations of tn and an were 83 87 9 37 and 35 42 2 65 mg l correspondingly the degradation rate of tp was 95 39 and the outlet tp concentration was 0 87 0 29 mg l 2 the data related to bacterial community changes at the phylum level showed that during the initial stage of the process day 1 the phyla present in the abs included proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi the highest abundance values corresponded to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which were 24 33 and 19 97 respectively at the class level alpha proteobacteria belta proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria and delta proteobacteria proteobacteria as well as flavobacteriia sphingbacteriia and cytophagia bacteroidetes were the most abundant 3 the balance and stable growth of bacteria and microalgae species effectively decreased the concentrations of c n and p present in the ades in relation to the mechanism the microalgal community formed in abs presented a proper activity this activity increased local do values around microalgal cell and stimulated microbial activities in zoogloea the organic carbon in ades was decomposed and cod concentration decreased the increase of do values indicated an increase in the activities of ammonifiers and nitrifiers this enhanced the growth rate and cell activity of microalgae promoting n and p adsorption by these microorganisms the proper growth of aerobic bacteria and microalgae promoted the increase of the zoogloea thickness film the inner anaerobic microenvironment formation in zoogloea was favorable for n removal in the denitrification process based on this n and p removal in a sbpbr were dramatically enhanced declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the
