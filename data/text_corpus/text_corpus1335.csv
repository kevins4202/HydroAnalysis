6675,in sharp open channel bends there exists nonlinear interactions between streamwise and cross stream velocities which leads to the adjustment of flow energy transport increases the energy dissipation and eventually influences the development of river bends however previous studies have not yet fully understood the mechanisms underlying the transport and dissipation of energy in open channel bends in addition energy dissipation is directly related to the evolution of enstrophy ω ω 2 however it has not yet received much attention in the study of the resistance in meandering rivers to gain an insight into these mechanisms with the aid of detailed experimental data collected in a sharp open channel bend this study quantified the impacts of the key terms in the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation results show that the term related to the transport of kinetic energy by cross stream circulation is at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the kinetic energy equation which contributes significantly to the redistribution of kinetic energy over the cross section the term related to the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the kinetic energy equation shows the smallest order of magnitude and thus is almost negligible for the time averaged flow field furthermore over most of the measured area the term related to the centrifugal force shows values of at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the enstrophy equation which means that this term exerts the dominant influence on the energy dissipation the results also revealed that the transformation process is insensitive to the variations in froude number these results are expected to improve the understanding of the complete process of energy

rivers form a dynamic system which is in the process ofcontinuous evolution camporeale et al 2007 this development of river bends is strongly affected by the spatial distribution of the velocities the boundary shear stresses and the sediment transport all of which are directly related to the energy transformation therefore to make a better understanding of the development of meandering rivers it is important first to make a full appreciation of the mechanisms underlying the transformation process of flow energy in open channel bends the energy transformation is determined by the combination of two components the transport of kinetic energy by velocity viscous stress and reynolds stress and the energy dissipation by fluid friction in open channel bends each of these components exhibits its characteristics one of the key features of curved channel flow is the existence of secondary flow johannesson and parker 1989 although the velocity of the secondary flow is relatively smaller in comparison with the streamwise velocity there exists a strong interaction between the streamwise and cross stream velocity de vriend 1981 blanckaert and de vriend 2004 blanckaert and graf 2004 therefore the distribution of kinetic energy especially the portion of the streamwise flow is strongly influenced by this interaction which has an effect on the distribution of bed shear stress and further the development of the bed topography of river bends engelund 1974 edwards and smith 2002 chien and wan 1999 however in spite of its engineering importance the mechanisms underlying the process of energy transport have not been investigated thoroughly specifically few studies have performed quantitative analyses of the relative importance of different mechanisms in energy transport such as the role of viscous stresses reynolds stresses and most importantly the secondary flow for the energy dissipation because of the additional transverse component of the boundary shear stress induced by the secondary flow in open channel bends odgaard and bergs 1988 bridge 1992 kinetic energy will be dissipated at a faster rate than it would through straight channels which leads to an increase in the resistance to the flow and therefore reduces the conveyance capacity of rivers and channels chang 1983 shiono et al 1999 extensive investigations have been carried out to quantify the energy dissipation or flow resistance in open channel bends or natural channels for example chang 1983 proposed an analytical model to compute the rate of energy dissipation in open channel bends and showed that the energy dissipation induced by the secondary flow accounts for over one half of the total energy dissipation at a higher depth radius ratio recent work by blanckaert 2009 indicated that energy dissipation barely increases once a threshold curvature is reached which is what he called the saturation phenomenon moramarco and dingman 2017 investigated the relationship between two velocity distribution parameters and flow resistance in terms of manning roughness shear velocity and water surface slope in general most foregoing research focused attention on associating the energy dissipation in open channel bends with one or several factors such as channel curvature roughness depth of water froude number and other variables however the mechanisms underlying the energy dissipation in open channel bends have not yet been investigated in detail these mechanisms are important in the estimation of flow resistance for the closure of the governing equations in essence energy dissipation is a fluid mechanics problem in which vorticity plays a leading role in vortex dynamics ω ω 2 which is called enstrophy is directly related to kinetic energy and represents the energy dissipation effects in the fluid davidson 2004 wu et al 2006 alexakis and doering 2006 however in spite of its importance for understanding the mechanisms underlying the process of energy dissipation in open channel bends enstrophy has received little attention from the aforementioned the purpose of the present research is to obtain a more detailed picture of the two components of the energy transformation in river bends in particular special emphasis is placed on the role of the cross circulation in the process of the energy transformation it should be mentioned that the present research focuses only on flow phenomena in the central part of the cross section furthermore attention is restricted to the case of with immobile bed topography although the flow sediment interaction also influences the energy transformation it is important first to gain an insight into the hydrodynamic processes of the energy transformation before investigating the mechanisms in the more complex case with sediment laden flow and mobile bed topography the major objectives of the present paper are 1 to report and analyze detailed experimental data on the streamwise flow secondary flow streamwise vorticity the turbulent normal and shear stresses which allow for an analysis of the flow physics and may be useful for numerical model validation 2 to analyze the mechanisms of kinetic energy transport in the present experiments by means of a term by term estimation of the kinetic energy equation 3 to analyze the mechanisms underlying the energy dissipation in the reported experiments by means of a term by term estimation of the enstrophy equation although such an analysis is restricted to the experimental conditions investigated in this work these results are expected to improve the understanding of the transformation process of kinetic energy in open channel bends 2 theoretical considerations to gain an insight into the mechanisms underlying the energy transformation the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation must be given adequate considerations for simplicity a cartesian coordinate system is adopted first to illuminate the problem the kinetic energy equation in the coordinate system is given by tennekes and lumley 1972 1 t 1 2 u i u i u j x j 1 2 u i u i x j p ρ u j 2 ν u i s ij u i u j u i u i u j s ij 2 ν s ij s ij in which the einstein summation convention is implied for repeated indices taking the values from 1 to 3 u i i 1 2 3 are the time averaged velocity u i i 1 2 3 are the fluctuating velocity u i u j i j 1 2 3 are the reynolds stress components the over bar indicates the time averaged values s ij i j 1 2 3 is the rate of strain tensor p is the pressure t is time ν is the molecular kinematic viscosity ρ is the density of water for details of the physical meaning of the various terms in this equation please refer to tennekes and lumley 1972 it should be noted that for large reynolds number flow the reynolds stress is much larger than viscous stress it follows that the transport of turbulent flow is much stronger than molecular transport therefore the transport of kinetic energy by viscous stresses 2 ν u i s ij x j is negligible the last two terms represent the production of turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate respectively u i u j s ij is normally negative while 2 s ij s ij is always positive definite according to tensor analysis 2 s ij s ij can be expressed as 2 2 s ij s ij ω i ω i 2 x i x j u i u j in which ω i is the vorticity and ω i ω i 2 is known as enstrophy if integrating eq 2 over a fixed volume with stationary boundary or the volume extends to infinity where the fluid is at rest then only enstrophy contributes to the total dissipation substituting eq 2 to eq 1 and integrating the result over the volume lead to the rate of change of total kinetic energy in the volume 3 t v 1 2 u i u i d σ ν 2 v ω i ω i 2 d σ v u i u j s ij d σ the above equation highlights the important role of ω i ω i 2 kinetic energy of the fluid decreases at a rate equal to the sum of enstrophy and the production of turbulent kinetic energy therefore in order to gain an insight into the process of energy dissipation the evolution of ω i ω i 2 should be carefully investigated the enstrophy equation provides a good basis for this investigation the enstrophy equation is transformed from the vorticity equation the vorticity equation is given by brundrett and baines 1963 4 ω k t u j ω k x j ω j u k x j ε ijk 2 u l u j x i x l ν 2 ω k x j x j in which the einstein summation convention is also used ε ijk i j k 1 2 3 is the levi civita symbol ω j i 1 2 3 is the time averaged vorticity the physical meanings of the terms in eq 4 can be seen in brundrett and baines 1963 multiplying the vorticity eq 4 by ω i the enstrophy equation for steady flow is obtained 5 t ω k ω k 2 u j x j ω k ω k 2 ω k ω j u k x j ε ijk ω k 2 u l u j x i x l ν 2 x j x j ω k ω k 2 ν ω i x j ω i x j details of the physical meaning of the various terms in this equation can be found in tennekes and lumley 1972 according to the order of magnitude analysis by tennekes and lumley 1972 the viscous term is of order of u 3 l 3 ul ν and all the other terms are order of u 3 l 3 where l and u are known as the characteristic scale of velocity and length respectively or integral scales of turbulence and comparable with the scales of the large vortex for the flow at large reynolds number u 3 l 3 ul ν is extremely small compared with the other terms which means that the viscosity terms are negligible so far the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation have been introduced and the connection between them has been clarified to investigate the energy transformation in open channel bends the two equations should be transformed from a cartesian to a cylindrical coordinate system according to nezu and nakagawa 1993 the velocity of the centre region secondary flow is about 20 30 of the streamwise velocity which means that the kinetic energy of the streamwise flow accounts for more than 90 of the total kinetic energy therefore the kinetic energy equation can be derived directly from the streamwise momentum equation the momentum equations in the cylindrical coordinate system can be found in batchelor 1970 multiplying the streamwise momentum equation by the streamwise velocity the kinetic energy equation in the orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system can be obtained as 6 t u s 2 2 1 1 n r u s s u s 2 2 u n n u s 2 2 1 1 n r u n u s 2 r u z z u s 2 2 1 1 n r g u s z s s 1 1 n r u s s u s u s u s n u s u n u s z u s u z 2 1 n r u s 2 u s u n r in which the s axis is along the channel centerline the n axis is perpendicular to it and points towards the center of curvature and the z axis points vertically upward from the horizontal s n plane the origin of the s axis is at the entrance of bend see fig 1 a 1 n r 1 is a metric factor that accounts for the divergence of the n coordinate lines zs is water surface elevation g is the gravitational acceleration u i i s n z are the time averaged velocity u i u j i s n z are the reynolds stress components according to de vriend 1981 the convective influence of the secondary flow on the streamwise velocity takes place only in n z plane and in consequence the streamwise variations of the physical quantities are unlikely to play an important role in it blanckaert and de vriend 2004 also argued that streamwise derivatives are not essential for the mechanisms underlying the two cross stream circulation cells since our attention is focused on the energy transformation within the context of secondary flow all the gradients in the streamwise direction described hereafter except for the gravity term are therefore left out of consideration in agreement with blanckaert and graf 2004 to differentiate the cross circulation motion a distinction is made to split the flow velocity components u n into the sum of the depth averaged value u n and local deviations from it u n see fig 1 b thus u n can be rewritten as 7 u n u n u n substituting the decomposition 7 into eq 6 and neglecting the gradients in the streamwise direction except for the streamwise pressure gradient eq 6 becomes 8 t u s 2 2 k e cs k e csc k e rs t e p w p in which the terms on the right hand side represent 9 1 k e cs u n n u s 2 2 1 1 n r u n

can be interpreted as follows kecs represents the advective transport of kinetic energy by cross stream u n kecsc the advective transport of kinetic energy by the cross stream circulation u n u z tep the production of turbulent kinetic energy kers the transport of kinetic energy by reynolds stress and wp the work done by the streamwise pressure since the present experiments concern the steady flow all the t terms in this paper equal zero it should be noted that eq 8 does not include the viscous dissipation term as mentioned earlier the viscous dissipation term in the kinetic equation is closely connected with the evolution of enstrophy which will be considered in the following enstrophy equation as has been made clear in the introduction the present research concentrates mainly on the flow phenomena in the central part of the cross section in this region only curvature induced secondary flow occurs which means that the vorticity vector perpendicular to the n z plane is the most dominant accordingly without loss of accuracy ω s 2 2 is used to represent the total enstrophy ω s 2 ω n 2 ω z 2 2 and thereby the enstrophy equation is transformed directly from the streamwise vorticity equation given by van balen et al 2009 multiplying the streamwise vorticity equation by ω s and neglecting the gradients in the streamwise direction yields 10 t ω s 2 2 e n adv e n c e n cf k e rns e

enadv represents the advective transport of enstrophy by the secondary flow enc the effects associated with curvature on the evolution of enstrophy encf the effects of the centrifugal force on the evolution of enstrophy enrns the effects associated with the reynolds normal stresses enrss the effects connected with the reynolds shear stresses endiff the dissipation by the molecular viscosity which as discussed in the introduction are negligible for large reynolds number flow and thus are left out of consideration in the present investigations in the remainder of the paper a term by term analysis for the kinetic energy and the enstrophy equation will be performed based on the data from the experiments described hereafter this analysis will help us to gain an insight into the effects of different physical terms on the energy transformation 3 experimental apparatus and data experiments were carried out in a b 0 4 m wide laboratory flume at the institute for sedimentation on river and coastal engineering tianjin university a 3 5 m long straight inflow reach allows the boundary layer to develop fully before the flow enters in the 180 bend of constant radius of curvature r 1 2 m which is followed by a 3 5 m long straight outflow reach fig 2 a it is worthwhile mentioning that there exists a relationship between channel migration rates and the ratio of radius of meandering bend curvature to channel width r b this means the development of meandering rivers is associated with r b furthermore the maximum rate of migration occurs where r b falls into a narrow range of 2 3 hickin and nanson 1984 crosato 2008 this relationship is significant because it suggests an inherent mechanism underlying the evolution of meandering rivers and can be considered to represent the adjustment of the planform geometry towards a equilibrium profile which allows the river to control its energy losses hooke 1975 richards 1982 therefore the value of r b associated with the maximum migration rates is of great importance to river regulation with the well chosen value of r b 3 in the present experiments we hope the reported study can not only provide a better understanding of transformation process of kinetic energy but also has practicalapplication in river engineering such as bank protection and stable channel design the bed and side walls of the channel are made of plexiglass measurement of discharge was carried out by a calibrated flow meter set on the supply water pump table 1 shows the geometric and hydraulic conditions q is the discharge h the mean flow depth u q bh the mean velocity s s the bed slope re the mean reynolds number and fr the mean froude number it should be noted that since the water depths between the two banks in the bend is defined as 1 5 b r u 2 g 2 mm blanckaert and graf 2001 the water level variations along with the radial direction can be considered negligibly small 1 36 of the water depth at the flume entrance 0 15 m considering this the mean water depth is considered to be equal to the water depth measured at the flume entrance and all the other mean flow characteristics are estimated based on this mean water depth s h is the mean water surface gradient on the centerline according to blanckaert 2009 the cross sectional averaged water elevations decreases about linearly along the centerline of the bend therefore s h can be estimated by s h z in z out l in which z in and z out represent the water elevations measured on the centerline at the bend entrance and exit respectively and l the arc length of the centerline in the bend c f is a chézy type dimensionless friction coefficient defined as c f 1 2 u g r h s h in which r h is the mean hydraulic radius it is should be mentioned that there is a wide range of configurations of meandering rivers in nature which makes it difficult to represent all natural conditions in a laboratory flume and the flow regimes also vary significantly in different rivers therefore physical experiments are commonly designed based on the dominant dimensionless geometrical and hydraulic parameters that reflect the general geometry and flow characteristics of meandering rivers for the geometry of open channel bends the principal dimensionless control parameters for meander hydrodynamics are c f 1 h b and b r blanckaert 2011 with the former characterizing the velocity redistribution in meandering rivers and the latter representing the curvature effects furthermore they found that the values of c f 1 h b are typically limited in the range of 6 to 12 and tend to decrease with the increase in river size on the basis of this the present experiments were designed under the geometrical conditions with the parameter c f 1 h b 7 68 which is representative of large natural meandering rivers with a width to radius ratio b r 3 according to crosato 2008 this value is in the range of natural rivers with sharp curvature which means that the channel s configuration can be considered representative of natural sharp bends for the hydraulic characteristics of open channels froude number is a major indicator of free surface flow wang et al 2014 it is also known that meandering rivers normally develop in the alluvial plains of lower reaches dey 2014 in which the froude number is usually very small fr 1 table 2 estimates some important hydraulic and geometric parameters in some typical natural meandering rivers it can be found that the values of fr fall within the range of 0 07 0 26 in most meandering rivers and tends to decrease with an increase in the river size the present experiment is characterized by fr 0 16 which is representative of the flow condition in natural meandering rivers based on the aforementioned the major geometric and hydraulic parameters in the present experiments are considered to represent a generic rather than a specific model of a field case the effects of curvature and froude number on energy transformation will be discussed in section 5 the velocity measurements were performed with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv based on the doppler effect adv obtains the three dimensional velocity vector u i t with high spatial and temporal resolution the adv consists of a central emitter surrounded by four receivers mounted in a measuring stand specially designed for laboratory experiments during the measurements the transmit transducer sends a short pulse that covers a sampling volume and the four receivers listen to an echo that corresponds from this volume to obtain the three velocity components from that volume for the measurements presented in this work the sampling frequency was 200 hz and the acquisition time was 60 s from the measured data the time averaged velocity vector u u s u n u z the fluctuating velocity vector u u s u n u z and all reynolds stress components u i u j i j s n z can be obtained as mentioned in the introduction the present research focuses on energy transformation within the context of secondary flow therefore it is important to capture the cross sections with relatively higher intensity secondary flow according to the numerical simulation of bai et al 2014 secondary flow develops at the bend entrance reaches a maximum magnitude between 90 and 120 from the bend entrance and weakens in the final part of the curved reach considering this three dimensional velocity measurements were made at the 90 and 120 cross sections from the bend entrance measurements were first performed on a relatively coarse grid in these two cross sections to find the regions with identifiable cells in these regions high resolution measurements were subsequently performed on a fine grid which makes it possible to evaluate three time averaged velocity components and turbulent stress components the size of the dense measuring grid fig 2 b is 32 mm horizontally and 9 5 mm vertically the lateral distance to the side walls is 40 mm the vertical distance to the bottom and to the water surface are 5 mm and 50 mm respectively since the measured point is situated 50 mm below the transducer probe which has to be immersed in the water in the present paper the process of energy transport in open channel bends is investigated by means of a term by term evaluation of the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation this requires the evaluation of derivatives of the measured quantities such as the derivatives of the time averaged velocities turbulent stresses which are difficult to estimate directly from the raw data due to the scattering of experimental data therefore analytical functions have been fitted to the experimental data using two dimensional cubic splines which provided the high spatial resolution data sufficiently smooth for later evaluation of derivatives of the measured quantities more details about the spline functions can be found in micula and micula 1999 the uncertainty caused by this method in the evaluated terms in eqs 8 and 10 is estimated in appendix a in agreement with blanckaert and de vriend 2004 and termini 2015 this value of uncertainty is sufficient for the purpose of this paper see appendix a section and thus the present results will not be corrupted by experimental inaccuracies 4 results 4 1 summary of preview results as shown in fig 3 a and b there exist two cells at the two investigated cross sections in the centre region a relatively stronger cell covering a large part of the cross section is observed with outward velocities near the water surface and inward velocities near the bottom this cell is often called curvature induced secondary flow which is caused by the interaction between the inward pressure gradient induced by the transverse tilting of the water surface and the outward centrifugal force blanckaert and graf 2001 besides the centre region cell a relatively weaker cell is noticed close to the outer bank this is often named turbulence induced secondary flow which is generated by the non homogeneity and anisotropy of turbulence einstein and li 1958 hinze 1973 perkins 1970 gessner 1973 as mentioned in section 2 the velocity of the centre region cell is about 20 30 of the streamwise velocity in contrast with the much smaller velocity of the outer bank cell which is typically 3 of the streamwise velocity blanckaert and de vriend 2005 blanckaert and graf 2001 also showed that the cross sectional velocities of the centre region cell are u n 2 u z 2 u o 0 1 on the average while the cross sectional velocities of the outer region cell are u n 2 u z 2 u o 0 03 furthermore the centre region cell always covers a much larger part of the cross section than the outer bank cell see fig 3 considering this the centre region cell is generally much stronger and larger than its outer region counterpart and thus plays a more important role in the energy transport and dissipation therefore attention is restricted to the flow phenomena in the central part of the cross section the dimensions of the centre region cell can be roughly estimated as 14 7 5 cm since our attention is focused on the centre region the velocity measurements were subsequently performed on a dense grid in this region fig 3c which is marked by red dashed lines all the results described hereafter are based on data collected from the experiments performed on this fine grid fig 4 a and b show the distribution of the normalized streamwise velocity component u s u in the centre region of the cross section at 90 and 120 respectively in the 90 cross section the maximum velocity region is found almost along the diagonal line of the examined area and the maximum value is about 1 25u in the 120 cross section the maximum velocity region is observed near the lower right corner and the maximum value is about 1 27u the cross sectional patterns of the secondary flow at 90 and 120 are illustrated in fig 4 c d respectively by means of the normalized streamwise vorticity ω s h u a zone of the streamwise vorticity ω s 0 occurs near the upper left part of the examined areas in the two cross sections it is highlighted by a thick ω s 0 isoline a zone of the streamwise vorticity ω s 0 occurs in a large portion of the examined areas in the examined area of the 90 cross section the streamwise vorticity decreases from a positive maximum value of 1 4 u h in the bottom layer towards a negative peak valueof 0 8 u h in the top layer in contrast at the 120 cross section the streamwise vorticity decreases from apositive maximum value of 2 u h in the bottom layer towards a negative peak value of 0 8 u h in the top layer fig 4 e and f compare some of the observed vertical profiles u s u in the cross section at 90 and 120 respectively it can be seen that in the left part of the examined area the measured maximum velocity appears far below the free surface making the measured velocity profiles substantially deviate from the logarithmic profile 4 2 terms of the kinetic energy equation in this section the most important terms in the kinetic energy equation will now be analyzed term by term all terms are normalized by g u s s 0 00157 m2 s3 which is computed from u 0 2 m s fig 5 shows different normalized terms of eq 8 at 90 cross section in the examined area the term kecs increases from about 0 05 close to the bottom to a maximum positive value of 0 5 in the top of this area showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 2 o 10 1 in comparison the term kecsc shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 100 an order of magnitude larger than the term kecs and reaches a negative maximum value of 5 in the top left corner and a positive maximum value of 1 2 in the bottom layer therefore it can be concluded that the convective effect plays an important role in the energy transport in addition to investigate the relative importance of each term associated with cross stream circulation in the kinetic energy equation the term kecsc is divided into the sum of terms k e csc i u n u s 2 2 n 1 n r 1 u s 2 u n r k e csc i i u z u s 2 2 z the term kecsc i represents the advective transport of kinetic energy by the transverse component of cross stream circulation un the term kecsc ii denotes the advective transport of kinetic energy by the vertical component of cross stream circulation uz as shown in fig 5 c the negative peak value of the term kecsc i is found in the upper part of the centre examined area and increases in value to 1 0 near the bottom layer showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 100 the negative peak value of kecsc ii is found in the top left corner and increases in value to about 0 8 near the bottom showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 100 fig 5 d on the basis of the results it can be concluded that the transport of energy by the transverse component of cross stream circulation un is of a comparable order of magnitude as by the vertical component of cross stream circulation uz which means that both of them play a leading role fig 5 e and f illustrate the terms associated with turbulent stress kers increases in value from 0 4 in the bottom layer to 0 75 in the top left corner and shows values of order of magnitude o 10 1 an order of magnitude smaller than kecsc fig 5 e in contrast tep shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 3 o 10 1 which means that a negligible part of the total kinetic energy transfer between time averaged flow and turbulence fig 5 f thus the production of turbulent kinetic energy is almost irrelevant to the energy transport in open channel bends fig 6 reports different terms of eq 8 at 120 cross section comparing the results of the two cross sections it can be observed that the term kecs in both of the two cross sections shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 2 o 10 1 like in the case of 90 cross section the term kecsc in the 120 cross section still plays an important role in the energy transport a similar negative value region with values of order of magnitude of o 100 is observed in the upper part of the examined area and the term kecsc reaches a negative maximum value of 4 6 in this region the term kecsc i and kecsc ii in the two cross sections are moderately different both of the two terms in 120 cross section account for relatively larger negative value region and show smaller negative maximum values than in the 90 cross section in summary all terms in eq 8 are of different order of magnitude the advective transport of kinetic energy by the cross stream circulation is the dominant mechanism in the energy transport of which the transverse and the vertical component of cross stream circulation are of the comparable order of magnitude the cross flow and turbulent stresses play a subordinate role in the transport of kinetic energy kinetic energy transfer between time averaged flow and turbulence is negligible 4 3 terms of the enstrophy equation from section theoretical considerations it is clear that enstrophy is directly related to the energy dissipation considering this the terms of eq 10 have been estimated on the basis of the measured data fig 7 reports the isolines of terms in the enstrophy equation at 90 cross section all terms are normalized by u h 3 with u 0 2 m s and h 0 15 m from fig 7 it can be seen that the term enadv shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 10 the term enc shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 2 o 10 1 an order of magnitude smaller than the term enadv and thus contributes verylittle to the generation of enstrophy fig 7b in order to investigate the relative importance of each term associated the effects of the centrifugal force in the evolution of enstrophy the term encf is divided into the sum of terms e n cf i 1 n r 1 ω s u s 2 r z e n cf i i 1 n r 1 ω s u s 2 r z the term encf i represents the effects of the centrifugal force on the evolution of enstrophy and the term encf ii represents the effects associated with turbulence related centrifugal force it can be seen from fig 7 c that the term encf i plays an important role in the evolution of enstrophy this term decreases from 2 4 near the bottom layer to about 1 in the middle of the area and then increases again towards the top of the area and reach values of 3 showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 10 in contrast the term encf ii shows negligible values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 1 0 2 o 10 1 fig 7d fig 7 e and f show the effects of the turbulent stress on the production of enstrophy it can be seen that the term enrns and the term enrss give a contribution of comparable magnitude to enstrophy generation although relatively smaller in values compared with the encf i term both of the term enrns and enrss show values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 10 and thus are not negligible in summary in the examined area the advective transport terms and the centrifugal force related terms are the most important mechanisms underlying the production of enstrophy and the latter is relatively larger curvature related terms and turbulence related centrifugal force terms contribute verylittle to the generation of enstrophy in contrast with the centrifugal force related terms although relatively smaller in values than the cross stream circulation terms and the centrifugal force related terms the reynolds stress terms are not negligible 5 discussion 5 1 transport of kinetic energy the experiments provide sufficient data for analysis of the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying the transport of kinetic energy fig 9 reports the distribution of the normalized streamwise kinetic energy defined as u s 2 u 2 for the 90 and 120 cross sections these results confirm that the streamwise velocity is substantially deformed in the region with an identifiable secondary flow this phenomenon is called the velocity dip phenomenon and has been already noticed by many other researchers nezu and nakagawa 1993 blanckaert and graf 2004 blanckaert and de vriend 2004 moramarco et al 2004 termini and moramarco 2018 investigated the effect of width to depth ratio on the velocity dip phenomenon and found that the distance between the maximum streamwise velocity and the water surface was closely related to the development of secondary flow along the bend the change of the location of the maximum streamwise velocity can also be found in the present experiments in the 90 cross section the highest kinetic energy is observed in the lowerleft corner of the examined area while the smallest values is found in the upperleft hand corner fig 9a in contrast in the 120 cross section the location of the highest kinetic energy is adjusted gradually to the lowerright corner of the examined area fig 9b this change of the location of the highest kinetic energy is more than likely to be induced by the evolution of secondary flow along the bend in agreement with blanckaert and graf 2004 the advection of kinetic energy by the cross stream motion u n u z is decomposed into the sum of the advective transport by the cross stream circulation u n u z and by the cross flow u n 0 and the advective transport of kinetic energy by cross stream circulation is further split into the sum of the advective transport by un and uz from section 4 1 it can be concluded that kecsc the advection of kinetic energy by the cross stream motion u n u z is the dominant mechanism underlying this deformation of kinetic energy distribution and thus exerts the most important role in the transport of kinetic energy which is in agreement with blanckaert and graf 2004 they carried out the order of magnitude analysis of the terms in the streamwise momentum equation by using the experimental data collected in a deformed bed 120 open channel bend although they investigated the transport of streamwise momentum rather than kinetic energy when attention is focused only on the advective transport effects of cross stream motion their results can also provide a contrast with the present results the un term kecsc i and uz term kecsc ii are also considered as can be seen in fig 5 c and 6 c a thick 0 isoline splits the examined area into two parts in the upper part of this region where un 0 the term kecsc i shows negative values and kinetic energy also shows smaller values in this part therefore in this region the role of un in this region is to take away kinetic energy in the lower part of this region where un 0 the term kecsc i shows positive values and kinetic energy also shows larger values in this part therefore the role of un in this region is to bring back kinetic energy and from figs 5 d and 6 d it can be observed that the vertical component of cross stream circulation uz plays a similar role to un in the transport of kinetic energy figs 5d and 6d therefore in large part of the examined area the high energy fluid is transported by cross stream circulation from the region near the water surface towards the region near the bottom layer this can account for the deformation of kinetic energy distribution blanckaert and graf 2004 also carry out special investigations into the advective effect of un and uz they claimed that the advective effect of un is generally larger than that of uz however according to the order of magnitude analysis in section 4 2 it is observed in the present results that un and uz make a contribution of the comparable magnitude to the deformation of streamwise velocity especially in the negative value region where both of them show almost the same negative maximum values as shown in figs 5 a and 6 a although the cross stream term kecs is one order of magnitude smaller than the cross stream circulation term kecsc the term kecs is not negligibly small especially in the upper left corner of the examined area furthermore in the top left edge the cross stream term kecs shows positive values and also slightly offsets the advective effect of cross stream circulation u n u z which shows negative values in this region according to the results of the order of magnitude analysis in figs 5 e and 6 e it can be seen that the transport of kinetic energy by reynolds stress is significantlyweaker than by cross stream motion but it is not negligible since the term kers in the topleftcorner of the examined area shows the positive values which compensates a little for the negative values of the term kecsc furthermore it can also be concluded that kinetic energy transfer from the time averaged flow to the turbulence via the reynolds stresses u s u n and u s u z is trivial to kinetic energy of the time averaged flow especially when compared with the energy transport by cross stream circulation although this energy transfer is important to maintain the turbulent flow therefore when attention is paid to the energy transport in the time averaged flow this kinetic energy transfer from the time averaged flow to the turbulence can be ignored as mentioned in section 3 the froude number is a major parameter for flow characteristic to examine how our experimental results are affected by froude number in the same laboratory flume another experiment for convenience called run 2 hereafter was performed in the 90 cross section to compare with the experiment already introduced for convenience called run 1 hereafter the only difference in the hydraulic conditions between the two sets of experiment is the mean velocity u with 0 2 m s for run 1 and 0 25 m s for run 2 correspondingly the froude numbers for run 1 and 2 are 0 16 and 0 206 respectively with the latter being 28 75 larger than the former fig 10 shows different normalized terms of eq 8 at 90 cross section for run 2 all terms are normalized by g u s s 0 002 m2 s3 which is computed from u 0 25 m s it can be found that the differences between the same terms at different fr are rather small the maximum value of all terms in fig 10 are slightly larger than their counterparts in fig 5 despite the difference it can also be seen that all terms in fig 10 are of the same order of magnitude as their counterparts in fig 5 for example the term kecsc in fig 10 also assumes the largest order of magnitude which is the same as the results in fig 5 similarly the other terms in fig 10 are almost in the same role as in fig 5 as a result within the range of investigated froude numbers energy transport did not indicate distinct dependence on the froude number as mentioned in section 3 the froude number of large natural meandering rivers is generally very small and varies over a rather narrow range 0 07 0 26 therefore with fr falling into the range of 0 16 0 206 the present results can also be expected to be applicable to large meandering rivers 5 2 energy dissipation as should be clear from section 2 for the time averaged flow the energy dissipation is closely connected with the evolution of enstrophy according to the kinetic eq 1 for the time averaged flow the energy dissipation is composed of two parts one associated with the generation of turbulent kinetic energy which has been discussed in the above section and the other related to the viscous dissipation which is what this section focuses on fig 11 shows the distribution of the normalized enstrophy defined as ω s h u 2 for the 90 and 120 cross sections from fig 11 it can be observed that enstrophy shows high values in the near bed region and eye of the centre region cell which means that in these regions where the velocity gradient is relatively steeper kinetic energy is converted into heat through viscous deformation it should also be here that the high values of enstrophy close to the near bed layer do not mean there exists an identifiable vortex but the boundary layer in order to gain an insight into the relative importance of each mechanism underlying the energy dissipation the enstrophy eq 10 has been investigated by a term by term analysis from figs 7 and 8 it becomes clear that the term encf i in the enstrophy equation exert an important role in the energy dissipation the term encf i represents the skewing induced generation of enstrophy which corresponds with the skewing induced vorticity also called the prandtl s circulation of the first kind as has been discussed in the above section the cross stream circulation strongly influences the energy transport which further has an effect on the gradient of the centrifugal force u s 2 r z and ultimately the generation of enstrophy in the regions which are strongly affected by the secondary flow the advective transport of kinetic energy by the secondary flow deforms the us profiles which means that the centrifugal force term u s 2 r z is dependent on secondary flow due to the dip phenomenon caused by the advective transport of kinetic energy the near bed gradient of the streamwise velocity is increased as observed in the present results the increased near bed gradient of the streamwise velocity will further lead to the increase in energy dissipation however for very sharply curved bends as in the present experiments the nonlinear feedback between us and secondary flow will result in the saturation of intensity of the secondary flow blanckaert 2009 in the meanwhile the near bed gradient of the streamwise velocity will not increase which means that the energy dissipation caused by the centrifugal force term u s 2 r z is also no longer increased in the regions which are not affected by the secondary flow except for the boundary layers the us profile can be considered to follow the logarithmic velocity distribution in these regions as a result of the effect of turbulent diffusion the distribution of us is rather even along the vertical line see fig 4e and 4f which means that the gradient of us 2 is negligibly small compared with it in the regions affected strongly by the secondary flow in contrast the effects of curvature and turbulence related centrifugal force on the generation of enstrophy are negligibly small compared with the term encf i see figs 7b 7d 8b and 8d as shown in figs 7 a and 8 a the transport of enstrophy by the cross stream enadv shows values comparable with the term encf i however this term only represents the redistribution of enstrophy across the cross section and does not affect the total enstrophy in other words this term can neither generate enstrophy nor reduce it from figs 7 e f 8 e and 8 f the term enrns and enrss in the enstrophy equation are smaller than the term encf i but cannot be neglected according to perkins 1970 in straight channels the u n 2 u z 2 term is the source of the streamwise vorticity ω s and u n u z term acts as a sink of it which means that these two terms are also the source or sink of enstrophy however for curved channel bends the role of reynolds stresses in the evolution of enstrophy is complex from the present results the term enrns and enrss show negative values over most of the examined area which means that they suppress the generation of enstrophy in the upper and near bottom layer the two terms also show positive values which means that they favor the generation of enstrophy therefore from the present results it cannot be determined whether the two reynolds stresses terms will increase enstrophy or decrease it or both further investigations are needed to determine their role in the evolution of enstrophy similar to the previous section to investigate the influence of froude number the enstrophy eq 10 has also been estimated based on the measured data from run 2 fig 12 reports the isolines of the terms in the enstrophy equation at 90 cross section for run 2 and all terms are normalized by u h 3 with u 0 25 m s and h 0 15 m it can be seen that all terms in fig 12 are of the same order of magnitude as their counterparts in fig 7 and there is not much difference in the maximum value of all terms between the two runs for example the most important term encf i also shows the largest order of magnitude see fig 12c which is the same as the results in fig 7 therefore the froude number has limited influence on the energy dissipation combined with the earlier mentioned analysis the transformation process of kinetic energy is expected to be insensitive to variations in froude number 5 3 applicability of results since the present research focused attention on the energy transformation within the context of the secondary flow the strength of secondary flow is a major concern for the present experiments it is well known that the width to depth ratio b h or h b is an important dimensionless variable which has a strong impact on the secondary flow and further controls the development of meander rivers considering h b h r r b the influence of h b on the secondary flow can be decomposed into two parts the influence of h r which accounts for the shallowness of the channel and r b the dimensionless curvature ratio which represents the sharp curvature effects for the influence of the shallowness of the flow h r there have been many studies focused attention on associating the strength of centre region cell of secondary flow with several factors such as channel curvature r and depth of water h engelund 1974 falcon ascanio and kennedy 1983 demuren and rodi 1986 these expressions are of the form 12 u n u h r this relation indicates that the secondary flow velocity progressively increases with increasing values of h r which has already been derived by many researchers however the dependency of the strength of cross circulation on h r may be more complex than expression 12 indicates which means that the strength of cross circulation do not necessarily increase proportionally to the curvature ratio h r actually according to the experimental results of miao et al 2016 in the smoother bed in their experiments sand bed a critical value for the linear range is h r 0 04 for h r 0 04 secondary flow magnitude grows about linearly with h r with the further increase in values of h r the growth becomes less than linear before the secondary flow magnitude reaches a maximum value at h r 0 1 and slowly decreases for h r 0 1 in which range the secondary flow magnitude decreases very slightly with further increase of h r and therefore can be considered to remain nearly constant the value of h r in the present experiments is 0 125 approximately 20 larger than 0 1 since the present research focused attention on the transport and dissipation of kinetic energy within the context of secondary flow in sharp open channel bends it is expected that with the further increase in the value of h r the transformation process of kinetic energy is insensitive to the increase in h r this could be explained by the fact that there exist complex nonlinear interactions between the streamwise and cross stream velocities which weakens the cross stream motion as recommended by miao et al river bends can be considered mildly curved when h r 0 04 or b h 25 b r which is beyond the scope of the present research since the major concern for present research is the sharply curved channels furthermore our attention was paid not on the exact values of each term but on the comparison between various terms and the relative importance of the various mechanisms considering this the results and conclusions in the present experiments are generally valid for sharp natural meandering rivers it should be noted here that for a laboratory flow to be measured in detail as well as to ensure that the flow is turbulent reynolds number is dependent on the water depth the water cannot be too shallow cannot be less than 10 cm say in the present experiments which means that h r cannot be too small in laboratory meandering experiments in addition the present data also served for the validation of a three dimensional numerical model so cases with smaller values of h r could be investigated through numerical simulations for the influence of the curvature r b the laboratory meandering researches include either single bends such as the commonly used single circular channel bends with constant curvatures various central angles or the periodic symmetric channels such as the kinoshita channels its planform is defined by a kinoshita curve the single circular channel bends can also be regarded as an element of these periodic symmetric channels according to yalin 1992 the cross sectional flow iscomprisedoftwoparts the cross circulation which is caused by channel curvature r and the convective component which is induced by the streamwise variation of curvature r 1 s for the single circular channel bends with constant curvature r 1 s 0 the attention is focused only on the role of various curvatures various central angles in the strength of secondary flow along the bend blanckaert 2009 found that the strength of secondary flow stops increasing when the curvature is increased in very sharp bends a process he called the saturation of the secondary flow as mentioned before this is due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions between the streamwise and cross stream velocities for the present laboratory experiments since the value of r b reaches the range of very sharp bends the results and conclusions are deemed valid for natural sharp meandering bends for the channels with variable curvatures r 1 s 0 the convective flow pattern needs to be considered whiting and dietrich 1993 found that the convective behavior of flow is important only in wide meandering rivers b h 10 in the case of small values of b h the convective flow behaviour was significantly attenuated this has been confirmed by termini and piraino 2011 in the present research the effects of convective behavior is reflected in the transport of energy by the cross stream u n the term kecs it can be seen quite clearly from fig 3 that the cross circulation dominates over convective transversal motion in the 90 and 120 cross sections which means that the transport of kinetic energy by cross circulation plays the leading role however in wider meandering rivers the term kecs may be larger than in the present experiments for the energy dissipation the transport of kinetic energy by cross circulation and by cross stream only represent the redistribution of enstrophy across the cross section both of them can neither generate enstrophy nor reduce the total enstrophy and as a result will not affect greatly the resistance induced by the secondary flow 6 conclusions this work investigated the transformation process of kinetic energy in a sharp open channel bend with the aid of high quality three dimensional flow measurements special attention was paid to the role of the cross stream circulation in the transport of kinetic energy and energy dissipation the present study broadens the physical understanding of the energy transformation in curved channels the conclusions that can be drawn from this research are summarized as follows for the transport of kinetic energy it has been confirmed that the advective transport of kinetic energy by the cross stream circulation is the most important mechanism underlying the energy transport in sharp open channel bends this term is at least one order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the kinetic energy equation and makes a significant contribution to the deformation of the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity the advective transport of kinetic energy by the transverse and by the vertical component of cross stream circulation are of the comparable order of magnitude the advection of kinetic energy by the cross flow although less important than the cross stream circulation term cannot be ignored the reynolds stresses play a minor role the transport of kinetic energy by reynolds stress is not negligible since this term shows the positive values in some areas and thus compensates moderately for the negative values of the cross stream circulation term kinetic energy transfer between time averaged flow and turbulence is negligible for the time averaged flow field for the dissipation of kinetic energy it can be found that the centrifugal force term which represents the skewing induced generation of enstrophy exerts the dominant influence on the energy dissipation in sharp open channel bends in the regions strongly affected by the secondary flow the centre regions the cross stream circulation has a strong effect on the gradient of the centrifugal force and then influences the generation of enstrophy which follows that the intricate interaction between secondary flow and the streamwise velocity plays an important role in the increase in the energy dissipation the role of curvature and turbulence related centrifugal force on the generation of enstrophy can be ignored when compared with the centrifugal force term within the range of investigated froude numbers the transformation process is insensitive to the variations in froude number it is worthwhile mentioning that although the laboratory experiments were restricted to the centre regions under the hydraulic and geometric conditions investigated in this research they lend some valuable insights into the complete process of the energy transformation in particular the evolution of enstrophy was investigated in curved channel flow which may provide a new way of studying the problems related to resistance in river bends in order to extend the present analysis further research could be made under different conditions such as different width radius ratios and planimetric configurations furthermore the emphasis of this study was mainly on sharply curved channel flow further analysis can be extended to mildly curved bends with r b conflict of interest none acknowledgments this study

university appendix a estimation of the experimental uncertainty the experimental uncertainty is composed of two parts the uncertainty in the experimental data and in the estimation of the terms in eqs 8 and 10 for the experimental data in the process of velocity measurement both the signal noise ratio snr and the correlation coefficient cor were observed carefully the snr and cor were always higher than 20 db and 90 respectively and remain stable during the process of measurement which ensures the quality of the experimental data for the uncertainty in the estimation of the terms in eqs 8 and 10 the relative uncertainty of a measured quantity f can be defined as a1 ε f f f f in which f is the measured value f the real value in the present research attention is focused on the time averaged quantity considering this in agreement with termini 2015 the uncertainty in time averaged quantity f can be estimated by the standard error of the mean sem which can be expressed as a2 ε ta σ f n in which σ f is the standard deviation of time series of f n is the size the number of observations of the sample on the basis of experimental data a conservative estimation is made of the uncertainty in the time averaged velocity u i i s n z and the reynolds stress components u i u j i s n z the uncertainty of these quantities was estimated as follows ε ta u s 3 ε ta u n 3 ε ta u z 10 ε u n 3 ε ta u i u j 10 the higher relative uncertainty of u z is mainly due to its low value the terms in the kinetic and the enstrophy equations are of the form f 1 f 2 p and f 1 2 f 2 p q where p and q are generic variables therefore based on eq a1 f 1 f 2 p and f 1 2 f 2 p q can be written as follows a3 ε f 1 f 2 p f 1 f 2 p f 1 f 2 p f 1 f 2 p ε 1 f 2 ε 2 p f 2 p ε 1 f 2 ε 2 p f 2 p the expression of f 1 2 f 2 p q is similar to that of f 1 f 2 p that is a4 ε f 1 2 f 2 p q ε 1 2 f 2 ε 2 p q f 2 p q ε 1 2 f 2 ε 2 p q f 2 p q according to blanckaert and de vriend 2004 it can be assumed that error varies slowly in space which follows that a5 f ε p f p f ε f ε for 2 f ε p q 2 f p q it has the same form as eq a5 based on a5 eqs a3 and a4 can be written as a6 ε f 1 f 2 p ε 1 f 2 ε 2 p f

estimations of all terms in eqs 8 and 10 are conservative in the present results all terms are of a comparable magnitude or at least differ by an order of magnitude furthermore the present research focused attention on first order effects therefore in agreement with blanckaert and de vriend 2004 and termini 2015 the calculated results are assumed not to be corrupted by experimental inaccuracies 
6675,in sharp open channel bends there exists nonlinear interactions between streamwise and cross stream velocities which leads to the adjustment of flow energy transport increases the energy dissipation and eventually influences the development of river bends however previous studies have not yet fully understood the mechanisms underlying the transport and dissipation of energy in open channel bends in addition energy dissipation is directly related to the evolution of enstrophy ω ω 2 however it has not yet received much attention in the study of the resistance in meandering rivers to gain an insight into these mechanisms with the aid of detailed experimental data collected in a sharp open channel bend this study quantified the impacts of the key terms in the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation results show that the term related to the transport of kinetic energy by cross stream circulation is at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the kinetic energy equation which contributes significantly to the redistribution of kinetic energy over the cross section the term related to the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the kinetic energy equation shows the smallest order of magnitude and thus is almost negligible for the time averaged flow field furthermore over most of the measured area the term related to the centrifugal force shows values of at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the enstrophy equation which means that this term exerts the dominant influence on the energy dissipation the results also revealed that the transformation process is insensitive to the variations in froude number these results are expected to improve the understanding of the complete process of energy

rivers form a dynamic system which is in the process ofcontinuous evolution camporeale et al 2007 this development of river bends is strongly affected by the spatial distribution of the velocities the boundary shear stresses and the sediment transport all of which are directly related to the energy transformation therefore to make a better understanding of the development of meandering rivers it is important first to make a full appreciation of the mechanisms underlying the transformation process of flow energy in open channel bends the energy transformation is determined by the combination of two components the transport of kinetic energy by velocity viscous stress and reynolds stress and the energy dissipation by fluid friction in open channel bends each of these components exhibits its characteristics one of the key features of curved channel flow is the existence of secondary flow johannesson and parker 1989 although the velocity of the secondary flow is relatively smaller in comparison with the streamwise velocity there exists a strong interaction between the streamwise and cross stream velocity de vriend 1981 blanckaert and de vriend 2004 blanckaert and graf 2004 therefore the distribution of kinetic energy especially the portion of the streamwise flow is strongly influenced by this interaction which has an effect on the distribution of bed shear stress and further the development of the bed topography of river bends engelund 1974 edwards and smith 2002 chien and wan 1999 however in spite of its engineering importance the mechanisms underlying the process of energy transport have not been investigated thoroughly specifically few studies have performed quantitative analyses of the relative importance of different mechanisms in energy transport such as the role of viscous stresses reynolds stresses and most importantly the secondary flow for the energy dissipation because of the additional transverse component of the boundary shear stress induced by the secondary flow in open channel bends odgaard and bergs 1988 bridge 1992 kinetic energy will be dissipated at a faster rate than it would through straight channels which leads to an increase in the resistance to the flow and therefore reduces the conveyance capacity of rivers and channels chang 1983 shiono et al 1999 extensive investigations have been carried out to quantify the energy dissipation or flow resistance in open channel bends or natural channels for example chang 1983 proposed an analytical model to compute the rate of energy dissipation in open channel bends and showed that the energy dissipation induced by the secondary flow accounts for over one half of the total energy dissipation at a higher depth radius ratio recent work by blanckaert 2009 indicated that energy dissipation barely increases once a threshold curvature is reached which is what he called the saturation phenomenon moramarco and dingman 2017 investigated the relationship between two velocity distribution parameters and flow resistance in terms of manning roughness shear velocity and water surface slope in general most foregoing research focused attention on associating the energy dissipation in open channel bends with one or several factors such as channel curvature roughness depth of water froude number and other variables however the mechanisms underlying the energy dissipation in open channel bends have not yet been investigated in detail these mechanisms are important in the estimation of flow resistance for the closure of the governing equations in essence energy dissipation is a fluid mechanics problem in which vorticity plays a leading role in vortex dynamics ω ω 2 which is called enstrophy is directly related to kinetic energy and represents the energy dissipation effects in the fluid davidson 2004 wu et al 2006 alexakis and doering 2006 however in spite of its importance for understanding the mechanisms underlying the process of energy dissipation in open channel bends enstrophy has received little attention from the aforementioned the purpose of the present research is to obtain a more detailed picture of the two components of the energy transformation in river bends in particular special emphasis is placed on the role of the cross circulation in the process of the energy transformation it should be mentioned that the present research focuses only on flow phenomena in the central part of the cross section furthermore attention is restricted to the case of with immobile bed topography although the flow sediment interaction also influences the energy transformation it is important first to gain an insight into the hydrodynamic processes of the energy transformation before investigating the mechanisms in the more complex case with sediment laden flow and mobile bed topography the major objectives of the present paper are 1 to report and analyze detailed experimental data on the streamwise flow secondary flow streamwise vorticity the turbulent normal and shear stresses which allow for an analysis of the flow physics and may be useful for numerical model validation 2 to analyze the mechanisms of kinetic energy transport in the present experiments by means of a term by term estimation of the kinetic energy equation 3 to analyze the mechanisms underlying the energy dissipation in the reported experiments by means of a term by term estimation of the enstrophy equation although such an analysis is restricted to the experimental conditions investigated in this work these results are expected to improve the understanding of the transformation process of kinetic energy in open channel bends 2 theoretical considerations to gain an insight into the mechanisms underlying the energy transformation the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation must be given adequate considerations for simplicity a cartesian coordinate system is adopted first to illuminate the problem the kinetic energy equation in the coordinate system is given by tennekes and lumley 1972 1 t 1 2 u i u i u j x j 1 2 u i u i x j p ρ u j 2 ν u i s ij u i u j u i u i u j s ij 2 ν s ij s ij in which the

density of water for details of the physical meaning of the various terms in this equation please refer to tennekes and lumley 1972 it should be noted that for large reynolds number flow the reynolds stress is much larger than viscous stress it follows that the transport of turbulent flow is much stronger than molecular transport therefore the transport of kinetic energy by viscous stresses 2 ν u i s ij x j is negligible the last two terms represent the production of turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate respectively u i u j s ij is normally negative while 2 s ij s ij is always positive definite according to tensor analysis 2 s ij s ij can be expressed as 2 2 s ij s ij ω i ω i 2 x i x j u i u j in which ω i is the vorticity and ω i ω i 2 is known as enstrophy if integrating eq 2 over a fixed volume with stationary boundary or the volume extends to infinity where the fluid is at rest then only enstrophy contributes to the total dissipation substituting eq 2 to eq 1 and integrating the result over the volume lead to the rate of change of total kinetic energy in the volume 3 t v 1 2 u i u i d σ ν 2 v ω i ω i 2 d σ v u i u j s ij d σ the above equation highlights the important role of ω i ω i 2 kinetic energy of the fluid decreases at a rate equal to the sum of enstrophy and the production of turbulent kinetic energy therefore in order to gain an insight into the process of energy dissipation the evolution of ω i ω i 2 should be carefully investigated the enstrophy equation provides a good basis for this investigation the enstrophy equation is transformed from the vorticity equation the vorticity equation is given by brundrett and baines 1963 4 ω k t u j ω k x j ω j u k x j ε ijk 2 u l u j x i x l ν 2 ω k x j x j in which the einstein summation convention is also used ε ijk i j k 1 2 3 is the levi civita symbol ω j i 1 2 3 is the time averaged vorticity the physical meanings of the terms in eq 4 can be seen in brundrett and baines 1963 multiplying the vorticity eq 4 by ω i the enstrophy equation for steady flow is obtained 5 t ω k ω k 2 u j x j ω k ω k 2 ω k ω j u k x j ε ijk ω k 2 u l u j x i x l ν 2 x j x j ω k ω k 2 ν ω i x j ω i x j details of the physical meaning of the various terms in this equation can be found in tennekes and lumley 1972 according to the order of magnitude analysis by tennekes and lumley 1972 the viscous term is of order of u 3 l 3 ul ν and all the other terms are order of u 3 l 3 where l and u are known as the characteristic scale of velocity and length respectively or integral scales of turbulence and comparable with the scales of the large vortex for the flow at large reynolds number u 3 l 3 ul ν is extremely small compared with the other terms which means that the viscosity terms are negligible so far the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation have been introduced and the connection between them has been clarified to investigate the energy transformation in open channel bends the two equations should be transformed from a cartesian to a cylindrical coordinate system according to nezu and nakagawa 1993 the velocity of the centre region secondary flow is about 20 30 of the streamwise velocity which means that the kinetic energy of the streamwise flow accounts for more than 90 of the total kinetic energy therefore the kinetic energy equation can be derived directly from the streamwise momentum equation the momentum equations in the cylindrical coordinate system can be found in batchelor 1970 multiplying the streamwise momentum equation by the streamwise velocity the kinetic energy equation in the orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system can be obtained as 6 t u s 2 2 1 1 n r u s s u s 2 2 u n n u s 2 2 1 1 n r u n u s 2 r u z z u s 2 2 1 1 n r g u s z s s 1 1 n r u s s u s u s u s n u s u n u s z u s u z 2 1 n r u s 2 u s u n r in which the s axis is along the channel centerline the n axis is perpendicular to it and points towards the center of curvature and the z axis points vertically upward from the horizontal s n plane the origin of the s axis is at the entrance of bend see fig 1 a 1 n r 1 is a metric factor that accounts for the divergence of the n coordinate lines zs is water surface elevation g is the gravitational acceleration u i i s n z are the time averaged velocity u i u j i s n z are the reynolds stress components according to de vriend 1981 the convective influence of the secondary flow on the streamwise velocity takes place only in n z plane and in consequence the streamwise variations of the physical quantities are unlikely to play an important role in it blanckaert and de vriend 2004 also argued that streamwise derivatives are not essential for the mechanisms underlying the two cross stream circulation cells since our attention is focused on the energy transformation within the context of secondary flow all the gradients in the streamwise direction described hereafter except for the gravity term are therefore left out of consideration in agreement with blanckaert and graf 2004 to differentiate the cross circulation motion a distinction is made to split the flow velocity components u n into the sum of the depth averaged value u n and local deviations from it u n see fig 1 b thus u n can be rewritten as 7 u n u n u n substituting the decomposition 7 into eq 6 and neglecting the gradients in the streamwise direction except for the streamwise pressure gradient eq 6 becomes 8 t u s 2 2 k e cs k e csc k e rs t e p w p in which the terms on the right hand side represent 9 1 k e cs u n n u s 2 2 1 1 n r u n

the production of turbulent kinetic energy kers the transport of kinetic energy by reynolds stress and wp the work done by the streamwise pressure since the present experiments concern the steady flow all the t terms in this paper equal zero it should be noted that eq 8 does not include the viscous dissipation term as mentioned earlier the viscous dissipation term in the kinetic equation is closely connected with the evolution of enstrophy which will be considered in the following enstrophy equation as has been made clear in the introduction the present research concentrates mainly on the flow phenomena in the central part of the cross section in this region only curvature induced secondary flow occurs which means that the vorticity vector perpendicular to the n z plane is the most dominant accordingly without loss of accuracy ω s 2 2 is used to represent the total enstrophy ω s 2 ω n 2 ω z 2 2 and thereby the enstrophy equation is transformed directly from the streamwise vorticity equation given by van balen et al 2009 multiplying the streamwise vorticity equation by ω s and neglecting the gradients in the streamwise direction yields 10 t ω s 2 2 e n adv e n c e n cf k e rns e

enadv represents the advective transport of enstrophy by the secondary flow enc the effects associated with curvature on the evolution of enstrophy encf the effects of the centrifugal force on the evolution of enstrophy enrns the effects associated with the reynolds normal stresses enrss the effects connected with the reynolds shear stresses endiff the dissipation by the molecular viscosity which as discussed in the introduction are negligible for large reynolds number flow and thus are left out of consideration in the present investigations in the remainder of the paper a term by term analysis for the kinetic energy and the enstrophy equation will be performed based on the data from the experiments described hereafter this analysis will help us to gain an insight into the effects of different physical terms on the energy transformation 3 experimental apparatus and data experiments were carried out in a b 0 4 m wide laboratory flume at the institute for sedimentation on river and coastal engineering tianjin university a 3 5 m long straight inflow reach allows the boundary layer to develop fully before the flow enters in the 180 bend of constant radius of curvature r 1 2 m which is followed by a 3 5 m long straight outflow reach fig 2 a it is worthwhile mentioning that there exists a relationship between channel migration rates and the ratio of radius of meandering bend curvature to channel width r b this means the development of meandering rivers is associated with r b furthermore the maximum rate of migration occurs where r b falls into a narrow range of 2 3 hickin and nanson 1984 crosato 2008 this relationship is significant because it suggests an inherent mechanism underlying the evolution of meandering rivers and can be considered to represent the adjustment of the planform geometry towards a equilibrium profile which allows the river to control its energy losses hooke 1975 richards 1982 therefore the value of r b associated with the maximum migration rates is of great importance to river regulation with the well chosen value of r b 3 in the present experiments we hope the reported study can not only provide a better understanding of transformation process of kinetic energy but also has practicalapplication in river engineering such as bank protection and stable channel design the bed and side walls of the channel are made of plexiglass measurement of discharge was carried out by a calibrated flow meter set on the supply water pump table 1 shows the geometric and hydraulic conditions q is the discharge h the mean flow depth u q bh the mean velocity s s the bed slope re the mean reynolds number and fr the mean froude number it should be noted that since the water depths between the two banks in the bend is defined as 1 5 b r u 2 g 2 mm blanckaert and graf 2001 the water level variations along with the radial direction can be considered negligibly small 1 36 of the water depth at the flume entrance 0 15 m considering this the mean water depth is considered to be equal to the water depth measured at the flume entrance and all the other mean flow characteristics are estimated based on this mean water depth s h is the mean water surface gradient on the centerline according to blanckaert 2009 the cross sectional averaged water elevations decreases about linearly along the centerline of the bend therefore s h can be estimated by s h z in z out l in which z in and z out represent the water elevations measured on the centerline at the bend entrance and exit respectively and l the arc length of the centerline in the bend c f is a chézy type dimensionless friction coefficient defined as c f 1 2 u g r h s h in which r h is the mean hydraulic radius it is should be mentioned that there is a wide range of configurations of meandering rivers in nature which makes it difficult to represent all natural conditions in a laboratory flume and the flow regimes also vary significantly in different rivers therefore physical experiments are commonly designed based on the dominant dimensionless geometrical and hydraulic parameters that reflect the general geometry and flow characteristics of meandering rivers for the geometry of open channel bends the principal dimensionless control parameters for meander hydrodynamics are c f 1 h b and b r blanckaert 2011 with the former characterizing the velocity redistribution in meandering rivers and the latter representing the curvature effects furthermore they found that the values of c f 1 h b are typically limited in the range of 6 to 12 and tend to decrease with the increase in river size on the basis of this the present experiments were designed under the geometrical conditions with the parameter c f 1 h b 7 68 which is representative of large natural meandering rivers with a width to radius ratio b r 3 according to crosato 2008 this value is in the range of natural rivers with sharp curvature which means that the channel s configuration can be considered representative of natural sharp bends for the hydraulic characteristics of open channels froude number is a major indicator of free surface flow wang et al 2014 it is also known that meandering rivers normally develop in the alluvial plains of lower reaches dey 2014 in which the froude number is usually very small fr 1 table 2 estimates some important hydraulic and geometric parameters in some typical natural meandering rivers it can be found that the values of fr fall within the range of 0 07 0 26 in most meandering rivers and tends to decrease with an increase in the river size the present experiment is characterized by fr 0 16 which is representative of the flow condition in natural meandering rivers based on the aforementioned the major geometric and hydraulic parameters in the present experiments are considered to represent a generic rather than a specific model of a field case the effects of curvature and froude number on energy transformation will be discussed in section 5 the velocity measurements were performed with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv based on the doppler effect adv obtains the three dimensional velocity vector u i t with high spatial and temporal resolution the adv consists of a central emitter surrounded by four receivers mounted in a measuring stand specially designed for laboratory experiments during the measurements the transmit transducer sends a short pulse that covers a sampling volume and the four receivers listen to an echo that corresponds from this volume to obtain the three velocity components from that volume for the measurements presented in this work the sampling frequency was 200 hz and the acquisition time was 60 s from the measured data the time averaged velocity vector u u s u n u z the fluctuating velocity vector u u s u n u z and all reynolds stress components u i u j i j s n z can be obtained as mentioned in the introduction the present research focuses on energy transformation within the context of secondary flow therefore it is important to capture the cross sections with relatively higher intensity secondary flow according to the numerical simulation of bai et al 2014 secondary flow develops at the bend entrance reaches a maximum magnitude between 90 and 120 from the bend entrance and weakens in the final part of the curved reach considering this three dimensional velocity measurements were made at the 90 and 120 cross sections from the bend entrance measurements were first performed on a relatively coarse grid in these two cross sections to find the regions with identifiable cells in these regions high resolution measurements were subsequently performed on a fine grid which makes it possible to evaluate three time averaged velocity components and turbulent stress components the size of the dense measuring grid fig 2 b is 32 mm horizontally and 9 5 mm vertically the lateral distance to the side walls is 40 mm the vertical distance to the bottom and to the water surface are 5 mm and 50 mm respectively since the measured point is situated 50 mm below the transducer probe which has to be immersed in the water in the present paper the process of energy transport in open channel bends is investigated by means of a term by term evaluation of the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation this requires the evaluation of derivatives of the measured quantities such as the derivatives of the time averaged velocities turbulent stresses which are difficult to estimate directly from the raw data due to the scattering of experimental data therefore analytical functions have been fitted to the experimental data using two dimensional cubic splines which provided the high spatial resolution data sufficiently smooth for later evaluation of derivatives of the measured quantities more details about the spline functions can be found in micula and micula 1999 the uncertainty caused by this method in the evaluated terms in eqs 8 and 10 is estimated in appendix a in agreement with blanckaert and de vriend 2004 and termini 2015 this value of uncertainty is sufficient for the purpose of this paper see appendix a section and thus the present results will not be corrupted by experimental inaccuracies 4 results 4 1 summary of preview results as shown in fig 3 a and b there exist two cells at the two investigated cross sections in the centre region a relatively stronger cell covering a large part of the cross section is observed with outward velocities near the water surface and inward velocities near the bottom this cell is often called curvature induced secondary flow which is caused by the interaction between the inward pressure gradient induced by the transverse tilting of the water surface and the outward centrifugal force blanckaert and graf 2001 besides the centre region cell a relatively weaker cell is noticed close to the outer bank this is often named turbulence induced secondary flow which is generated by the non homogeneity and anisotropy of turbulence einstein and li 1958 hinze 1973 perkins 1970 gessner 1973 as mentioned in section 2 the velocity of the centre region cell is about 20 30 of the streamwise velocity in contrast with the much smaller velocity of the outer bank cell which is typically 3 of the streamwise velocity blanckaert and de vriend 2005 blanckaert and graf 2001 also showed that the cross sectional velocities of the centre region cell are u n 2 u z 2 u o 0 1 on the average while the cross sectional velocities of the outer region cell are u n 2 u z 2 u o 0 03 furthermore the centre region cell always covers a much larger part of the cross section than the outer bank cell see fig 3 considering this the centre region cell is generally much stronger and larger than its outer region counterpart and thus plays a more important role in the energy transport and dissipation therefore attention is restricted to the flow phenomena in the central part of the cross section the dimensions of the centre region cell can be roughly estimated as 14 7 5 cm since our attention is focused on the centre region the velocity measurements were subsequently performed on a dense grid in this region fig 3c which is marked by red dashed lines all the results described hereafter are based on data collected from the experiments performed on this fine grid fig 4 a and b show the distribution of the normalized streamwise velocity component u s u in the centre region of the cross section at 90 and 120 respectively in the 90 cross section the maximum velocity region is found almost along the diagonal line of the examined area and the maximum value is about 1 25u in the 120 cross section the maximum velocity region is observed near the lower right corner and the maximum value is about 1 27u the cross sectional patterns of the secondary flow at 90 and 120 are illustrated in fig 4 c d respectively by means of the normalized streamwise vorticity ω s h u a zone of the streamwise vorticity ω s 0 occurs near the upper left part of the examined areas in the two cross sections it is highlighted by a thick ω s 0 isoline a zone of the streamwise vorticity ω s 0 occurs in a large portion of the examined areas in the examined area of the 90 cross section the streamwise vorticity decreases from a positive maximum value of 1 4 u h in the bottom layer towards a negative peak valueof 0 8 u h in the top layer in contrast at the 120 cross section the streamwise vorticity decreases from apositive maximum value of 2 u h in the bottom layer towards a negative peak value of 0 8 u h in the top layer fig 4 e and f compare some of the observed vertical profiles u s u in the cross section at 90 and 120 respectively it can be seen that in the left part of the examined area the measured maximum velocity appears far below the free surface making the measured velocity profiles substantially deviate from the logarithmic profile 4 2 terms of the kinetic energy equation in this section the most important terms in the kinetic energy equation will now be analyzed term by term all terms are normalized by g u s s 0 00157 m2 s3 which is computed from u 0 2 m s fig 5 shows different normalized terms of eq 8 at 90 cross section in the examined area the term kecs increases from about 0 05 close to the bottom to a maximum positive value of 0 5 in the top of this area showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 2 o 10 1 in comparison the term kecsc shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 100 an order of magnitude larger than the term kecs and reaches a negative maximum value of 5 in the top left corner and a positive maximum value of 1 2 in the bottom layer therefore it can be concluded that the convective effect plays an important role in the energy transport in addition to investigate the relative importance of each term associated with cross stream circulation in the kinetic energy equation the term kecsc is divided into the sum of terms k e csc i u n u s 2 2 n 1 n r 1 u s 2 u n r k e csc i i u z u s 2 2 z the term kecsc i represents the advective transport of kinetic energy by the transverse component of cross stream circulation un the term kecsc ii denotes the advective transport of kinetic energy by the vertical component of cross stream circulation uz as shown in fig 5 c the negative peak value of the term kecsc i is found in the upper part of the centre examined area and increases in value to 1 0 near the bottom layer showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 100 the negative peak value of kecsc ii is found in the top left corner and increases in value to about 0 8 near the bottom showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 100 fig 5 d on the basis of the results it can be concluded that the transport of energy by the transverse component of cross stream circulation un is of a comparable order of magnitude as by the vertical component of cross stream circulation uz which means that both of them play a leading role fig 5 e and f illustrate the terms associated with turbulent stress kers increases in value from 0 4 in the bottom layer to 0 75 in the top left corner and shows values of order of magnitude o 10 1 an order of magnitude smaller than kecsc fig 5 e in contrast tep shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 3 o 10 1 which means that a negligible part of the total kinetic energy transfer between time averaged flow and turbulence fig 5 f thus the production of turbulent kinetic energy is almost irrelevant to the energy transport in open channel bends fig 6 reports different terms of eq 8 at 120 cross section comparing the results of the two cross sections it can be observed that the term kecs in both of the two cross sections shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 2 o 10 1 like in the case of 90 cross section the term kecsc in the 120 cross section still plays an important role in the energy transport a similar negative value region with values of order of magnitude of o 100 is observed in the upper part of the examined area and the term kecsc reaches a negative maximum value of 4 6 in this region the term kecsc i and kecsc ii in the two cross sections are moderately different both of the two terms in 120 cross section account for relatively larger negative value region and show smaller negative maximum values than in the 90 cross section in summary all terms in eq 8 are of different order of magnitude the advective transport of kinetic energy by the cross stream circulation is the dominant mechanism in the energy transport of which the transverse and the vertical component of cross stream circulation are of the comparable order of magnitude the cross flow and turbulent stresses play a subordinate role in the transport of kinetic energy kinetic energy transfer between time averaged flow and turbulence is negligible 4 3 terms of the enstrophy equation from section theoretical considerations it is clear that enstrophy is directly related to the energy dissipation considering this the terms of eq 10 have been estimated on the basis of the measured data fig 7 reports the isolines of terms in the enstrophy equation at 90 cross section all terms are normalized by u h 3 with u 0 2 m s and h 0 15 m from fig 7 it can be seen that the term enadv shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 10 the term enc shows values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 2 o 10 1 an order of magnitude smaller than the term enadv and thus contributes verylittle to the generation of enstrophy fig 7b in order to investigate the relative importance of each term associated the effects of the centrifugal force in the evolution of enstrophy the term encf is divided into the sum of terms e n cf i 1 n r 1 ω s u s 2 r z e n cf i i 1 n r 1 ω s u s 2 r z the term encf i represents the effects of the centrifugal force on the evolution of enstrophy and the term encf ii represents the effects associated with turbulence related centrifugal force it can be seen from fig 7 c that the term encf i plays an important role in the evolution of enstrophy this term decreases from 2 4 near the bottom layer to about 1 in the middle of the area and then increases again towards the top of the area and reach values of 3 showing values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 10 in contrast the term encf ii shows negligible values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 1 0 2 o 10 1 fig 7d fig 7 e and f show the effects of the turbulent stress on the production of enstrophy it can be seen that the term enrns and the term enrss give a contribution of comparable magnitude to enstrophy generation although relatively smaller in values compared with the encf i term both of the term enrns and enrss show values of order of magnitude varying in the range o 10 1 o 10 and thus are not negligible in summary in the examined area the advective transport terms and the centrifugal force related terms are the most important mechanisms underlying the production of enstrophy and the latter is relatively larger curvature related terms and turbulence related centrifugal force terms contribute verylittle to the generation of enstrophy in contrast with the centrifugal force related terms although relatively smaller in values than the cross stream circulation terms and the centrifugal force related terms the reynolds stress terms are not negligible 5 discussion 5 1 transport of kinetic energy the experiments provide sufficient data for analysis of the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying the transport of kinetic energy fig 9 reports the distribution of the normalized streamwise kinetic energy defined as u s 2 u 2 for the 90 and 120 cross sections these results confirm that the streamwise velocity is substantially deformed in the region with an identifiable secondary flow this phenomenon is called the velocity dip phenomenon and has been already noticed by many other researchers nezu and nakagawa 1993 blanckaert and graf 2004 blanckaert and de vriend 2004 moramarco et al 2004 termini and moramarco 2018 investigated the effect of width to depth ratio on the velocity dip phenomenon and found that the distance between the maximum streamwise velocity and the water surface was closely related to the development of secondary flow along the bend the change of the location of the maximum streamwise velocity can also be found in the present experiments in the 90 cross section the highest kinetic energy is observed in the lowerleft corner of the examined area while the smallest values is found in the upperleft hand corner fig 9a in contrast in the 120 cross section the location of the highest kinetic energy is adjusted gradually to the lowerright corner of the examined area fig 9b this change of the location of the highest kinetic energy is more than likely to be induced by the evolution of secondary flow along the bend in agreement with blanckaert and graf 2004 the advection of kinetic energy by the cross stream motion u n u z is decomposed into the sum of the advective transport by the cross stream circulation u n u z and by the cross flow u n 0 and the advective transport of kinetic energy by cross stream circulation is further split into the sum of the advective transport by un and uz from section 4 1 it can be concluded that kecsc the advection of kinetic energy by the cross stream motion u n u z is the dominant mechanism underlying this deformation of kinetic energy distribution and thus exerts the most important role in the transport of kinetic energy which is in agreement with blanckaert and graf 2004 they carried out the order of magnitude analysis of the terms in the streamwise momentum equation by using the experimental data collected in a deformed bed 120 open channel bend although they investigated the transport of streamwise momentum rather than kinetic energy when attention is focused only on the advective transport effects of cross stream motion their results can also provide a contrast with the present results the un term kecsc i and uz term kecsc ii are also considered as can be seen in fig 5 c and 6 c a thick 0 isoline splits the examined area into two parts in the upper part of this region where un 0 the term kecsc i shows negative values and kinetic energy also shows smaller values in this part therefore in this region the role of un in this region is to take away kinetic energy in the lower part of this region where un 0 the term kecsc i shows positive values and kinetic energy also shows larger values in this part therefore the role of un in this region is to bring back kinetic energy and from figs 5 d and 6 d it can be observed that the vertical component of cross stream circulation uz plays a similar role to un in the transport of kinetic energy figs 5d and 6d therefore in large part of the examined area the high energy fluid is transported by cross stream circulation from the region near the water surface towards the region near the bottom layer this can account for the deformation of kinetic energy distribution blanckaert and graf 2004 also carry out special investigations into the advective effect of un and uz they claimed that the advective effect of un is generally larger than that of uz however according to the order of magnitude analysis in section 4 2 it is observed in the present results that un and uz make a contribution of the comparable magnitude to the deformation of streamwise velocity especially in the negative value region where both of them show almost the same negative maximum values as shown in figs 5 a and 6 a although the cross stream term kecs is one order of magnitude smaller than the cross stream circulation term kecsc the term kecs is not negligibly small especially in the upper left corner of the examined area furthermore in the top left edge the cross stream term kecs shows positive values and also slightly offsets the advective effect of cross stream circulation u n u z which shows negative values in this region according to the results of the order of magnitude analysis in figs 5 e and 6 e it can be seen that the transport of kinetic energy by reynolds stress is significantlyweaker than by cross stream motion but it is not negligible since the term kers in the topleftcorner of the examined area shows the positive values which compensates a little for the negative values of the term kecsc furthermore it can also be concluded that kinetic energy transfer from the time averaged flow to the turbulence via the reynolds stresses u s u n and u s u z is trivial to kinetic energy of the time averaged flow especially when compared with the energy transport by cross stream circulation although this energy transfer is important to maintain the turbulent flow therefore when attention is paid to the energy transport in the time averaged flow this kinetic energy transfer from the time averaged flow to the turbulence can be ignored as mentioned in section 3 the froude number is a major parameter for flow characteristic to examine how our experimental results are affected by froude number in the same laboratory flume another experiment for convenience called run 2 hereafter was performed in the 90 cross section to compare with the experiment already introduced for convenience called run 1 hereafter the only difference in the hydraulic conditions between the two sets of experiment is the mean velocity u with 0 2 m s for run 1 and 0 25 m s for run 2 correspondingly the froude numbers for run 1 and 2 are 0 16 and 0 206 respectively with the latter being 28 75 larger than the former fig 10 shows different normalized terms of eq 8 at 90 cross section for run 2 all terms are normalized by g u s s 0 002 m2 s3 which is computed from u 0 25 m s it can be found that the differences between the same terms at different fr are rather small the maximum value of all terms in fig 10 are slightly larger than their counterparts in fig 5 despite the difference it can also be seen that all terms in fig 10 are of the same order of magnitude as their counterparts in fig 5 for example the term kecsc in fig 10 also assumes the largest order of magnitude which is the same as the results in fig 5 similarly the other terms in fig 10 are almost in the same role as in fig 5 as a result within the range of investigated froude numbers energy transport did not indicate distinct dependence on the froude number as mentioned in section 3 the froude number of large natural meandering rivers is generally very small and varies over a rather narrow range 0 07 0 26 therefore with fr falling into the range of 0 16 0 206 the present results can also be expected to be applicable to large meandering rivers 5 2 energy dissipation as should be clear from section 2 for the time averaged flow the energy dissipation is closely connected with the evolution of enstrophy according to the kinetic eq 1 for the time averaged flow the energy dissipation is composed of two parts one associated with the generation of turbulent kinetic energy which has been discussed in the above section and the other related to the viscous dissipation which is what this section focuses on fig 11 shows the distribution of the normalized enstrophy defined as ω s h u 2 for the 90 and 120 cross sections from fig 11 it can be observed that enstrophy shows high values in the near bed region and eye of the centre region cell which means that in these regions where the velocity gradient is relatively steeper kinetic energy is converted into heat through viscous deformation it should also be here that the high values of enstrophy close to the near bed layer do not mean there exists an identifiable vortex but the boundary layer in order to gain an insight into the relative importance of each mechanism underlying the energy dissipation the enstrophy eq 10 has been investigated by a term by term analysis from figs 7 and 8 it becomes clear that the term encf i in the enstrophy equation exert an important role in the energy dissipation the term encf i represents the skewing induced generation of enstrophy which corresponds with the skewing induced vorticity also called the prandtl s circulation of the first kind as has been discussed in the above section the cross stream circulation strongly influences the energy transport which further has an effect on the gradient of the centrifugal force u s 2 r z and ultimately the generation of enstrophy in the regions which are strongly affected by the secondary flow the advective transport of kinetic energy by the secondary flow deforms the us profiles which means that the centrifugal force term u s 2 r z is dependent on secondary flow due to the dip phenomenon caused by the advective transport of kinetic energy the near bed gradient of the streamwise velocity is increased as observed in the present results the increased near bed gradient of the streamwise velocity will further lead to the increase in energy dissipation however for very sharply curved bends as in the present experiments the nonlinear feedback between us and secondary flow will result in the saturation of intensity of the secondary flow blanckaert 2009 in the meanwhile the near bed gradient of the streamwise velocity will not increase which means that the energy dissipation caused by the centrifugal force term u s 2 r z is also no longer increased in the regions which are not affected by the secondary flow except for the boundary layers the us profile can be considered to follow the logarithmic velocity distribution in these regions as a result of the effect of turbulent diffusion the distribution of us is rather even along the vertical line see fig 4e and 4f which means that the gradient of us 2 is negligibly small compared with it in the regions affected strongly by the secondary flow in contrast the effects of curvature and turbulence related centrifugal force on the generation of enstrophy are negligibly small compared with the term encf i see figs 7b 7d 8b and 8d as shown in figs 7 a and 8 a the transport of enstrophy by the cross stream enadv shows values comparable with the term encf i however this term only represents the redistribution of enstrophy across the cross section and does not affect the total enstrophy in other words this term can neither generate enstrophy nor reduce it from figs 7 e f 8 e and 8 f the term enrns and enrss in the enstrophy equation are smaller than the term encf i but cannot be neglected according to perkins 1970 in straight channels the u n 2 u z 2 term is the source of the streamwise vorticity ω s and u n u z term acts as a sink of it which means that these two terms are also the source or sink of enstrophy however for curved channel bends the role of reynolds stresses in the evolution of enstrophy is complex from the present results the term enrns and enrss show negative values over most of the examined area which means that they suppress the generation of enstrophy in the upper and near bottom layer the two terms also show positive values which means that they favor the generation of enstrophy therefore from the present results it cannot be determined whether the two reynolds stresses terms will increase enstrophy or decrease it or both further investigations are needed to determine their role in the evolution of enstrophy similar to the previous section to investigate the influence of froude number the enstrophy eq 10 has also been estimated based on the measured data from run 2 fig 12 reports the isolines of the terms in the enstrophy equation at 90 cross section for run 2 and all terms are normalized by u h 3 with u 0 25 m s and h 0 15 m it can be seen that all terms in fig 12 are of the same order of magnitude as their counterparts in fig 7 and there is not much difference in the maximum value of all terms between the two runs for example the most important term encf i also shows the largest order of magnitude see fig 12c which is the same as the results in fig 7 therefore the froude number has limited influence on the energy dissipation combined with the earlier mentioned analysis the transformation process of kinetic energy is expected to be insensitive to variations in froude number 5 3 applicability of results since the present research focused attention on the energy transformation within the context of the secondary flow the strength of secondary flow is a major concern for the present experiments it is well known that the width to depth ratio b h or h b is an important dimensionless variable which has a strong impact on the secondary flow and further controls the development of meander rivers considering h b h r r b the influence of h b on the secondary flow can be decomposed into two parts the influence of h r which accounts for the shallowness of the channel and r b the dimensionless curvature ratio which represents the sharp curvature effects for the influence of the shallowness of the flow h r there have been many studies focused attention on associating the strength of centre region cell of secondary flow with several factors such as channel curvature r and depth of water h engelund 1974 falcon ascanio and kennedy 1983 demuren and rodi 1986 these expressions are of the form 12 u n u h r this relation indicates that the secondary flow velocity progressively increases with increasing values of h r which has already been derived by many researchers however the dependency of the strength of cross circulation on h r may be more complex than expression 12 indicates which means that the strength of cross circulation do not necessarily increase proportionally to the curvature ratio h r actually according to the experimental results of miao et al 2016 in the smoother bed in their experiments sand bed a critical value for the linear range is h r 0 04 for h r 0 04 secondary flow magnitude grows about linearly with h r with the further increase in values of h r the growth becomes less than linear before the secondary flow magnitude reaches a maximum value at h r 0 1 and slowly decreases for h r 0 1 in which range the secondary flow magnitude decreases very slightly with further increase of h r and therefore can be considered to remain nearly constant the value of h r in the present experiments is 0 125 approximately 20 larger than 0 1 since the present research focused attention on the transport and dissipation of kinetic energy within the context of secondary flow in sharp open channel bends it is expected that with the further increase in the value of h r the transformation process of kinetic energy is insensitive to the increase in h r this could be explained by the fact that there exist complex nonlinear interactions between the streamwise and cross stream velocities which weakens the cross stream motion as recommended by miao et al river bends can be considered mildly curved when h r 0 04 or b h 25 b r which is beyond the scope of the present research since the major concern for present research is the sharply curved channels furthermore our attention was paid not on the exact values of each term but on the comparison between various terms and the relative importance of the various mechanisms considering this the results and conclusions in the present experiments are generally valid for sharp natural meandering rivers it should be noted here that for a laboratory flow to be measured in detail as well as to ensure that the flow is turbulent reynolds number is dependent on the water depth the water cannot be too shallow cannot be less than 10 cm say in the present experiments which means that h r cannot be too small in laboratory meandering experiments in addition the present data also served for the validation of a three dimensional numerical model so cases with smaller values of h r could be investigated through numerical simulations for the influence of the curvature r b the laboratory meandering researches include either single bends such as the commonly used single circular channel bends with constant curvatures various central angles or the periodic symmetric channels such as the kinoshita channels its planform is defined by a kinoshita curve the single circular channel bends can also be regarded as an element of these periodic symmetric channels according to yalin 1992 the cross sectional flow iscomprisedoftwoparts the cross circulation which is caused by channel curvature r and the convective component which is induced by the streamwise variation of curvature r 1 s for the single circular channel bends with constant curvature r 1 s 0 the attention is focused only on the role of various curvatures various central angles in the strength of secondary flow along the bend blanckaert 2009 found that the strength of secondary flow stops increasing when the curvature is increased in very sharp bends a process he called the saturation of the secondary flow as mentioned before this is due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions between the streamwise and cross stream velocities for the present laboratory experiments since the value of r b reaches the range of very sharp bends the results and conclusions are deemed valid for natural sharp meandering bends for the channels with variable curvatures r 1 s 0 the convective flow pattern needs to be considered whiting and dietrich 1993 found that the convective behavior of flow is important only in wide meandering rivers b h 10 in the case of small values of b h the convective flow behaviour was significantly attenuated this has been confirmed by termini and piraino 2011 in the present research the effects of convective behavior is reflected in the transport of energy by the cross stream u n the term kecs it can be seen quite clearly from fig 3 that the cross circulation dominates over convective transversal motion in the 90 and 120 cross sections which means that the transport of kinetic energy by cross circulation plays the leading role however in wider meandering rivers the term kecs may be larger than in the present experiments for the energy dissipation the transport of kinetic energy by cross circulation and by cross stream only represent the redistribution of enstrophy across the cross section both of them can neither generate enstrophy nor reduce the total enstrophy and as a result will not affect greatly the resistance induced by the secondary flow 6 conclusions this work investigated the transformation process of kinetic energy in a sharp open channel bend with the aid of high quality three dimensional flow measurements special attention was paid to the role of the cross stream circulation in the transport of kinetic energy and energy dissipation the present study broadens the physical understanding of the energy transformation in curved channels the conclusions that can be drawn from this research are summarized as follows for the transport of kinetic energy it has been confirmed that the advective transport of kinetic energy by the cross stream circulation is the most important mechanism underlying the energy transport in sharp open channel bends this term is at least one order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the kinetic energy equation and makes a significant contribution to the deformation of the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity the advective transport of kinetic energy by the transverse and by the vertical component of cross stream circulation are of the comparable order of magnitude the advection of kinetic energy by the cross flow although less important than the cross stream circulation term cannot be ignored the reynolds stresses play a minor role the transport of kinetic energy by reynolds stress is not negligible since this term shows the positive values in some areas and thus compensates moderately for the negative values of the cross stream circulation term kinetic energy transfer between time averaged flow and turbulence is negligible for the time averaged flow field for the dissipation of kinetic energy it can be found that the centrifugal force term which represents the skewing induced generation of enstrophy exerts the dominant influence on the energy dissipation in sharp open channel bends in the regions strongly affected by the secondary flow the centre regions the cross stream circulation has a strong effect on the gradient of the centrifugal force and then influences the generation of enstrophy which follows that the intricate interaction between secondary flow and the streamwise velocity plays an important role in the increase in the energy dissipation the role of curvature and turbulence related centrifugal force on the generation of enstrophy can be ignored when compared with the centrifugal force term within the range of investigated froude numbers the transformation process is insensitive to the variations in froude number it is worthwhile mentioning that although the laboratory experiments were restricted to the centre regions under the hydraulic and geometric conditions investigated in this research they lend some valuable insights into the complete process of the energy transformation in particular the evolution of enstrophy was investigated in curved channel flow which may provide a new way of studying the problems related to resistance in river bends in order to extend the present analysis further research could be made under different conditions such as different width radius ratios and planimetric configurations furthermore the emphasis of this study was mainly on sharply curved channel flow further analysis can be extended to mildly curved bends with r b conflict of interest none acknowledgments this study

university appendix a estimation of the experimental uncertainty the experimental uncertainty is composed of two parts the uncertainty in the experimental data and in the estimation of the terms in eqs 8 and 10 for the experimental data in the process of velocity measurement both the signal noise ratio snr and the correlation coefficient cor were observed carefully the snr and cor were always higher than 20 db and 90 respectively and remain stable during the process of measurement which ensures the quality of the experimental data for the uncertainty in the estimation of the terms in eqs 8 and 10 the relative uncertainty of a measured quantity f can be defined as a1 ε f f f f in which f is the measured value f the real value in the present research attention is focused on the time averaged quantity considering this in agreement with termini 2015 the uncertainty in time averaged quantity f can be estimated by the standard error of the mean sem which can be expressed as a2 ε ta σ f n in which σ f is the standard deviation of time series of f n is the size the number of observations of the sample on the basis of experimental data a conservative estimation is made of the uncertainty in the time averaged velocity u i i s n z and the reynolds stress components u i u j i s n z the uncertainty of these quantities was estimated as follows ε ta u s 3 ε ta u n 3 ε ta u z 10 ε u n 3 ε ta u i u j 10 the higher relative uncertainty of u z is mainly due to its low value the terms in the kinetic and the enstrophy equations are of the form f 1 f 2 p and f 1 2 f 2 p q where p and q are generic variables therefore based on eq a1 f 1 f 2 p and f 1 2 f 2 p q can be written as follows a3 ε f 1 f 2 p f 1 f 2 p f 1 f 2 p f 1 f 2 p ε 1 f 2 ε 2 p f 2 p ε 1 f 2 ε 2 p f 2 p the expression of f 1 2 f 2 p q is similar to that of f 1 f 2 p that is a4 ε f 1 2 f 2 p q ε 1 2 f 2 ε 2 p q f 2 p q ε 1 2 f 2 ε 2 p q f 2 p q according to blanckaert and de vriend 2004 it can be assumed that error varies slowly in space which follows that a5 f ε p f p f ε f ε for 2 f ε p q 2 f p q it has the same form as eq a5 based on a5 eqs a3 and a4 can be written as a6 ε f 1 f 2 p ε 1 f 2 ε 2 p f

estimations of all terms in eqs 8 and 10 are conservative in the present results all terms are of a comparable magnitude or at least differ by an order of magnitude furthermore the present research focused attention on first order effects therefore in agreement with blanckaert and de vriend 2004 and termini 2015 the calculated results are assumed not to be corrupted by experimental inaccuracies 
6676,deep soil water infiltration is a key hydrological process in seasonally frozen regions and displays a distinct behavior from that in other unfrozen regions however the seasonal dynamics and key controls of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp are still poorly understood in this study we examine the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and attempt to quantitatively assess the relative influences of several driving factors by applying a random forests statistical analysis the following key results were obtained deep soil water infiltration shows marked seasonal variation rainfall intensity exerts little effect on the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration as almost all rainfall returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration no infiltration occurred when the depth of lower layer frozen soil reached 29 cm whereas deep infiltration increased during the thawing of soil frost suggesting that deep infiltration is impeded by soil freezing overall the observed seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and volumetric soil moisture content were similar during the freeze thaw process furthermore deep soil water infiltration was more strongly influenced by deep volumetric soil moisture than by shallower volumetric soil moisture our results suggest that the topsoil mattic epipedon soil organic matter content and root systems role in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling hydrological processes in alpine meadows keywords deep soil water infiltration qinghai tibet plateau seasonally frozen random forests mattic epipedon 1 introduction deep soil water infiltration is the key process controlling water movement and balance in the hydrological cycle thus playing vital roles in the management of water resources and in the interaction between groundwater and surface water ge et al 2011 in alpine meadows the soil profile is divided into two layers the superficial soil layer 0 80 cm and the deep soil layer below 80 cm depending on the thickness of the soil zhang et al 2017 in general the total thickness of the soil layer in alpine meadows is approximately 60 80 cm zhang et al 2017 thus deep soil water infiltration can be defined as water infiltration that occurs in the below 60 80 cm soil layer i e parent material in recent years a large number of studies have focused on the relationship between rainfall and water infiltration abrol et al 2016 li et al 2016 for instance heisler white et al 2008 indicated that large rainfall events could enhance soil water content by allowing excess water infiltration deeper into the soil profile suggesting that large rainfall events could facilitate deep soil water infiltration yang et al 2014 concluded that the seasonal dynamics of infiltration are positively related to rainfall and that rainfall events with low intensity long duration and large quantity were the most beneficial for deep soil infiltration however most previous studies have been conducted in arid and semi arid regions franzluebbers 2002 he et al 2012 martinez meza and whitford 1996 wang et al 2008 wang et al 2010 liu et al 2006 and are based on simulated rainfall experiments huang et al 2013 tang et al 2003 little attention has been paid to the relationship between natural rainfall and deep soil water infiltration in seasonally frozen regions particularly on the qinghai tibet plateau which is known as the third pole due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient reliable and regular observation data consequently the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and its controlling factors in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau are poorly understood the seasonal freeze thaw cycle has an important impact on the seasonal variation of deep soil water infiltration in high latitude and high elevation regions chang et al 2015 for two reasons firstly the seasonally frozen layer acts as a special aquiclude or aquitard layer which can delay the timing and reduce the magnitude of infiltration for instance deep soil water infiltration decreases significantly due to the decreased hydraulic conductivity during the freezing phase whereas increasing deep soil water infiltration is observed during the thawing period owing to water replenishment by the melting of frozen soil daniel and staricka 2010 secondly the frozen soil not only participates directly in the hydrothermal exchange through its own hydro thermal effects but also alters the transmission and exchange of water and energy chang et al 2015 therefore deep soil water infiltration in high altitude and high latitude regions is strongly affected by the freeze thaw processes of seasonally frozen ground meyboom 2012 tóth 2010 given the vital role of seasonally frozen ground in regulating deep soil water infiltration many methods have been applied to examine the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and its relationship with rainfall such as numerical modeling he et al 2012 and isotope tracing sugimoto et al 2003 yang 1999 nevertheless understanding how the soil freeze thaw cycle affects deep soil water infiltration remains a challenge because deep infiltration is a relatively complex process affected by many factors these include the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil the soil structure and soil organic matter franzluebbers 2002 yang et al 2014 and root system and vegetation coverage devitt and smith 2002 leung et al 2015 for instance established woody shrubs could significantly promote soil water infiltration by establishing preferential flow pathways lyford and qashu 1969 mauchamp and janeau 1993 pressland 1976 although isotope tracers have been widely used to indirectly calculate the quantity of deep soil water infiltration they cannot produce accurate results on short temporal scales yang 1999 which impedes the development of hydrologic models therefore direct measurements of water filtration are needed to better understand the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau these were achieved here using a large weighing lysimeter the qtp is known as the chinese water tower playing an important role in ensuring the safety of water resources in china and southeast asia zou et al 2017 furthermore the qtp also holds most of the world s seasonally frozen ground covering approximately 1 46 106 km2 zou et al 2017 the main objectives of this study are to 1 identify the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and their relationship with rainfall as well as frozen soil thickness and 2 quantitatively evaluate the effect of environmental factors on deep soil water infiltration based on deep soil water infiltration as well as seasonally frozen data from 15 june 2017 to 30 june 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the haibei national field research station qinghai china 37 37 n 101 19 e which is located on the northeastern qtp at an elevation of 3200 m a m s l this region has a plateau continental monsoon climate with well developed seasonally frozen ground the maximum thickness of frozen soil is approximately 180 220 cm and is characterized by uni directional freezing and bi directional melting the annual precipitation is 580 mm of which 80 falls during the growing season i e from may to september the mean annual air temperature is 1 7 c with the minimum monthly temperature in january 15 0 c and the maximum monthly temperature in july 10 1 c the annual pan evaporation is approximately 1191 4 mm cao et al 2004 the regional representative vegetation is alpine meadow dominated by kobresia humilis cao et al 2004 the alpine meadow soil is classified as clay loam and has a thickness of approximately 60 80 cm with 96 3 of roots concentrated in the 0 50 cm level and diluvial and highly permeable parent material the mattic epipedon which is recognized as the mattic diagnostic epipedon in the chinese soil taxonomy has relatively high water holding capacity and low heat conductivity yang et al 2014 in this region the mattic epipedon is mainly distributed in topsoil at 10 30 cm the detailed physical characteristics of this region are shown in table 1 2 2 data collection all meteorological variables were obtained from the weather station at haibei station rainfall was observed at 30 minute intervals by a rainfall gauge 52203 rm young usa at 0 5 m height soil frost was measured daily by frost tubes 3 cm diameter at 20 00 beijing standard time deep soil water infiltration evapotranspiration et and unfrozen volumetric soil water content were measured by a soil lysimeter system cr1000 campbell usa height 2 m diameter 1 m and resolution 0 01 mm and the profile of the soil column in the lysimeter were located at 5 10 15 20 40 60 80 100 140 and 180 cm water infiltration was measured using a skip flow sensor te525mm l campbell usa evapotranspiration was obtained using mass conservation principles the unfrozen volumetric soil water content was measured using a moisture conductivity sensor 93640 025 campbell usa utilizing the dielectric constant method for this study we only selected the unfrozen volumetric soil water content at 5 10 15 20 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm in the column a detailed schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 2 3 statistical analysis considering that strong nonlinearities and collinearities exist among the environment variables it was not appropriate to examine the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables based solely on the coefficients calculated in multiple regression analysis mra however the random forests approach performs better than traditional regression methods in dealing with the problem of nonlinearities and collinearities among environmental variables in addition random forests can directly cope with any type of data without the need for transformations the random forests approach incorporates the important superiority of tree based methods and can deal with various types of predictor variables regardless of whether the variables follow a normal distribution most importantly random forests provide two methods for the assessment of variable importance when quantitatively evaluating the relative influences of environmental variables on deep soil water infiltration following cutler et al 2004 1 the variable importance was assessed according to the degree of change of the gini index the gini index describes the impurity of nodes a smaller gini index indicates lower impurity and the decision tree was classified based on the minimum principles of the gini index node as follows 1 gini t 1 i 1 k p i t 2 where p i t is the probability of category i at node t when gini t 0 the sample data are classified as the same type as that at node t for decreasing values of dgj the values of dgj are averaged over all the nodes in the forest i e incnodepurity and greater values of incnodepurity indicate a greater importance of characteristic j 2 the variable importance was assessed by the degree of reduction in classification accuracy about 3 of data at each sampling point were not selected for the random forest i e out of bag oob the error in oob was calculated for each tree before randomly scrambling the eigenvalues of characteristic j and finally calculating the new oob error e r j the importance of feature j vj is represented as follows 2 v j r 1 n e r j e r where n is the number of decision trees and v j is a standardized quantity representing the incmse for which larger values indicate a greater importance of characteristic j all statistical analyses were conducted in r 3 03 and all figures were produced using origin 9 0 3 results 3 1 variation of frozen depth rainfall and deep soil water infiltration lower layer soil frost commenced in early november and reach the maximum frozen depth occurred at the end of march 187 cm then begin soil frost thawed bi directionally fig 2 the number of frozen days was approximately 200 fig 2 soil lysimeter data from 15 june 2017 to 30 june 2018 show considerable daily variation fig 3 interestingly no infiltration occurred from december to the following march table 2 suggesting that deep soil water infiltration was impeded by soil freezing whereas deep infiltration increased significantly during the thawing of soil frost fig 3 and table 2 precipitation displayed an uneven distribution with almost 80 falling in the growing season i e from may to september fig 3 and table 2 total evapotranspiration 522 28 mm was larger than total rainfall 447 30 mm table 2 indicated that almost all rainfall was returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration suggesting that deep soil water infiltration might not be promoted by rainfall events 3 2 variation of volumetric soil moisture across different soil layers during the thaw freeze cycle during the unfrozen period the shallow volumetric soil moisture 0 20 cm displayed a larger variation than that of the deep soil volumetric moisture content 40 140 cm due to its greater susceptibility to external environmental influences such as rainfall and et fig 4 moreover the seasonal variations of volumetric soil moisture across different soil layers were greatly influenced by the soil thaw freeze cycle for instance during the freezing period the soil moisture contents at 5 10 15 20 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm decreased by 67 94 74 07 69 83 75 47 94 32 79 42 80 05 80 67 and 82 11 from november 2017 to january 2018 respectively table 3 in contrast the volumetric soil moisture increased significantly during the thawing period of soil frost ultimately both the shallow and deep soil volumetric moisture contents decreased significantly when the soil frost had completely melted note that the volumetric soil moisture after complete melting was lower than that before the onset of freezing table 3 interestingly the seasonal variation of volumetric soil moisture content was similar to that of deep soil water infiltration reflecting a strong connection between soil volumetric moisture content and deep soil water infiltration 3 3 the effect of rainfall intensity on volumetric soil moisture we observed the effects of different rainfall intensities on the soil moisture profiles in the case study of the period during 23 july 2017 24 july 2017 fig 5 a the 5 10 15 and 20 cm volumetric soil moisture contents increased by 265 36 171 41 117 19 and 106 76 respectively after 48 h of continuous rainfall totaling 58 mm average rainfall intensity of 1 21 mm h 1 however the 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm volumetric soil moisture contents remained relatively stable in the case study of july 31 fig 5b continuous rainfall lasting 48 h yielded a total of 31 4 mm average rainfall intensity of 0 65 mm h 1 the 5 10 15 and 20 cm volumetric soil moisture contents increased by 34 85 31 29 21 01 and 18 53 respectively while those at 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm did not show any consistent change indicating that the wetting front could only reach a depth of 40 cm even under high rainfall intensities consequently rainfall only had a strong impact on shallow volumetric soil moisture providing further evidence for the weak effect of rainfall on deep soil water infiltration 3 4 the effect of volumetric soil moisture on deep soil water infiltration given the strong connection between volumetric soil moisture and deep soil water infiltration we explored the relative influence of volumetric soil moisture within different soil layers on deep soil water infiltration based on the random forests method results showed that the volumetric soil moisture across different soil layers could explain 80 05 of the variation of deep soil water infiltration fig 6 furthermore the 140 cm volumetric soil moisture content was the most important factor affecting the seasonal variation of deep soil water infiltration followed by 100 80 60 and 40 cm volumetric soil moisture contents whereas the 5 10 15 and 20 cm volumetric soil moisture contents only had weak influences on deep soil water infiltration thus indicating that seasonal variation of the deep soil water infiltration was mainly dominated by deep soil volumetric moisture content and not by the shallow volumetric soil moisture to better understand the relationship between volumetric soil moisture and deep soil water infiltration we also explored the partial effects of volumetric soil moisture contents across different soil layers on deep soil water infiltration as shown in fig 7 there was no infiltration when the 140 100 80 60 and 40 cm volumetric soil moisture contents were less than 38 34 24 22 and 11 respectively but the deep soil water infiltration increased significantly when the 140 100 80 and 60 cm volumetric soil moisture contents exceeded 38 34 24 and 22 respectively suggesting that these contents were the threshold values of field capacity for the 140 100 80 and 60 cm soil layers respectively deep soil water infiltration still occurred when the 40 20 15 10 and 5 cm volumetric soil moisture contents were between 5 and 10 in addition the deep soil water infiltration reduced significantly when the 140 100 80 and 60 cm volumetric soil moisture contents were greater than 45 42 37 and 39 respectively suggesting that these contents were the threshold values of saturation capacity for the respective soil layers 4 discussion 4 1 the relationship between rainfall and deep soil water infiltration a great number of studies have indicated that deep soil infiltration is strongly affected by rainfall intensity especially for low intensity and long duration rainfall events wang et al 2008 in contrast the deep soil water infiltration in our study was not strongly affected either by light or heavy rainfall events normally two processes are needed to generate deep soil water infiltration storage and conduction the unsaturated surface soil layer will store some of the rainfall before the surplus rainfall can infiltrate further to deeper soil layers consequently most of the rainfall was stored in the surface soil layer during large rainfall events particularly when the surface soil has a strong water holding capacity thus we concluded that the discrepancy might be attributed to the following two aspects firstly there was a high soil organic matter content in the 0 40 cm soil layer of our study site due to abundant dead roots and litter which has a higher water holding capacity yang et al 2014 and resulted in a large proportion of rainfall being retained in the topsoil layer from where it is evaporated or transpired rather than infiltrating to deeper soil the annual evapotranspiration was 587 9 mm which was in line with the eddy covariance observations in the same study site zhang et al 2018 whereas the annual rainfall was 500 2 mm table 2 thus almost all the rainfall was returned to the atmosphere via the evapotranspiration pathway this finding provides additional evidence for the weak impact of rainfall on deep soil water infiltration in addition the mattic epipedon is well developed in our study site and has a much lower thermal conductivity but much higher water retention capacity than the lower layer of mineral soil stähli et al 2001 this could further impede infiltration to the deep soil layers furthermore the vegetation cover may intercept some of the rainfall during the growing season huang et al 2013 as supported by our observations of reduced deep soil water infiltration from july to september when compared with june and october even though july september accounted for 77 of total rainfall table 2 furthermore the root system might also play a vital role in regulating the deep soil water infiltration after rainfall events as has been widely reported by previous studies devitt and smith 2002 lange et al 2009 for instance gish et al 1998 found that plant roots can act as preferential flow pathways for rainfall infiltration allowing the root system to promote the downward movement of rainfall by root channel macropores in the vicinity of root crowns and resulting in rainfall infiltration through relatively impermeable sub surface layers since the root system in our study site was mainly concentrated in the uppermost 40 cm which accounted for 98 of total root biomass table 1 the formation of cracks in soil during the process of plant root growth leads to the generation of preferential flow paths zhang et al 2015 additionally the dead root systems at the soil surface could be transformed into soil organic matter due to its decay which accelerates the formation of soil aggregates and consequently increases the number of priority flow paths formed zhang et al 2015 this result was also partly supported by soil texture sand was mainly distributed in the topsoil layer and clay was mainly distributed in subsoil layer table 1 for a high sand and low clay contents in topsoil there is a greater possibility for preferential flow in that layer furthermore the occurrence of preferential flow was also associated with soil bulk density and soil organic matter content low soil bulk density in the topsoil layer may be linked to more soil macropores lin et al 2010 and abundant soil organic matter in topsoil may include more soil aggregates that contribute to preferential flow by combining these factors we speculated that the heavy rainfall infiltration in the 0 40 cm topsoil layer compared to the subsoil layer may be partly attributed to the preferential flow induced by root systems this is consistent with our observation that the wetting front only reached a depth of 40 cm after intense rainfall in future we may adopt the dye tracer method to provide more supportive evidence to confirm the preferential flow in the root system zone 4 2 the relationship between seasonal freeze thaw processes and deep soil water infiltration the seasonal freeze thaw processes have direct effects on the seasonal variations of deep soil water infiltration in the alpine grassland through their impact on volumetric soil moisture as indicated by the strong connection between deep soil water infiltration and volumetric soil moisture content during the soil freeze thaw cycle this link has also been found in previous studies yang et al 2014 it well recognised that the viscosity and surface tension of water in the soil is enhanced in the zones undergoing freezing kane and stein 2010 causing unfrozen soil moisture to be transferred from zones of higher temperature to zones lower temperature temperature variations also alter the distribution of intermolecular forces and in addition the hydraulic conductivity and permeability of the soil is greatly controlled by water and ice lenses in the soil through their effects on effective soil porosity ireson et al 2013 previous studies have indicated that the deep soil water infiltration is reduced or halted during soil freezing as supported by our observation of zero infiltration once lower layer frozen soil reached 29 cm our results indicated that the frozen soil layers act as an aquitard which reduce rainfall infiltration by decreasing hydraulic conductivity causing most rainfall to be returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration ge et al 2011 nevertheless some studies have also found that frozen soils are not completely impermeable strictly speaking the infiltration capacity of frozen soil is strongly determined by its effective porosity ireson et al 2013 frozen soil can be divided into three classes on the basis of its infiltration capacity restricted limited and unlimited granger et al 1984 our study site likely belongs to the restricted class however during the thawing period deep soil water infiltration was promoted significantly due to increases in both large and small effective soil pores after the ice melted daniel and staricka 2010 while the effects of seasonal freeze thaw processes on deep soil water infiltration were complex and affected by many factors such as soil organic matter vegetation coverage root system and mattic epipedon overall the main effect of freeze thaw on deep soil water infiltration was caused by the redistribution of soil moisture furthermore the deep volumetric soil moisture content exerted a stronger influence on deep soil water infiltration than that of shallower volumetric soil moisture due to the downwards direction of soil water infiltration thus the deep volumetric soil moisture has a greater control on deep soil water infiltration than that of shallower volumetric soil moisture the short time period of this study prevents description of interannual variability and a longer time series of deep soil water infiltration and of other factors that control deep soil water infiltration should be considered in the future in order to gain a better understanding of the key controlling factors on seasonal and interannual variations of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first study exploring the seasonal dynamics and key controlling factors of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau based on a soil lysimeter system we found that the deep soil water infiltration was principally controlled by volumetric soil moisture which explained 80 05 of the seasonal variability the soil freeze thaw cycle also had a profound effect on deep soil water infiltration as infiltration was impeded or even halted by the soil freezing process but significantly promoted during thawing interestingly rainfall exerted only a weak impact on deep soil water infiltration as almost all rainfall was returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration our results provide new insights for establishing future regional hydrological models author contributions l dai and x guo performed the research analyzed data

6676,deep soil water infiltration is a key hydrological process in seasonally frozen regions and displays a distinct behavior from that in other unfrozen regions however the seasonal dynamics and key controls of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp are still poorly understood in this study we examine the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and attempt to quantitatively assess the relative influences of several driving factors by applying a random forests statistical analysis the following key results were obtained deep soil water infiltration shows marked seasonal variation rainfall intensity exerts little effect on the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration as almost all rainfall returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration no infiltration occurred when the depth of lower layer frozen soil reached 29 cm whereas deep infiltration increased during the thawing of soil frost suggesting that deep infiltration is impeded by soil freezing overall the observed seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and volumetric soil moisture content were similar during the freeze thaw process furthermore deep soil water infiltration was more strongly influenced by deep volumetric soil moisture than by shallower volumetric soil moisture our results suggest that the topsoil mattic epipedon soil organic matter content and root systems role in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling hydrological processes in alpine meadows keywords deep soil water infiltration qinghai tibet plateau seasonally frozen random forests mattic epipedon 1 introduction deep soil water infiltration is the key process controlling water movement and balance in the hydrological cycle thus playing vital roles in the management of water resources and in the interaction between groundwater and surface water ge et al 2011 in alpine meadows the soil profile is divided into two layers the superficial soil layer 0 80 cm and the deep soil layer below 80 cm depending on the thickness of the soil zhang et al 2017 in general the total thickness of the soil layer in alpine meadows is approximately 60 80 cm zhang et al 2017 thus deep soil water infiltration can be defined as water infiltration that occurs in the below 60 80 cm soil layer i e parent material in recent years a large number of studies have focused on the relationship between rainfall and water infiltration abrol et al 2016 li et al 2016 for instance heisler white et al 2008 indicated that large rainfall events could enhance soil water content by allowing excess water infiltration deeper into the soil profile suggesting that large rainfall events could facilitate deep soil water infiltration yang et al 2014 concluded that the seasonal dynamics of infiltration are positively related to rainfall and that rainfall events with low intensity long duration and large quantity were the most beneficial for deep soil infiltration however most previous studies have been conducted in arid and semi arid regions franzluebbers 2002 he et al 2012 martinez meza and whitford 1996 wang et al 2008 wang et al 2010 liu et al 2006 and are based on simulated rainfall experiments huang et al 2013 tang et al 2003 little attention has been paid to the relationship between natural rainfall and deep soil water infiltration in seasonally frozen regions particularly on the qinghai tibet plateau which is known as the third pole due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient reliable and regular observation data consequently the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and its controlling factors in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau are poorly understood the seasonal freeze thaw cycle has an important impact on the seasonal variation of deep soil water infiltration in high latitude and high elevation regions chang et al 2015 for two reasons firstly the seasonally frozen layer acts as a special aquiclude or aquitard layer which can delay the timing and reduce the magnitude of infiltration for instance deep soil water infiltration decreases significantly due to the decreased hydraulic conductivity during the freezing phase whereas increasing deep soil water infiltration is observed during the thawing period owing to water replenishment by the melting of frozen soil daniel and staricka 2010 secondly the frozen soil not only participates directly in the hydrothermal exchange through its own hydro thermal effects but also alters the transmission and exchange of water and energy chang et al 2015 therefore deep soil water infiltration in high altitude and high latitude regions is strongly affected by the freeze thaw processes of seasonally frozen ground meyboom 2012 tóth 2010 given the vital role of seasonally frozen ground in regulating deep soil water infiltration many methods have been applied to examine the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and its relationship with rainfall such as numerical modeling he et al 2012 and isotope tracing sugimoto et al 2003 yang 1999 nevertheless understanding how the soil freeze thaw cycle affects deep soil water infiltration remains a challenge because deep infiltration is a relatively complex process affected by many factors these include the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil the soil structure and soil organic matter franzluebbers 2002 yang et al 2014 and root system and vegetation coverage devitt and smith 2002 leung et al 2015 for instance established woody shrubs could significantly promote soil water infiltration by establishing preferential flow pathways lyford and qashu 1969 mauchamp and janeau 1993 pressland 1976 although isotope tracers have been widely used to indirectly calculate the quantity of deep soil water infiltration they cannot produce accurate results on short temporal scales yang 1999 which impedes the development of hydrologic models therefore direct measurements of water filtration are needed to better understand the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the qinghai tibet plateau these were achieved here using a large weighing lysimeter the qtp is known as the chinese water tower playing an important role in ensuring the safety of water resources in china and southeast asia zou et al 2017 furthermore the qtp also holds most of the world s seasonally frozen ground covering approximately 1 46 106 km2 zou et al 2017 the main objectives of this study are to 1 identify the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and their relationship with rainfall as well as frozen soil thickness and 2 quantitatively evaluate the effect of environmental factors on deep soil water infiltration based on deep soil water infiltration as well as seasonally frozen data from 15 june 2017 to 30 june 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the haibei national field research station qinghai china 37 37 n 101 19 e which is located on the northeastern qtp at an elevation of 3200 m a m s l this region has a plateau continental monsoon climate with well developed seasonally frozen ground the maximum thickness of frozen soil is approximately 180 220 cm and is characterized by uni directional freezing and bi directional melting the annual precipitation is 580 mm of which 80 falls during the growing season i e from may to september the mean annual air temperature is 1 7 c with the minimum monthly temperature in january 15 0 c and the maximum monthly temperature in july 10 1 c the annual pan evaporation is approximately 1191 4 mm cao et al 2004 the regional representative vegetation is alpine meadow dominated by kobresia humilis cao et al 2004 the alpine meadow soil is classified as clay loam and has a thickness of approximately 60 80 cm with 96 3 of roots concentrated in the 0 50 cm level and diluvial and highly permeable parent material the mattic epipedon which is recognized as the mattic diagnostic epipedon in the chinese soil taxonomy has relatively high water holding capacity and low heat conductivity yang et al 2014 in this region the mattic epipedon is mainly distributed in topsoil at 10 30 cm the detailed physical characteristics of this region are shown in table 1 2 2 data collection all meteorological variables were obtained from the weather station at haibei station rainfall was observed at 30 minute intervals by a rainfall gauge 52203 rm young usa at 0 5 m height soil frost was measured daily by frost tubes 3 cm diameter at 20 00 beijing standard time deep soil water infiltration evapotranspiration et and unfrozen volumetric soil water content were measured by a soil lysimeter system cr1000 campbell usa height 2 m diameter 1 m and resolution 0 01 mm and the profile of the soil column in the lysimeter were located at 5 10 15 20 40 60 80 100 140 and 180 cm water infiltration was measured using a skip flow sensor te525mm l campbell usa evapotranspiration was obtained using mass conservation principles the unfrozen volumetric soil water content was measured using a moisture conductivity sensor 93640 025 campbell usa utilizing the dielectric constant method for this study we only selected the unfrozen volumetric soil water content at 5 10 15 20 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm in the column a detailed schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 2 3 statistical analysis considering that strong nonlinearities and collinearities exist among the environment variables it was not appropriate to examine the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables based solely on the coefficients calculated in multiple regression analysis mra however the random forests approach performs better than traditional regression methods in dealing with the problem of nonlinearities and collinearities among environmental variables in addition random forests can directly cope with any type of data without the need for transformations the random forests approach incorporates the important superiority of tree based methods and can deal with various types of predictor variables regardless of whether the variables follow a normal distribution most importantly random forests provide two methods for the assessment of variable importance when quantitatively evaluating the relative influences of environmental variables on deep soil water infiltration following cutler et al 2004 1 the variable importance was assessed according to the degree of change of the gini index the gini index describes the impurity of nodes a smaller gini index indicates lower impurity and the decision tree was classified based on the minimum principles of the gini index node as follows 1 gini t 1 i 1 k p i t 2 where p i t is the probability of category i at node t when gini t 0 the sample data are classified as the same type as that at node t for decreasing values of dgj the values of dgj are averaged over all the nodes in the forest i e incnodepurity and greater values of incnodepurity indicate a greater importance of characteristic j 2 the variable importance was assessed by the degree of reduction in classification accuracy about 3 of data at each sampling point were not selected for the random forest i e out of bag oob the error in oob was calculated for each tree before randomly scrambling the eigenvalues of characteristic j and finally calculating the new oob error e r j the importance of feature j vj is represented as follows 2 v j r 1 n e r j e r where n is the number of decision trees and v j is a standardized quantity representing the incmse for which larger values indicate a greater importance of characteristic j all statistical analyses were conducted in r 3 03 and all figures were produced using origin 9 0 3 results 3 1 variation of frozen depth rainfall and deep soil water infiltration lower layer soil frost commenced in early november and reach the maximum frozen depth occurred at the end of march 187 cm then begin soil frost thawed bi directionally fig 2 the number of frozen days was approximately 200 fig 2 soil lysimeter data from 15 june 2017 to 30 june 2018 show considerable daily variation fig 3 interestingly no infiltration occurred from december to the following march table 2 suggesting that deep soil water infiltration was impeded by soil freezing whereas deep infiltration increased significantly during the thawing of soil frost fig 3 and table 2 precipitation displayed an uneven distribution with almost 80 falling in the growing season i e from may to september fig 3 and table 2 total evapotranspiration 522 28 mm was larger than total rainfall 447 30 mm table 2 indicated that almost all rainfall was returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration suggesting that deep soil water infiltration might not be promoted by rainfall events 3 2 variation of volumetric soil moisture across different soil layers during the thaw freeze cycle during the unfrozen period the shallow volumetric soil moisture 0 20 cm displayed a larger variation than that of the deep soil volumetric moisture content 40 140 cm due to its greater susceptibility to external environmental influences such as rainfall and et fig 4 moreover the seasonal variations of volumetric soil moisture across different soil layers were greatly influenced by the soil thaw freeze cycle for instance during the freezing period the soil moisture contents at 5 10 15 20 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm decreased by 67 94 74 07 69 83 75 47 94 32 79 42 80 05 80 67 and 82 11 from november 2017 to january 2018 respectively table 3 in contrast the volumetric soil moisture increased significantly during the thawing period of soil frost ultimately both the shallow and deep soil volumetric moisture contents decreased significantly when the soil frost had completely melted note that the volumetric soil moisture after complete melting was lower than that before the onset of freezing table 3 interestingly the seasonal variation of volumetric soil moisture content was similar to that of deep soil water infiltration reflecting a strong connection between soil volumetric moisture content and deep soil water infiltration 3 3 the effect of rainfall intensity on volumetric soil moisture we observed the effects of different rainfall intensities on the soil moisture profiles in the case study of the period during 23 july 2017 24 july 2017 fig 5 a the 5 10 15 and 20 cm volumetric soil moisture contents increased by 265 36 171 41 117 19 and 106 76 respectively after 48 h of continuous rainfall totaling 58 mm average rainfall intensity of 1 21 mm h 1 however the 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm volumetric soil moisture contents remained relatively stable in the case study of july 31 fig 5b continuous rainfall lasting 48 h yielded a total of 31 4 mm average rainfall intensity of 0 65 mm h 1 the 5 10 15 and 20 cm volumetric soil moisture contents increased by 34 85 31 29 21 01 and 18 53 respectively while those at 40 60 80 100 and 140 cm did not show any consistent change indicating that the wetting front could only reach a depth of 40 cm even under high rainfall intensities consequently rainfall only had a strong impact on shallow volumetric soil moisture providing further evidence for the weak effect of rainfall on deep soil water infiltration 3 4 the effect of volumetric soil moisture on deep soil water infiltration given the strong connection between volumetric soil moisture and deep soil water infiltration we explored the relative influence of volumetric soil moisture within different soil layers on deep soil water infiltration based on the random forests method results showed that the volumetric soil moisture across different soil layers could explain 80 05 of the variation of deep soil water infiltration fig 6 furthermore the 140 cm volumetric soil moisture content was the most important factor affecting the seasonal variation of deep soil water infiltration followed by 100 80 60 and 40 cm volumetric soil moisture contents whereas the 5 10 15 and 20 cm volumetric soil moisture contents only had weak influences on deep soil water infiltration thus indicating that seasonal variation of the deep soil water infiltration was mainly dominated by deep soil volumetric moisture content and not by the shallow volumetric soil moisture to better understand the relationship between volumetric soil moisture and deep soil water infiltration we also explored the partial effects of volumetric soil moisture contents across different soil layers on deep soil water infiltration as shown in fig 7 there was no infiltration when the 140 100 80 60 and 40 cm volumetric soil moisture contents were less than 38 34 24 22 and 11 respectively but the deep soil water infiltration increased significantly when the 140 100 80 and 60 cm volumetric soil moisture contents exceeded 38 34 24 and 22 respectively suggesting that these contents were the threshold values of field capacity for the 140 100 80 and 60 cm soil layers respectively deep soil water infiltration still occurred when the 40 20 15 10 and 5 cm volumetric soil moisture contents were between 5 and 10 in addition the deep soil water infiltration reduced significantly when the 140 100 80 and 60 cm volumetric soil moisture contents were greater than 45 42 37 and 39 respectively suggesting that these contents were the threshold values of saturation capacity for the respective soil layers 4 discussion 4 1 the relationship between rainfall and deep soil water infiltration a great number of studies have indicated that deep soil infiltration is strongly affected by rainfall intensity especially for low intensity and long duration rainfall events wang et al 2008 in contrast the deep soil water infiltration in our study was not strongly affected either by light or heavy rainfall events normally two processes are needed to generate deep soil water infiltration storage and conduction the unsaturated surface soil layer will store some of the rainfall before the surplus rainfall can infiltrate further to deeper soil layers consequently most of the rainfall was stored in the surface soil layer during large rainfall events particularly when the surface soil has a strong water holding capacity thus we concluded that the discrepancy might be attributed to the following two aspects firstly there was a high soil organic matter content in the 0 40 cm soil layer of our study site due to abundant dead roots and litter which has a higher water holding capacity yang et al 2014 and resulted in a large proportion of rainfall being retained in the topsoil layer from where it is evaporated or transpired rather than infiltrating to deeper soil the annual evapotranspiration was 587 9 mm which was in line with the eddy covariance observations in the same study site zhang et al

weak impact of rainfall on deep soil water infiltration in addition the mattic epipedon is well developed in our study site and has a much lower thermal conductivity but much higher water retention capacity than the lower layer of mineral soil stähli et al 2001 this could further impede infiltration to the deep soil layers furthermore the vegetation cover may intercept some of the rainfall during the growing season huang et al 2013 as supported by our observations of reduced deep soil water infiltration from july to september when compared with june and october even though july september accounted for 77 of total rainfall table 2 furthermore the root system might also play a vital role in regulating the deep soil water infiltration after rainfall events as has been widely

6677,arid and semi arid regions experience large hydroclimatic variability and decadal scale droughts during droughts the reduced water availability alters the biophysical properties of the catchments which leads to non stationarity in rainfall runoff r r relationships uncertainty exists regarding the mechanisms causing r r non stationarity especially at seasonal scales this study analyses endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which could possibly influence r r relationships in two case study catchments in southeast australia sea the case study catchments are chosen such that they are representative of arid to semi arid catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal scale droughts the results demonstrate that endogenous catchment mechanisms i e groundwater table baseflow and vegetation have stronger influences on non stationarity in r r relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapotranspiration these findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r r relationships in order to develop more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions while this study is focussed on sea the findings are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal scale droughts keywords one way anova kolmogorov smirnov test australia drought surface water groundwater interaction land use change 1 introduction climate change projection studies indicate altered climatic conditions in the future relative to the historical record in many regions of the world arnell and gosling 2013 these projected changes and associated shifts in precipitation and temperature regimes are expected to influence plant phenology through altered soil water relations deb et al 2015a 2015b kiem et al 2016 van loon et al 2016 this can further alter the plant physiological responses and the hydrological cycle van dijk et al 2013 van loon 2015 in addition droughts potentially reduce the connectivity among the surface and subsurface water which can further alter the hydrological process chiew et al 2014 rugel et al 2016 these changes in catchment properties introduce higher uncertainties in studies aimed at projecting future hydrological conditions döll and zhang 2010 the traditional approach for projecting future hydrological conditions is to use inputs from a variety of different climate scenarios in hydrological models that have been calibrated validated on historical conditions deb et al 2018a this means an implicit assumption is made that the future catchment dynamics will remain as they were in the past i e during the periods used to calibrate the hydrological models this assumption is problematic given several recent studies which have demonstrated that catchment characteristics and dynamics are unlikely to remain the same in the future due to climate change and also changes in land use and land cover saft et al 2015 kim et al 2015 tian et al 2018 for instance during the millennium drought 1997 2009 in southeast australia sea reduced rainfall was associated with a dramatic and disproportionate reduction in runoff which further led to depletion of reservoirs and hampered agricultural production kiem and verdon kidd 2011 van dijk et al 2013 the hydrological modelling community attempted to simulate runoff during the millennium drought using different hydrological models in most cases the models performed poorly with runoff routinely overestimated during the millennium drought vaze et al 2010a 2010b chiew 2010 chiew et al 2014 saft et al 2016 an obvious explanation for the reduced observed runoff during millennium drought is the decline in rainfall verdon kidd and kiem 2009a 2009b however it has been shown that only 52 66 of the reduction in runoff can be explained by the corresponding reduction in rainfall potter et al 2011 potter and chiew 2011 several other mechanisms such as surface water sw groundwater gw interaction chiew and vaze 2015 vegetation cover ajami et al 2017 topography and potential evapotranspiration petheram et al 2011 and influences from large scale climate processes kiem and verdon kidd 2009 2010 2011 have also been found to contribute to the excessive runoff reduction during the millennium drought however saft et al 2015 investigated mechanisms which influenced non stationarity in rainfall runoff r r relationships in sea at an annual scale and found that potential evapotranspiration baseflow index and vegetation cover were statistically insignificant to the non stationarity in r r relationships this is somewhat contrary to previous findings and this lack of clarity highlights the need for further research that identifies the mechanisms which control non stationarity in r r relationships in sea in addition to the knowledge gaps uncovered by saft et al 2015 there is also limited understanding into the impacts and drivers of non stationarity in r r relationships at the seasonal scale it is well known that seasonal climatic variability alters the soil moisture pattern which in turn affects the runoff generation from a catchment xu et al 2012 for instance in sea spring september october november son usually receives the lowest rainfall and the antecedent soil moisture content is low resulting in higher infiltration deb et al 2018b however it is unknown what happens to r r relationships during different seasons and during multi year droughts i e where infiltration is further increased due to greater reductions in the antecedent soil moisture content that persist across many seasons penna et al 2011 temperature and evaporative demand also likely play important roles however there is high uncertainty as to exactly what those roles are van loon 2015 longobardi and khaertdinova 2015 kiem et al 2016 furthermore water management and distribution plans e g irrigation allocations are generally done at monthly or seasonal scales given that the existing hydrological models used for water management planning have failed to realistically simulate runoff under r r non stationarity it is crucial to identify the mechanisms which cause seasonal scale non stationarity in r r relationships so that a robust framework can be developed for realistic runoff simulation therefore this paper builds on the recommendations of fowler et al 2016 who suggested that the identification of physical processes undergoing change during different climatic epochs is crucial the aims of this study are to determine at annual and seasonal scales a the relative change of r r relationships due to multi year 7 years droughts b how sensitive the changes in r r relationships are to various endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms and c which endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms cause drought related non stationarity in r r relationships the study focusses on only two catchments in sea but the results and conclusions are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal scale droughts 2 data 2 1 catchment selection two catchments were chosen that are typical of sea catchments and which have different biophysical characteristics i e slope mean elevation soil types climate etc criteria for selecting the study catchments also included anthropogenically unaltered catchments with hydro climatic record 40 years and missing data 5 gw table data available at a monthly frequency one catchment size of 200 km2 and another 1000 km2 the selected catchments shown in fig 1 were brankeet creek catchment victoria stream gauge located at ancona 405251 36 97 s 145 79 e and muttama creek catchment new south wales nsw stream gauge located at coolac 410044 34 93 s 148 16 e hereafter referred as 405251 and 410044 catchments respectively the elevation ranges from 313 to 1020 m for catchment 405251 with an area of 122 km2 indicating a steep and narrow catchment whereas 410044 is relatively flat with elevation ranging from 236 to 720 m and area of 1061 km2 2 2 hydroclimatic data the dataset used in this study is presented in table 1 most datasets were complete for the periods except the rainfall and runoff streamflow rainfall data was missing for 3 of the periods covered and days where rainfall data was missing were assumed to have zero rain since most of the missing dataset was during the world war ii wwii drought period when the probability of rainfall was low runoff data was missing for 5 of the periods covered and missing runoff data was infilled based on the average daily flows for the corresponding months daily reference evapotranspiration et0 baseflow and horton index hi were calculated based on the data shown in table 1 see section 3 1 for details catchment rainfall was calculated based on the areal average across the catchment weighted using thiessen polygons created based on gauge locations tozer et al 2012 the spatial interpolation of the gw table for the catchments was done via simple kriging sun et al 2009 xiao et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 calculating daily et0 baseflow and hi the daily et0 for the catchments was calculated based on hargreaves samani equation et0 hs eq 1 since it is considered to be the most appropriate method for semi arid regions moeletsi et al 2013 sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 1 et o h s 0 408 a t m e a n 17 78 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where et0 hs mm day 1 tmean tmax and tmin are the daily mean maximum and minimum

radiation mj m 1 day 1 0 0408 is a constant to convert ra in mm day 1 additionally et0 was also calculated based on the widely used penman monteith equation et0 pm allen et al 1998 as given in eq 2 2

the total runoff it separates the quickflow component from the total flow and the baseflow was identified by subtracting the quickflow component from the total flow eqs 3 and 4 3 q f i α q f i 1 1 α 2 q i q i 1 f o r q f i 0 0 f o r q f i 0 4 q b i q i q f i where qf i is quickflow component mm for ith time step q i is the original runoff mm at ith time step qb i is baseflow mm at the ith time step and α is filter parameter usually set to 0 925 this approach has been applied successfully in many australian catchments nathan and mcmahon 1992 neal et al 2004 ladson et al 2013 hi represents the efficiency of plants to vaporise evapotranspiration the available water in a catchment and is expressed as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to catchment wetting eq 5 hi ranges from 0 to 1 and typically in dry conditions it can approach close to 1 illustrating use of all available water by plants in arid and semi arid conditions the quickflow constitute most of the runoff and therefore hi is close to 1 5 hi aet w where aet represents the annual actual evapotranspiration mm and w represents the catchment wetting mm which is calculated as the subtraction of annual quickflow derived in eq 3 mm from the annual precipitation mm the actual evapotranspiration was calculated from the water balance equation while considering the change in storage as zero eq 6 6 ds dt p q a e t where ds dt is the rate of change in storage p is annual precipitation mm q is total runoff mm and aet is annual actual evapotranspiration mm the seasonal summer autumn winter and spring and annual rainfall was calculated by aggregating the daily totals similarly baseflow and runoff were determined by aggregating the total daily flows calculated from daily mean values daily tmax tmin and hi were averaged to annual and seasonal values similarly bi monthly lai and monthly gw table were averaged to the corresponding time scales the normality of the annual rainfall and runoff data was evaluated using anderson darling ad test while considering the null hypothesis data follows normal distribution and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 the result illustrates rejection of null hypothesis for both rainfall and runoff data which are observed to be typically skewed at both catchments therefore in order to enhance the data applicability it was transformed using box cox transformation box and cox 1964 eq 7 7 q i q i λ 1 λ λ 0 l n q i λ 0 where qi is the transformed annual runoff qi is the raw runoff data λ is the parameter which was identified using maximum likelihood approach the box cox transformed rainfall was also generated using the same eq 7 and similarly the seasonal rainfall and runoff were also transformed for further analysis four major tasks were used in this study 1 identification of drought epochs in the catchments 2 identification of non stationarity in r r relationships in the catchments during droughts 3 exploring the sensitivities of the changes in r r relationships to endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms and 4 assessing the contribution of the corresponding mechanisms to the non stationarity in r r relationships the latter three steps were performed at both annual and seasonal scales for both catchments 3 2 defining and identifying drought epochs throughout the paper the terms drought epoch and non dry epoch are used drought was defined based on annual january december rainfall totals and the method used by saft et al 2015 this involved calculating annual rainfall anomalies relative to the 1939 2015 and 1974 2013 annual mean for catchments 410044 and 405251 respectively the annual anomalies were then smoothed with a three year moving window to minimise the impact of single wetter years in an otherwise long and significantly dry period the start of a drought epoch was the first year of a three year negative anomaly the end of a drought was set as the last year of the last negative three year anomaly unless that last year was a year with a positive anomaly 15 of the annual mean in which case the end year of the drought is set as the year prior to that last year also if the last two years had slightly positive anomalies each 15 of the annual mean the end year of the drought was set to the first year with a positive anomaly to ensure the considered drought epoch is sufficiently long and severe only drought epochs of 7 years and mean dry period anomaly 7 were considered 3 3 detection of non stationarity in r r relationship non stationarity in the r r relationships was identified using one way analysis of variance anova performed for the regression coefficients intercepts for the drought and non dry epochs derived from a linear model eq 8 the null hypothesis considered was variation in the intercepts is zero and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 8 q i α dro i dro α non d r o i non d r o β p i ε i where qi is transformed runoff αdro and αnon dro are eq 8 regression coefficients for the drought and non drought epochs respectively idro and inon dro are indicators for drought and non dry epochs respectively which were set to 1 for the period of interest and 0 for all other years including other dry epochs β is the slope of the regression line pi is the transformed rainfall and εi refers to the residuals of regression in order to identify the non stationarity in r r relationships at annual and seasonal scale the variance in the intercepts was tested for the corresponding time scales the residuals from the regression analysis were observed to be autocorrelated therefore the variables were transformed based on the recommendation by haan 2002 the variable at each time step was reduced by the value of autocorrelation multiplied by the variable at the previous time step this approach eliminated the autocorrelation in the residuals bringing it to zero for the entire record in order to crosscheck the existence of non stationarity in the r r relationships for the non transformed data two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test was applied for the runoff to rainfall ratio among drought and non dry epochs at both annual and seasonal scales the null hypothesis considered was samples derived from the two datasets follow the same distribution and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 in the case of multiple drought epochs both tests i e anova and ks test were performed among all the pairs of data i e drought 1 non dry drought 2 non dry drought 1 drought 2 etc tukey s post hoc test was further applied in the case of one way anova for each pair of datasets the autocorrelation in the seasonal runoff cascading to the runoff to rainfall ratio in the ks test was eliminated while using the same approach recommended by haan 2002 p 258 the relative changes of the r r relationship at annual and seasonal scales were identified by the difference between the runoff estimates from eq 8 with idro as 1 and inon dro as 0 i e drought and vice versa non dry for a representative rainfall at both annual and seasonal scales the rainfall was derived from the transformed rainfall data at corresponding time scales considering minimum transformed rainfall as the representative rainfall may result in the underestimation of runoff generation for drought whereas the mean value may lead to overestimation therefore the representative rainfall was calculated as half the sum of mean and minimum annual and seasonal transformed rainfall where the mean and minimum values were calculated for all years included in the regression equations the transformed runoff estimates were reverse box cox transformed to original runoff space and the difference was calculated to identify the relative change 3 4 identification of mechanisms influencing non stationarity in this study based on the existing work by saft et al 2015 endogenous catchment associated and exogenous climate associated catchment mechanisms were evaluated for their contribution to annual and seasonal scale r r non stationarity under multi year droughts the endogenous catchment and exogenous mechanisms considered were gw table baseflow lai and hi and et0 hs et0 pm rainfall tmax and tmin the sensitivity of r r relationship to the mechanisms was evaluated using normalised sensitivities of non transformed annual and seasonal runoff to rainfall ratio to the considered mechanisms in order to identify the sensitivities for drought and non dry epochs the dataset of the considered mechanisms were first converted to annual and seasonal scales mentioned earlier in section 3 3 for the corresponding epochs the normalised sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to annual gw table during drought was calculated by multiplying the ratio of mean gw table to runoff to rainfall ratio and the slope of the linear regression line among runoff to rainfall ratio and gw table for the corresponding drought eq 9 similarly the normalised sensitivities for other mechanisms to runoff to rainfall ratio were also calculated for each time scale annual and seasonal and epochs drought and non dry epochs in both catchments 9 n s g w g w r r d r r d g w where n s g w is normalized sensitivity of annual seasonal summer autumn winter spring runoff to rainfall ratio to gw table g w is mean annual seasonal gw table and r r is mean runoff to rainfall ratio similarly d r r and d g w are changes in runoff to rainfall ratio and gw table respectively the normalised sensitivity of runoff ratio is equivalent to the runoff to rainfall ratio elasticity to the considered mechanism gw table here in other words in this case it is defined as how much percentage change in the runoff to rainfall ratio is observed for 1 change in gw table in the catchment since at a seasonal scale the runoff to rainfall ratios can be autocorrelated contribution of baseflow in runoff from the previous season the approach of transforming runoff to rainfall ratio as recommended by haan 2002 was applied first the autocorrelation in the runoff to rainfall ratio for each season was identified and then it was multiplied to the runoff to rainfall ratio at the preceding season thus removing the autocorrelation for the whole record the investigation of whether the changes in the r r relationship are linked to the variation in catchment characteristics during the drought was done by applying two sample ks test among the subset of mechanisms for drought and non dry epochs the null hypothesis considered was the samples selected from both dataset follow same distribution and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 the ks test was conducted at both annual and seasonal scales for both catchments similarly the test was also done for the exogenous mechanisms at both time scales in case of catchment 410044 three subsets of the mechanisms were formed non dry wwii and millennium droughts at both time scales and the test was done for each pair of the dataset therefore in this study it was assumed that if there is a significant change in the mechanisms during drought relative to the non dry epochs it is associated with non stationarity in the r r relationships 4 results 4 1 drought period identification the 3 year moving window rainfall anomaly illustrates that the catchments have experienced droughts for several years throughout the record in the case of catchment 405251 the most severe drought is observed during 1998 to 2011 i e millennium drought whereas for catchment 410044 the severe droughts are during 1941 to 1953 referred to hereafter as the wwii drought and 2002 to 2009 referred to hereafter as the millennium drought fig 2 in the case of catchment 410044 there are several short droughts such as 1958 to 1960 and 1975 to 1982 however they are ignored for further analysis due to the focus on continuous multi year droughts 7 years in this study the rainfall anomaly suggests the existence of higher variability in the average annual rainfall for catchment 410044 87 0 to 102 1 relative to 405251 58 3 to 49 5 also it can be observed that during the millennium drought the mean reduction in average annual rainfall is 10 3 for catchment 405251 fig 2 whereas in case of catchment 410044 the mean reduction is observed to be 42 7 and 14 7 for wwii and millennium droughts respectively the existence of these severe droughts illustrate their potential ability to seriously alter vegetation dynamics and ultimately the runoff in the catchments which is discussed in the later sections 4 2 non stationarity in hydrologic response results obtained from the one way anova of the intercepts of the linear model illustrate the existence of non stationarity in the r r relationships at both annual and seasonal scales in both catchments table 2 the results for catchment 405251 considers linear models created for non dry and millennium drought whereas catchment 410044 considers non dry wwii and millennium droughts the results show the existence of a significant variation in the intercept for the non dry and the millennium drought for catchment 405251 similarly table 3 shows that the null hypothesis for tukey s post hoc test i e that there is no significant difference in the y intercepts for linear models of the r r relationship is rejected for all three cases assessed i e non dry and wwii drought non dry and millennium drought and wwii and millennium drought at an annual scale for catchment 410044 at a seasonal scale the null hypothesis is rejected for the comparison of non dry and wwii drought epochs for summer and spring non dry and millennium drought epochs and wwii drought and millennium drought epochs for autumn winter and spring the rejection of the null hypothesis illustrates the existence of non stationarity in the r r relationships for the cases considered the outcomes of the ks test for the runoff to rainfall ratio calculated from the non transformed data lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis at annual and seasonal scales for catchment 405251 similarly for catchment 410044 the null hypothesis is rejected for all three cases at the annual scale while for the seasonal scale the null hypothesis is rejected for case 1 summer case 2 and 3 during autumn and winter and all three cases during spring fig 3 these results support the findings of one way anova where the non stationarity in r r relationships are observed for the corresponding epochs fig 3 illustrates that the median values and ranges of runoff to rainfall ratio for the millennium drought are lower relative to non dry epochs at both catchments interestingly the median and the range of runoff to rainfall ratio during the wwii drought is observed to be higher compared to the non dry epochs and millennium drought for all cases except the winter season for the 410044 catchment 4 3 relative change of r r relationships during droughts relative to non dry epochs fig 4 illustrates the relative change of r r relationships due to multi year drought compared to non dry epoch there is a clear negative change in the r r relationship i e below average runoff per unit rainfall for catchment 405251 during the millennium drought at both annual and seasonal scales fig 4a similarly a negative change is also observed during the millennium drought for catchment 410044 however a positive change i e above average runoff per unit rainfall is observed during the wwii drought at both time scales fig 4b this elevated runoff to rainfall ratio during the wwii drought is counter intuitive given that a lower runoff to rainfall ratio is generally observed during droughts when compared to non dry epochs lavado casimiro et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 however elevated runoff to rainfall ratios during droughts are not impossible or unprecedented with for example saft et al 2015 also finding elevated runoff to rainfall ratios for five sea catchments during the millennium drought at seasonal scales both catchments are observed to experience a similar pattern of change for millennium drought the relative change observed for catchment 405251 are 19 6 59 2 57 8 and 43 1 for summer autumn winter and spring respectively similarly for catchment 410044 the relative changes are 75 7 92 8 91 0 and 83 3 for the corresponding seasons clearly a larger change is observed for catchment 410044 than for 405251 this is possibly due to the larger number of tree die off during droughts in the 410044 catchment relative to the 405251 and resulting enhancement of infiltration and reduction of overland flow ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 another possible explanation is that due to the heavily reduced rainfall in catchment 410044 during the millennium drought the recharge throughout the catchment declined resulting in lowering of the water table in the unconfined aquifer this along with the flatter topography of the catchment further provokes the flow regime to the losing state where the river flow recharges the aquifer and leads to reduced runoff brownbill et al 2011 on the other hand due to the steeper slope of catchment 405251 the river maintains the gaining state since the water table follows the topography condon and maxwell 2015 and results in a relatively higher runoff per unit rainfall compared to catchment 410044 in the case of wwii drought the relative changes of runoff are 53 1 50 4 8 9 and 28 7 for the summer autumn winter and spring seasons respectively for the 410044 catchment this increase in the runoff can be attributed to the contribution of the baseflow since although there is a reduction in rainfall tmin and tmax during the drought are lower than that of non dry periods further discussed later in section 4 5 these lower temperatures are typically associated with reduced et0 and therefore more water is retained in the vadose zone and the unconfined aquifer which contributes to the runoff kinal and stoneman 2012 overall these results demonstrate that changes in the r r relationship tends to be negative during the millennium drought for both catchments and positive during wwii drought at catchment 410044 at both time scales 4 4 normalised sensitivities of runoff to rainfall ratio to endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms in case of catchment 405251 the runoff to rainfall ratio is found to be positively sensitive to gw table at an annual scale and summer during the millennium drought whereas it is insensitive during other epochs and seasons fig 5 a specifically one percentage change in gw table results in approximately 50 150 and 300 change in the runoff to rainfall ratio during annual non dry drought and summer drought epochs respectively similarly runoff to rainfall ratio is noted to vary in the range of 20 and 55 for each percentage change in hi at annual scale non dry and drought epochs respectively the ratio is also observed to be negatively sensitive to both et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax during drought epochs at both time scales fig 5e f and h respectively from fig 5e and 5f it can be seen that the sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to the changes in et0 hs and et0 pm is similar except for a slight variation in the magnitude of the sensitivity at annual scale drought and summer drought a similar response i e runoff to rainfall ratio is negatively sensitive can also be seen for tmax although there is a variation in the magnitude fig 5h nevertheless the magnitude of runoff to rainfall sensitivity for et0 hs et0 pm and tmax is 5 6 times greater than the sensitivity to changes in rainfall also the sensitivities of runoff to rainfall ratio to baseflow and lai are positive i e positive change in runoff to rainfall ratio is observed for a positive change in the baseflow and lai across all seasons and at annual scale irrespective of drought and non dry conditions except for lai during the autumn non dry epoch where the sensitivity is observed to be negative the normalised sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to rainfall shows mixed responses with negative sensitivities during summer non dry autumn non dry and drought conditions whereas positive for all other cases runoff to rainfall ratio sensitivity to tmin is found to be negligible except for the millennium drought at an annual scale where it is observed to be negative fig 5i it is noteworthy that the maximum changes in the runoff to rainfall ratio per unit change in the mechanisms is observed in the case of gw table especially for the summer season during millennium drought for catchment 410044 due to the unavailability of sufficient gw table and lai data during wwii drought the normalised sensitivities for runoff to rainfall ratio during wwii drought is calculated only for baseflow hi et0 hs et0 pm rainfall tmax and tmin at the annual scale runoff to rainfall ratio is positively sensitive to i e positive response in runoff to rainfall ratio with positive changes baseflow lai rainfall and tmin and negatively sensitive to hi et0 hs et0 pm and tmax during millennium drought fig 6 from fig 6e and 6f it can be seen that the magnitude of sensitivity during millennium drought is different for the two approaches of et0 estimation with higher sensitivity for the hs approach this is possibly due to the higher dependence of et0 hs on tmax whereas et0 pm accounts for many variables to result in a lower sensitivity similarly during wwii drought the runoff to rainfall ratio is observed to be positively sensitive to baseflow whereas negatively sensitive to et0 hs et0 pm rainfall and tmax the seasonal scale runoff to rainfall ratio is noted to be positively sensitive to baseflow at all three epochs except for summer wwii and millennium droughts and autumn wwii drought where the runoff to rainfall ratio is insensitive fig 6b it is worth noting that during the summer and spring seasons of millennium drought runoff to rainfall ratio is positively sensitive to lai and rainfall the positive sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to lai can be possibly due to the fact that the higher temperatures during drought can result in higher tree die off and therefore the infiltration is enhanced which ultimately results in lowering the runoff zhang et al 2016 a higher negative sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio is observed for both et0 hs and et0 pm during millennium drought for both time scales also the sensitivity is negligible during the summer and autumn seasons for wwii drought clearly there is a similarity in the runoff to rainfall sensitivities except for a higher magnitude of sensitivity for autumn non dry epoch under et0 pm fig 6f compared to et0 hs fig 6e based on the identified results it is clear that the overall seasonal runoff to rainfall ratio is highly sensitive to baseflow et0 hs et0 pm lai and tmax during millennium drought however due to the unavailability of gw and lai data during wwii drought it could not be asserted how sensitive the runoff to rainfall ratio is to these mechanisms although it is observed to be highly sensitive to baseflow during spring and winter fig 6 whereas tmin and tmax during autumn it is important to note that the maximum changes in the runoff to rainfall ratio per unit change of the mechanisms are observed to be for gw table during drought annual scale hi during millennium drought and both at annual and seasonal scale for tmax 4 5 endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms controlling changes in r r relationships 4 5 1 endogenous catchment mechanisms the two sample ks test result for the endogenous catchment mechanisms among the non dry and drought epochs at catchment 405251 illustrate the rejection of null hypothesis for gw table baseflow and hi at annual scale for catchment 405251 fig 7 b 7c and 7d this implies the existence of statistically significant variation follows different distribution in the subset of data during the non dry and millennium drought also at a seasonal scale the null hypothesis is rejected for baseflow lai and hi during summer all four mechanisms during autumn and winter and gw table baseflow and hi during spring clearly from fig 7 these mechanisms vary widely throughout annually and seasonally the gw table height and baseflow are reduced during the millennium drought at both temporal scales although the median value of lai is noted to reduce the anomaly shows higher variation during autumn season of millennium drought since hi represents the efficiency at which plants use available water voepel et al 2011 evidently higher values are observed during drought relative to non dry epoch the ks test results illustrate the rejection of null hypothesis for baseflow and hi when the subsets were compared for non dry wwii drought and wwii millennium drought at annual scale for catchment 410044 fig 8 similarly the null hypothesis is also rejected for the subsets of gw table baseflow and hi for wwii millennium drought for the corresponding catchment fig 9 also at seasonal scale due to the unavailability of gw table and lai data for the wwii drought epoch the comparison between non dry wwii drought and wwii drought millennium drought was done only for baseflow and hi the ks test null hypothesis is rejected for baseflow during summer and spring seasons while comparing non dry and wwii drought epochs importantly the confidence level for rejection of null hypothesis for baseflow is low 0 04 at both annual and seasonal scales similarly while comparing the wwii and millennium droughts the null hypothesis is rejected for both baseflow and hi during winter and spring seasons furthermore for seasonal scale comparison of the mechanisms for non dry and millennium droughts the null hypothesis is rejected for gw table and baseflow during autumn winter and spring seasons in addition the null hypothesis is also rejected for hi during winter and spring seasons whereas lai during autumn season fig 8b suggest higher median values of baseflow during wwii drought relative to non dry epoch at annual scale also an interesting lower hi during annual wwii drought relative to non dry epoch is observed fig 8c indicating lower efficiency of water uptake by plants on the contrary the hi during millennium drought is observed to be higher when compared to the non dry and wwii drought epochs at annual scale the plots also illustrate how severely the mechanisms vary among wwii drought and millennium drought in the catchment at both annual and seasonal scales for instance the baseflow varies widely during both droughts with higher magnitudes during the wwii drought the plots created for the non dry and millennium drought are also in line with the findings of the catchment 405251 with lower magnitudes for gw table baseflow and lai whereas higher values are noted for hi during millennium drought 4 5 2 exogenous catchment mechanisms the results show that the contribution of the considered mechanisms to non stationarity in r r relationships varies widely for different temporal scales annual and seasonal scales and catchments for instance two sample ks test results for the comparison of the mechanisms during non dry and millennium drought indicate that at an annual scale the null hypothesis is rejected for rainfall and tmin at catchment 405251 similarly for the comparison at seasonal scale the results illustrate that null hypothesis of ks test is rejected for tmin during summer and spring whereas rainfall and tmin during autumn and winter fig 7 also at both temporal scales a lower and a higher magnitude of rainfall and tmin respectively are observed in the catchment in case of catchment 410044 the null hypothesis for the two sample ks test is rejected for rainfall and tmax at annual scale whereas only rainfall during summer and spring when the mechanisms are compared for non dry and wwii drought epochs additionally fig 8 shows lower rainfall during wwii drought at both time scales interestingly a lower tmax is observed during wwii drought relative to non dry epochs at the annual scale which is counterintuitive to the concept that higher temperatures are expected during drought a possible explanation for lower tmax during the wwii drought relative to the non dry epochs is the lower hi fig 8c as lower hi indicates reduced efficiency of the catchment in using available water by plants and an increase in the amount of water available at the surface and vadose zone leading to an increase in actual evapotranspiration and a cooling effect in the local climate cai et al 2009 lockart et al 2009 a lower magnitude of tmax indicates reduced et0 which can further influence the r r relationship although no significant change in the et0 is observed the null hypothesis for ks test is also rejected for the et0 and tmax when wwii and millennium droughts are compared at an annual scale both et0 hs and et0 pm show similar magnitude of annual scale et0 except for a slightly lower median and higher range for et0 pm which is statistically insignificant moreover at seasonal scale et0 et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax are noted to follow different distributions for autumn winter and spring seasons in addition the null hypothesis is also rejected for rainfall during winter illustrating the variance in rainfall pattern during the two droughts furthermore higher magnitudes of et0 et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax are observed for the millennium drought at annual scale and all seasons fig 8 wetter winters are also evident during the millennium drought relative to wwii drought for the catchment 410044 these results indicate that all considered exogenous mechanisms vary widely among the non dry wwii and millennium droughts at both time scales which drive the hydrological non stationarity also interestingly both et0 hs and et0 pm follow similar pattern of magnitude with a slight variation in the median and range two sample ks test results fig 9 for the comparison of the subsets of exogenous mechanisms for non dry and millennium drought illustrate rainfall et0 hs et0 pm and tmax as the major contributor to non stationarity at annual scale similarly at seasonal scale et0 hs et0 pm and tmax are noted to follow different distributions during autumn winter and spring seasons also the null hypothesis of the samples collected from subsets of non dry and millennium drought epochs are rejected for rainfall during the autumn and spring seasons clearly a lower magnitude of rainfall whereas a higher magnitude of tmax and et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm can be observed during drought epoch relative to non dry epoch fig 9 for the exogenous mechanisms considered in catchment 405251 tmin is found to be the most dominating mechanism influencing non stationarity during all seasons and at annual sale among non dry and millennium drought also rainfall is noted to influence the r r relationship during autumn and winter seasons similarly considering the catchment 410044 rainfall is noted to be the most dominating mechanism influencing non stationarity in the r r relationships among non dry and wwii drought on the contrary the contribution of et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax is observed to be major when wwii drought is compared to millennium drought at both annual and seasonal scales furthermore the non stationarity among the r r relationship during non dry and millennium drought for catchment 410044 can be claimed to the combined effect of rainfall et0 and tmax at both annual and seasonal scale thus it is necessary to consider all the mechanisms while dealing with catchment scale non stationary especially at seasonal scale 5 discussion during multi year drought epochs non stationarity exists in r r relationships at the catchment scale previous studies e g potter et al 2011 2013 and saft et al 2015 have reported annual scale changes in r r relationship during the millennium drought however this study shows seasonal scale non stationarity for the millennium drought and also the wwii drought there exists a statistically significant negative change in the r r relationships during the millennium drought at both annual and seasonal scales for both catchments interestingly a statistically significant positive change is observed during the wwii drought when compared to non dry epochs at the annual scale and during summer and spring seasons at catchment 410044 a positive change in r r relationship i e above average runoff per unit rainfall during drought is unusual and could be an artefact of uncertainties associated with the station based rainfall data used particularly the areal averaging necessary to obtain catchment average rainfall e g tozer et al 2012 however elevated runoff per unit rainfall during drought is not unprecedented e g saft et al 2015 and the results relating to the contribution of baseflow tmax and et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm provide a potential explanation for this counter intuitive result catchment 410044 received lower rainfall in terms of the number of wet days and mean daily rainfall intensity verdon kidd and kiem 2009a 2009b yet tmax was close to the mean tmax brönnimann 2015 this possibly translates to relatively lower et0 during the wwii drought when compared to the millennium drought and as a result more runoff per unit rainfall yang and liu 2011 yadav et al 2016 however lockart et al 2009 raise questions about this hypothesis arguing that temperature is a response to rather than a driver of actual evapotranspiration in any case fig 8 shows that baseflow is significantly elevated annually and in spring during the wwii drought and this combined with the lack of above average temperatures and reduced et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm and hi during the wwii drought possibly explain the higher runoff per unit rainfall experienced during the wwii drought this results also suggest that the wwii drought was primarily a meteorological drought whereas the reduced rainfall experienced during millennium drought also led to a soil moisture or agricultural drought ecological drought and hydrological water resources drought van dijk et al 2013 kiem et al 2016 there is a clear indication that et0 estimated by both hs and pm equations shows similar results although there is a slight variation in the magnitudes of the median and range it is statistically insignificant this further validates the theory that in arid and semi arid areas temperature and solar radiation governs et0 fooladmand et al 2008 sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 this suggests that the outputs of the et0 hs method can be relied on where the availability of data required in et0 pm method e g vapour pressure soil heat flux is a challenge which it currently is in many developing countries that are classified as arid semi arid regions the results also show that during multi year drought epochs the endogenous catchment mechanisms are more responsible for the changes in the r r relationship than exogenous specifically at seasonal scale a significant change in the baseflow gw and lai is noted for both annual and seasonal time scales at both catchments this does not mean there is no influence from exogenous catchment mechanisms as tmax and et0 likely had some influence during the millennium drought especially for catchment 410044 the millennium drought led to a significant decline in gw table van dijk et al 2013 and this is possibly the reason for the sensitivity of the r r relationship to gw table and baseflow the disconnection between the sw and gw during the millennium drought parsons et al 2008 is one possible cause of the significant decline in runoff observed during the millennium drought also multi year droughts can result in higher tree mortality rate zhang et al 2017 significant reduction in vegetation cover can result in reduced interception and enhanced infiltration which lowers the overland flow techamahasaranont et al 2017 however this may not always be true due to the forest restoration dynamics especially where larger areas are covered by trees catchments in this study a significant change in the lai is observed only during summer autumn and winter seasons at the smaller catchment 405251 during the millennium drought this implies the tree die off is higher in the wetter and less vegetated catchment on the other hand although catchment 410044 is drier and possesses higher vegetation the trees are more resilient in addition to this dominating plant species in a forest also contributes to the tree die off saft et al 2015 for instance a plant species which is more susceptible to soil moisture deficiency will have higher probability of tree die off a major concern is that the existing r r models are unable to realistically simulate runoff during multi year droughts vaze et al 2010a 2010b vaze et al 2011 saft et al 2016 tian et al 2018 this is because of the variation in catchment runoff response to rainfall during multi year droughts this further affects water resources planning and management since an accurate estimation of water availability is not possible another major issue is the application of the hydrological models in flood forecasting the results are flawed if the catchment characteristics are changed during droughts especially if a flood event occurs during the drought or immediately after a drought two ways to handle this are through modifying the existing models or developing new ones for either case work such as that presented here that identifies mechanisms which lead to variation in the r r relationships is necessary particular focus alluded to but not explicitly analysed here should be given to the different sensitivities in r r relationships for catchments with different soils and vegetation e g soils that are not sandy or heavy clay typically have the strongest vegetation function because they are the best for storing soil water between storms and catchments dominated by these soils will have very different r r relationships to catchments that are mostly sandy soils or clay further investigation into the sensitivities in r r relationships associated with different types of soil vegetation and also catchment elevation and slope are also recommended 6 conclusions this study identifies endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which influence the non stationarity in r r relationships in sea at both annual and seasonal scales the results suggest that the endogenous catchment mechanisms i e gw table baseflow and lai are strongly associated with non stationarity during multi year droughts this is true for both annual and seasonal time scales exogenous catchment mechanisms tmax rainfall and et0 also contribute to the non stationarity in r r relationships but their influences are not as strong as endogenous catchment mechanisms while the hydrological modelling community uses past climate for model calibration it must be kept in mind that a hydrological processes in a catchment change due to multi year droughts and b these changes in the hydrological processes will introduce higher uncertainties in model predictions it is also emphasised that changes in the catchment characteristics e g land use changes and alterations to sw gw interactions must be considered in order to obtain realistic hydrological simulations during droughts additionally et0 estimated by hs equation can be used as an alternative to the pm equation under data limited conditions these findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r r relationships in order to develop the more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions while this study is focussed on sea the findings are relevant to all catchments that

6677,arid and semi arid regions experience large hydroclimatic variability and decadal scale droughts during droughts the reduced water availability alters the biophysical properties of the catchments which leads to non stationarity in rainfall runoff r r relationships uncertainty exists regarding the mechanisms causing r r non stationarity especially at seasonal scales this study analyses endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which could possibly influence r r relationships in two case study catchments in southeast australia sea the case study catchments are chosen such that they are representative of arid to semi arid catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal scale droughts the results demonstrate that endogenous catchment mechanisms i e groundwater table baseflow and vegetation have stronger influences on non stationarity in r r relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapotranspiration these findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r r relationships in order to develop more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions while this study is focussed on sea the findings are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal scale droughts keywords one way anova kolmogorov smirnov test australia drought surface water groundwater interaction land use change 1 introduction climate change projection studies indicate altered climatic conditions in the future relative to the historical record in many regions of the world arnell and gosling 2013 these projected changes and associated shifts in precipitation and temperature regimes are expected to influence plant phenology through altered soil water relations deb et al 2015a 2015b kiem et al 2016 van loon et al 2016 this can further alter the plant physiological responses and the hydrological cycle van dijk et al 2013 van loon 2015 in addition droughts potentially reduce the connectivity among the surface and subsurface water which can further alter the hydrological process chiew et al 2014 rugel et al 2016 these changes in catchment properties introduce higher uncertainties in studies aimed at projecting future hydrological conditions döll and zhang 2010 the traditional approach for projecting future hydrological conditions is to use inputs from a variety of different climate scenarios in hydrological models that have been calibrated validated on historical conditions deb et al 2018a this means an implicit assumption is made that the future catchment dynamics will remain as they were in the past i e during the periods used to calibrate the hydrological models this assumption is problematic given several recent studies which have demonstrated that catchment characteristics and dynamics are unlikely to remain the same in the future due to climate change and also changes in land use and land cover saft et al 2015 kim et al 2015 tian et al 2018 for instance during the millennium drought 1997 2009 in southeast australia sea reduced rainfall was associated with a dramatic and disproportionate reduction in runoff which further led to depletion of reservoirs and hampered agricultural production kiem and verdon kidd 2011 van dijk et al 2013 the hydrological modelling community attempted to simulate runoff during the millennium drought using different hydrological models in most cases the models performed poorly with runoff routinely overestimated during the millennium drought vaze et al 2010a 2010b chiew 2010 chiew et al 2014 saft et al 2016 an obvious explanation for the reduced observed runoff during millennium drought is the decline in rainfall verdon kidd and kiem 2009a 2009b however it has been shown that only 52 66 of the reduction in runoff can be explained by the corresponding reduction in rainfall potter et al 2011 potter and chiew 2011 several other mechanisms such as surface water sw groundwater gw interaction chiew and vaze 2015 vegetation cover ajami et al 2017 topography and potential evapotranspiration petheram et al 2011 and influences from large scale climate processes kiem and verdon kidd 2009 2010 2011 have also been found to contribute to the excessive runoff reduction during the millennium drought however saft et al 2015 investigated mechanisms which influenced non stationarity in rainfall runoff r r relationships in sea at an annual scale and found that potential evapotranspiration baseflow index and vegetation cover were statistically insignificant to the non stationarity in r r relationships this is somewhat contrary to previous findings and this lack of clarity highlights the need for further research that identifies the mechanisms which control non stationarity in r r relationships in sea in addition to the knowledge gaps uncovered by saft et al 2015 there is also limited understanding into the impacts and drivers of non stationarity in r r relationships at the seasonal scale it is well known that seasonal climatic variability alters the soil moisture pattern which in turn affects the runoff generation from a catchment xu et al 2012 for instance in sea spring september october november son usually receives the lowest rainfall and the antecedent soil moisture content is low resulting in higher infiltration deb et al 2018b however it is unknown what happens to r r relationships during different seasons and during multi year droughts i e where infiltration is further increased due to greater reductions in the antecedent soil moisture content that persist across many seasons penna et al 2011 temperature and evaporative demand also likely play important roles however there is high uncertainty as to exactly what those roles are van loon 2015 longobardi and khaertdinova 2015 kiem et al 2016 furthermore water management and distribution plans e g irrigation allocations are generally done at monthly or seasonal scales given that the existing hydrological models used for water management planning have failed to realistically simulate runoff under r r non stationarity it is crucial to identify the mechanisms which cause seasonal scale non stationarity in r r relationships so that a robust framework can be developed for realistic runoff simulation therefore this paper builds on the recommendations of fowler et al 2016 who suggested that the identification of physical processes undergoing change during different climatic epochs is crucial the aims of this study are to determine at annual and seasonal scales a the relative change of r r relationships due to multi year 7 years droughts b how sensitive the changes in r r relationships are to various endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms and c which endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms cause drought related non stationarity in r r relationships the study focusses on only two catchments in sea but the results and conclusions are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal scale droughts 2 data 2 1 catchment selection two catchments were chosen that are typical of sea catchments and which have different biophysical characteristics i e slope mean elevation soil types climate etc criteria for selecting the study catchments also included anthropogenically unaltered catchments with hydro climatic record 40 years and missing data 5 gw table data available at a monthly frequency one catchment size of 200 km2 and another 1000 km2 the selected catchments shown in fig 1 were brankeet creek catchment victoria stream gauge located at ancona 405251 36 97 s 145 79 e and muttama creek catchment new south wales nsw stream gauge located at coolac 410044 34 93 s 148 16 e hereafter referred as 405251 and 410044 catchments respectively the elevation ranges from 313 to 1020 m for catchment 405251 with an area of 122 km2 indicating a steep and narrow catchment whereas 410044 is relatively flat with elevation ranging from 236 to 720 m and area of 1061 km2 2 2 hydroclimatic data the dataset used in this study is presented in table 1 most datasets were complete for the periods except the rainfall and runoff streamflow rainfall data was missing for 3 of the periods covered and days where rainfall data was missing were assumed to have zero rain since most of the missing dataset was during the world war ii wwii drought period when the probability of rainfall was low runoff data was missing for 5 of the periods covered and missing runoff data was infilled based on the average daily flows for the corresponding months daily reference evapotranspiration et0 baseflow and horton index hi were calculated based on the data shown in table 1 see section 3 1 for details catchment rainfall was calculated based on the areal average across the catchment weighted using thiessen polygons created based on gauge locations tozer et al 2012 the spatial interpolation of the gw table for the catchments was done via simple kriging sun et al 2009 xiao et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 calculating daily et0 baseflow and hi the daily et0 for the catchments was calculated based on hargreaves samani equation et0 hs eq 1 since it is considered to be the most appropriate method for semi arid regions moeletsi et al 2013 sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 1 et o h s 0 408 a t m e a n 17 78 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where et0 hs mm day 1 tmean tmax and tmin are the daily mean maximum and minimum

radiation mj m 1 day 1 0 0408 is a constant to convert ra in mm day 1 additionally et0 was also calculated based on the widely used penman monteith equation et0 pm allen et al 1998 as given in eq 2 2

the total runoff it separates the quickflow component from the total flow and the baseflow was identified by subtracting the quickflow component from the total flow eqs 3 and 4 3 q f i α q f i 1 1 α 2 q i q i 1 f o r q f i 0 0 f o r q f i 0 4 q b i q i q f i where qf i is quickflow component mm for ith time step q i is the original runoff mm at ith time step qb i is baseflow mm at the ith time step and α is filter parameter usually set to 0 925 this approach has been applied successfully in many australian catchments nathan and mcmahon 1992 neal et al 2004 ladson et al 2013 hi represents the efficiency of plants to vaporise evapotranspiration the available water in a catchment and is expressed as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to catchment wetting eq 5 hi ranges from 0 to 1 and typically in dry conditions it can approach close to 1 illustrating use of all available water by plants in arid and semi arid conditions the quickflow constitute most of the runoff and therefore hi is close to 1 5 hi aet w where aet represents the annual actual evapotranspiration mm and w represents the catchment wetting mm which is calculated as the subtraction of annual quickflow derived in eq 3 mm from the annual precipitation mm the actual evapotranspiration was calculated from the water balance equation while considering the change in storage as zero eq 6 6 ds dt p q a e t where ds dt is the rate of change in storage p is annual precipitation mm q is total runoff mm and aet is annual actual evapotranspiration mm the seasonal summer autumn winter and spring and annual rainfall was calculated by aggregating the daily totals similarly baseflow and runoff were determined by aggregating the total daily flows calculated from daily mean values daily tmax tmin and hi were averaged to annual and seasonal values similarly bi monthly lai and monthly gw table were averaged to the corresponding time scales the normality of the annual rainfall and runoff data was evaluated using anderson darling ad test while considering the null hypothesis data follows normal distribution and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 the result illustrates rejection of null hypothesis for both rainfall and runoff data which are observed to be typically skewed at both catchments therefore in order to enhance the data applicability it was transformed using box cox transformation box and cox 1964 eq 7 7 q i q i λ 1 λ λ 0 l n q i λ 0 where qi is the transformed annual runoff qi is the raw runoff data λ is the parameter which was identified using maximum likelihood approach the box cox transformed rainfall was also generated using the same eq 7 and similarly the seasonal rainfall and runoff were also transformed for further analysis four major tasks were used in this study 1 identification of drought epochs in the catchments 2 identification of non stationarity in r r relationships in the catchments during droughts 3 exploring the sensitivities of the changes in r r relationships to endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms and 4 assessing the contribution of the corresponding mechanisms to the non stationarity in r r relationships the latter three steps were performed at both annual and seasonal scales for both catchments 3 2 defining and identifying drought epochs throughout the paper the terms drought epoch and non dry epoch are used drought was defined based on annual january december rainfall totals and the method used by saft et al 2015 this involved calculating annual rainfall anomalies relative to the 1939 2015 and 1974 2013 annual mean for catchments 410044 and 405251 respectively the annual anomalies were then smoothed with a three year moving window to minimise the impact of single wetter years in an otherwise long and significantly dry period the start of a drought epoch was the first year of a three year negative anomaly the end of a drought was set as the last year of the last negative three year anomaly unless that last year was a year with a positive anomaly 15 of the annual mean in which case the end year of the drought is set as the year prior to that last year also if the last two years had slightly positive anomalies each 15 of the annual mean the end year of the drought was set to the first year with a positive anomaly to ensure the considered drought epoch is sufficiently long and severe only drought epochs of 7 years and mean dry period anomaly 7 were considered 3 3 detection of non stationarity in r r relationship non stationarity in the r r relationships was identified using one way analysis of variance anova performed for the regression coefficients intercepts for the drought and non dry epochs derived from a linear model eq 8 the null hypothesis considered was variation in the intercepts is zero and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 8 q i α dro i dro α non d r o i non d r o β p i ε i where qi is transformed runoff αdro and αnon dro are eq 8 regression coefficients for the drought and non drought epochs respectively idro and inon dro are indicators for drought and non dry epochs respectively which were set to 1 for the period of interest and 0 for all other years including other dry epochs β is the slope of the regression line pi is the transformed rainfall and εi refers to the residuals of regression in order to identify the non stationarity in r r relationships at annual and seasonal scale the variance in the intercepts was tested for the corresponding time scales the residuals from the regression analysis were observed to be autocorrelated therefore the variables were transformed based on the recommendation by haan 2002 the variable at each time step was reduced by the value of autocorrelation multiplied by the variable at the previous time step this approach eliminated the autocorrelation in the residuals bringing it to zero for the entire record in order to crosscheck the existence of non stationarity in the r r relationships for the non transformed data two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test was applied for the runoff to rainfall ratio among drought and non dry epochs at both annual and seasonal scales the null hypothesis considered was samples derived from the two datasets follow the same distribution and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 in the case of multiple drought epochs both tests i e anova and ks test were performed among all the pairs of data i e drought 1 non dry drought 2 non dry drought 1 drought 2 etc tukey s post hoc test was further applied in the case of one way anova for each pair of datasets the autocorrelation in the seasonal runoff cascading to the runoff to rainfall ratio in the ks test was eliminated while using the same approach recommended by haan 2002 p 258 the relative changes of the r r relationship at annual and seasonal scales were identified by the difference between the runoff estimates from eq 8 with idro as 1 and inon dro as 0 i e drought and vice versa non dry for a representative rainfall at both annual and seasonal scales the rainfall was derived from the transformed rainfall data at corresponding time scales considering minimum transformed rainfall as the representative rainfall may result in the underestimation of runoff generation for drought whereas the mean value may lead to overestimation therefore the representative rainfall was calculated as half the sum of mean and minimum annual and seasonal transformed rainfall where the mean and minimum values were calculated for all years included in the regression equations the transformed runoff estimates were reverse box cox transformed to original runoff space and the difference was calculated to identify the relative change 3 4 identification of mechanisms influencing non stationarity in this study based on the existing work by saft et al 2015 endogenous catchment associated and exogenous climate associated catchment mechanisms were evaluated for their contribution to annual and seasonal scale r r non stationarity under multi year droughts the endogenous catchment and exogenous mechanisms considered were gw table baseflow lai and hi and et0 hs et0 pm rainfall tmax and tmin the sensitivity of r r relationship to the mechanisms was evaluated using normalised sensitivities of non transformed annual and seasonal runoff to rainfall ratio to the considered mechanisms in order to identify the sensitivities for drought and non dry epochs the dataset of the considered mechanisms were first converted to annual and seasonal scales mentioned earlier in section 3 3 for the corresponding epochs the normalised sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to annual gw table during drought was calculated by multiplying the ratio of mean gw table to runoff to rainfall ratio and the slope of the linear regression line among runoff to rainfall ratio and gw table for the corresponding drought eq 9 similarly the normalised sensitivities for other mechanisms to runoff to rainfall ratio were also calculated for each time scale annual and seasonal and epochs drought and non dry epochs in both catchments 9 n s g w g w r r d r r d g w where n s g w is normalized sensitivity of annual seasonal summer autumn winter spring runoff to rainfall ratio to gw table g w is mean annual seasonal gw table and r r is mean runoff to rainfall ratio similarly d r r and d g w are changes in runoff to rainfall ratio and gw table respectively the normalised sensitivity of runoff ratio is equivalent to the runoff to rainfall ratio elasticity to the considered mechanism gw table here in other words in this case it is defined as how much percentage change in the runoff to rainfall ratio is observed for 1 change in gw table in the catchment since at a seasonal scale the runoff to rainfall ratios can be autocorrelated contribution of baseflow in runoff from the previous season the approach of transforming runoff to rainfall ratio as recommended by haan 2002 was applied first the autocorrelation in the runoff to rainfall ratio for each season was identified and then it was multiplied to the runoff to rainfall ratio at the preceding season thus removing the autocorrelation for the whole record the investigation of whether the changes in the r r relationship are linked to the variation in catchment characteristics during the drought was done by applying two sample ks test among the subset of mechanisms for drought and non dry epochs the null hypothesis considered was the samples selected from both dataset follow same distribution and was tested at a significance level of 0 05 the ks test was conducted at both annual and seasonal scales for both catchments similarly the test was also done for the exogenous mechanisms at both time scales in case of catchment 410044 three subsets of the mechanisms were formed non dry wwii and millennium droughts at both time scales and the test was done for each pair of the dataset therefore in this study it was assumed that if there is a significant change in the mechanisms during drought relative to the non dry epochs it is associated with non stationarity in the r r relationships 4 results 4 1 drought period identification the 3 year moving window rainfall anomaly illustrates that the catchments have experienced droughts for several years throughout the record in the case of catchment 405251 the most severe drought is observed during 1998 to 2011 i e millennium drought whereas for catchment 410044 the severe droughts are during 1941 to 1953 referred to hereafter as the wwii drought and 2002 to 2009 referred to hereafter as the millennium drought fig 2 in the case of catchment 410044 there are several short droughts such as 1958 to 1960 and 1975 to 1982 however they are ignored for further analysis due to the focus on continuous multi year droughts 7 years in this study the rainfall anomaly suggests the existence of higher variability in the average annual rainfall for catchment 410044 87 0 to 102 1 relative to 405251 58 3 to 49 5 also it can be observed that during the millennium drought the mean reduction in average annual rainfall is 10 3 for catchment 405251 fig 2 whereas in case of catchment 410044 the mean reduction is observed to be 42 7 and 14 7 for wwii and millennium droughts respectively the existence of these severe droughts illustrate their potential ability to seriously alter vegetation dynamics and ultimately the runoff in the catchments which is discussed in the later sections 4 2 non stationarity in hydrologic response results obtained from the one way anova of the intercepts of the linear model illustrate the existence of non stationarity in the r r relationships at both annual and seasonal scales in both catchments table 2 the results for catchment 405251 considers linear models created for non dry and millennium drought whereas catchment 410044 considers non dry wwii and millennium droughts the results show the existence of a significant variation in the intercept for the non dry and the millennium drought for catchment 405251 similarly table 3 shows that the null hypothesis for tukey s post hoc test i e that there is no significant difference in the y intercepts for linear models of the r r relationship is rejected for all three cases assessed i e non dry and wwii drought non dry and millennium drought and wwii and millennium drought at an annual scale for catchment 410044 at a seasonal scale the null hypothesis is rejected for the comparison of non dry and wwii drought epochs for summer and spring non dry and millennium drought epochs and wwii drought and millennium drought epochs for autumn winter and spring the rejection of the null hypothesis illustrates the existence of non stationarity in the r r relationships for the cases considered the outcomes of the ks test for the runoff to rainfall ratio calculated from the non transformed data lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis at annual and seasonal scales for catchment 405251 similarly for catchment 410044 the null hypothesis is rejected for all three cases at the annual scale while for the seasonal scale the null hypothesis is rejected for case 1 summer case 2 and 3 during autumn and winter and all three cases during spring fig 3 these results support the findings of one way anova where the non stationarity in r r relationships are observed for the corresponding epochs fig 3 illustrates that the median values and ranges of runoff to rainfall ratio for the millennium drought are lower relative to non dry epochs at both catchments interestingly the median and the range of runoff to rainfall ratio during the wwii drought is observed to be higher compared to the non dry epochs and millennium drought for all cases except the winter season for the 410044 catchment 4 3 relative change of r r relationships during droughts relative to non dry epochs fig 4 illustrates the relative change of r r relationships due to multi year drought compared to non dry epoch there is a clear negative change in the r r relationship i e below average runoff per unit rainfall for catchment 405251 during the millennium drought at both annual and seasonal scales fig 4a similarly a negative change is also observed during the millennium drought for catchment 410044 however a positive change i e above average runoff per unit rainfall is observed during the wwii drought at both time scales fig 4b this elevated runoff to rainfall ratio during the wwii drought is counter intuitive given that a lower runoff to rainfall ratio is generally observed during droughts when compared to non dry epochs lavado casimiro et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 however elevated runoff to rainfall ratios during droughts are not impossible or unprecedented with for example saft et al 2015 also finding elevated runoff to rainfall ratios for five sea catchments during the millennium drought at seasonal scales both catchments are observed to experience a similar pattern of change for millennium drought the relative change observed for catchment 405251 are 19 6 59 2 57 8 and 43 1 for summer autumn winter and spring respectively similarly for catchment 410044 the relative changes are 75 7 92 8 91 0 and 83 3 for the corresponding seasons clearly a larger change is observed for catchment 410044 than for 405251 this is possibly due to the larger number of tree die off during droughts in the 410044 catchment relative to the 405251 and resulting enhancement of infiltration and reduction of overland flow ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 another possible explanation is that due to the heavily reduced rainfall in catchment 410044 during the millennium drought the recharge throughout the catchment declined resulting in lowering of the water table in the unconfined aquifer this along with the flatter topography of the catchment further provokes the flow regime to the losing state where the river flow recharges the aquifer and leads to reduced runoff brownbill et al 2011 on the other hand due to the steeper slope of catchment 405251 the river maintains the gaining state since the water table follows the topography condon and maxwell 2015 and results in a relatively higher runoff per unit rainfall compared to catchment 410044 in the case of wwii drought the relative changes of runoff are 53 1 50 4 8 9 and 28 7 for the summer autumn winter and spring seasons respectively for the 410044 catchment this increase in the runoff can be attributed to the contribution of the baseflow since although there is a reduction in rainfall tmin and tmax during the drought are lower than that of non dry periods further discussed later in section 4 5 these lower temperatures are typically associated with reduced et0 and therefore more water is retained in the vadose zone and the unconfined aquifer which contributes to the runoff kinal and stoneman 2012 overall these results demonstrate that changes in the r r relationship tends to be negative during the millennium drought for both catchments and positive during wwii drought at catchment 410044 at both time scales 4 4 normalised sensitivities of runoff to rainfall ratio to endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms in case of catchment 405251 the runoff to rainfall ratio is found to be positively sensitive to gw table at an annual scale and summer during the millennium drought whereas it is insensitive during other epochs and seasons fig 5 a specifically one percentage change in gw table results in approximately 50 150 and 300 change in the runoff to rainfall ratio during annual non dry drought and summer drought epochs respectively similarly runoff to rainfall ratio is noted to vary in the range of 20 and 55 for each percentage change in hi at annual scale non dry and drought epochs respectively the ratio is also observed to be negatively sensitive to both et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax during drought epochs at both time scales fig 5e f and h respectively from fig 5e and 5f it can be seen that the sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to the changes in et0 hs and et0 pm is similar except for a slight variation in the magnitude of the sensitivity at annual scale drought and summer drought a similar response i e runoff to rainfall ratio is negatively sensitive can also be seen for tmax although there is a variation in the magnitude fig 5h nevertheless the magnitude of runoff to rainfall sensitivity for et0 hs et0 pm and tmax is 5 6 times greater than the sensitivity to changes in rainfall also the sensitivities of runoff to rainfall ratio to baseflow and lai are positive i e positive change in runoff to rainfall ratio is observed for a positive change in the baseflow and lai across all seasons and at annual scale irrespective of drought and non dry conditions except for lai during the autumn non dry epoch where the sensitivity is observed to be negative the normalised sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to rainfall shows mixed responses with negative sensitivities during summer non dry autumn non dry and drought conditions whereas positive for all other cases runoff to rainfall ratio sensitivity to tmin is found to be negligible except for the millennium drought at an annual scale where it is observed to be negative fig 5i it is noteworthy that the maximum changes in the runoff to rainfall ratio per unit change in the mechanisms is observed in the case of gw table especially for the summer season during millennium drought for catchment 410044 due to the unavailability of sufficient gw table and lai data during wwii drought the normalised sensitivities for runoff to rainfall ratio during wwii drought is calculated only for baseflow hi et0 hs et0 pm rainfall tmax and tmin at the annual scale runoff to rainfall ratio is positively sensitive to i e positive response in runoff to rainfall ratio with positive changes baseflow lai rainfall and tmin and negatively sensitive to hi et0 hs et0 pm and tmax during millennium drought fig 6 from fig 6e and 6f it can be seen that the magnitude of sensitivity during millennium drought is different for the two approaches of et0 estimation with higher sensitivity for the hs approach this is possibly due to the higher dependence of et0 hs on tmax whereas et0 pm accounts for many variables to result in a lower sensitivity similarly during wwii drought the runoff to rainfall ratio is observed to be positively sensitive to baseflow whereas negatively sensitive to et0 hs et0 pm rainfall and tmax the seasonal scale runoff to rainfall ratio is noted to be positively sensitive to baseflow at all three epochs except for summer wwii and millennium droughts and autumn wwii drought where the runoff to rainfall ratio is insensitive fig 6b it is worth noting that during the summer and spring seasons of millennium drought runoff to rainfall ratio is positively sensitive to lai and rainfall the positive sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio to lai can be possibly due to the fact that the higher temperatures during drought can result in higher tree die off and therefore the infiltration is enhanced which ultimately results in lowering the runoff zhang et al 2016 a higher negative sensitivity of runoff to rainfall ratio is observed for both et0 hs and et0 pm during millennium drought for both time scales also the sensitivity is negligible during the summer and autumn seasons for wwii drought clearly there is a similarity in the runoff to rainfall sensitivities except for a higher magnitude of sensitivity for autumn non dry epoch under et0 pm fig 6f compared to et0 hs fig 6e based on the identified results it is clear that the overall seasonal runoff to rainfall ratio is highly sensitive to baseflow et0 hs et0 pm lai and tmax during millennium drought however due to the unavailability of gw and lai data during wwii drought it could not be asserted how sensitive the runoff to rainfall ratio is to these mechanisms although it is observed to be highly sensitive to baseflow during spring and winter fig 6 whereas tmin and tmax during autumn it is important to note that the maximum changes in the runoff to rainfall ratio per unit change of the mechanisms are observed to be for gw table during drought annual scale hi during millennium drought and both at annual and seasonal scale for tmax 4 5 endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms controlling changes in r r relationships 4 5 1 endogenous catchment mechanisms the two sample ks test result for the endogenous catchment mechanisms among the non dry and drought epochs at catchment 405251 illustrate the rejection of null hypothesis for gw table baseflow and hi at annual scale for catchment 405251 fig 7 b 7c and 7d this implies the existence of statistically significant variation follows different distribution in the subset of data during the non dry and millennium drought also at a seasonal scale the null hypothesis is rejected for baseflow lai and hi during summer all four mechanisms during autumn and winter and gw table baseflow and hi during spring clearly from fig 7 these mechanisms vary widely throughout annually and seasonally the gw table height and baseflow are reduced during the millennium drought at both temporal scales although the median value of lai is noted to reduce the anomaly shows higher variation during autumn season of millennium drought since hi represents the efficiency at which plants use available water voepel et al 2011 evidently higher values are observed during drought relative to non dry epoch the ks test results illustrate the rejection of null hypothesis for baseflow and hi when the subsets were compared for non dry wwii drought and wwii millennium drought at annual scale for catchment 410044 fig 8 similarly the null hypothesis is also rejected for the subsets of gw table baseflow and hi for wwii millennium drought for the corresponding catchment fig 9 also at seasonal scale due to the unavailability of gw table and lai data for the wwii drought epoch the comparison between non dry wwii drought and wwii drought millennium drought was done only for baseflow and hi the ks test null hypothesis is rejected for baseflow during summer and spring seasons while comparing non dry and wwii drought epochs importantly the confidence level for rejection of null hypothesis for baseflow is low 0 04 at both annual and seasonal scales similarly while comparing the wwii and millennium droughts the null hypothesis is rejected for both baseflow and hi during winter and spring seasons furthermore for seasonal scale comparison of the mechanisms for non dry and millennium droughts the null hypothesis is rejected for gw table and baseflow during autumn winter and spring seasons in addition the null hypothesis is also rejected for hi during winter and spring seasons whereas lai during autumn season fig 8b suggest higher median values of baseflow during wwii drought relative to non dry epoch at annual scale also an interesting lower hi during annual wwii drought relative to non dry epoch is observed fig 8c indicating lower efficiency of water uptake by plants on the contrary the hi during millennium drought is observed to be higher when compared to the non dry and wwii drought epochs at annual scale the plots also illustrate how severely the mechanisms vary among wwii drought and millennium drought in the catchment at both annual and seasonal scales for instance the baseflow varies widely during both droughts with higher magnitudes during the wwii drought the plots created for the non dry and millennium drought are also in line with the findings of the catchment 405251 with lower magnitudes for gw table baseflow and lai whereas higher values are noted for hi during millennium drought 4 5 2 exogenous catchment mechanisms the results show that the contribution of the considered mechanisms to non stationarity in r r relationships varies widely for different temporal scales annual and seasonal scales and catchments for instance two sample ks test results for the comparison of the mechanisms during non dry and millennium drought indicate that at an annual scale the null hypothesis is rejected for rainfall and tmin at catchment 405251 similarly for the comparison at seasonal scale the results illustrate that null hypothesis of ks test is rejected for tmin during summer and spring whereas rainfall and tmin during autumn and winter fig 7 also at both temporal scales a lower and a higher magnitude of rainfall and tmin respectively are observed in the catchment in case of catchment 410044 the null hypothesis for the two sample ks test is rejected for rainfall and tmax at annual scale whereas only rainfall during summer and spring when the mechanisms are compared for non dry and wwii drought epochs additionally fig 8 shows lower rainfall during wwii drought at both time scales interestingly a lower tmax is observed during wwii drought relative to non dry epochs at the annual scale which is counterintuitive to the concept that higher temperatures are expected during drought a possible explanation for lower tmax during the wwii drought relative to the non dry epochs is the lower hi fig 8c as lower hi indicates reduced efficiency of the catchment in using available water by plants and an increase in the amount of water available at the surface and vadose zone leading to an increase in actual evapotranspiration and a cooling effect in the local climate cai et al 2009 lockart et al 2009 a lower magnitude of tmax indicates reduced et0 which can further influence the r r relationship although no significant change in the et0 is observed the null hypothesis for ks test is also rejected for the et0 and tmax when wwii and millennium droughts are compared at an annual scale both et0 hs and et0 pm show similar magnitude of annual scale et0 except for a slightly lower median and higher range for et0 pm which is statistically insignificant moreover at seasonal scale et0 et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax are noted to follow different distributions for autumn winter and spring seasons in addition the null hypothesis is also rejected for rainfall during winter illustrating the variance in rainfall pattern during the two droughts furthermore higher magnitudes of et0 et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax are observed for the millennium drought at annual scale and all seasons fig 8 wetter winters are also evident during the millennium drought relative to wwii drought for the catchment 410044 these results indicate that all considered exogenous mechanisms vary widely among the non dry wwii and millennium droughts at both time scales which drive the hydrological non stationarity also interestingly both et0 hs and et0 pm follow similar pattern of magnitude with a slight variation in the median and range two sample ks test results fig 9 for the comparison of the subsets of exogenous mechanisms for non dry and millennium drought illustrate rainfall et0 hs et0 pm and tmax as the major contributor to non stationarity at annual scale similarly at seasonal scale et0 hs et0 pm and tmax are noted to follow different distributions during autumn winter and spring seasons also the null hypothesis of the samples collected from subsets of non dry and millennium drought epochs are rejected for rainfall during the autumn and spring seasons clearly a lower magnitude of rainfall whereas a higher magnitude of tmax and et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm can be observed during drought epoch relative to non dry epoch fig 9 for the exogenous mechanisms considered in catchment 405251 tmin is found to be the most dominating mechanism influencing non stationarity during all seasons and at annual sale among non dry and millennium drought also rainfall is noted to influence the r r relationship during autumn and winter seasons similarly considering the catchment 410044 rainfall is noted to be the most dominating mechanism influencing non stationarity in the r r relationships among non dry and wwii drought on the contrary the contribution of et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm and tmax is observed to be major when wwii drought is compared to millennium drought at both annual and seasonal scales furthermore the non stationarity among the r r relationship during non dry and millennium drought for catchment 410044 can be claimed to the combined effect of rainfall et0 and tmax at both annual and seasonal scale thus it is necessary to consider all the mechanisms while dealing with catchment scale non stationary especially at seasonal scale 5 discussion during multi year drought epochs non stationarity exists in r r relationships at the catchment scale previous studies e g potter et al 2011 2013 and saft et al 2015 have reported annual scale changes in r r relationship during the millennium drought however this study shows seasonal scale non stationarity for the millennium drought and also the wwii drought there exists a statistically significant negative change in the r r relationships during the millennium drought at both annual and seasonal scales for both catchments interestingly a statistically significant positive change is observed during the wwii drought when compared to non dry epochs at the annual scale and during summer and spring seasons at catchment 410044 a positive change in r r relationship i e above average runoff per unit rainfall during drought is unusual and could be an artefact of uncertainties associated with the station based rainfall data used particularly the areal averaging necessary to obtain catchment average rainfall e g tozer et al 2012 however elevated runoff per unit rainfall during drought is not unprecedented e g saft et al 2015 and the results relating to the contribution of baseflow tmax and et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm provide a potential explanation for this counter intuitive result catchment 410044 received lower rainfall in terms of the number of wet days and mean daily rainfall intensity verdon kidd and kiem 2009a 2009b yet tmax was close to the mean tmax brönnimann 2015 this possibly translates to relatively lower et0 during the wwii drought when compared to the millennium drought and as a result more runoff per unit rainfall yang and liu 2011 yadav et al 2016 however lockart et al 2009 raise questions about this hypothesis arguing that temperature is a response to rather than a driver of actual evapotranspiration in any case fig 8 shows that baseflow is significantly elevated annually and in spring during the wwii drought and this combined with the lack of above average temperatures and reduced et0 both et0 hs and et0 pm and hi during the wwii drought possibly explain the higher runoff per unit rainfall experienced during the wwii drought this results also suggest that the wwii drought was primarily a meteorological drought whereas the reduced rainfall experienced during millennium drought also led to a soil moisture or agricultural drought ecological drought and hydrological water resources drought van dijk et al 2013 kiem et al 2016 there is a clear indication that et0 estimated by both hs and pm equations shows similar results although there is a slight variation in the magnitudes of the median and range it is statistically insignificant this further validates the theory that in arid and semi arid areas temperature and solar radiation governs et0 fooladmand et al 2008 sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 this suggests that the outputs of the et0 hs method can be relied on where the availability of data required in et0 pm method e g vapour pressure soil heat flux is a challenge which it currently is in many developing countries that are classified as arid semi arid regions the results also show that during multi year drought epochs the endogenous catchment mechanisms are more responsible for the changes in the r r relationship than exogenous specifically at seasonal scale a significant change in the baseflow gw and lai is noted for both annual and seasonal time scales at both catchments this does not mean there is no influence from exogenous catchment mechanisms as tmax and et0 likely had some influence during the millennium drought especially for catchment 410044 the millennium drought led to a significant decline in gw table van dijk et al 2013 and this is possibly the reason for the sensitivity of the r r relationship to gw table and baseflow the disconnection between the sw and gw during the millennium drought parsons et al 2008 is one possible cause of the significant decline in runoff observed during the millennium drought also multi year droughts can result in higher tree mortality rate zhang et al 2017 significant reduction in vegetation cover can result in reduced interception and enhanced infiltration which lowers the overland flow techamahasaranont et al 2017 however this may not always be true due to the forest restoration dynamics especially where larger areas are covered by trees catchments in this study a significant change in the lai is observed only during summer autumn and winter seasons at the smaller catchment 405251 during the millennium drought this implies the tree die off is higher in the wetter and less vegetated catchment on the other hand although catchment 410044 is drier and possesses higher vegetation the trees are more resilient in addition to this dominating plant species in a forest also contributes to the tree die off saft et al 2015 for instance a plant species which is more susceptible to soil moisture deficiency will have higher probability of tree die off a major concern is that the existing r r models are unable to realistically simulate runoff during multi year droughts vaze et al 2010a 2010b vaze et al 2011 saft et al 2016 tian et al 2018 this is because of the variation in catchment runoff response to rainfall during multi year droughts this further affects water resources planning and management since an accurate estimation of water availability is not possible another major issue is the application of the hydrological models in flood forecasting the results are flawed if the catchment characteristics are changed during droughts especially if a flood event occurs during the drought or immediately after a drought two ways to handle this are through modifying the existing models or developing new ones for either case work such as that presented here that identifies mechanisms which lead to variation in the r r relationships is necessary particular focus alluded to but not explicitly analysed here should be given to the different sensitivities in r r relationships for catchments with different soils and vegetation e g soils that are not sandy or heavy clay typically have the strongest vegetation function because they are the best for storing soil water between storms and catchments dominated by these soils will have very different r r relationships to catchments that are mostly sandy soils or clay further investigation into the sensitivities in r r relationships associated with different types of soil vegetation and also catchment elevation and slope are also recommended 6 conclusions this study identifies endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which influence the non stationarity in r r relationships in sea at both annual and seasonal scales the results suggest that the endogenous catchment mechanisms i e gw table baseflow and lai are strongly associated with non stationarity during multi year droughts this is true for both annual and seasonal time scales exogenous catchment mechanisms tmax rainfall and et0 also contribute to the non stationarity in r r relationships but their influences are not as strong as endogenous catchment mechanisms while the hydrological modelling community uses past climate for model calibration it must be kept in mind that a hydrological processes in a catchment change due to multi year droughts and b these changes in the hydrological processes will introduce higher uncertainties in model predictions it is also emphasised that changes in the catchment characteristics e g land use changes and alterations to sw gw interactions must be considered in order to obtain realistic hydrological simulations during droughts additionally et0 estimated by hs equation can be used as an alternative to the pm equation under data limited conditions these findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r r relationships in order to develop the more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions while this study is focussed on sea the findings are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal scale droughts declaration of interest statement the authors confirm that there is no conflict of interest associated with this paper acknowledgements

6678,a modelling strategy is formulated which collectively consists of separate multiple models mm and uses bayesian model averaging bma to combine these mms to learn from data the procedure is at two levels at level 1 three artificial intelligence ai models are constructed which comprise artificial neural network ann sugeno fuzzy logic sfl and multiple neuro fuzzy multi nf but their outputs are directed to bma at the next level at level 2 bma is used to combine ann sfl and multi nf for better predictions and with facilities for quantifying uncertainty the model performance is tested using the data from urmia aquifer in the west azerbaijan province northwest iran where due to the absence of participatory water usage management practices both lake urmia and its surrounding 12 aquifers including the study area are distressed the modelling strategy and its results on urmia aquifer provides an insight to the study area and will be used to investigate ways of arresting the decline in the water table of the aquifer but this should be feasible only by developing a series of management plans including basin management plans aquifer management plans drought plans water cycle studies under such an integrated management system the model developed here is demonstrably well placed to serve as an operational management tool for the aquifer keywords bayesian model averaging distressed

introduction bayesian model averaging bma transformed into a practical tool since draper 1995 and höting et al 1999 is a strategy to combine multiple models mm often constructed by perturbing parameters and to use its capability for assessing inherent uncertainties this paper investigates performances of bma by combining separate mms comprising three different artificial intelligence ai techniques for predicting groundwater level gwl of urmia aquifer the strategy is notable for coping with sparse data as the case is for urmia aquifer and for providing an insight into the state of the aquifer and its declining gwls during the 14 years of its record the study touches on the broader context of the problem where lake urmia is in a distressed state since 2000 due to overambitious embankment dams and this is paralleled by over abstractions of its aquifers fig 1 compares the decline in lake urmia water level a decline of 0 3 m year with declining gwl in urmia aquifer an approx decline of 0 2 m year where both declines are attributable to the absence of any policy or poor policies at both national and regional levels the paper aims to gain an insight into the problem as the economic vibrancy of the population at the fertile urmia plain depends on maintaining the integrity of the high quality of the aquifer model combination is a topical research and includes i ensemble modelling often using mms by perturbing parameters see clemen 1989 for a comprehensive review and cloke and pappenberger 2009 for a review on meteorological forecasting ii applications of bma in various disciplines since the works by draper 1995 and as elaborated by höting et al 1999 and iii the authors research activities in hydrology and geohydrology often use an ai model to combine mms aimm e g see nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a these model combination streams of activities are flanked by a traditional research practice in which mms are used but with the goal of comparing the performances of an innovative model with the performances of traditional mms the goal in traditional practices is to identify a superior model and this normally concludes with confirming the superiority of the innovative model by using anecdotal evidence and without statistical tests the authors use various aimm strategies and show significant improvements e g see nadiri et al 2019 the bayesian paradigm gained popularity since the middle of the 20th century whereas traditional model inter comparison studies available since the early 20th century employ frequentist paradigms in one way or another see jeffreys 1961 newman and wierenga 2003 introduced bma to combine a number of conceptual groundwater models for flow and transport equations tsai and li 2008 developed a new framework to address uncertainty associated with inverse groundwater modelling for hydraulic conductivity estimation further applications include gwl prediction li and tsai 2009 using a conceptual model groundwater management under uncertainty to mitigate saltwater intrusion tsai 2010 hierarchical bma hbma was applied to groundwater remediation designs to assess impacts of individual sources of uncertainty chitsazan and tsai 2014 2015 also chitsazan et al 2015 quantified uncertainty in different ann models by hbma mathematical models and input data to predict fluoride concentration in groundwater whilst bma is a natural model combination strategy it is fused in the paper with the model combination strategies based on the author s aimm strategy for bottom up data driven techniques applications of artificial intelligence ai techniques without model combination are outlined in table 1 which categorises various applications to groups research in group 1 uses a single ai model but applies it to diverse case studies such as gwl prediction in karstic and leaky aquifers coppola et al 2005 trichakis et al 2011 gwl prediction in freshwater swamp forests sun et al 2016 and gwl prediction in an unconfined aquifer sadeghfam et al 2018 research in group 2 table 1 uses ai with mms for gwl predictions using the same data which often share the same goal of selecting a superior model as shown in table 2 bazartseren et al 2003 use two such ai models and report that both models are accurate for a longer gwl prediction horizon alvisi et al 2006 also use two ai models and report that sugeno fuzzy logic sfl and mamdani fuzzy logic mfl perform slightly better than that by artificial neural network ann model in terms of rmse shiri et al 2013 employ gene expression programming gep and report it to be more successful than other ai models used in their tests for gwl predictions the choice of models on groundwater problems is vast and broadly comprise i process based theoretical empirical modelling capabilities such as modflow mt3d but are data intensive and computationally expensive or ii data driven bottom up modelling capabilities such as ai techniques which only use local data and still offer computationally cost effective prediction capabilities notably the combination of these two capabilities are referred to as conceptual models but are not detailed here for brevity owing to the sparsity of data and limited budget ai techniques are natural choices for the study also nadiri et al 2019 discuss the mathematical foundation for combining mms according to which model combination even by simple averaging improves the average of the combined model compared with the individual models the techniques based on process based modelling capabilities are precluded from this study but three commonly used ai models are selected to be combined by bma to improve on their accuracy an overview of table 1 provides a clear evidence that there is no superior model thus such a selection is at the expense of discarding information contained in the remaining models often by attaching a lower status the present paper is critical of choosing a superior or a single model at the expense of other models as emphasised by khatibi et al 2011a 2011b 2013 2014 2017 traditional model selection practices overlook the opportunity to learn from the convergence and divergences among mms and they only provide anecdotal evidence for identifying the superiority of a model but in reality they are just fit for purpose one approach to minimise the loss of information is to formalise the model selection procedure for instance khatibi et al 2003 tilford et al 2005 and hawkes et al 2005 discuss a risk based approach to model selection whereas li and tsai 2009 discuss a bayesian model selection bms based on bayesian model evidence for selecting the best model and argue that the best model does not guarantee better prediction also tsai and li 2008 argue that bma provides robust results than bms notably both bms and bma use posterior probability to rank models link and barker 2006 without testing the statistical significance of the superiority of a model investigating bma to combine ai models is a viable case for research the two streams of research reviewed above share the goal of model combination but those accounted by group 2 in table 1 require a strategy for model combination for a greater efficacy in modelling the authors avoid ranking individual models for selecting a best superior model but promote learning from mms through formulating a modelling strategy e g see nadiri et al 2014 2018a 2018b and khatibi et al 2017 2018a b ghorbani et al 2018 the capability to learn from mms is implemented through formulating strategies in which they are arranged at two levels at level 1 a set of models are developed which are artificial neural network sugeno fuzzy logic neuro fuzzy by employing their best practice procedure but for the purpose of producing inputs to the next level at level 2 a model is used to combine level 1 models the inputs of which are based on the outputs of level 1 models the model combination strategy used here is based on bma the only model combination strategy based on aimm for gwl modelling is reported by nadiri et al 2019 they formulate several strategies including one by simple averaging of mms and confirm the published literature by showing that the root mean square errors rmse of the combined model is less than the mean of the rmse of the individual models this is a confirmation that even simple averaging improves accuracy the objective is to predict the water table gwl for the urmia aquifer by combining ai models using bma the paper applyes bma to combine different ai models for predicting gwls and to the best knowledge of the authors bma combining mms of ai has not been investigated for the prediction of gwl also the model structure for prediction has novelty but this is explained in due course the procedure involves intrinsically a capability for estimating uncertainty attention is drawn to a possible mismatch of terminology on observed input data as used in bayesian statistics where these may be used as input data in ai modelling practices both terms are used interchangeably in the paper 2 methodology an overview of the methodology is outlined in fig 2 as a flowchart which depicts the main elements of using bma to learn from mms for predicting groundwater levels gwl the main elements are described in this section which lays out models at levels as illustrated in fig 2 level 0 comprises decisions on model structures box 1 level 1 comprises the construction of mms implemented in two phases of training and testing box 2 as well as their applications to set up a random series to replace some of the observation data box 3 level 2 uses bma to combine the mms at level 1 and to quantify inherent uncertainties box 6 2 1 level 0 model structure the approaches used to form the model structure include i an autoregression expression of gwl in terms of its previous values ii forming a set of regression equations and iii their combinations it suffices to state that gwl at t 1 is defined as a function of observation data including gwlt temperature tt river discharge rt groundwater abstraction at precipitation pt see box 1 of fig 2 these variables collectively form the acronym of gtrap and the authors refer to it as a grey box model outlined in section 3 3 a grey box model of this nature is not common in the literature for groundwater problems the authors are developing the approach which is particularly suitable for cases with sparse data see also nadiri et al 2019 these data were provided by west azerbaijan regional water authority wawa the gwls over the basin are influenced by a diverse range of factors and are therefore gwls are expected to be heterogeneous self organised mapping is used to transform heterogeneous gwl records into a number of homogeneous datasets as clusters of observation wells ow 2 2 level 1 multiple models the paper constructs the following mms at level 1 to predict gwl i artificial neural network ann ii sugeno fuzzy logic sfl iii neuro fuzzy nf as these models are now well established it suffices only to specify them to ensure that their implementation are reproducible by a third party these models are implemented in two phases training and testing 2 2 1 artificial neural network ann box 2 in fig 2 anns are now well established bottom up data driven modelling techniques with wide applications in hydrology the ann implementation in the paper is based on classic methodology as described by asce 2000a b hornik et al 1989 haykin 1999 and khatibi et al 2017 applications of ann to the prediction of gwls are cited in table 1 the implementation here comprises a feedforward multi layer perceptron mlp and uses three layers i the input layer which comprise 5 neurons of gwlt and more neurons on account of each ow at any given cluster tt rt at pt trap variables which do not vary across the basin ii the hidden layer for which the number of neurons has to be determined through a trial and error procedure to be presented later and iii the output layer which comprises one neuron gwlt 1 model building activities are processed in two phases i the training phase using levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and ii the testing phase these are expressed as asce 2000a b 1a o j f 1 b j i w ji i i 1b o k f 2 b k i w ji o j where f 1 is the activation function of the hidden layer and f 2 is its activation function of the output layer ii is the i th input oj is the j th output for hidden layer and ok is the k th output for output layer wji and wkj are weights that control the strength of connections between two layers and the biases bj and bk are used to adjust the mean value for input layer and hidden layer respectively in this study the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm is used for the implementation of the backpropagation of the ann model during its training phase 2 2 2 sugeno fuzzy logic sfl box 2 in fig 2 the sugeno fuzzy logic sfl model takagi and sugeno 1985 is selected to form the second member of the mms in this study and their applications for predicting gwls are cited in table 1 the first generation fl based modelling procedure was disadvantaged by relying on a set of prescribed rules whereas sfl shifted the practice toward learning the rule base from the site specific data machine learning and overcame the subjectivity inherent in prescribed rule bases sfl builds on ambiguous boundaries as in the classic fuzzy set theory in contrast to crisp sets gradual transitions are allowed between defined sets and partial membership function ranging from 0 to 1 for more details see pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 and zadeh 1965 the advantage of fuzzy sets is that it copes with imprecision often inherent in hydrogeological parameters the process of implementing the partial membership function involves using different shapes such as triangular gaussian trapezoidal sigmoid s shape and z shape often selected through trial and error at the preliminary stages sfl uses clustering techniques which are available since the 1980 s clustering learns automatically possible structures within the data and subsequently sets out optimum rules it uses subtractive clustering sc by bezdek 1981 and combines with fl which comprises i sc is used to extract fuzzy if then rules chiu 1994 chen and wang 1999 nadiri et al 2013 and ii constant or linear output membership functions referred to as the zero and first order sfl respectively are learned from the data the clustering process is characterised by i the number of rules in sc which is the same as the number of clusters and ii the clustering radius which is identified as a value between 0 and 1 their final output is the weighted average of all rule outputs aggregation as follows bezdek 1981 2a gwl i 1 l w i gwl i i 1 l w i where w i firing strength for the i th rule obtained through the and operator and l number of rules a first order sfl model is implemented to model gwl values through the use of a generalised gaussian function to express membership functions for the five input data each input is clustered into appropriate classes and a set of fuzzy if then rules are derived to linearly aggregate the input data as the output and these use the membership functions for the input data for gwl at t 1 predictions in this study a fuzzy if then rule i can be expressed as 2b rule i

predicting gwls are shown in table 1 thus the integrated nf inference system comprise i a given input dataset as specified above ii an sfl whose mf parameters are tuned using a hybrid algorithm the most compatible method for the construction of nf is the sugeno method using subtractive clustering the architecture of nf in this study comprises a five layer mlp network as follows nadiri et al 2013b layer 1 generate membership function for the input data x gwlt tt rt at pt and the output of neuron i is expressed as 3a o i l 1 μ ji x where l 1 and indicate the layer it is not power and this is also true up to layer 5 as below j is the number of inputs and i is the membership function index μji x is a fuzzy set associated with neuron i given a membership function this study used a

the implementation of nf in this research is referred to as a multiple neuro fuzzy multi nf model since the regular nf produce only one output multi nf incorporates a number of nf arranged in parallel combination to achieve a model architecture with multiple output this architecture is commonly applied in different fields e g turbine runner analysis see saeed et al 2013 optimal design of condenser see huang and yu 2016 but to the best of the authors knowledge this has not been applied to groundwater problems 2 2 4 implementations of models at level 1 the input variables gtrap defined in section 2 1 and to be further detailed in section 3 3 are each associated with uncertainty but the measurement of four of them g t r p variables follow standard best practice procedures and their contribution to model uncertainty are unlikely to be dominant however groundwater abstraction a is a variable that contains significant uncertainty due to the scale of unaccounted abstractions monte carlo simulation mcs was used to generate 4000 random series for groundwater abstraction box 3 in fig 2 mcs employs uniform distribution in the range of the measured values of abstraction and a certain percentage from measured values to account for uncertainty stemming from unaccounted abstractions the range between minimum and maximum unaccounted abstraction for each cluster are given later in table 2 and the allowance is as per recommendation by wawa 2015 these are sufficient to the application of the mms to compensate for the insufficiency of data records 2 3 level 2 bayesian model combination of multiple models boxes 4 7 in fig 2 2 3 1 bayesian theorem and its transformation into an algorithm due to the complexity of the mathematical formulation given below the presentation is first outlined in a simplified form but at the risk of a loss of rigour the results of the three level 1 models in a cluster may be represented as three arrays of m 1 m 2 and m 3 and their individual corresponding datapoints as m 1 m 2 and m 3 rather than using the bayesian theorem to combine these models consider their combination by simple averaging e g 4a m combined m 1 m 2 m 3 3 0 33 m 1 0 33 m 2 0 33 m 3 w 1 m 1 w 2 m 2 w 3 m 3 the simple averaging technique assigns w 1 w 2 w 3 0 333 but instead of prescribed rules the coefficients w 1 w 2 w 3 can be learned from the site specific data e g nadiri et al 2019 as introduced above bayesian statistics provide another strategy as investigated by the paper the law of total probability bma combines n plausible models per cluster as expressed by eq 4b below which is a general form of eq 4a as follows draper 1995 4b pr δ d p 1 n pr δ d m p pr m p d where pr δ d is the probability of the prediction of gwl denoted as δ given the observed gwl denoted as d pr δ d m p is the conditional probability of the predicted quantity given the observed data d and given model m p and pr m p d is the posterior probability of the model which are also known as model weight given the data d see draper 1995 kass and raftery 1995 raftery et al 1997 höting et al 1999 in this study δ represents predicted gwl d denotes observed gwl and m p denotes ann sfl and nf bayesian theorem bma uses the bayesian theorem outlined through the following steps step i the theorem the bayes theorem formulated for bma uses n plausible models m1 m2 mn where each array is one representation of the state variable of predicting gwls and their corresponding observed gwl values at each of the observation well are denoted by d the theorem is detailed by berger 1985 and is expressed as 5a pr m p d pr d m p p r m p j 1 n pr d m j p r m j where pr m p d is the posterior probability which learns a better estimate from the given data p r m p is a prior model probability for the model mp evaluated by expert judgments or estimated e g wöhling et al 2015 and elshall and tsai 2014 pr d m p is marginal likelihood function for model mp step ii algorithms eq 5a is processed for each cluster as follows prior probability p r m p it represents a relative weight of one model against other models before visiting data ye et al 2004 when there is not sufficient reason to prefer one model to another höting et al 1999 and wöhling et al 2015 considered equal priority reasonable natural choice to all models an algorithm for updating prior probabilities are updated to posterior probability given marginal likelihood function also known as bayesian model evidence as per li and tsai 2009 marginal likelihood function is approximated by 5b p r d m p e x p 1 2 bic p 5c w h e r e bic p q p n ln 2 π m p ln n 5d and in turn q p δ d c δ 1 δ d t where n is number of observation well ow in a cluster mp is number of model parameters expressed by eq 7a below qp is the sum of weighted squared errors expressed by eq 5d δ is predicted gwl and d is measured gwl c δ is the variance matrix of prediction errors using monte carlo simulations on model parameters li and tsai 2009 see below eqs 5b 5d are replaced in eq 5a and are manipulated to derive the following 5e pr m p d e x p 1 2 α δ b i c p i 1 n e x p 1 2 α δ b i c p where δbicp bicp bicmin in which bicmin bayesian information criteria is the lowest bic value among the models α is a scaling factor used in the variance window using α 1 leads to occam s window and this results in selecting the unique model as the best model whereas if α 0 the weights for identical models are obtained tsai and li 2008 solved this problem by using a desired significance level in occam s window as a scaling factor to produce the weights of a rational model reference may be made to tsai and li 2008 for selecting a value for the scaling factor li and tsai 2009 recommends bic as it gives an unbiased formulation and computational efficiency it is able to penalise against over parameterisation to ensure model parsimony and it is widely applied published researches are indicative of investigating the performance of bic aic akaike information criteria and kic kashyap information criterion e g see tsai and li 2008 singh et al 2010 tsai and elshall 2013 although liu et al 2016 argue that their outcomes are often contradictory but this shortfall is overcome by using numerical methods such as markov chain monte carlo mcmc method however seeking a solution for this issue is outside the remit of the paper but it is understood that the choice of aic suits complex models with large sample sizes over simple models step iii monte carlo simulations the monte carlo simulation performed by using the uniform probability distribution fitted to abstraction data the paper makes an allowance for over abstraction as recommended by wawa according to which unauthorised abstractions vary up to 0 8 times of measured abstraction uniform probability distribution is used in preference to other types of pdfs due to insufficient data section 4 2 specifies the way for carrying out monte carlo simulation in this study but eq 6 involves c δ and its formulation is outlined as follows as there are three models at level 1 there are three variances σ i 2 per cluster which estimates the variance between observed values and modelled values after the application of the monte carlo simulation c δ per cluster is then expressed as li and tsai 2009 6 c δ σ 1 2 0 0 σ i 2 where σ i 2 is the i th variance 2 3 2 estimating parsimony parameters the number of ai model parameters is often large and adding more parameters increases the simulation accuracy but through overfitting this is one obvious reason for model parsimony and is estimated by using the following equation nadiri et al 2014 heddam et al 2012 7a m p n input n output 1 n hidden layer n o utput a n n n input n output n rule n mf s f l n input n output n mf n input n mf 2 m u l t i n f where mp is number of model parameter ninput noutput are the number of input and output parameters and nhidden layer is number of neurons in the hidden layer nmf represents the number of membership function for each input notably the numbers vary from one cluster to another ye et al 2004 use a parsimony parameter λ and is used in bma which is expressed as 7b λ m p ln n where n is the number of ow in each cluster the number of each of the parameters λ qp bic and posterior quantities may seem to three as 1 per each model at level 1 but this not true the actual number accounts for the number of clusters and this is discussed further in section 4 1 1 2 3 3 estimating uncertainties using bma the bayesian model combines ai models of level 2 using three measures i the model parsimony as expressed by eq 7b ii uncertainties associated with measured abstraction and referred to as within model uncertainty and iii uncertainties between ai models according to the law of total expectation and variance the mean and variance of the predictions are respectively draper 1995 8a e δ d p 1 n e δ d m p p r m p d 8b v a r δ d e m v a r δ d m p v a r m e δ d m p where eq 8a comprises

approx 1000 km2 and overlaps with the aquifer which encompasses the basins of the following main rivers shaharchay nazluchay rozechay and baranduzchay the rivers rise approx along the borders between turkey and iran at the mountain ranges known as mor daghlari with notable mountains of sero silvana movana and ziveh the watercourses flow in the general easterly direction towards lake urmia at the east through urmia plain currently both the rivers and the aquifer suffer encroachments onto their natural states due to the absence of a planning system this has resulted in serious impacts including serious declines in gwls some aspects of which are reported by amirataee and zeinalzadeh 2016 shaharchay passes through the historic city of urmia the provincial capital of west azerbaijan at the centre west of the plain average altitude of the plain is 1320 amsl urmia aquifer is the source for 26 qanats 15 springs and 18 745 pumps where the installation of the latter components goes to the years since 1990 estimates indicate that the extractions were as much as 585 million m3 of water from the aquifer in 2004 2005 the study area is characterised as a semi arid and cold climate based on emberger method 1930 the average annual precipitation at urmia station is 350 mm and its mean annual temperature is 12 c for a 10 year period 2004 2014 record provided by wawa as per iranian meteorological organisation the mean annual relative humidity at urmia city is 58 2004 2014 the aquifer at urmia plain is a single formation layer even though it is crossed by four significant watercourses a report by the wawa 2015 the aquifer is unconfined and comprises heterogeneous alluvial deposits see fig 4 a with high specific yields and a known high quality groundwater which is one of the 12 aquifers around lake urmia the location of 48 ows on the young terraces and gravel plain is shown in fig 4a notably these ows were classified into clusters to treat their heterogeneity using a range of parameters and the study identified 12 clusters by using genetic algorithm self organising map ga som method som is now widely used in hydrology e g hsu et al 2002 and kalteh et al 2008 som study of the study area is being reported separately but the clusters are presented in fig 4b 3 2 data availability gwl monitoring is relatively new and is the responsibility of west azerbaijan water authority wawa the records go back to 2002 and these were obtained in 2015 for carrying out this research works the monitoring network constitutes 71 ows of which 48 are active now with monthly readings of gwl and the available data for the study cover the period of 2002 2015 further data available are the monthly precipitation and daily temperature data both for the period 1967 2015 at the meteorological station in urmia finally daily river discharge data are available for the period of 1967 2015 from 8 stations in the 4 rivers table 2 presents basic statistics of gtrap for each cluster including their mean and variance 3 3 model structure and the dataset a grey box model is developed to prediction gwl in terms of a set of widely available characteristics the input for which are gtrap variables of i one time step lag of gwl time series gwlt 1 expressed in terms of gwlt ii temperature tt iii river discharge rt iv groundwater abstraction at and v precipitation pt these observation data were used to form the dataset for ows in parallel for each cluster and their values for each variable were normalised between 0 and 1 this ensures that one model is fit for each cluster the datasets were prepared by dividing randomly the data within each cluster into two parts as follows 80 was used for the training phase and 20 for the testing phase the measured values of the gtrap independent variables are used in the training and testing phases of the level 1 models however when observation data are prepared for feeding into the level 2 bayesian model the variable a abstraction uses its randomised series generated by the uniform distribution method the assumptions are based on the advice given by wawa according to which the maximum is set to 180 and the minimum to 0 of measured values 3 4 performance measures ai model training testing and results of the four models use the following performance measures i the root mean square error rmse criterion which has the value of 0 for a perfectly fitted model and has no upper limit although the lower the value the better is the performance and ii determination coefficient r 2 with a best value of 1 for the perfectly fitted model but when its value is zero its performance is poor or indicates no correlation 4 result this section presents the results for both the models at level 1 ann sfl and multi nf and the outcomes of the bayesian model at level 2 the section also specifies the decisions made at the stage of preliminary models at the phase of training testing and at their application attention is drawn to the implication of the clustering technique as a result of which each of the four models ann sfl multi nf and the bayesian model are processed as per cluster arranged in parallel and the dataset within each of the 12 clusters are also in parallel 4 1 prediction using ai multiple models at level 1 4 1 1 artificial neural network ann a trial and error procedure was used to select the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the preliminary tests indicated that the architecture of 4 neurons at the hidden layer of all mlp ls models would produce optimum performance metrics the number of neurons for input and output layers depend on number of ows in each cluster consider the example of cluster 1 which contains 4 ows and therefore its architecture is 8 4 4 as follows neurons in the input layer 8 gow1 gow2 gow3 gow4 t r a p neurons in the hidden layer 4 and neurons in the output layer 4 gwlt 1 for ow1 ow2 ow3 and ow4 by the same token the number of input neurons for each cluster depends on the number of its ows table 3 presents performance metrics for each ow and fig 5 exemplifies monthly gwl predictions by ann at 6 selected ows for the 14 years of recorded period the full results presented in supplementary electronic material provide evidence that ann performances are fit for purpose 4 1 2 sugeno fuzzy logic sfl using the subtractive clustering sc method the values of cluster radius and the number of rules were identified by minimising rmse between observed and predicted gwls and these values are presented in table 4 for each cluster the gaussian membership function was used to fit the data using their mean and standard deviation although other functions were also tested table 3 presents the performance metrics for each ow and fig 5 exemplifies the monthly gwl predictions by sfl at the 6 selected ows against their observed gwls for 14 years of the recorded period the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material they provide evidence that the performance of sfl is fit for purpose 4 1 3 multiple neuro fuzzy multi nf the nf model incorporated the same clusters through sc method for input and target datasets as those for sfl the model parameters were estimated through the combination of the backpropagation gradient descent method jang et al 1997 with the least squares method see eq 3d and the gaussian membership functions the nf implementation for the study takes account of multiple ows in each cluster in parallel notably the same model structure is used for all the ows within the same cluster but the inputs and outputs are differentiated as per ow and not as per specific cluster hence and hence multi nf table 3 presents the performance metrics for each ow located in each cluster and fig 5 exemplifies monthly gwl predictions by multi nf for the 6 selected ow for the 14 years of the recorded period the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material they provide evidence that the performance of multi nf is fit for purpose table 3 identifies the most representative best performance and the poorest performing models according to which there is no single model to perform best in all cases and arguably this is a norm that its truth by and large will emerge sooner or later in the modelling culture to defy the notion of superior models overall sfl performs better than nf and it performs better than ann but not as good as sfl generally all three sets of results are fit for purpose 4 2 predictions at level 2 and within model uncertainty using mms at level 1 monte carlo simulations were used in the model application process to generate the predictions by using random series of observation dataset to capture the within model uncertainty however randomisation was not applied to gtrp data not only to the a abstraction data using a randomised series of 4000 datapoints to produce the outputs from the mms at level 1 the 14 years of data records for each gtrp variable at each ow comprises only 168 datapoints whereas predicted abstractions comprise 4000 datapoints this mismatch is dealt with by replicating gtrp variables sequentially to make 4000 datapoints these were fed into the bayesian model at level 2 but without showing prediction results of mms at level 1 the monte carlo simulation of the values of the abstraction variable using the uniform probability distribution required a number of decisions as follows i the minimum values of over abstraction was set to 0 and ii the maximum value was set to 80 greater than the measured value of abstraction as recommended by wawa 2004 owing to the lack of any reliable information on the distribution of this variable sensitivity tests of using other distributions are not justifiable 4 3 results of the bayesian model the bayesian model is implemented in 3 steps as illustrated in boxes 4 6 of fig 2 and their results are elaborated in this section the bma model is implemented as follows i generate the prediction results from the level 1 mms and using monte carlo simulations for the abstraction component box 3 fig 2 ii implement bma by processing eqs 5a 5e and 6 for c δ a n n diagonal matrix for a cluster where n is number of ows located in a cluster iii produce the bayesian predictions per cluster but capable of producing the results for each well as per eq 4b bma learns from site specific data which is expected to reflect the observed values with more accuracy the results presented in tables 3 5 and 6 and fig 5 exemplify prediction time series at 6 selected ows evidently the results are fit for purpose the bayesian model predictions include the three quantities of λ as expressed by eq 7b q p as expressed by eq 5d and measures the joint effect of input parameter uncertainty and between model uncertainty and bic p as expressed by eq 5c for each cluster of ows see also fig 2 box 6 notably it is known that in existing implementations of the bayesian models λ becomes a dominant factor over bic p and q p nadiri et al 2014 and this reduces the contributions of these latter two factors the paper treats this known problem by normalising the number of parameters in each of the mms between 0 and 1 and the production of the actual prediction results in the paper uses this novel treatment to smoothen model runs the values of the above three parameters of λ qp and bic together with the weights are presented in table 5 these in turn are used to produce predicted values of the performance metrics are presented in table 6 according to which the bayesian model performs better than each of the mms at level 1 for 32 ows out of 42 but the level 1 models perform better in the case of the remaining 10 ow notably the paper does not encourage traditional rankings 4 4 inter comparison of the results without any encouragement to rank the performance of the four mms ann sfl nf and bayesian predictions some insight is gained into the result by presenting the performance metrics for each cluster of the four models in table 6 it also shows the values of the weights learned for each model from the measured data as well as the values of the weights for each model at level 1 notably table 6 is a summary of table 3 which the latter presents the performance metrics for each ow the results suggest that there is some discordance between the values of the posterior probabilities and performance metrics of the individual models at level 1 for instance sfl performs better than ann and nf in terms of performance metrics but these do not translate into higher posterior probabilities for sfl this could be attributed to i not using more sophisticated probability distribution function for the monte carlo simulation due to the inherent level of uncertainties but more sophisticated distribution functions are not justifiable ii a general expectation is that locally learned values are often locally optimum values and often are not transferrable to meaningful inferences the overall improvements are deemed to be good enough but further updating is justifiable with more data time plots the above partial view on inter comparison of the mms are based on performance metrics but a further insight emerges when gwl hydrographs are displayed as in fig 6 the obvious observation is that despite some of very good metrics the deviation between observed and modelled results are significant fig 6 shows that an ai model with the highest performance criteria is not the superior model in all time periods and an ai model with the lowest performance criteria is far too good to be rejected for example consider ow 48 at cluster 12 at which sfl is the best model in terms of performance metrics but as it is visible from the figure it performs badly with respect to observed gwl between 95th and 100th months the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material scatters in the results the scale of deviations is more visible in the scatter diagram given in fig 7 the figure exemplifies another reality by showing the scatter diagram of 6 selected ows that the model with highest performance criteria does not provide the best result in all time period and the model with lowest criteria are often fit for purpose a greater visual insight emerges by considering the scatter diagram of the error residuals defined as observed values minus prediction values a sample of 6 ows are shown in fig 8 but the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material these results clearly show the behaviour of each set of the models at each observation well an examination of the full set of results show that the scatters are i narrow at some 24 ows ii medium at some 13 ows iii large at other 13 ows and iv there 5 ows where the scatters seem cluster or complex as the length of time for the recorded data is 14 years this is considered as sufficiently short and not capable of studying them for any pattern on trends highlights the highlights of the overall results presented in this sections are as follows i no single model performs the best in all cases and this confirms table 1 despite the rhetoric of claims on superior models ii performance metrics are useful summaries and together with scatter diagrams they uncover the aspects hidden by performance metrics that the fitted models are hardly perfect iii much clearer insight is obtained by scatter diagram of error residuals and the results show that bma is effective in making the scatters narrower than those of the other models and thereby more robost also there are patterns of behaviour iv overall narrow and medium residuals generally correspond to areas where the decline in water table is considerable ow32 ow34 and ow38 for the narrow scatter ow35 ow31 ow24 for the medium scatter although some ows with this behaviour have mixed scatter see ow36 and ow23 v in the area with weak declines in water table scatters are seen to be narrow medium large or in cluster forms 5 discussion the results presented above clearly show that each set of performance measures reveal some aspects of the problem and therefore one is not a replacement for another but they have to be used side by side for a deeper insight for instance relying on performance metrics of rmse and r 2 reveal that each of the four models investigated in this study are fit for purpose but bma tends to provide narrower error residuals than any other model the strategy based on bma is a two level model management strategy the various practices for which are reviewed in the introduction section and is evidently unlike existing practices of selecting one at the expense of the others the whole procedure gives rise to hierarchically arranged models levels 1 and 2 and renders i it improves modelling accuracy and reliability and ii a learning environment and as such a modelling strategy is not formed for the sake of finding a best model but for learning models are tools of decision making and learning in the following ways theoretical basis for the improvements there are theoretical reasons for improved performances of the model at level 2 compared with the performances of mms at level 1 the reasons are based on cauchy s inequality as presented by chen and lin 2006 kadkhodaie ilkhchi et al 2009 and nadiri et al 2018a however their mathematical treatments are outside the scope of the paper spatial distribution of the improvements bma is capable of quantifying the within model variance owing to producing different predictions as per each model in mms defined by eq 8c and between model variance in terms of assessing the convergence divergence between the results of different models using eq 8d both for the same study the spatial distribution of both variances are presented in fig 9 a c which uses the ordinary kriging ok method to distribute these values the figure shows that i in vast areas of the aquifer under study the data do not show any significant variance ii modelling results are convergent in terms of having low variances associated with between model variances iii central areas of the aquifer under study are prone to both high within model and between model variances and this indicates there are significant divergences in these areas and iv the strong similarity in the distribution of both components of variance is reflected in their total values v the similarity between the total variance and the decline of water table shown in fig 9d is also striking notably fig 9d is the spatial distribution of the results presented in fig 1 and also uses ok to distribute spatially the average declines land use in the central west of the aquifer under study comprises fruit farms with high demands on water supply a further attention is drawn to fig 9 to apparent similarities between fig 9a and 9b past experience on applications of bma to groundwater models are largely based on predicting parameters which derive a single value at sparse spatial locations distributed often by ok using past experience one therefore may expect that considerable differences between the results in fig 9a and 9b however the task in this study is quite different as bma is used to predict time series which are state variables at a set of particular ows therefore similarity between fig 9a and 9b stems from the variance of gwl time series which are inevitably reflected in both between model and within model variances notably the averaged value of between model variance is affected by the gwl variances scope of the strategy based on bma the above results also show that the strategy is suitable as an aquifer management tool aquifer management in the urmia aquifer up to 1990 was based on traditional common rules of the local communities often with a high level of care for the wholesomeness of its water and equitable distributions among the users including tacitly meeting ecological and environmental needs in less than one generation the practice of pumpage undermined the long established tradition the model shows that it is quite feasible to develop a quantitative basis for management in which the decline of water table can be arrested and a new regime of equitable distribution can be worked out by the full participation of the users and a representation of ecological and environmental needs the objectives of the study is not to develop a plan as a research work has no such mandates but to formulate desperately needed tools for planning practices in the future the model developed here can now be applied in various ways for instance scenarios can be formulated to assess impacts of reduced recharge or increased abstraction the immediate plan is to include the aquifer capacity as a variable in the model structure this capacity if feasible would be a quick approach to assess the capacity of aquifers and set the alarms before depleting aquifers reach unrecoverable states management of urmia aquifer urmia aquifer supports the livelihood of a population of more than 1 million and is at the margin of the fertile crescent supporting the livelihood of its population for more than four millennia through the use of the traditional qanat system interwoven into the fabric of its cultural setting since 1990 there was a meteoric change in its irrigation culture as pumps became available the aquifer was a common resource with little regulation to cope with new changes and therefore should sustainable practices not be developed for the aquifer the emergence of the tragedy of the commons is inevitable and fig 9d shows that the process is already underway this is supported by qualitative information obtained from a number of water users that since 2000 the experience of the decline of water table instigated the deepening of the wells this impacted on water table with a further decline and created salinity problems there is no study to take a systemic view of the problems yet whilst water resource planning with public participation is yet to be developed in the country setting the equitable level of abstraction is haphazardly for not being evidence based and thereby defining the level of unauthorised abstractions is a grey area nonetheless a report by the west azerbaijan regional water authority 2016 attributes 80 of abstraction to unauthorised sourced based on the preliminary findings reflected by the paper the emerging full picture is outlined as follows i the decline in water table is not total yet as their sources of replenishment broadly remain unchanged and therefore the adverse situation can be arrested ii any mitigation measure must be sustainable and for this a number of management plans are overdue including basin management plan for the lake urmia basin aquifer management plans for each of the 12 aquifers surrounding lake urmia including urmia aquifer and water cycle studies to ensure that water is equitably distributed among all sectors of water users iii international experience shows that any plan without the participation of water users is likely to fail and therefore aquifer plans ought to define appropriate equitable levels iv extension services are essential to train the water user communities with ways of efficient use of water 6 conclusion a modelling strategy is presented to study urmia aquifer the west azerbaijan province northwest iran due to the absence of any modern aquifer management practices the aquifer is distressed as its water table is in decline based on 14 years of recorded water levels at 48 observation wells ow the modelling strategy for the sparse data incorporates three models which comprise three ai models of artificial neural network ann sugeno fuzzy logic sfl and multiple neuro fuzzy nf a bayesian model averaging bma technique is employed to combine these modelling results where bma improves predictions and provides facilities for quantifying uncertainty the results of the three ai models show that there is no single model performing the best but they have convergences and divergences bma combines these modelling results into a single model in which the combined model is a learning from the convergence and divergence of the ai models and as such it performs better than the individual models most of the time but overwhelmingly reduces the scatters in the error residuals the paper refrains from ranking the models but recommends that the bma medium is used for learning from models the analysis of the results shows that bma is a suitable strategy for an operational aquifer management system and with a more monitoring of water table it can respond to its inherent variations although urmia aquifer is distressed and has come to this state in two decades or so the paper argues that the aquifer is not dry yet and its rainfall patterns remain more or less the same and therefore its past healthy state can be reinstated this will depend on developing appropriate defensible models developing a series of management plans giving high importance to inputs of opinions from the water users through their participation and never compromising the compensation flows for ecological and environmental functioning of the basin acknowledgment the authors would like to thank west azerbaijan regional water authority for their

6678,a modelling strategy is formulated which collectively consists of separate multiple models mm and uses bayesian model averaging bma to combine these mms to learn from data the procedure is at two levels at level 1 three artificial intelligence ai models are constructed which comprise artificial neural network ann sugeno fuzzy logic sfl and multiple neuro fuzzy multi nf but their outputs are directed to bma at the next level at level 2 bma is used to combine ann sfl and multi nf for better predictions and with facilities for quantifying uncertainty the model performance is tested using the data from urmia aquifer in the west azerbaijan province northwest iran where due to the absence of participatory water usage management practices both lake urmia and its surrounding 12 aquifers including the study area are distressed the modelling strategy and its results on urmia aquifer provides an insight to the study area and will be used to investigate ways of arresting the decline in the water table of the aquifer but this should be feasible only by developing a series of management plans including basin management plans aquifer management plans drought plans water cycle studies under such an integrated management system the model developed here is demonstrably well placed to serve as an operational management tool for the aquifer keywords bayesian model averaging distressed

introduction bayesian model averaging bma transformed into a practical tool since draper 1995 and höting et al 1999 is a strategy to combine multiple models mm often constructed by perturbing parameters and to use its capability for assessing inherent uncertainties this paper investigates performances of bma by combining separate mms comprising three different artificial intelligence ai techniques for predicting groundwater level gwl of urmia aquifer the strategy is notable for coping with sparse data as the case is for urmia aquifer and for providing an insight into the state of the aquifer and its declining gwls during the 14 years of its record the study touches on the broader context of the problem where lake urmia is in a distressed state since 2000 due to overambitious embankment dams and this is paralleled by over abstractions of its aquifers fig 1 compares the decline in lake urmia water level a decline of 0 3 m year with declining gwl in urmia aquifer an approx decline of 0 2 m year where both declines are attributable to the absence of any policy or poor policies at both national and regional levels the paper aims to gain an insight into the problem as the economic vibrancy of the population at the fertile urmia plain depends on maintaining the integrity of the high quality of the aquifer model combination is a topical research and includes i ensemble modelling often using mms by perturbing parameters see clemen 1989 for a comprehensive review and cloke and pappenberger 2009 for a review on meteorological forecasting ii applications of bma in various disciplines since the works by draper 1995 and as elaborated by höting et al 1999 and iii the authors research activities in hydrology and geohydrology often use an ai model to combine mms aimm e g see nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a these model combination streams of activities are flanked by a traditional research practice in which mms are used but with the goal of comparing the performances of an innovative model with the performances of traditional mms the goal in traditional practices is to identify a superior model and this normally concludes with confirming the superiority of the innovative model by using anecdotal evidence and without statistical tests the authors use various aimm strategies and show significant improvements e g see nadiri et al 2019 the bayesian paradigm gained popularity since the middle of the 20th century whereas traditional model inter comparison studies available since the early 20th century employ frequentist paradigms in one way or another see jeffreys 1961 newman and wierenga 2003 introduced bma to combine a number of conceptual groundwater models for flow and transport equations tsai and li 2008 developed a new framework to address uncertainty associated with inverse groundwater modelling for hydraulic conductivity estimation further applications include gwl prediction li and tsai 2009 using a conceptual model groundwater management under uncertainty to mitigate saltwater intrusion tsai 2010 hierarchical bma hbma was applied to groundwater remediation designs to assess impacts of individual sources of uncertainty chitsazan and tsai 2014 2015 also chitsazan et al 2015 quantified uncertainty in different ann models by hbma mathematical models and input data to predict fluoride concentration in groundwater whilst bma is a natural model combination strategy it is fused in the paper with the model combination strategies based on the author s aimm strategy for bottom up data driven techniques applications of artificial intelligence ai techniques without model combination are outlined in table 1 which categorises various applications to groups research in group 1 uses a single ai model but applies it to diverse case studies such as gwl prediction in karstic and leaky aquifers coppola et al 2005 trichakis et al 2011 gwl prediction in freshwater swamp forests sun et al 2016 and gwl prediction in an unconfined aquifer sadeghfam et al 2018 research in group 2 table 1 uses ai with mms for gwl predictions using the same data which often share the same goal of selecting a superior model as shown in table 2 bazartseren et al 2003 use two such ai models and report that both models are accurate for a longer gwl prediction horizon alvisi et al 2006 also use two ai models and report that sugeno fuzzy logic sfl and mamdani fuzzy logic mfl perform slightly better than that by artificial neural network ann model in terms of rmse shiri et al 2013 employ gene expression programming gep and report it to be more successful than other ai models used in their tests for gwl predictions the choice of models on groundwater problems is vast and broadly comprise i process based theoretical empirical modelling capabilities such as modflow mt3d but are data intensive and computationally expensive or ii data driven bottom up modelling capabilities such as ai techniques which only use local data and still offer computationally cost effective prediction capabilities notably the combination of these two capabilities are referred to as conceptual models but are not detailed here for brevity owing to the sparsity of data and limited budget ai techniques are natural choices for the study also nadiri et al 2019 discuss the mathematical foundation for combining mms according to which model combination even by simple averaging improves the average of the combined model compared with the individual models the techniques based on process based modelling capabilities are precluded from this study but three commonly used ai models are selected to be combined by bma to improve on their accuracy an overview of table 1 provides a clear evidence that there is no superior model thus such a selection is at the expense of discarding information contained in the remaining models often by attaching a lower status the present paper is critical of choosing a superior or a single model at the expense of other models as emphasised by khatibi et al 2011a 2011b 2013 2014 2017 traditional model selection practices overlook the opportunity to learn from the convergence and divergences among mms and they only provide anecdotal evidence for identifying the superiority of a model but in reality they are just fit for purpose one approach to minimise the loss of information is to formalise the model selection procedure for instance khatibi et al 2003 tilford et al 2005 and hawkes et al 2005 discuss a risk based approach to model selection whereas li and tsai 2009 discuss a bayesian model selection bms based on bayesian model evidence for selecting the best model and argue that the best model does not guarantee better prediction also tsai and li 2008 argue that bma provides robust results than bms notably both bms and bma use posterior probability to rank models link and barker 2006 without testing the statistical significance of the superiority of a model investigating bma to combine ai models is a viable case for research the two streams of research reviewed above share the goal of model combination but those accounted by group 2 in table 1 require a strategy for model combination for a greater efficacy in modelling the authors avoid ranking individual models for selecting a best superior model but promote learning from mms through formulating a modelling strategy e g see nadiri et al 2014 2018a 2018b and khatibi et al 2017 2018a b ghorbani et al 2018 the capability to learn from mms is implemented through formulating strategies in which they are arranged at two levels at level 1 a set of models are developed which are artificial neural network sugeno fuzzy logic neuro fuzzy by employing their best practice procedure but for the purpose of producing inputs to the next level at level 2 a model is used to combine level 1 models the inputs of which are based on the outputs of level 1 models the model combination strategy used here is based on bma the only model combination strategy based on aimm for gwl modelling is reported by nadiri et al 2019 they formulate several strategies including one by simple averaging of mms and confirm the published literature by showing that the root mean square errors rmse of the combined model is less than the mean of the rmse of the individual models this is a confirmation that even simple averaging improves accuracy the objective is to predict the water table gwl for the urmia aquifer by combining ai models using bma the paper applyes bma to combine different ai models for predicting gwls and to the best knowledge of the authors bma combining mms of ai has not been investigated for the prediction of gwl also the model structure for prediction has novelty but this is explained in due course the procedure involves intrinsically a capability for estimating uncertainty attention is drawn to a possible mismatch of terminology on observed input data as used in bayesian statistics where these may be used as input data in ai modelling practices both terms are used interchangeably in the paper 2 methodology an overview of the methodology is outlined in fig 2 as a flowchart which depicts the main elements of using bma to learn from mms for predicting groundwater levels gwl the main elements are described in this section which lays out models at levels as illustrated in fig 2 level 0 comprises decisions on model structures box 1 level 1 comprises the construction of mms implemented in two phases of training and testing box 2 as well as their applications to set up a random series to replace some of the observation data box 3 level 2 uses bma to combine the mms at level 1 and to quantify inherent uncertainties box 6 2 1 level 0 model structure the approaches used to form the model structure include i an autoregression expression of gwl in terms of its previous values ii forming a set of regression equations and iii their combinations it suffices to state that gwl at t 1 is defined as a function of observation data including gwlt temperature tt river discharge rt groundwater abstraction at precipitation pt see box 1 of fig 2 these variables collectively form the acronym of gtrap and the authors refer to it as a grey box model outlined in section 3 3 a grey box model of this nature is not common in the literature for groundwater problems the authors are developing the approach which is particularly suitable for cases with sparse data see also nadiri et al 2019 these data were provided by west azerbaijan regional water authority wawa the gwls over the basin are influenced by a diverse range of factors and are therefore gwls are expected to be heterogeneous self organised mapping is used to transform heterogeneous gwl records into a number of homogeneous datasets as clusters of observation wells ow 2 2 level 1 multiple models the paper constructs the following mms at level 1 to predict gwl i artificial neural network ann ii sugeno fuzzy logic sfl iii neuro fuzzy nf as these models are now well established it suffices only to specify them to ensure that their implementation are reproducible by a third party these models are implemented in two phases training and testing 2 2 1 artificial neural network ann box 2 in fig 2 anns are now well established bottom up data driven modelling techniques with wide applications in hydrology the ann implementation in the paper is based on classic methodology as described by asce 2000a b hornik et al 1989 haykin 1999 and khatibi et al 2017 applications of ann to the prediction of gwls are cited in table 1 the implementation here comprises a feedforward multi layer perceptron mlp and uses three layers i the input layer which comprise 5 neurons of gwlt and more neurons on account of each ow at any given cluster tt rt at pt trap variables which do not vary across the basin ii the hidden layer for which the number of neurons has to be determined through a trial and error procedure to be presented later and iii the output layer which comprises one neuron gwlt 1 model building activities are processed in two phases i the training phase using levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and ii the testing phase these are expressed as asce 2000a b 1a o j f 1 b j i w ji i i 1b o k f 2 b k i w ji o j where f 1 is the activation function of the hidden layer and f 2 is its activation function of the output layer ii is the i th input oj is the j th output for hidden layer and ok is the k th output for output layer wji and wkj are weights that control the strength of connections between two layers and the biases bj and bk are used to adjust the mean value for input layer and hidden layer respectively in this study the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm is used for the implementation of the backpropagation of the ann model during its training phase 2 2 2 sugeno fuzzy logic sfl box 2 in fig 2 the sugeno fuzzy logic sfl model takagi and sugeno 1985 is selected to form the second member of the mms in this study and their applications for predicting gwls are cited in table 1 the first generation fl based modelling procedure was disadvantaged by relying on a set of prescribed rules whereas sfl shifted the practice toward learning the rule base from the site specific data machine learning and overcame the subjectivity inherent in prescribed rule bases sfl builds on ambiguous boundaries as in the classic fuzzy set theory in contrast to crisp sets gradual transitions are allowed between defined sets and partial membership function ranging from 0 to 1 for more details see pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 and zadeh 1965 the advantage of fuzzy sets is that it copes with imprecision often inherent in hydrogeological parameters the process of implementing the partial membership function involves using different shapes such as triangular gaussian trapezoidal sigmoid s shape and z shape often selected through trial and error at the preliminary stages sfl uses clustering techniques which are available since the 1980 s clustering learns automatically possible structures within the data and subsequently sets out optimum rules it uses subtractive clustering sc by bezdek 1981 and combines with fl which comprises i sc is used to extract fuzzy if then rules chiu 1994 chen and wang 1999 nadiri et al 2013 and ii constant or linear output membership functions referred to as the zero and first order sfl respectively are learned from the data the clustering process is characterised by i the number of rules in sc which is the same as the number of clusters and ii the clustering radius which is identified as a value between 0 and 1 their final output is the weighted average of all rule outputs aggregation as follows bezdek 1981 2a gwl i 1 l w i gwl i i 1 l w i where w i firing strength for the i th rule obtained through the and operator and l number of rules a first order sfl model is implemented to model gwl values through the use of a generalised gaussian function to express membership functions for the five input data each input is clustered into appropriate classes and a set of fuzzy if then rules are derived to linearly aggregate the input data as the output and these use the membership functions for the input data for gwl at t 1 predictions in this study a fuzzy if then rule i can be expressed as 2b rule i gwl b e l o n g s t o m f gwl i t b e l o n g s t o m f t i r b e l o n g s t o m f r i p b e l o n g s t o m f p i e b e l o n g s t o m f e i t h e n gwl i 1 m i g w l n i t p i r u i a q i p c i where gwl i 1 output of rule i mfi gwl membership function of the i th cluster of input gwl mf i t membership function of the i th cluster of input t mf i r membership function of the i th cluster of input r mf i a membership function of the i th cluster of input a mf i p membership function of the i th cluster of input p and mi ni pi qi ui and ci coefficients to be determined by the linear least squares estimation 2 2 3 multiple neuro fuzzy multi nf box 2 in fig 2 neuro fuzzy models integrate anns with fuzzy logic and therefore fuzzy inference rules are handled by ann their applications to predicting gwls are shown in table 1 thus the integrated nf inference system comprise i a given input dataset as specified above ii an sfl whose mf parameters are tuned using a hybrid algorithm the most compatible method for the construction of nf is the sugeno method using subtractive clustering the architecture of nf in this study comprises a five layer mlp network as follows nadiri et al 2013b layer 1 generate membership function for the input data x gwlt tt rt at pt and the output of neuron i is expressed as 3a o i l 1 μ ji x where l 1 and indicate the layer it is not power and this is also true up to layer 5 as below j is the number of inputs and i is the membership function index μji x is a fuzzy set associated with neuron i given a membership function this study used a generalised gaussian function for the mf function which was identified through a trial and error procedure layer 2 calculate firing strength wi for the i th rule via the multiplication rule 3b o i l 2

i l 5 g w l i w i gwl i the nf parameters in eq 3d and mf parameters are estimated using a hybrid algorithm in this study which is a combination of the gradient descent and the least squares method the implementation of nf in this research is referred to as a multiple neuro fuzzy multi nf model since the regular nf produce only one output multi nf incorporates a number of nf arranged in parallel combination to achieve a model architecture with multiple output this architecture is commonly applied in different fields e g turbine runner analysis see saeed et al 2013 optimal design of condenser see huang and yu 2016 but to the best of the authors knowledge this has not been applied to groundwater problems 2 2 4 implementations of models at level 1 the input variables gtrap defined in section 2 1 and to be further detailed in section 3 3 are each associated with uncertainty but the measurement of four of them g t r p variables follow standard best practice procedures and their contribution to model uncertainty are unlikely to be dominant however groundwater abstraction a is a variable that contains significant uncertainty due to the scale of unaccounted abstractions monte carlo simulation mcs was used to generate 4000 random series for groundwater abstraction box 3 in fig 2 mcs employs uniform distribution in the range of the measured values of abstraction and a certain percentage from measured values to account for uncertainty stemming from unaccounted abstractions the range between minimum and maximum unaccounted abstraction for each cluster are given later in table 2 and the allowance is as per recommendation by wawa 2015 these are sufficient to the application of the mms to compensate for the insufficiency of data records 2 3 level 2 bayesian model combination of multiple models boxes 4 7 in fig 2 2 3 1 bayesian theorem and its transformation into an algorithm due to the complexity of the mathematical formulation given below the presentation is first outlined in a simplified form but at the risk of a loss of rigour the results of the three level 1 models in a cluster may be represented as three arrays of m 1 m 2 and m 3 and their individual corresponding datapoints as m 1 m 2 and m 3 rather than using the bayesian theorem to combine these models consider their combination by simple averaging e g 4a m combined m 1 m 2 m 3 3 0 33 m 1 0 33 m 2 0 33 m 3 w 1 m 1 w 2 m 2 w 3 m 3 the simple averaging technique assigns w 1 w 2 w 3 0 333 but instead of prescribed rules the coefficients w 1 w 2 w 3 can be learned from the site specific data e g nadiri et al 2019 as introduced above bayesian statistics provide another strategy as investigated by the paper the law of total probability bma combines n plausible models per cluster as expressed by eq 4b below which is a general form of eq 4a as follows draper 1995 4b pr δ d p 1 n pr δ d m p pr m p d where pr δ d is the probability of the prediction of gwl denoted as δ given the observed gwl denoted as d pr δ d m p is the conditional probability of the predicted quantity given the observed data d and given model m p and pr m p d is the posterior probability of the model which are also known as model weight given the data d see draper 1995 kass and raftery 1995 raftery et al 1997 höting et al 1999 in this study δ represents predicted gwl d denotes observed gwl and m p denotes ann sfl and nf bayesian theorem bma uses the bayesian theorem outlined through the following steps step i the theorem the bayes theorem formulated for bma uses n plausible models m1 m2 mn where each array is one representation of the state variable of predicting gwls and their corresponding observed gwl values at each of the observation well are denoted by d the theorem is detailed by berger 1985 and is expressed as 5a pr m p d pr d m p p r m p j 1 n pr d m j p r m j where pr m p d is the posterior probability which learns a better estimate from the given data p r m p is a prior model probability for the model mp evaluated by expert judgments or estimated e g wöhling et al 2015 and elshall and tsai 2014 pr d m p is marginal likelihood function for model mp step ii algorithms eq 5a is processed for each cluster as follows prior probability p r m p it represents a relative weight of one model against other models before visiting data ye et al 2004 when there is not sufficient reason to prefer one model to another höting et al 1999 and wöhling et al 2015 considered equal priority reasonable natural choice to all models an algorithm for updating prior probabilities are updated to posterior probability given marginal likelihood function also known as bayesian model evidence as per li and tsai 2009 marginal likelihood function is approximated by 5b p r d m p e x p 1 2 bic p 5c w h e r e bic p q p n ln 2 π m p ln n 5d and in turn q p δ d c δ 1 δ d t where n is number of observation well ow in a cluster mp is number of model parameters expressed by eq 7a below qp is the sum of weighted squared errors expressed by eq 5d δ is predicted gwl and d is measured gwl c δ is the variance matrix of prediction errors using monte carlo simulations on model parameters li and tsai 2009 see below eqs 5b 5d are replaced in eq 5a and are manipulated to derive the following 5e pr m p d e x p 1 2 α δ b i c p i 1 n e x p 1 2 α δ b i c p where δbicp bicp bicmin in which bicmin bayesian information criteria is the lowest bic value among the models α is a scaling factor used in the variance window using α 1 leads to occam s window and this results in selecting the unique model as the best model whereas if α 0 the weights for identical models are obtained tsai and li 2008 solved this problem by using a desired significance level in occam s window as a scaling factor to produce the weights of a rational model reference may be made to tsai and li 2008 for selecting a value for the scaling factor li and tsai 2009 recommends bic as it gives an unbiased formulation and computational efficiency it is able to penalise against over parameterisation to ensure model parsimony and it is widely applied published researches are indicative of investigating the performance of bic aic akaike information criteria and kic kashyap information criterion e g see tsai and li 2008 singh et al 2010 tsai and elshall 2013 although liu et al 2016 argue that their outcomes are often contradictory but this shortfall is overcome by using numerical methods such as markov chain monte carlo mcmc method however seeking a solution for this issue is outside the remit of the paper but it is understood that the choice of aic suits complex models with large sample sizes over simple models step iii monte carlo simulations the monte carlo simulation performed by using the uniform probability distribution fitted to abstraction data the paper makes an allowance for over abstraction as recommended by wawa according to which unauthorised abstractions vary up to 0 8 times of measured abstraction uniform probability distribution is used in preference to other types of pdfs due to insufficient data section 4 2 specifies the way for carrying out monte carlo simulation in this study but eq 6 involves c δ and its formulation is outlined as follows as there are three models at level 1 there are three variances σ i 2 per cluster which estimates the variance between observed values and modelled values after the application of the monte carlo simulation c δ per cluster is then expressed as li and tsai 2009 6 c δ σ 1 2 0 0 σ i 2 where σ i 2 is the i th variance 2 3 2 estimating parsimony parameters the number of ai model parameters is often large and adding more parameters increases the simulation accuracy but through overfitting this is one obvious reason for model parsimony and is estimated by using the following equation nadiri et al 2014 heddam et al 2012 7a m p n input n output 1 n hidden layer n o utput a n n n input n output n rule n mf s f l n input n output n mf n input n mf 2 m u l t i n f where mp is number of model parameter ninput noutput are the number of input and output parameters and nhidden layer is number of neurons in the hidden layer nmf represents the number of membership function for each input notably the numbers vary from one cluster to another ye et al 2004 use a parsimony parameter λ and is used in bma which is expressed as 7b λ m p ln n where n is the number of ow in each cluster the number of each of the parameters λ qp bic and posterior quantities may seem to three as 1 per each model at level 1 but this not true the actual number accounts for the number of clusters and this is discussed further in section 4 1 1 2 3 3 estimating uncertainties using bma the bayesian model combines ai models of level 2 using three measures i the model parsimony as expressed by eq 7b ii uncertainties associated with measured abstraction and referred to as within model uncertainty and iii uncertainties between ai models according to the law of total expectation and variance the mean and variance of the predictions are respectively draper 1995 8a e δ d p 1 n e δ d m p p r m p d 8b v a r δ d e m v a r δ d m p v a r m e δ d m p where eq 8a comprises

approx 1000 km2 and overlaps with the aquifer which encompasses the basins of the following main rivers shaharchay nazluchay rozechay and baranduzchay the rivers rise approx along the borders between turkey and iran at the mountain ranges known as mor daghlari with notable mountains of sero silvana movana and ziveh the watercourses flow in the general easterly direction towards lake urmia at the east through urmia plain currently both the rivers and the aquifer suffer encroachments onto their natural states due to the absence of a planning system this has resulted in serious impacts including serious declines in gwls some aspects of which are reported by amirataee and zeinalzadeh 2016 shaharchay passes through the historic city of urmia the provincial capital of west azerbaijan at the centre west of the plain average altitude of the plain is 1320 amsl urmia aquifer is the source for 26 qanats 15 springs and 18 745 pumps where the installation of the latter components goes to the years since 1990 estimates indicate that the extractions were as much as 585 million m3 of water from the aquifer in 2004 2005 the study area is characterised as a semi arid and cold climate based on emberger method 1930 the average annual precipitation at urmia station is 350 mm and its mean annual temperature is 12 c for a 10 year period 2004 2014 record provided by wawa as per iranian meteorological organisation the mean annual relative humidity at urmia city is 58 2004 2014 the aquifer at urmia plain is a single formation layer even though it is crossed by four significant watercourses a report by the wawa 2015 the aquifer is unconfined and comprises heterogeneous alluvial deposits see fig 4 a with high specific yields and a known high quality groundwater which is one of the 12 aquifers around lake urmia the location of 48 ows on the young terraces and gravel plain is shown in fig 4a notably these ows were classified into clusters to treat their heterogeneity using a range of parameters and the study identified 12 clusters by using genetic algorithm self organising map ga som method som is now widely used in hydrology e g hsu et al 2002 and kalteh et al 2008 som study of the study area is being reported separately but the clusters are presented in fig 4b 3 2 data availability gwl monitoring is relatively new and is the responsibility of west azerbaijan water authority wawa the records go back to 2002 and these were obtained in 2015 for carrying out this research works the monitoring network constitutes 71 ows of which 48 are active now with monthly readings of gwl and the available data for the study cover the period of 2002 2015 further data available are the monthly precipitation and daily temperature data both for the period 1967 2015 at the meteorological station in urmia finally daily river discharge data are available for the period of 1967 2015 from 8 stations in the 4 rivers table 2 presents basic statistics of gtrap for each cluster including their mean and variance 3 3 model structure and the dataset a grey box model is developed to prediction gwl in terms of a set of widely available characteristics the input for which are gtrap variables of i one time step lag of gwl time series gwlt 1 expressed in terms of gwlt ii temperature tt iii river discharge rt iv groundwater abstraction at and v precipitation pt these observation data were used to form the dataset for ows in parallel for each cluster and their values for each variable were normalised between 0 and 1 this ensures that one model is fit for each cluster the datasets were prepared by dividing randomly the data within each cluster into two parts as follows 80 was used for the training phase and 20 for the testing phase the measured values of the gtrap independent variables are used in the training and testing phases of the level 1 models however when observation data are prepared for feeding into the level 2 bayesian model the variable a abstraction uses its randomised series generated by the uniform distribution method the assumptions are based on the advice given by wawa according to which the maximum is set to 180 and the minimum to 0 of measured values 3 4 performance measures ai model training testing and results of the four models use the following performance measures i the root mean square error rmse criterion which has the value of 0 for a perfectly fitted model and has no upper limit although the lower the value the better is the performance and ii determination coefficient r 2 with a best value of 1 for the perfectly fitted model but when its value is zero its performance is poor or indicates no correlation 4 result this section presents the results for both the models at level 1 ann sfl and multi nf and the outcomes of the bayesian model at level 2 the section also specifies the decisions made at the stage of preliminary models at the phase of training testing and at their application attention is drawn to the implication of the clustering technique as a result of which each of the four models ann sfl multi nf and the bayesian model are processed as per cluster arranged in parallel and the dataset within each of the 12 clusters are also in parallel 4 1 prediction using ai multiple models at level 1 4 1 1 artificial neural network ann a trial and error procedure was used to select the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the preliminary tests indicated that the architecture of 4 neurons at the hidden layer of all mlp ls models would produce optimum performance metrics the number of neurons for input and output layers depend on number of ows in each cluster consider the example of cluster 1 which contains 4 ows and therefore its architecture is 8 4 4 as follows neurons in the input layer 8 gow1 gow2 gow3 gow4 t r a p neurons in the hidden layer 4 and neurons in the output layer 4 gwlt 1 for ow1 ow2 ow3 and ow4 by the same token the number of input neurons for each cluster depends on the number of its ows table 3 presents performance metrics for each ow and fig 5 exemplifies monthly gwl predictions by ann at 6 selected ows for the 14 years of recorded period the full results presented in supplementary electronic material provide evidence that ann performances are fit for purpose 4 1 2 sugeno fuzzy logic sfl using the subtractive clustering sc method the values of cluster radius and the number of rules were identified by minimising rmse between observed and predicted gwls and these values are presented in table 4 for each cluster the gaussian membership function was used to fit the data using their mean and standard deviation although other functions were also tested table 3 presents the performance metrics for each ow and fig 5 exemplifies the monthly gwl predictions by sfl at the 6 selected ows against their observed gwls for 14 years of the recorded period the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material they provide evidence that the performance of sfl is fit for purpose 4 1 3 multiple neuro fuzzy multi nf the nf model incorporated the same clusters through sc method for input and target datasets as those for sfl the model parameters were estimated through the combination of the backpropagation gradient descent method jang et al 1997 with the least squares method see eq 3d and the gaussian membership functions the nf implementation for the study takes account of multiple ows in each cluster in parallel notably the same model structure is used for all the ows within the same cluster but the inputs and outputs are differentiated as per ow and not as per specific cluster hence and hence multi nf table 3 presents the performance metrics for each ow located in each cluster and fig 5 exemplifies monthly gwl predictions by multi nf for the 6 selected ow for the 14 years of the recorded period the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material they provide evidence that the performance of multi nf is fit for purpose table 3 identifies the most representative best performance and the poorest performing models according to which there is no single model to perform best in all cases and arguably this is a norm that its truth by and large will emerge sooner or later in the modelling culture to defy the notion of superior models overall sfl performs better than nf and it performs better than ann but not as good as sfl generally all three sets of results are fit for purpose 4 2 predictions at level 2 and within model uncertainty using mms at level 1 monte carlo simulations were used in the model application process to generate the predictions by using random series of observation dataset to capture the within model uncertainty however randomisation was not applied to gtrp data not only to the a abstraction data using a randomised series of 4000 datapoints to produce the outputs from the mms at level 1 the 14 years of data records for each gtrp variable at each ow comprises only 168 datapoints whereas predicted abstractions comprise 4000 datapoints this mismatch is dealt with by replicating gtrp variables sequentially to make 4000 datapoints these were fed into the bayesian model at level 2 but without showing prediction results of mms at level 1 the monte carlo simulation of the values of the abstraction variable using the uniform probability distribution required a number of decisions as follows i the minimum values of over abstraction was set to 0 and ii the maximum value was set to 80 greater than the measured value of abstraction as recommended by wawa 2004 owing to the lack of any reliable information on the distribution of this variable sensitivity tests of using other distributions are not justifiable 4 3 results of the bayesian model the bayesian model is implemented in 3 steps as illustrated in boxes 4 6 of fig 2 and their results are elaborated in this section the bma model is implemented as follows i generate the prediction results from the level 1 mms and using monte carlo simulations for the abstraction component box 3 fig 2 ii implement bma by processing eqs 5a 5e and 6 for c δ a n n diagonal matrix for a cluster where n is number of ows located in a cluster iii produce the bayesian predictions per cluster but capable of producing the results for each well as per eq 4b bma learns from site specific data which is expected to reflect the observed values with more accuracy the results presented in tables 3 5 and 6 and fig 5 exemplify prediction time series at 6 selected ows evidently the results are fit for purpose the bayesian model predictions include the three quantities of λ as expressed by eq 7b q p as expressed by eq 5d and measures the joint effect of input parameter uncertainty and between model uncertainty and bic p as expressed by eq 5c for each cluster of ows see also fig 2 box 6 notably it is known that in existing implementations of the bayesian models λ becomes a dominant factor over bic p and q p nadiri et al 2014 and this reduces the contributions of these latter two factors the paper treats this known problem by normalising the number of parameters in each of the mms between 0 and 1 and the production of the actual prediction results in the paper uses this novel treatment to smoothen model runs the values of the above three parameters of λ qp and bic together with the weights are presented in table 5 these in turn are used to produce predicted values of the performance metrics are presented in table 6 according to which the bayesian model performs better than each of the mms at level 1 for 32 ows out of 42 but the level 1 models perform better in the case of the remaining 10 ow notably the paper does not encourage traditional rankings 4 4 inter comparison of the results without any encouragement to rank the performance of the four mms ann sfl nf and bayesian predictions some insight is gained into the result by presenting the performance metrics for each cluster of the four models in table 6 it also shows the values of the weights learned for each model from the measured data as well as the values of the weights for each model at level 1 notably table 6 is a summary of table 3 which the latter presents the performance metrics for each ow the results suggest that there is some discordance between the values of the posterior probabilities and performance metrics of the individual models at level 1 for instance sfl performs better than ann and nf in terms of performance metrics but these do not translate into higher posterior probabilities for sfl this could be attributed to i not using more sophisticated probability distribution function for the monte carlo simulation due to the inherent level of uncertainties but more sophisticated distribution functions are not justifiable ii a general expectation is that locally learned values are often locally optimum values and often are not transferrable to meaningful inferences the overall improvements are deemed to be good enough but further updating is justifiable with more data time plots the above partial view on inter comparison of the mms are based on performance metrics but a further insight emerges when gwl hydrographs are displayed as in fig 6 the obvious observation is that despite some of very good metrics the deviation between observed and modelled results are significant fig 6 shows that an ai model with the highest performance criteria is not the superior model in all time periods and an ai model with the lowest performance criteria is far too good to be rejected for example consider ow 48 at cluster 12 at which sfl is the best model in terms of performance metrics but as it is visible from the figure it performs badly with respect to observed gwl between 95th and 100th months the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material scatters in the results the scale of deviations is more visible in the scatter diagram given in fig 7 the figure exemplifies another reality by showing the scatter diagram of 6 selected ows that the model with highest performance criteria does not provide the best result in all time period and the model with lowest criteria are often fit for purpose a greater visual insight emerges by considering the scatter diagram of the error residuals defined as observed values minus prediction values a sample of 6 ows are shown in fig 8 but the full set of the results are presented in supplementary electronic material these results clearly show the behaviour of each set of the models at each observation well an examination of the full set of results show that the scatters are i narrow at some 24 ows ii medium at some 13 ows iii large at other 13 ows and iv there 5 ows where the scatters seem cluster or complex as the length of time for the recorded data is 14 years this is considered as sufficiently short and not capable of studying them for any pattern on trends highlights the highlights of the overall results presented in this sections are as follows i no single model performs the best in all cases and this confirms table 1 despite the rhetoric of claims on superior models ii performance metrics are useful summaries and together with scatter diagrams they uncover the aspects hidden by performance metrics that the fitted models are hardly perfect iii much clearer insight is obtained by scatter diagram of error residuals and the results show that bma is effective in making the scatters narrower than those of the other models and thereby more robost also there are patterns of behaviour iv overall narrow and medium residuals generally correspond to areas where the decline in water table is considerable ow32 ow34 and ow38 for the narrow scatter ow35 ow31 ow24 for the medium scatter although some ows with this behaviour have mixed scatter see ow36 and ow23 v in the area with weak declines in water table scatters are seen to be narrow medium large or in cluster forms 5 discussion the results presented above clearly show that each set of performance measures reveal some aspects of the problem and therefore one is not a replacement for another but they have to be used side by side for a deeper insight for instance relying on performance metrics of rmse and r 2 reveal that each of the four models investigated in this study are fit for purpose but bma tends to provide narrower error residuals than any other model the strategy based on bma is a two level model management strategy the various practices for which are reviewed in the introduction section and is evidently unlike existing practices of selecting one at the expense of the others the whole procedure gives rise to hierarchically arranged models levels 1 and 2 and renders i it improves modelling accuracy and reliability and ii a learning environment and as such a modelling strategy is not formed for the sake of finding a best model but for learning models are tools of decision making and learning in the following ways theoretical basis for the improvements there are theoretical reasons for improved performances of the model at level 2 compared with the performances of mms at level 1 the reasons are based on cauchy s inequality as presented by chen and lin 2006 kadkhodaie ilkhchi et al 2009 and nadiri et al 2018a however their mathematical treatments are outside the scope of the paper spatial distribution of the improvements bma is capable of quantifying the within model variance owing to producing different predictions as per each model in mms defined by eq 8c and between model variance in terms of assessing the convergence divergence between the results of different models using eq 8d both for the same study the spatial distribution of both variances are presented in fig 9 a c which uses the ordinary kriging ok method to distribute these values the figure shows that i in vast areas of the aquifer under study the data do not show any significant variance ii modelling results are convergent in terms of having low variances associated with between model variances iii central areas of the aquifer under study are prone to both high within model and between model variances and this indicates there are significant divergences in these areas and iv the strong similarity in the distribution of both components of variance is reflected in their total values v the similarity between the total variance and the decline of water table shown in fig 9d is also striking notably fig 9d is the spatial distribution of the results presented in fig 1 and also uses ok to distribute spatially the average declines land use in the central west of the aquifer under study comprises fruit farms with high demands on water supply a further attention is drawn to fig 9 to apparent similarities between fig 9a and 9b past experience on applications of bma to groundwater models are largely based on predicting parameters which derive a single value at sparse spatial locations distributed often by ok using past experience one therefore may expect that considerable differences between the results in fig 9a and 9b however the task in this study is quite different as bma is used to predict time series which are state variables at a set of particular ows therefore similarity between fig 9a and 9b stems from the variance of gwl time series which are inevitably reflected in both between model and within model variances notably the averaged value of between model variance is affected by the gwl variances scope of the strategy based on bma the above results also show that the strategy is suitable as an aquifer management tool aquifer management in the urmia aquifer up to 1990 was based on traditional common rules of the local communities often with a high level of care for the wholesomeness of its water and equitable distributions among the users including tacitly meeting ecological and environmental needs in less than one generation the practice of pumpage undermined the long established tradition the model shows that it is quite feasible to develop a quantitative basis for management in which the decline of water table can be arrested and a new regime of equitable distribution can be worked out by the full participation of the users and a representation of ecological and environmental needs the objectives of the study is not to develop a plan as a research work has no such mandates but to formulate desperately needed tools for planning practices in the future the model developed here can now be applied in various ways for instance scenarios can be formulated to assess impacts of reduced recharge or increased abstraction the immediate plan is to include the aquifer capacity as a variable in the model structure this capacity if feasible would be a quick approach to assess the capacity of aquifers and set the alarms before depleting aquifers reach unrecoverable states management of urmia aquifer urmia aquifer supports the livelihood of a population of more than 1 million and is at the margin of the fertile crescent supporting the livelihood of its population for more than four millennia through the use of the traditional qanat system interwoven into the fabric of its cultural setting since 1990 there was a meteoric change in its irrigation culture as pumps became available the aquifer was a common resource with little regulation to cope with new changes and therefore should sustainable practices not be developed for the aquifer the emergence of the tragedy of the commons is inevitable and fig 9d shows that the process is already underway this is supported by qualitative information obtained from a number of water users that since 2000 the experience of the decline of water table instigated the deepening of the wells this impacted on water table with a further decline and created salinity problems there is no study to take a systemic view of the problems yet whilst water resource planning with public participation is yet to be developed in the country setting the equitable level of abstraction is haphazardly for not being evidence based and thereby defining the level of unauthorised abstractions is a grey area nonetheless a report by the west azerbaijan regional water authority 2016 attributes 80 of abstraction to unauthorised sourced based on the preliminary findings reflected by the paper the emerging full picture is outlined as follows i the decline in water table is not total yet as their sources of replenishment broadly remain unchanged and therefore the adverse situation can be arrested ii any mitigation measure must be sustainable and for this a number of management plans are overdue including basin management plan for the lake urmia basin aquifer management plans for each of the 12 aquifers surrounding lake urmia including urmia aquifer and water cycle studies to ensure that water is equitably distributed among all sectors of water users iii international experience shows that any plan without the participation of water users is likely to fail and therefore aquifer plans ought to define appropriate equitable levels iv extension services are essential to train the water user communities with ways of efficient use of water 6 conclusion a modelling strategy is presented to study urmia aquifer the west azerbaijan province northwest iran due to the absence of any modern aquifer management practices the aquifer is distressed as its water table is in decline based on 14 years of recorded water levels at 48 observation wells ow the modelling strategy for the sparse data incorporates three models which comprise three ai models of artificial neural network ann sugeno fuzzy logic sfl and multiple neuro fuzzy nf a bayesian model averaging bma technique is employed to combine these modelling results where bma improves predictions and provides facilities for quantifying uncertainty the results of the three ai models show that there is no single model performing the best but they have convergences and divergences bma combines these modelling results into a single model in which the combined model is a learning from the convergence and divergence of the ai models and as such it performs better than the individual models most of the time but overwhelmingly reduces the scatters in the error residuals the paper refrains from ranking the models but recommends that the bma medium is used for learning from models the analysis of the results shows that bma is a suitable strategy for an operational aquifer management system and with a more monitoring of water table it can respond to its inherent variations although urmia aquifer is distressed and has come to this state in two decades or so the paper argues that the aquifer is not dry yet and its rainfall patterns remain more or less the same and therefore its past healthy state can be reinstated this will depend on developing appropriate defensible models developing a series of management plans giving high importance to inputs of opinions from the water users through their participation and never compromising the compensation flows for ecological and environmental functioning of the basin acknowledgment the authors would like to thank west azerbaijan regional water authority for their

6679,the concept of return period and its estimation are pivotal in risk management for many geophysical applications return period is usually estimated by inferring a probability distribution from an observed series of the random process of interest and then applying the classical equation i e the inverse of the exceedance probability traditionally we form a statistical sample by selecting from the complete time series e g at the daily scale those values that can reasonably be considered as realizations of independent extremes e g annual maxima or peaks over a certain high threshold such a selection procedure entails that a large number of observations are discarded this wastage of information could have important consequences in practical problems where the reduction of the already small size of common hydrological records significantly affects the reliability of the estimates under such circumstances it is crucial to exploit all the available information to this end we investigate the advantages of estimating the return period without any data decimation by using the full data set the proposed procedure denoted as complete time series analysis cta exploits the property that the average interarrival time i e return period of potentially damaging events is not affected by the dependence structure of the underlying process even for cyclo stationary e g seasonal processes for the sake of illustration the cta is compared to that based on annual maxima selection through a simple non parametric approach discussing advantages and limitations of the method results suggest that the proposed cta approach provides a more conservative return period estimation in an holistic implementation framework within a broader range of return period values than that pertaining to other methods which means not only the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory keywords return period interarrival time complete time series analysis persistence seasonality annual maxima 1 introduction hydraulic risk analysis relies on finding the probability of failure of a given hydraulic structure or more generally system due to the occurrence of intense hydrological events where the probability of failure is usually expressed in terms of return period different failure mechanisms could be considered where each of them results from the combination of multiple characteristics of the hydrological loads schumann 2017 hence under general conditions the return period of structure failure should be quantified taking into account the joint probability of failure mechanisms i e the joint probability of the random variables describing the hydrological load and the complex interactions between the structure and the hydrological loads acting on it see e g volpi and fiori 2014 in the simplest case we have a single failure mechanism that is ruled by a single random variable describing the hydrological load for example a bridge destroyed by a flood under such circumstances the return period of structure failure corresponds to that of the hydrological load once the key variable representing the hydrological load is identified the problem is solved by inferring a probability distribution from a series of realizations of this random variable in order to determine the magnitude of the event corresponding to a given return period or probability of failure given this premise it is clear that the concept of return period and how it is estimated from observations is central to risk management problems in hydrological hydraulic applications yet this is true also in many other geophysical and engineering fields even if return period is a widely applied and well established probabilistic tool for hydrological applications since the pioneering work of alexander 1959 there have been few studies attempting to analyze the differences between estimated return periods of hydrological extremes using different methods of estimation nonetheless some researchers have recently investigated the concept of return period when the basic assumptions of stationarity and independence are omitted see among others fernández and salas 1999 douglas et al 2002 bunde et al 2003 eichner et al 2011 rootzén and katz 2013 volpi et al 2015 obeysekera and salas 2016 read and vogel 2016 and references therein as detailed in the following the purpose of our work is to investigate a new statistical approach to infer return period from a complete record of observed data therefore we must assume a dependence structure in time and a stationary framework because the non stationary hypothesis implies a priori attributions supported by deductive reasoning that go beyond the scope of this paper koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 under the assumption of stationarity bunde et al 2003 and volpi et al 2015 have shown that the independence condition is not necessary in order to apply the classical equation of return period i e the inverse of the exceedance probability following volpi et al 2015 this paper highlights how temporal dependence does not alter the average interarrival time formulation even in stochastic processes characterized by cyclo stationarity a characteristic that hydrological and other geophysical processes exhibit at sub annual scales furthermore we investigate here the potential application of this important property of return period derived from the full available record for frequency analysis specifically we show how the return period can be directly estimated from raw data records of a time dependent process regardless of its dependence structure under stationary or cyclo stationary conditions this alternative approach for return period estimation which is proposed here for the first time and denoted as complete time series analysis cta is compared to the traditional approach based on frequency analysis of annual maxima am which constitutes the basis of traditional extreme value analysis indeed we usually analyze am to catch the tail of the distribution of the parent process where the latter is the process of interest hence the rationale behind cta is to exploit all the information provided by observational data marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 with the objective of better estimating the return period in a wider range of values not only at the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory note indeed that small to moderate return period values are still of interest in several practical problems such as pluvial flooding furthermore it is important to stress that cta provides different return period estimates with respect to annual maxima by considering all the occurrences of the dangerous values e g exceedance of the random variable above any threshold value of interest within the observed record as it will be discussed later on hence we aim at exploring the potential conveniences of cta compared to traditional approaches and not to elaborate on the return period concept see volpi et al 2015 for this reason in this article we base and limit our investigation to the non parametric approach two illustrative examples are presented both relying on synthetic processes the first one makes use of a very simple process whose correlation structure is known a priori the second example resembles the main characteristics of a real word process future research will focus on the parametric implementation of cta for its practical use in real world cases indeed the problem of fitting a model to the complete record of observations and the evaluation of the related uncertainty deserves further attention the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly recalls the definitions of return period available in the literature and illustrates the properties of the interarrival time for stationary and cyclo stationary processes in section 3 the new approach for return period estimation relying on frequency analysis of complete times series cta is introduced as an alternative to traditional methods based on annual maxima and peaks over threshold section 4 in sections 5 and 6 complete time series analysis is compared to the standard approach using annual maxima for a simple stationary process and for a cyclo stationary process that mimics the characteristics of a real world phenomenon respectively section 7 is concerned with the potential issues related to the application of the proposed approach in real word problems while the conclusion section summarizes the main findings of this paper 2 return period definitions and properties let z τ be a stochastic process that represents a natural process evolving in continuous time τ as observations of z are only made in discrete time we consider here the corresponding discrete time process z j that is obtained by sampling z τ at constant time intervals δ τ i e z j z j δ τ where j 1 2 denotes discrete time we make the only assumption that z j is a stationary process fully described in terms of its marginal probability function p z z pr z z and up to the second order in terms of joint distribution by its autocorrelation function ρ θ γ θ γ 0 with θ 0 1 2 where γ θ cov z j z j θ and ρ θ 1 1 further we denote the mean of the process as μ e z j and its standard deviation σ γ 0 for design and risk assessment purposes we are interested in the occurrence of dangerous events that might result in a system or structure failure we define here a dangerous event as the exceedance at the δ τ scale of a threshold level a z z for instance the discharge exceeding a given high threshold level potentially causing the flooding of an urbanized area the probability of a is given by pr a pr z z 1 p z z 1 pr b where b denotes the complementary event of a in hydrological applications as well as in many other engineering fields the rareness of the dangerous events is usually measured in terms of return period t z thus assuming that the event a will occur on average once every t years which is the time unit commonly used for return periods in hydrology mathematically it is 1 t δ τ e x x 1 xf x x where x is the number of discrete time steps to an occurrence of the event a and f x x pr x x is its probability mass function pmf note that in eq 1 which only refers to discrete time processes t is measured in units of time i e δ τ if δ τ 1 year the return period is measured in years as highlighted by previous literature studies see e g fernández and salas 1999 douglas et al 2002 the return period can be defined as the average of i the waiting time that is the time interval ranging from the present to the next threshold exceedance or ii the interarrival time that is the time elapsing between any two successive realizations of the dangerous event as explained later on we adopt here the second definition which implicitly assumes that a dangerous event has just occurred we remark that such a definition is customary in hydrological applications see e g chow et al 1988 kottegoda and rosso 1997 salvadori et al 2007 for convenience herein we express discrete time as t j j 0 where j 0 is the current instant of time when the dangerous event has just occurred therefore the discrete time process is indicated as z t and t 0 denotes the present as a consequence the pmf of the interarrival time can be written as fernández and salas 1999 2 f x x pr b 1 b 2 b x 1 a x a 0 pr a 0 b 1 b 2 b x 1 a x pr a 0 then the definition of return period based on the concept of interarrival time relies on a conditional probability the average interarrival time is obtained by substituting eq 2 into 1 if z t is a purely random process then the return period t is given by e g stedinger et al 1993 3 t z δ τ 1 1 p z z regardless of the definition used for x in eq 1 i e waiting time or interarrival time the above relationship holds true even if the stationary and independent process is not sampled at constant time intervals in this case δ τ is the average time interval between consecutive samples koutsoyiannis 2008 although the independence condition is typically assumed as a necessary condition for eq 3 it has been recently demonstrated by volpi et al 2015 independently from the conceptual arguments presented by bunde et al 2003 that the return period t z defined as the average interarrival time is expressed by eq 3 even for processes correlated in time with any type of dependence structure of z an important and not very well known fact that is exploited in the following development conversely when based on the concept of waiting time the formulation of the return period strictly depends on the correlation structure of the process specifically for any dangerous events a or threshold levels z the average waiting time is an increasing function of the correlation of the process thus resulting in values larger than the average interarrival time which ignores correlation hence for processes which are positively correlated in time such as most hydrological processes eq 3 returns a lower bound in terms of t z although the average interarrival time t z remains the same for correlated and independent processes the probability that the threshold z is exceeded in a given period can be very different in the two cases in fact if a dangerous event occurs at present time then the conditional probability of occurrence of another dangerous event at successive instants of time will be greater than the independent case this yields that the probability mass function of the interarrival time that corresponds to the probability of failure will have a larger mass for small temporal values and a lower mass elsewhere hence a larger variance with respect to the independent case since the average waiting time is an increasing function of the variance of the interarrival time as shown in volpi et al 2015 the latter characteristic of the interarrival time distribution explains why the average waiting time is larger than the average interarrival time as a further consequence the definition of return period based on the interarrival time might result in higher values of the probability of failure with respect to the independent case the reader is referred to volpi et al 2015 for further details on the theoretical properties of both definitions of t 2 1 cyclo stationary processes the property of interarrival time mentioned above has been derived based on the assumption that the underlying process z is stationary see the appendix b in volpi et al 2015 for details however many natural processes exhibit statistical properties that are invariant to a shift of the time origin by integral multiples of a certain period π due to e g the seasonal variability of environmental phenomena at sub annual scales koutsoyiannis 2016 in stochastic hydrology such processes are usually modelled by cyclo stationary processes with period π let us consider a cyclo stationary process that is characterized by a joint distribution function that varies within the time period π typically equal to one year such that pr b t pr b π t pr b t b t 1 pr b π t b π t 1 and so on for such a process the pmf given in eq 2 can be regarded as the pmf of the interarrival time conditional to the occurrence of the dangerous event at time t 0 i e f x x t 0 for any value of t this conditional pmf can be written as 4 f x x t pr a t b t 1 b t 2 b t x 1 a t x pr a t to account for the possible occurrence of a at every instant of time t within the period π we marginalize the above conditional probability by summing the pmf in eq 4 with respect to all the possible values of time t t t π 1 according to their probability of occurrence the latter quantity is nothing else than the conditional probability pr a t t t t π 1 hence it is 5 f x x t t t t π 1 pr a t t t t π 1 pr a t b t 1 b t 2 b t x 1 a t x pr a t t t t π 1 pr a t r t t π 1 pr a r pr a t b t 1 b t 2 b t x 1 a t x pr a t finally the average interarrival time of the cyclo stationary process is obtained by substituting in eq 1 the pmf given in eq 5 thus obtaining 6 t z δ τ 1 1 p z z where p z z 1 r t t π 1 pr a r 1 1 r t t π 1 pr b r is the marginal probability of non exceeding the threshold value z within any period t t π 1 since we are dealing with a cyclo stationary processes p z z remains the same for any t the derivation of eq 6 is given in appendix a while for cyclo stationary processes the exceeding probability pr a t 1 pr b t varies with time t t t π 1 the return period of the dangerous event a is a constant value independent of time t and it is expressed again by the classical equation of return period 3 novel return period estimation complete time series analysis cta the property that the average interarrival time i e return period is not affected by the dependence structure of the underlying process even for cyclo stationary processes sheds a new light on the problem of return period estimation in practical problems under the hypothesis of stationarity or cyclo stationarity in the case of processes exhibiting seasonality and sampled at the sub annual scale the return period can be estimated by using eq 3 starting from any kind of observational data independent or correlated in time thereby potentially exploiting all the available information on the underlying process hence the only necessary assumption is that of stationarity but stationarity is also related to ergodicity which in turn is a prerequisite to make inference from data as previously mentioned the stationarity issue goes beyond the scope of this work the interested readers are referred to the work of koutsoyiannis 2014 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 koutsoyiannis 2016 serinaldi et al 2018 and luke et al 2017 for a comprehensive discussion let z z 1 z n be an observed realization of the stochastic process z t where n is the length of the data series following its formal definition based on the interarrival time the empirical return period could be estimated by first deriving from z the sample of the interarrival time for each value of the threshold z i e x z x 1 x 2 x η z and then averaging in time as in eq 1 this approach can be applied only in the case of very long time series very large n for which the size of the interarrival series η z is large enough to return reliable estimates for high threshold values z in hydrological applications the length of the observed series is usually less than one hundred years e g at the daily or at the hourly scale hence it is important to exploit all the available information for sample estimates the empirical return period can be obtained by directly applying eq 3 to the entire time series z where the cumulative probability function p z is substituted by a probability model inferred from the observed data for simplicity we adopt here a non parametric approach by substituting p z with its empirical counterpart the empirical distribution function edf denoted in the following as f n provides an estimate of the distribution function of the underlying stochastic process e g kolmogorov 1933 let z i i 1 n be a sequence of dependent and equally distributed random variables then f n is defined as the fraction of random variables that are less than or equal to the specified value z i e 7 f n z 1 n i 1 n i z i z where i z i z is the indicator of the event z i z the estimate f n z is obtained by considering in eq 7 the outcome z instead of the random variables the edf in eq 7 is an unbiased estimator of the marginal probability function i e e f n z p z z this means that the dependence structure of the underlying process does not affect the expectation of the edf while it affects its covariance as reported by azriel and schwartzman 2015 moreover these authors remark that the estimator in eq 7 is consistent for all gaussian stationary ergodic processes that are characterized by an autocorrelation function decreasing to zero as the lag time goes to infinity i e the necessary condition for ergodicity the latter case includes both short and long range dependent processes such as the hurst kolmogorov process koutsoyiannis 2016 the consistency property of the edf continues to hold for non gaussian distributions under various forms of dependence see e g dedecker and merlevéde 2007 wu 2006 note that in the case of cyclo stationary processes where the marginal probability distribution changes with time within the period π f n directly provides an estimate of p z z which takes into account the variability during the period of the marginal probability function i e the alternation of events characterized by a different probability of exceedance the computational approach based on the complete edf complete time series analysis cta returns on average the same results to those based on the observed interarrival time series provided that n hence η z is very large an illustration example showing the latter property will be presented in the following sections the estimation approach proposed in this section makes use of the whole available information on the process z i e the complete time series z with the aim of returning a reliable and robust estimate of the return period of the dangerous event z z for any threshold value z i e in a broader range of values with respect to the traditional approaches used in extreme value analysis it is important to stress that cta requires the availability of an uninterrupted record of observations i e z where the process is sampled at constant time intervals δ τ indeed this is a necessary condition for the property of the average interarrival time to hold true as explained in volpi et al 2015 in the following sections we compare cta with the traditional sampling methods used in extreme value analysis thus highlighting advantages and limitations of both the strategies 4 traditional approaches for return period estimation since independence of z t is usually invoked for the derivation of eq 3 e g benjamin and cornell 1970 p 233 kottegoda and rosso 1997 p 190 and chow et al 1988 p 383 it is common practice in hydrological applications to implement some techniques for data selection aimed to allow the assumption of the statistical independence of the observations these techniques constitute the basis for the extreme value analysis whose objective is to quantify the stochastic behavior of a process at unusually large or small levels that potentially lead to the failure of a system coles 2001 salvadori et al 2007 classical methods for extreme and independent value selection are the block maxima approach where the block generally coincides with the year annual maxima am and the more complex peak over threshold approach pot the wide popularity of am relies on its simplicity but also on the limited access in the past to regularly sampled long observed series of the random variable of interest although it is necessary to have available the complete series to establish if an extreme event is an annual maximum it was common practice to take note essentially of the values reached during extreme events especially in old times when the observation of the hydrological variables was not systematic apart from a few noteworthy cases such as that described in calenda et al 2005 when a complete time series of observations is available pot is adopted in practical applications especially when the length of the observed period is short to select the largest possible amount of data yet respecting the independence assumption pot originated in hydrology with the rationale that if additional information about the extreme upper tail were used besides the annual maxima then more accurate and reliable estimates of the parameters and quantiles of extreme value distributions would be obtained see e g katz et al 2002 this is the same rationale behind cta as described in the previous section however it is important to stress that while cta does not require any data selection pot asks for additional computational efforts to select only the peaks over the threshold i e the maximum of a cluster of values all exceeding the threshold and necessitates the introduction of further information or parameters in order to select among those peaks only independent ones see e g coles 2001 for simplicity in this work we compare cta to am to avoid confusion we use y to indicate the annual maximum of the random variable z the annual maximum time series is derived from z as y y 1 y n n y where n is the number of observations y i max z n y i 1 1 z n y i and n y is the number of time intervals δ τ per year e g n y 365 in the case z is observed at the daily scale the empirical return period of the values in y can be evaluated by using the same procedures described above for the time series z and based on the edf since n n y n 4 1 purely random and stationary processes the probability distribution function of y is by definition different from that of z since we aim at exploring the difference between the two under general conditions cyclo stationarity and persistence for the sake of clarity we start from the well known stationary and independent case then ρ θ 0 for θ 0 by introducing a general framework that is instrumental to the discussion reported in the following sections given a threshold value z the probability of annual maxima p y z pr y z can be easily derived from that of the parent process as e g coles 2001 8 p y z p z z n y by using eq 3 the corresponding return period is derived 9 t y z δ τ n y 1 p z z n y where δ τ n y is one year note that here n y is not a random variable since z is an observed series of the stochastic process z sampled at a constant time intervals δ τ hence the number of observations in each year is constant being uniquely determined by the time interval δ τ conversely in traditional extreme value theory the exponent in eq 8 is not a constant being the number of peaks of clusters of values but rather can be regarded as a realization of a poisson distributed random variable this yields a different form for the probability distribution of annual maxima which gives numerical values not significantly different from those provided by eq 8 for large p z z koutsoyiannis 2004 if n y 1 cta obviously gives the same results of am if n y 1 which means that δ τ 1 year eq 9 results in larger values with respect to 1 1 p z z as shown in fig 1 note that the figure depicts the theoretical return period of annual maxima as function of that of the continuous process i e when assuming n y for any kind of process z in other words it is the case of infinite sample length n for convenience the return period of annual maxima is denoted by t y while that of the parent process by t z both are measured in years from now on the figure shows to what extent am results in larger values of the return period with respect to that of the underlying process or in other words the probability of y z is smaller than that of the dangerous events z z this is due to a wastage of information during any year additional events may have occurred that are excluded by the analysis because such data are not the annual maximum in the year they arose as in the example depicted in fig 2 a for the sake of illustration fig 2 shows one year of a lognormal ar 1 daily time series with mean μ 1 variance σ 2 1 and lag 1 correlation coefficient ρ 1 0 panel a and ρ 1 0 85 panel b note that seasonal variability is not considered in this independent and stationary example the figure depicts with red dots the information discarded by the annual maxima approach red circles in the estimation of the return period of the event z 4 furthermore these events might be possibly larger than the maximum in other years it also follows that the minimum value of the return period of annual maxima is equal to 1 year which means that based on annual maxima analysis we cannot measure the rareness of events that occur more frequently than once every year as the threshold z increases we look to more and more intense events the return period of annual maxima t y tends to that of the parent process t z indeed very large events are expected to be always selected as annual maxima hence the wastage of information is reduced toward zero as the threshold increases the difference t y t z denoted in fig 1 as d reduces to less than 5 of t z only when t z becomes larger than about 10 years this means that relatively frequent events that might be of interest when the expected damage is modest are generally underestimated when only the annual maxima are available the asymptotic convergence of the annual maxima distribution to that of the parent process for high threshold values about t z 10 years according to the above figure is at the basis of extreme value theory 5 persistent stationary processes the difference between annual maxima and the parent process for those events that are characterized by small to medium values of the return period is expected to worsen in the case of time dependent positively correlated processes where the dangerous events tend to occur in clusters see the example shown in fig 2b where the number of events neglected by annual maxima approach the red dots increases with respect to the independent case depicted fig 2a the latter condition is that usually matched in hydrological applications for instance the rainfall amount observed at given time scale exhibits a complex persistent behavior in time affected by seasonality which depends on the time scale itself hence we compare here the empirical return period of the complete time series to that of annual maxima for time persistent processes by making use of a simple synthetic example in this section we consider an autoregressive process of order one ar 1 supposed to represent a stationary and persistent natural process observed at the daily scale i e δ τ 1 day the process analyzed here is characterized by a marginal lognormal probability distribution function with mean μ and variance σ 2 while its time dependence structure is ruled by the lag 1 correlation coefficient ρ 1 we assume here μ 1 and two different values for the variance σ 2 1 or σ 2 5 further we let the correlation coefficient vary between 0 independent process and 0 99 persistent process noting that we are ignoring seasonality here 5 1 theoretical difference between cta and am for persistent processes we first compare the empirical return period of the annual maxima to that of the complete series by analyzing a very long series specifically n 365 10 5 days i e 10 5 years this analysis is intended to investigate the theoretical difference between cta and am for persistent processes when the accuracy of the return period estimate is essentially not affected by the length of the observed period as in the independent case discussed in section 4 1 results are represented in fig 3 for several values of ρ 1 ranging between 0 5 and 0 99 and for σ 2 1 fig 3a and σ 2 5 fig 3b the independent case ρ 1 0 is reported as a reference values of ρ 1 0 0 5 are not considered since the difference with the independent case is negligible finally we look at results for return period values included between 1 day that is the minimum value that can be explored based on the temporal resolution of the available series and 1000 years such that estimates are not influenced by the finite length of the simulated series we recall here that the theoretical return period according to eq 3 of the parent process is fully determined by the lognormal probability distribution which is represented in fig 3 by the magenta curve the return period estimated from the complete series returns for any ρ 1 the theoretical distribution black dashed curves that overlap for all ρ 1 the magenta curve thus it is not affected at all by the correlation structure of the process as demonstrated by volpi et al 2015 since in this numerical experiment n is very large also the empirical return period computed as the average of the interarrival time between successive events z z i e by strictly following eq 1 returns the theoretical value for any ρ 1 and for threshold values z up to that represented in the figure the latter result which numerically demonstrates the theoretical finding by volpi et al 2015 is illustrated in fig 4 for the specific process characterized by the parameter combination σ 2 5 and ρ 1 0 85 in fig 3 the return period estimated by selecting the annual maxima t y colored curves assumes values larger than the theoretical ones pertaining to the parent process or the independent case ρ 1 0 black curve this implies that the corresponding z values are smaller we also notice that for ρ 1 0 9 the annual maxima span over a wide range covering values that are even smaller than the mean of the process μ 1 vertical dashed line in the figure on average the number of daily data exceeding the threshold z min y that are discarded by am per year ranges in between 10 and 350 values when ρ 1 increases from 0 to 0 99 respectively for both σ 2 1 and σ 2 5 further the return period estimate converges only for large values of z to the theoretical value with a rate of convergence that depends on the persistence of the process hence the larger is ρ 1 the slower is the rate of convergence of t y to t z an important role is also played by the variance of the process in the case σ 2 5 fig 3b the convergence of the complete distribution to the theoretical one is even slower than in the case depicted in fig 3a σ 2 1 to give a quantitative measure of the deviation of the annual maxima estimate from the theoretical return period of the parent process the difference d t y t z for t z 10 years moves from 0 5 years for ρ 1 0 i e 5 as in the theoretical independent case depicted in fig 1 to 150 200 years for ρ 1 0 99 and σ 2 1 5 note that return period estimate based on cta is compared here only to that pertaining to annual maxima but a similar comparison could be made by considering the pot approach it is expected that return period estimates based on pot result in intermediate values between am and cta as a function of the threshold used to select peaks but closer to am estimates note indeed that cta considers all the values exceeding the threshold z see e g fig 2b while pot uses only the independent maxima of clusters of values exceeding z the difference between the two approaches might be relevant for practical purposes as discussed later in section 7 5 2 effects of finite time series length the situation depicted in fig 3 is not met in practical applications when the limited length of the observed series significantly affects the return period estimation in terms of both accuracy and uncertainty generally speaking accuracy is expected to improve while uncertainty decreases when increasing the length of the dataset of observations of a given process note that here the number of observations is not a direct measure of the amount of information provided by data because of the correlation among the observed values in complete time series hence we aim at comparing the overall robustness of return period estimates for small sample lengths obtained by cta instead of the selected annual maxima which are commonly assumed to be independent to investigate the latter issue we repeated the above analysis for different values of n within the range from 10 to 200 years for a large number a synthetic time series m 10 000 results obtained when assuming σ 2 5 and ρ 1 0 6 are depicted in fig 5 the figure summarizes the empirical probability estimates together with their 95 uncertainty bounds derived by using both methods for some values of n ranging in between 10 and 200 years note that results are presented here in terms of edf to avoid infinite values of return period that might occur due to the use of eq 1 when z is larger than the maximum observed value in the dataset if the edf in eq 7 is normalized with respect to n 1 instead of n we obtain the classic weibull plotting position formula makkonen 2006 indeed the latter is usually adopted to avoid infinite values of the estimated return period for the sample maximum this issue goes beyond the scope of this analysis which is intended to discuss the variability of return period estimate due to finite sample lengths it will be considered in future works together with the problem of model fitting fig 5 shows how the am estimate converges on the average only with increasing t moving from fig 5a to c to that of the complete time series which overlaps the theoretical one for any sample length n as expected the uncertainty bounds reduce with the sample size n uncertainty also reduces as t increases however this unexpected behavior is a consequence of the fact that probability is upper bounded to unity and due to the adoption of the edf given in eq 7 notwithstanding this it is worth noting that am uncertainty bounds are narrower than those pertaining to cta for any value of t this means that the selection of annual maxima results in an undersampling effect that manifests itself in terms of underestimation of the exceeding probability of the parent process i e overestimation of the non exceeding probability or of the return period as discussed in fig 3 and of its sampling variability correlation in time which in this case is fully represented by the lag 1 correlation coefficient ρ 1 significantly affects the accuracy and the variability of the return period estimates obtained by both methods results for all values of ρ 1 considered in this illustrative example are summarized in fig 6 for t 5 years fig 6a and b depict the behavior of the average probability estimates based on am panel a and cta panel b it can be noticed that the bias resulting from am is strongly enhanced by high values of ρ 1 conversely the average probability estimates based on cta are unbiased for any ρ 1 and n further the underestimation of the sampling variability which is observed in fig 5 for ρ 1 0 6 when using am magnifies in the cases of processes strongly correlated in time to illustrate the latter issue we depict in fig 6 also the coefficient of variation c v of the probability estimates for t 5 years computed by analyzing annual maxima fig 6c and the complete time series fig 6d the figure clearly shows that while c v is comparable for small values of ρ 1 large differences arise when ρ 1 approaches to one while c v of cta estimate increases with the persistence of the process that of am reduces the latter behaviour is a consequence of the fact that probability that is upper bounded by one is overestimated when analyzing annual maxima a similar analysis could be performed in terms of quantiles by investigating how the order statistics of annual maxima and complete time series are influenced by the correlation structure of the process however slightly different results not shown are obtained in terms of empirical return period quantiles with respect to those obtained in terms of edf as in fig 6 in fact the probability distribution of the order statistics does not correspond on average to the theoretical probability distribution of the underlying process david and nagaraja 2003 moreover it is affected by the autocorrelation structure of the process conversely the edf expressed by eq 7 is an unbiased estimator regardless of the type and strength of the correlation structure 6 persistent and cyclo stationary processes in order to provide some insights into the use of cta in applications we analyze here a synthetic process which resembles the main statistical properties of an hydrological observed series specifically we analyze a daily discharge process that is characterized by non normality a strong seasonal pattern and by long range persistence the type of analysis envisaged here requires a very long series of data hence for the sake of illustration we consider a fractional autoregressive moving average process farma p d q which models the tiber river daily discharge time series observed at roma ripetta station observations cover a period of 54 years from 1930 to 1983 but only the first 15 years were used to calibrate the linear parametric model as an example fig 7 a shows the observed series black line for a time window of three years from 1933 to 1936 the seasonal pattern clearly emerges from the structure of the autocorrelation function as depicted in fig 7b black line the model was calibrated after normalizing the data based on a log normal transformation and removing seasonality fig 7 shows a subsample of the simulated series compared to the observed one panel a and the corresponding autocorrelation functions panel b thus highlighting the capability of the model in reproducing the complex behavior of the real word process the reader is referred to grimaldi 2004 for a detailed description of model structure calibration and performance we remark again that the model employed here is for the sole sake of illustration and other general and more parsimonious methods could have been used to generate synthetic series from the observed process with any arbitrary autocorrelation structure as discussed by koutsoyiannis 2016 yet this goes beyond the scope of this work we estimated the empirical return periods for both the annual maxima and the complete time series by substituting in eq 3 the non exceedance probability with the edf calculated using eq 7 which gives the average non exceeding probability within the year π the empirical return periods are depicted in fig 8 a since the synthetic series is very long the figure depicts the theoretical difference between the two unaffected by sample length am significantly overestimates the return period of the complete time series if the latter is considered as a benchmark for return periods up to 100 years here the bias of am with respect to cta d t y t z for t z 10 years is equal to 10 years which means a 100 relative difference the latter value is very close to that pertaining to the ar 1 lognormal process with similar value of ρ 1 and σ 2 5 discussed in section 5 2 although the variation coefficient here is smaller about 0 7 with respect to that pertaining to the ar 1 process about 2 3 if a finite length sample is used to estimate return periods the difference between am and cta might be enhanced the effects of finite sample length for this cyclo stationary long range persistent process is illustrated in panels b d of fig 8 in panels b and c the empirical return periods of two samples of 54 years equal to the length of the observed time series drawn from the farma calibrated model are compared to the corresponding theoretical ones the full length samples the empirical return period estimates for the event z 1500 m 3 s are depicted in panel d the average return period of annual maxima overestimates that pertaining to the complete time series also showing a smaller dispersion around its average value 7 discussion on cta application in real world cases it is important to note that the cta approach to return period estimate considered here generally differs from the common methods used in hydrology e g in flood frequency analysis as explained in the following cta gives the return period of the event a defined as the exceedance of a threshold value i e z t z at the temporal resolution δ τ at which the continuous process z is sampled in other words it accounts for all the interarrival times between any successive values exceeding z at the δ τ scale including those elapsing between successive values of z t that remain above the threshold z i e simply equal to δ τ see fig 2 instead in the conventional flood analysis the above interarrival times are usually not considered the significance of such a return period estimate depends on the particular goal at hand and on the temporal resolution δ τ that should be comparable not much smaller with respect to the temporal scale that characterizes the natural phenomenon the temporal scale should not be confused with the characteristic scale of the correlation structure i e the integral scale which itself depends on the temporal resolution δ τ for instance in the example provided in section 6 cta accounts for the consecutive exceedance of any threshold value of flow discharge at the daily scale δ τ 1 day which is a small temporal scale with respect to the average duration of a flood event in this case if the purpose of the analysis is the assessment of the levee system it might be not of interest to know if the levee height is exceeded the day after once exceedance is already occurred the day before on the other hand it might be important to account for successive exceedances at the temporal resolution of the process δ τ e g when we are evaluating the return period of daily rainfall to design a urban drainage system against pluvial flooding and the critical duration of the system that maximizes the peak discharge is approximately one day further as anticipated in the introduction for simplicity reasons we based our analyses on a non parametric estimation approach i e using the edf in eq 7 instead of a model fitted to the data however direct estimation of the statistics of a process is generally not possible merely from the data and data alone do not enable extrapolation of estimates as often required for planning and design purposes koutsoyiannis 2016 thus the issue of fitting appropriate models in the context of the proposed approach deserves further investigation although uncertainty is inherent in any statistical model such uncertainty could be reduced by the utilization of all the available information as well as by judicious choices of model the use of cta naturally implements seasonality handling in frequency analysis as recently discussed by allamanno et al 2011 see also rasmussen and rosbjerg 1991 and strupczewski et al 2012 disregarding seasonality in hydro climatic extreme value analysis based on annual maxima or pot leads to an overestimation of return period which is less safe the problem is solved by taking into account the events that occurred in all the seasons by fitting different distributions to the maxima in separate seasons or months and mixing the seasonal distributions according to their probability of occurrence see e g mascaro 2018 or by directly including the seasonal rate of occurrence of the exceedance events in the pot approach as in rasmussen and rosbjerg 1991 and allamanno et al 2011 cta implements the former method by considering for frequency analysis all the observed values in each of the seasons this could eventually require the adoption of complex probability models e g mixed models the adoption of complex probability models could also help handle the heterogeneity due to the possible superposition of different physical processes ruling the statistical behaviour of the random variable of interest rainfall floods etc in fact the general understanding appears to be that low and ordinary hydrological events could be dominated by a different process merz et al 2008 thus having little or no contribution to the larger events this might emerge from the edf of the annual maxima by manifesting a different statistical behavior for ordinary and extreme events this heterogeneity is expected to emerge more strongly when analyzing the complete time series that brings a larger number of values also on the upper tail of the probability distribution function with respect to annual maxima in this regard we believe that a priori physical knowledge about the underlying processes if available could be included in the analysis to support the assumption of complex mixed models for modeling and extrapolation purposes see e g calenda et al 2009 in absence of additional knowledge on the physical process the heterogeneity assumption cannot be truly tested however all events generally occur under the combination of numerous factors so that the probabilistic treatment of processes is by definition a macroscopic approach that does not care about each of the specific factors and reduces to fitting the most appropriate model to the empirical distribution of the complete data set or to its part that is of interest for the specific problem at hand finally we remark that cta is based on the availability of a discrete time uninterrupted record of observations with an adequate temporal resolution which according to our analysis affects the results in the case of few missing data within long observational records some temporal or spatial interpolation techniques could be adopted to fill the gaps in general large gaps could affect cta more than am or pot the improvement of large datasets of environmental observations is expected to favor cta approach in the future 8 conclusions a new approach for return period estimation is proposed denoted as complete time series analysis cta this approach relies on the property that the average interarrival time between successive events e g z z is not affected by the correlation structure of the underlying process regardless of the persistence of the process this means that independence is not a necessary condition when return period is defined as the average of the interarrival time this also implies that no data selection techniques are needed to assure independence of the data for frequency analysis hence once stationarity can be assumed the return period can be computed by using the classical equation of return period the inverse of the exceedance probability starting from any kind of observational data independent or correlated in time thereby potentially exploiting all the available information on the parent process this property is extended herein to include cyclo stationary processes since hydrological and other geophysical processes typically manifest a weaker form of stationarity at sub annual scales connected to the seasonal variability of the environmental phenomena we compare the proposed approach to the simple method of annual maxima am typically adopted in extreme value analysis complete time series observed in discrete time at constant time intervals and annual maxima are inherently different processes that give subtly different information on the same underlying continuous process specifically cta describes the marginal behaviour of the whole parent process sampled in discrete time at a given temporal resolution while am describes the statistical behavior of its extremes the difference between cta and am are discussed herein by making use of two illustrative examples in both cases we adopt for the sake of illustration a non parametric approach by using the empirical probability distribution function of the annual maxima and the complete time series as an estimate of the marginal probability distribution function of the underlying process some general conclusions can be drawn from the analyses as listed in the following cta results in an accurate estimate of return period of the parent process for any intensity of the event i e threshold value z and on the average for any sample length regardless of the correlation structure and the seasonality of the parent process thus allowing to investigate a wider range of return period values not only the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory am leads to an overestimation of the return period and an underestimation of its sampling variability of the parent process for small to moderate return period values converging to cta estimates for large events this behaviour which is a consequence of data selection and is well known in the literature for independent processes is enhanced by time persistence of the underlying process further it is independent on average from the sample length return period estimates provided by cta are generally different with respect to that pertaining to annual maxima because cta considers all the occurrences of the dangerous events within the observed record their significance depends on the particular goal at hand and on the temporal resolution of the process that should be comparable with respect to the temporal scale that characterizes the natural phenomenon cta could be easily applied in the case of complex hydrological time series such as that discussed here that reproduces the main features of the tiber river daily discharge as observed at rome ripetta station which are typically characterized by non normality seasonality long range persistence and possibly heterogeneity we found that the estimation of the return period using cta could be a convenient alternative to existing methods as function of the problem at hand for a few reasons first the method is easy to implement it can be employed for any sample length without any data selection e g events selection in flood analysis moreover cta always results in more conservative return period estimates i e smaller estimated values with higher uncertainty by exploiting all the information content of the observed data i e low ordinary and extreme discharge values that make up the complete time series and fully describe the seasonal pattern the difference between cta and am tends toward zero as we look at events that are more and more extreme simply because very large events are expected to be always selected as annual maxima thus cta and extreme value analysis are expected to give the same results in terms of the upper tail of the distribution thus supporting the adoption of extreme value analysis when the interest is in large return period values note however that very intense events typically pertain to the extrapolation range where differences among the methods could emerge when a probability distribution model is fitted to the sample hence additional work is needed to fully understand advantages and limitations of cta in engineering practice since the main scope of this work was to explore the potential advantages of the complete time series approach compared to traditional ones we have not addressed the important issue of the inference of the statistical distribution of the hydrological variable of interest future work will investigate the problem of fitting appropriate candidate models able to reproduce the complex potentially heterogeneous statistical behavior of complete time series declaration of interests none acknowledgement we acknowledge the

6679,the concept of return period and its estimation are pivotal in risk management for many geophysical applications return period is usually estimated by inferring a probability distribution from an observed series of the random process of interest and then applying the classical equation i e the inverse of the exceedance probability traditionally we form a statistical sample by selecting from the complete time series e g at the daily scale those values that can reasonably be considered as realizations of independent extremes e g annual maxima or peaks over a certain high threshold such a selection procedure entails that a large number of observations are discarded this wastage of information could have important consequences in practical problems where the reduction of the already small size of common hydrological records significantly affects the reliability of the estimates under such circumstances it is crucial to exploit all the available information to this end we investigate the advantages of estimating the return period without any data decimation by using the full data set the proposed procedure denoted as complete time series analysis cta exploits the property that the average interarrival time i e return period of potentially damaging events is not affected by the dependence structure of the underlying process even for cyclo stationary e g seasonal processes for the sake of illustration the cta is compared to that based on annual maxima selection through a simple non parametric approach discussing advantages and limitations of the method results suggest that the proposed cta approach provides a more conservative return period estimation in an holistic implementation framework within a broader range of return period values than that pertaining to other methods which means not only the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory keywords return period interarrival time complete time series analysis persistence seasonality annual maxima 1 introduction hydraulic risk analysis relies on finding the probability of failure of a given hydraulic structure or more generally system due to the occurrence of intense hydrological events where the probability of failure is usually expressed in terms of return period different failure mechanisms could be considered where each of them results from the combination of multiple characteristics of the hydrological loads schumann 2017 hence under general conditions the return period of structure failure should be quantified taking into account the joint probability of failure mechanisms i e the joint probability of the random variables describing the hydrological load and the complex interactions between the structure and the hydrological loads acting on it see e g volpi and fiori 2014 in the simplest case we have a single failure mechanism that is ruled by a single random variable describing the hydrological load for example a bridge destroyed by a flood under such circumstances the return period of structure failure corresponds to that of the hydrological load once the key variable representing the hydrological load is identified the problem is solved by inferring a probability distribution from a series of realizations of this random variable in order to determine the magnitude of the event corresponding to a given return period or probability of failure given this premise it is clear that the concept of return period and how it is estimated from observations is central to risk management problems in hydrological hydraulic applications yet this is true also in many other geophysical and engineering fields even if return period is a widely applied and well established probabilistic tool for hydrological applications since the pioneering work of alexander 1959 there have been few studies attempting to analyze the differences between estimated return periods of hydrological extremes using different methods of estimation nonetheless some researchers have recently investigated the concept of return period when the basic assumptions of stationarity and independence are omitted see among others fernández and salas 1999 douglas et al 2002 bunde et al 2003 eichner et al 2011 rootzén and katz 2013 volpi et al 2015 obeysekera and salas 2016 read and vogel 2016 and references therein as detailed in the following the purpose of our work is to investigate a new statistical approach to infer return period from a complete record of observed data therefore we must assume a dependence structure in time and a stationary framework because the non stationary hypothesis implies a priori attributions supported by deductive reasoning that go beyond the scope of this paper koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 under the assumption of stationarity bunde et al 2003 and volpi et al 2015 have shown that the independence condition is not necessary in order to apply the classical equation of return period i e the inverse of the exceedance probability following volpi et al 2015 this paper highlights how temporal dependence does not alter the average interarrival time formulation even in stochastic processes characterized by cyclo stationarity a characteristic that hydrological and other geophysical processes exhibit at sub annual scales furthermore we investigate here the potential application of this important property of return period derived from the full available record for frequency analysis specifically we show how the return period can be directly estimated from raw data records of a time dependent process regardless of its dependence structure under stationary or cyclo stationary conditions this alternative approach for return period estimation which is proposed here for the first time and denoted as complete time series analysis cta is compared to the traditional approach based on frequency analysis of annual maxima am which constitutes the basis of traditional extreme value analysis indeed we usually analyze am to catch the tail of the distribution of the parent process where the latter is the process of interest hence the rationale behind cta is to exploit all the information provided by observational data marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 with the objective of better estimating the return period in a wider range of values not only at the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory note indeed that small to moderate return period values are still of interest in several practical problems such as pluvial flooding furthermore it is important to stress that cta provides different return period estimates with respect to annual maxima by considering all the occurrences of the dangerous values e g exceedance of the random variable above any threshold value of interest within the observed record as it will be discussed later on hence we aim at exploring the potential conveniences of cta compared to traditional approaches and not to elaborate on the return period concept see volpi et al 2015 for this reason in this article we base and limit our investigation to the non parametric approach two illustrative examples are presented both relying on synthetic processes the first one makes use of a very simple process whose correlation structure is known a priori the second example resembles the main characteristics of a real word process future research will focus on the parametric implementation of cta for its practical use in real world cases indeed the problem of fitting a model to the complete record of observations and the evaluation of the related uncertainty deserves further attention the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly recalls the definitions of return period available in the literature and illustrates the properties of the interarrival time for stationary and cyclo stationary processes in section 3 the new approach for return period estimation relying on frequency analysis of complete times series cta is introduced as an alternative to traditional methods based on annual maxima and peaks over threshold section 4 in sections 5 and 6 complete time series analysis is compared to the standard approach using annual maxima for a simple stationary process and for a cyclo stationary process that mimics the characteristics of a real world phenomenon respectively section 7 is concerned with the potential issues related to the application of the proposed approach in real word problems while the conclusion section summarizes the main findings of this paper 2 return period definitions and properties let z τ be a stochastic process that represents a natural process evolving in continuous time τ as observations of z are only made in discrete time we consider here the corresponding discrete time process z j that is obtained by sampling z τ at constant time intervals δ τ i e z j z j δ τ where j 1 2 denotes discrete time we make the only assumption that z j is a stationary process fully described in terms of its marginal probability function p z z pr z z and up to the second order in terms of joint distribution by its autocorrelation function ρ θ γ θ γ 0 with θ 0 1 2 where γ θ cov z j z j θ and ρ θ 1 1 further we denote the mean of the process as μ e z j and its standard deviation σ γ 0 for design and risk assessment purposes we are interested in the occurrence of dangerous events that might result in a system or structure failure we define here a dangerous event as the exceedance at the δ τ scale of a threshold level a z z for instance the discharge exceeding a given high threshold level potentially causing the flooding of an urbanized area the probability of a is given by pr a pr z z 1 p z z 1 pr b where b denotes the complementary event of a in hydrological applications as well as in many other engineering fields the rareness of the dangerous events is usually measured in terms of return period t z thus assuming that the event a will occur on average once every t years which is the time unit commonly used for return periods in hydrology mathematically it is 1 t δ τ e x x 1 xf x x where x is the number of discrete time steps to an occurrence of the event a and f x x pr x x is its probability mass function pmf note that in eq 1 which only refers to discrete time processes t is measured in units of time i e δ τ if δ τ 1 year the return period is measured in years as highlighted by previous literature studies see e g fernández and salas 1999 douglas et al 2002 the return period can be defined as the average of i the waiting time that is the time interval ranging from the present to the next threshold exceedance or ii the interarrival time that is the time elapsing between any two successive realizations of the dangerous event as explained later on we adopt here the second definition which implicitly assumes that a dangerous event has just occurred we remark that such a definition is customary in hydrological applications see e g chow et al 1988 kottegoda and rosso 1997 salvadori et al 2007 for convenience herein we express discrete time as t j j 0 where j 0 is the current instant of time when the dangerous event has just occurred therefore the discrete time process is indicated as z t and t 0 denotes the present as a consequence the pmf of the interarrival time can be written as fernández and salas 1999 2 f x x pr b 1 b 2 b x 1 a x a 0 pr a 0 b 1 b 2 b x 1 a x pr a 0 then the definition of return period based on the concept of interarrival time relies on a conditional probability the average interarrival time is obtained by substituting eq 2 into 1 if z t is a purely random process then the return period t is given by e g stedinger et al 1993 3 t z δ τ 1 1 p z z regardless of the definition used for x in eq 1 i e waiting time or interarrival time the above relationship holds true even if the stationary and independent process is not sampled at constant time intervals in this case δ τ is the average time interval between consecutive samples koutsoyiannis 2008 although the independence condition is typically assumed as a necessary condition for eq 3 it has been recently demonstrated by volpi et al 2015 independently from the conceptual arguments presented by bunde et al 2003 that the return period t z defined as the average interarrival time is expressed by eq 3 even for processes correlated in time with any type of dependence structure of z an important and not very well known fact that is exploited in the following development conversely when based on the concept of waiting time the formulation of the return period strictly depends on the correlation structure of the process specifically for any dangerous events a or threshold levels z the average waiting time is an increasing function of the correlation of the process thus resulting in values larger than the average interarrival time which ignores correlation hence for processes which are positively correlated in time such as most hydrological processes eq 3 returns a lower bound in terms of t z although the average interarrival time t z remains the same for correlated and independent processes the probability that the threshold z is exceeded in a given period can be very different in the two cases in fact if a dangerous event occurs at present time then the conditional probability of occurrence of another dangerous event at successive instants of time will be greater than the independent case this yields that the probability mass function of the interarrival time that corresponds to the probability of failure will have a larger mass for small temporal values and a lower mass elsewhere hence a larger variance with respect to the independent case since the average waiting time is an increasing function of the variance of the interarrival time as shown in volpi et al 2015 the latter characteristic of the interarrival time distribution explains why the average waiting time is larger than the average interarrival time as a further consequence the definition of return period based on the interarrival time might result in higher values of the probability of failure with respect to the independent case the reader is referred to volpi et al 2015 for further details on the theoretical properties of both definitions of t 2 1 cyclo stationary processes the property of interarrival time mentioned above has been derived based on the assumption that the underlying process z is stationary see the appendix b in volpi et al 2015 for details however many natural processes exhibit statistical properties that are invariant to a shift of the time origin by integral multiples of a certain period π due to e g the seasonal variability of environmental phenomena at sub annual scales koutsoyiannis 2016 in stochastic hydrology such processes are usually modelled by cyclo stationary processes with period π let us consider a cyclo stationary process that is characterized by a joint distribution function that varies within the time period π typically equal to one year such that pr b t pr b π t pr b t b t 1 pr b π t b π t 1 and so on for such a process the pmf given in eq 2 can be regarded as the pmf of the interarrival time conditional to the occurrence of the dangerous event at time t 0 i e f x x t 0 for any value of t this conditional pmf can be written as 4 f x x t pr a t b t 1 b t 2 b t x 1 a t x pr a t to account for the possible occurrence of a at every instant of time t within the period π we marginalize the above conditional probability by summing the pmf in eq 4 with respect to all the possible values of time t t t π 1 according to their probability of occurrence the latter quantity is nothing else than the conditional probability pr a t t t t π 1 hence it is 5 f x x t t t t π 1 pr a t t t t π 1 pr a t b t 1 b t 2 b t x 1 a t x pr a t t t t π 1 pr a t r t t π 1 pr a r pr a t b t 1 b t 2 b t x 1 a t x pr a t finally the average interarrival time of the cyclo stationary process is obtained by substituting in eq 1 the pmf given in eq 5 thus obtaining 6 t z δ τ 1 1 p z z where p z z 1 r t t π 1 pr a r 1 1 r t t π 1 pr b r is the marginal probability of non exceeding the threshold value z within any period t t π 1 since we are dealing with a cyclo stationary processes p z z remains the same for any t the derivation of eq 6 is given in appendix a while for cyclo stationary processes the exceeding probability pr a t 1 pr b t varies with time t t t π 1 the return period of the dangerous event a is a constant value independent of time t and it is expressed again by the classical equation of return period 3 novel return period estimation complete time series analysis cta the property that the average interarrival time i e return period is not affected by the dependence structure of the underlying process even for cyclo stationary processes sheds a new light on the problem of return period estimation in practical problems under the hypothesis of stationarity or cyclo stationarity in the case of processes exhibiting seasonality and sampled at the sub annual scale the return period can be estimated by using eq 3 starting from any kind of observational data independent or correlated in time thereby potentially exploiting all the available information on the underlying process hence the only necessary assumption is that of stationarity but stationarity is also related to ergodicity which in turn is a prerequisite to make inference from data as previously mentioned the stationarity issue goes beyond the scope of this work the interested readers are referred to the work of koutsoyiannis 2014 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 koutsoyiannis 2016 serinaldi et al 2018 and luke et al 2017 for a comprehensive discussion let z z 1 z n be an observed realization of the stochastic process z t where n is the length of the data series following its formal definition based on the interarrival time the empirical return period could be estimated by first deriving from z the sample of the interarrival time for each value of the threshold z i e x z x 1 x 2 x η z and then averaging in time as in eq 1 this approach can be applied only in the case of very long time series very large n for which the size of the interarrival series η z is large enough to return reliable estimates for high threshold values z in hydrological applications the length of the observed series is usually less than one hundred years e g at the daily or at the hourly scale hence it is important to exploit all the available information for sample estimates the empirical return period can be obtained by directly applying eq 3 to the entire time series z where the cumulative probability function p z is substituted by a probability model inferred from the observed data for simplicity we adopt here a non parametric approach by substituting p z with its empirical counterpart the empirical distribution function edf denoted in the following as f n provides an estimate of the distribution function of the underlying stochastic process e g kolmogorov 1933 let z i i 1 n be a sequence of dependent and equally distributed random variables then f n is defined as the fraction of random variables that are less than or equal to the specified value z i e 7 f n z 1 n i 1 n i z i z where i z i z is the indicator of the event z i z the estimate f n z is obtained by considering in eq 7 the outcome z instead of the random variables the edf in eq 7 is an unbiased estimator of the marginal probability function i e e f n z p z z this means that the dependence structure of the underlying process does not affect the expectation of the edf while it affects its covariance as reported by azriel and schwartzman 2015 moreover these authors remark that the estimator in eq 7 is consistent for all gaussian stationary ergodic processes that are characterized by an autocorrelation function decreasing to zero as the lag time goes to infinity i e the necessary condition for ergodicity the latter case includes both short and long range dependent processes such as the hurst kolmogorov process koutsoyiannis 2016 the consistency property of the edf continues to hold for non gaussian distributions under various forms of dependence see e g dedecker and merlevéde 2007 wu 2006 note that in the case of cyclo stationary processes where the marginal probability distribution changes with time within the period π f n directly provides an estimate of p z z which takes into account the variability during the period of the marginal probability function i e the alternation of events characterized by a different probability of exceedance the computational approach based on the complete edf complete time series analysis cta returns on average the same results to those based on the observed interarrival time series provided that n hence η z is very large an illustration example showing the latter property will be presented in the following sections the estimation approach proposed in this section makes use of the whole available information on the process z i e the complete time series z with the aim of returning a reliable and robust estimate of the return period of the dangerous event z z for any threshold value z i e in a broader range of values with respect to the traditional approaches used in extreme value analysis it is important to stress that cta requires the availability of an uninterrupted record of observations i e z where the process is sampled at constant time intervals δ τ indeed this is a necessary condition for the property of the average interarrival time to hold true as explained in volpi et al 2015 in the following sections we compare cta with the traditional sampling methods used in extreme value analysis thus highlighting advantages and limitations of both the strategies 4 traditional approaches for return period estimation since independence of z t is usually invoked for the derivation of eq 3 e g benjamin and cornell 1970 p 233 kottegoda and rosso 1997 p 190 and chow et al 1988 p 383 it is common practice in hydrological applications to implement some techniques for data selection aimed to allow the assumption of the statistical independence of the observations these techniques constitute the basis for the extreme value analysis whose objective is to quantify the stochastic behavior of a process at unusually large or small levels that potentially lead to the failure of a system coles 2001 salvadori et al 2007 classical methods for extreme and independent value selection are the block maxima approach where the block generally coincides with the year annual maxima am and the more complex peak over threshold approach pot the wide popularity of am relies on its simplicity but also on the limited access in the past to regularly sampled long observed series of the random variable of interest although it is necessary to have available the complete series to establish if an extreme event is an annual maximum it was common practice to take note essentially of the values reached during extreme events especially in old times when the observation of the hydrological variables was not systematic apart from a few noteworthy cases such as that described in calenda et al 2005 when a complete time series of observations is available pot is adopted in practical applications especially when the length of the observed period is short to select the largest possible amount of data yet respecting the independence assumption pot originated in hydrology with the rationale that if additional information about the extreme upper tail were used besides the annual maxima then more accurate and reliable estimates of the parameters and quantiles of extreme value distributions would be obtained see e g katz et al 2002 this is the same rationale behind cta as described in the previous section however it is important to stress that while cta does not require any data selection pot asks for additional computational efforts to select only the peaks over the threshold i e the maximum of a cluster of values all exceeding the threshold and necessitates the introduction of further information or parameters in order to select among those peaks only independent ones see e g coles 2001 for simplicity in this work we compare cta to am to avoid confusion we use y to indicate the annual maximum of the random variable z the annual maximum time series is derived from z as y y 1 y n n y where n is the number of observations y i max z n y i 1 1 z n y i and n y is the number of time intervals δ τ per year e g n y 365 in the case z is observed at the daily scale the empirical return period of the values in y can be evaluated by using the same procedures described above for the time series z and based on the edf since n n y n 4 1 purely random and stationary processes the probability distribution function of y is by definition different from that of z since we aim at exploring the difference between the two under general conditions cyclo stationarity and persistence for the sake of clarity we start from the well known stationary and independent case then ρ θ 0 for θ 0 by introducing a general framework that is instrumental to the discussion reported in the following sections given a threshold value z the probability of annual maxima p y z pr y z can be easily derived from that of the parent process as e g coles 2001 8 p y z p z z n y by using eq 3 the corresponding return period is derived 9 t y z δ τ n y 1 p z z n y where δ τ n y is one year note that here n y is not a random variable since z is an observed series of the stochastic process z sampled at a constant time intervals δ τ hence the number of observations in each year is constant being uniquely determined by the time interval δ τ conversely in traditional extreme value theory the exponent in eq 8 is not a constant being the number of peaks of clusters of values but rather can be regarded as a realization of a poisson distributed random variable this yields a different form for the probability distribution of annual maxima which gives numerical values not significantly different from those provided by eq 8 for large p z z koutsoyiannis 2004 if n y 1 cta obviously gives the same results of am if n y 1 which means that δ τ 1 year eq 9 results in larger values with respect to 1 1 p z z as shown in fig 1 note that the figure depicts the theoretical return period of annual maxima as function of that of the continuous process i e when assuming n y for any kind of process z in other words it is the case of infinite sample length n for convenience the return period of annual maxima is denoted by t y while that of the parent process by t z both are measured in years from now on the figure shows to what extent am results in larger values of the return period with respect to that of the underlying process or in other words the probability of y z is smaller than that of the dangerous events z z this is due to a wastage of information during any year additional events may have occurred that are excluded by the analysis because such data are not the annual maximum in the year they arose as in the example depicted in fig 2 a for the sake of illustration fig 2 shows one year of a lognormal ar 1 daily time series with mean μ 1 variance σ 2 1 and lag 1 correlation coefficient ρ 1 0 panel a and ρ 1 0 85 panel b note that seasonal variability is not considered in this independent and stationary example the figure depicts with red dots the information discarded by the annual maxima approach red circles in the estimation of the return period of the event z 4 furthermore these events might be possibly larger than the maximum in other years it also follows that the minimum value of the return period of annual maxima is equal to 1 year which means that based on annual maxima analysis we cannot measure the rareness of events that occur more frequently than once every year as the threshold z increases we look to more and more intense events the return period of annual maxima t y tends to that of the parent process t z indeed very large events are expected to be always selected as annual maxima hence the wastage of information is reduced toward zero as the threshold increases the difference t y t z denoted in fig 1 as d reduces to less than 5 of t z only when t z becomes larger than about 10 years this means that relatively frequent events that might be of interest when the expected damage is modest are generally underestimated when only the annual maxima are available the asymptotic convergence of the annual maxima distribution to that of the parent process for high threshold values about t z 10 years according to the above figure is at the basis of extreme value theory 5 persistent stationary processes the difference between annual maxima and the parent process for those events that are characterized by small to medium values of the return period is expected to worsen in the case of time dependent positively correlated processes where the dangerous events tend to occur in clusters see the example shown in fig 2b where the number of events neglected by annual maxima approach the red dots increases with respect to the independent case depicted fig 2a the latter condition is that usually matched in hydrological applications for instance the rainfall amount observed at given time scale exhibits a complex persistent behavior in time affected by seasonality which depends on the time scale itself hence we compare here the empirical return period of the complete time series to that of annual maxima for time persistent processes by making use of a simple synthetic example in this section we consider an autoregressive process of order one ar 1 supposed to represent a stationary and persistent natural process observed at the daily scale i e δ τ 1 day the process analyzed here is characterized by a marginal lognormal probability distribution function with mean μ and variance σ 2 while its time dependence structure is ruled by the lag 1 correlation coefficient ρ 1 we assume here μ 1 and two different values for the variance σ 2 1 or σ 2 5 further we let the correlation coefficient vary between 0 independent process and 0 99 persistent process noting that we are ignoring seasonality here 5 1 theoretical difference between cta and am for persistent processes we first compare the empirical return period of the annual maxima to that of the complete series by analyzing a very long series specifically n 365 10 5 days i e 10 5 years this analysis is intended to investigate the theoretical difference between cta and am for persistent processes when the accuracy of the return period estimate is essentially not affected by the length of the observed period as in the independent case discussed in section 4 1 results are represented in fig 3 for several values of ρ 1 ranging between 0 5 and 0 99 and for σ 2 1 fig 3a and σ 2 5 fig 3b the independent case ρ 1 0 is reported as a reference values of ρ 1 0 0 5 are not considered since the difference with the independent case is negligible finally we look at results for return period values included between 1 day that is the minimum value that can be explored based on the temporal resolution of the available series and 1000 years such that estimates are not influenced by the finite length of the simulated series we recall here that the theoretical return period according to eq 3 of the parent process is fully determined by the lognormal probability distribution which is represented in fig 3 by the magenta curve the return period estimated from the complete series returns for any ρ 1 the theoretical distribution black dashed curves that overlap for all ρ 1 the magenta curve thus it is not affected at all by the correlation structure of the process as demonstrated by volpi et al 2015 since in this numerical experiment n is very large also the empirical return period computed as the average of the interarrival time between successive events z z i e by strictly following eq 1 returns the theoretical value for any ρ 1 and for threshold values z up to that represented in the figure the latter result which numerically demonstrates the theoretical finding by volpi et al 2015 is illustrated in fig 4 for the specific process characterized by the parameter combination σ 2 5 and ρ 1 0 85 in fig 3 the return period estimated by selecting the annual maxima t y colored curves assumes values larger than the theoretical ones pertaining to the parent process or the independent case ρ 1 0 black curve this implies that the corresponding z values are smaller we also notice that for ρ 1 0 9 the annual maxima span over a wide range covering values that are even smaller than the mean of the process μ 1 vertical dashed line in the figure on average the number of daily data exceeding the threshold z min y that are discarded by am per year ranges in between 10 and 350 values when ρ 1 increases from 0 to 0 99 respectively for both σ 2 1 and σ 2 5 further the return period estimate converges only for large values of z to the theoretical value with a rate of convergence that depends on the persistence of the process hence the larger is ρ 1 the slower is the rate of convergence of t y to t z an important role is also played by the variance of the process in the case σ 2 5 fig 3b the convergence of the complete distribution to the theoretical one is even slower than in the case depicted in fig 3a σ 2 1 to give a quantitative measure of the deviation of the annual maxima estimate from the theoretical return period of the parent process the difference d t y t z for t z 10 years moves from 0 5 years for ρ 1 0 i e 5 as in the theoretical independent case depicted in fig 1 to 150 200 years for ρ 1 0 99 and σ 2 1 5 note that return period estimate based on cta is compared here only to that pertaining to annual maxima but a similar comparison could be made by considering the pot approach it is expected that return period estimates based on pot result in intermediate values between am and cta as a function of the threshold used to select peaks but closer to am estimates note indeed that cta considers all the values exceeding the threshold z see e g fig 2b while pot uses only the independent maxima of clusters of values exceeding z the difference between the two approaches might be relevant for practical purposes as discussed later in section 7 5 2 effects of finite time series length the situation depicted in fig 3 is not met in practical applications when the limited length of the observed series significantly affects the return period estimation in terms of both accuracy and uncertainty generally speaking accuracy is expected to improve while uncertainty decreases when increasing the length of the dataset of observations of a given process note that here the number of observations is not a direct measure of the amount of information provided by data because of the correlation among the observed values in complete time series hence we aim at comparing the overall robustness of return period estimates for small sample lengths obtained by cta instead of the selected annual maxima which are commonly assumed to be independent to investigate the latter issue we repeated the above analysis for different values of n within the range from 10 to 200 years for a large number a synthetic time series m 10 000 results obtained when assuming σ 2 5 and ρ 1 0 6 are depicted in fig 5 the figure summarizes the empirical probability estimates together with their 95 uncertainty bounds derived by using both methods for some values of n ranging in between 10 and 200 years note that results are presented here in terms of edf to avoid infinite values of return period that might occur due to the use of eq 1 when z is larger than the maximum observed value in the dataset if the edf in eq 7 is normalized with respect to n 1 instead of n we obtain the classic weibull plotting position formula makkonen 2006 indeed the latter is usually adopted to avoid infinite values of the estimated return period for the sample maximum this issue goes beyond the scope of this analysis which is intended to discuss the variability of return period estimate due to finite sample lengths it will be considered in future works together with the problem of model fitting fig 5 shows how the am estimate converges on the average only with increasing t moving from fig 5a to c to that of the complete time series which overlaps the theoretical one for any sample length n as expected the uncertainty bounds reduce with the sample size n uncertainty also reduces as t increases however this unexpected behavior is a consequence of the fact that probability is upper bounded to unity and due to the adoption of the edf given in eq 7 notwithstanding this it is worth noting that am uncertainty bounds are narrower than those pertaining to cta for any value of t this means that the selection of annual maxima results in an undersampling effect that manifests itself in terms of underestimation of the exceeding probability of the parent process i e overestimation of the non exceeding probability or of the return period as discussed in fig 3 and of its sampling variability correlation in time which in this case is fully represented by the lag 1 correlation coefficient ρ 1 significantly affects the accuracy and the variability of the return period estimates obtained by both methods results for all values of ρ 1 considered in this illustrative example are summarized in fig 6 for t 5 years fig 6a and b depict the behavior of the average probability estimates based on am panel a and cta panel b it can be noticed that the bias resulting from am is strongly enhanced by high values of ρ 1 conversely the average probability estimates based on cta are unbiased for any ρ 1 and n further the underestimation of the sampling variability which is observed in fig 5 for ρ 1 0 6 when using am magnifies in the cases of processes strongly correlated in time to illustrate the latter issue we depict in fig 6 also the coefficient of variation c v of the probability estimates for t 5 years computed by analyzing annual maxima fig 6c and the complete time series fig 6d the figure clearly shows that while c v is comparable for small values of ρ 1 large differences arise when ρ 1 approaches to one while c v of cta estimate increases with the persistence of the process that of am reduces the latter behaviour is a consequence of the fact that probability that is upper bounded by one is overestimated when analyzing annual maxima a similar analysis could be performed in terms of quantiles by investigating how the order statistics of annual maxima and complete time series are influenced by the correlation structure of the process however slightly different results not shown are obtained in terms of empirical return period quantiles with respect to those obtained in terms of edf as in fig 6 in fact the probability distribution of the order statistics does not correspond on average to the theoretical probability distribution of the underlying process david and nagaraja 2003 moreover it is affected by the autocorrelation structure of the process conversely the edf expressed by eq 7 is an unbiased estimator regardless of the type and strength of the correlation structure 6 persistent and cyclo stationary processes in order to provide some insights into the use of cta in applications we analyze here a synthetic process which resembles the main statistical properties of an hydrological observed series specifically we analyze a daily discharge process that is characterized by non normality a strong seasonal pattern and by long range persistence the type of analysis envisaged here requires a very long series of data hence for the sake of illustration we consider a fractional autoregressive moving average process farma p d q which models the tiber river daily discharge time series observed at roma ripetta station observations cover a period of 54 years from 1930 to 1983 but only the first 15 years were used to calibrate the linear parametric model as an example fig 7 a shows the observed series black line for a time window of three years from 1933 to 1936 the seasonal pattern clearly emerges from the structure of the autocorrelation function as depicted in fig 7b black line the model was calibrated after normalizing the data based on a log normal transformation and removing seasonality fig 7 shows a subsample of the simulated series compared to the observed one panel a and the corresponding autocorrelation functions panel b thus highlighting the capability of the model in reproducing the complex behavior of the real word process the reader is referred to grimaldi 2004 for a detailed description of model structure calibration and performance we remark again that the model employed here is for the sole sake of illustration and other general and more parsimonious methods could have been used to generate synthetic series from the observed process with any arbitrary autocorrelation structure as discussed by koutsoyiannis 2016 yet this goes beyond the scope of this work we estimated the empirical return periods for both the annual maxima and the complete time series by substituting in eq 3 the non exceedance probability with the edf calculated using eq 7 which gives the average non exceeding probability within the year π the empirical return periods are depicted in fig 8 a since the synthetic series is very long the figure depicts the theoretical difference between the two unaffected by sample length am significantly overestimates the return period of the complete time series if the latter is considered as a benchmark for return periods up to 100 years here the bias of am with respect to cta d t y t z for t z 10 years is equal to 10 years which means a 100 relative difference the latter value is very close to that pertaining to the ar 1 lognormal process with similar value of ρ 1 and σ 2 5 discussed in section 5 2 although the variation coefficient here is smaller about 0 7 with respect to that pertaining to the ar 1 process about 2 3 if a finite length sample is used to estimate return periods the difference between am and cta might be enhanced the effects of finite sample length for this cyclo stationary long range persistent process is illustrated in panels b d of fig 8 in panels b and c the empirical return periods of two samples of 54 years equal to the length of the observed time series drawn from the farma calibrated model are compared to the corresponding theoretical ones the full length samples the empirical return period estimates for the event z 1500 m 3 s are depicted in panel d the average return period of annual maxima overestimates that pertaining to the complete time series also showing a smaller dispersion around its average value 7 discussion on cta application in real world cases it is important to note that the cta approach to return period estimate considered here generally differs from the common methods used in hydrology e g in flood frequency analysis as explained in the following cta gives the return period of the event a defined as the exceedance of a threshold value i e z t z at the temporal resolution δ τ at which the continuous process z is sampled in other words it accounts for all the interarrival times between any successive values exceeding z at the δ τ scale including those elapsing between successive values of z t that remain above the threshold z i e simply equal to δ τ see fig 2 instead in the conventional flood analysis the above interarrival times are usually not considered the significance of such a return period estimate depends on the particular goal at hand and on the temporal resolution δ τ that should be comparable not much smaller with respect to the temporal scale that characterizes the natural phenomenon the temporal scale should not be confused with the characteristic scale of the correlation structure i e the integral scale which itself depends on the temporal resolution δ τ for instance in the example provided in section 6 cta accounts for the consecutive exceedance of any threshold value of flow discharge at the daily scale δ τ 1 day which is a small temporal scale with respect to the average duration of a flood event in this case if the purpose of the analysis is the assessment of the levee system it might be not of interest to know if the levee height is exceeded the day after once exceedance is already occurred the day before on the other hand it might be important to account for successive exceedances at the temporal resolution of the process δ τ e g when we are evaluating the return period of daily rainfall to design a urban drainage system against pluvial flooding and the critical duration of the system that maximizes the peak discharge is approximately one day further as anticipated in the introduction for simplicity reasons we based our analyses on a non parametric estimation approach i e using the edf in eq 7 instead of a model fitted to the data however direct estimation of the statistics of a process is generally not possible merely from the data and data alone do not enable extrapolation of estimates as often required for planning and design purposes koutsoyiannis 2016 thus the issue of fitting appropriate models in the context of the proposed approach deserves further investigation although uncertainty is inherent in any statistical model such uncertainty could be reduced by the utilization of all the available information as well as by judicious choices of model the use of cta naturally implements seasonality handling in frequency analysis as recently discussed by allamanno et al 2011 see also rasmussen and rosbjerg 1991 and strupczewski et al 2012 disregarding seasonality in hydro climatic extreme value analysis based on annual maxima or pot leads to an overestimation of return period which is less safe the problem is solved by taking into account the events that occurred in all the seasons by fitting different distributions to the maxima in separate seasons or months and mixing the seasonal distributions according to their probability of occurrence see e g mascaro 2018 or by directly including the seasonal rate of occurrence of the exceedance events in the pot approach as in rasmussen and rosbjerg 1991 and allamanno et al 2011 cta implements the former method by considering for frequency analysis all the observed values in each of the seasons this could eventually require the adoption of complex probability models e g mixed models the adoption of complex probability models could also help handle the heterogeneity due to the possible superposition of different physical processes ruling the statistical behaviour of the random variable of interest rainfall floods etc in fact the general understanding appears to be that low and ordinary hydrological events could be dominated by a different process merz et al 2008 thus having little or no contribution to the larger events this might emerge from the edf of the annual maxima by manifesting a different statistical behavior for ordinary and extreme events this heterogeneity is expected to emerge more strongly when analyzing the complete time series that brings a larger number of values also on the upper tail of the probability distribution function with respect to annual maxima in this regard we believe that a priori physical knowledge about the underlying processes if available could be included in the analysis to support the assumption of complex mixed models for modeling and extrapolation purposes see e g calenda et al 2009 in absence of additional knowledge on the physical process the heterogeneity assumption cannot be truly tested however all events generally occur under the combination of numerous factors so that the probabilistic treatment of processes is by definition a macroscopic approach that does not care about each of the specific factors and reduces to fitting the most appropriate model to the empirical distribution of the complete data set or to its part that is of interest for the specific problem at hand finally we remark that cta is based on the availability of a discrete time uninterrupted record of observations with an adequate temporal resolution which according to our analysis affects the results in the case of few missing data within long observational records some temporal or spatial interpolation techniques could be adopted to fill the gaps in general large gaps could affect cta more than am or pot the improvement of large datasets of environmental observations is expected to favor cta approach in the future 8 conclusions a new approach for return period estimation is proposed denoted as complete time series analysis cta this approach relies on the property that the average interarrival time between successive events e g z z is not affected by the correlation structure of the underlying process regardless of the persistence of the process this means that independence is not a necessary condition when return period is defined as the average of the interarrival time this also implies that no data selection techniques are needed to assure independence of the data for frequency analysis hence once stationarity can be assumed the return period can be computed by using the classical equation of return period the inverse of the exceedance probability starting from any kind of observational data independent or correlated in time thereby potentially exploiting all the available information on the parent process this property is extended herein to include cyclo stationary processes since hydrological and other geophysical processes typically manifest a weaker form of stationarity at sub annual scales connected to the seasonal variability of the environmental phenomena we compare the proposed approach to the simple method of annual maxima am typically adopted in extreme value analysis complete time series observed in discrete time at constant time intervals and annual maxima are inherently different processes that give subtly different information on the same underlying continuous process specifically cta describes the marginal behaviour of the whole parent process sampled in discrete time at a given temporal resolution while am describes the statistical behavior of its extremes the difference between cta and am are discussed herein by making use of two illustrative examples in both cases we adopt for the sake of illustration a non parametric approach by using the empirical probability distribution function of the annual maxima and the complete time series as an estimate of the marginal probability distribution function of the underlying process some general conclusions can be drawn from the analyses as listed in the following cta results in an accurate estimate of return period of the parent process for any intensity of the event i e threshold value z and on the average for any sample length regardless of the correlation structure and the seasonality of the parent process thus allowing to investigate a wider range of return period values not only the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory am leads to an overestimation of the return period and an underestimation of its sampling variability of the parent process for small to moderate return period values converging to cta estimates for large events this behaviour which is a consequence of data selection and is well known in the literature for independent processes is enhanced by time persistence of the underlying process further it is independent on average from the sample length return period estimates provided by cta are generally different with respect to that pertaining to annual maxima because cta considers all the occurrences of the dangerous events within the observed record their significance depends on the particular goal at hand and on the temporal resolution of the process that should be comparable with respect to the temporal scale that characterizes the natural phenomenon cta could be easily applied in the case of complex hydrological time series such as that discussed here that reproduces the main features of the tiber river daily discharge as observed at rome ripetta station which are typically characterized by non normality seasonality long range persistence and possibly heterogeneity we found that the estimation of the return period using cta could be a convenient alternative to existing methods as function of the problem at hand for a few reasons first the method is easy to implement it can be employed for any sample length without any data selection e g events selection in flood analysis moreover cta always results in more conservative return period estimates i e smaller estimated values with higher uncertainty by exploiting all the information content of the observed data i e low ordinary and extreme discharge values that make up the complete time series and fully describe the seasonal pattern the difference between cta and am tends toward zero as we look at events that are more and more extreme simply because very large events are expected to be always selected as annual maxima thus cta and extreme value analysis are expected to give the same results in terms of the upper tail of the distribution thus supporting the adoption of extreme value analysis when the interest is in large return period values note however that very intense events typically pertain to the extrapolation range where differences among the methods could emerge when a probability distribution model is fitted to the sample hence additional work is needed to fully understand advantages and limitations of cta in engineering practice since the main scope of this work was to explore the potential advantages of the complete time series approach compared to traditional ones we have not addressed the important issue of the inference of the statistical distribution of the hydrological variable of interest future work will investigate the problem of fitting appropriate candidate models able to reproduce the complex potentially heterogeneous statistical behavior of complete time series declaration of interests none acknowledgement we acknowledge the
