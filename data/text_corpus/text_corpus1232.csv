6160,in this study a review of the developed methods to estimate groundwater withdrawal gww from aquifers by pumping wells is provided then a method adopted by iran s basic studies bureau of water resources management company for estimation of gww through 536 aquifers across iran is presented and modified this so called representative pumping wells network rpwn approach is a combination of statistical and rate and time methods which has been implemented for all aquifers in iran since 2007 the rpwn approach is based on the overlaying of 10 important features in a gis environment and classified in a number of zones in which their withdrawals are statistically different the representative pumping wells in each zone are sampled for rpwn based on a multi objective optimization three aquifers of tehran arak and qazvin in iran are selected as real cases studies to demonstrate the efficiency of the modified rpwn approach metered pumpage of the all active wells obtained from the last official inventory in 2007 is considered as true gww values to evaluate the current and modified rpwns based on modified approach 50 representative pumping wells rpws are selected for each aquifer of tehran arak and qazvin respectively 58 11 and 50 less than number of wells considered in the current rpwn whereas the computational errors of gww by the current rpwn are between 19 9 and 26 2 the modified rpwn shows much smaller errors in the range of 0 2 to 1 41 moreover the modified rpwn reduces the cost of data compilation to 10 6 to 58 0 of the current rpwn the results of this study demonstrate that the modified rpwn approach is a robust efficient effective and consistent tool and particularly suited to the aquifers that pumping wells provides a dense observation network in which data compilation of gww impose a great deal of financial burden keywords groundwater withdrawal pumping wells rate and time method statistical approach representative pumping wells network 1 introduction during the last 100 years the global population has more than quadrupled 7 billion crop land area has doubled 15 million km 2 while irrigated area has increased six fold 3 0 million km 2 and water withdrawal has increased by nearly 8 times 4000 km 3 yr wada et al 2016 while 98 7 of all liquid freshwater is composed of groundwater rejani et al 2008 these resources contributes 42 36 and 27 of global water used for irrigation households and manufacturing respectively döll et al 2012 overexploitation of groundwater resources during this period has exerted financial social and political pressure to find a solution sophocleous 2004 ngigi et al 2008 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 easy to access the reliability of groundwater resources during droughts technological advances such as cheaper well drilling techniques and the popularization of the submersible pump make groundwater resources an excellent catalyst for rapid socioeconomic development in many regions giordano 2006 scanlon et al 2012 a recent drought occurring in the middle east in 2007 highlighted the need for sustainable management of water resources world bank 2007 in many countries of the middle east groundwater resources are nonrenewable insignificant natural recharge and monitoring the rates at which they are utilized under anthropogenic activities is important for sustainable planning purposes joodaki et al 2014 in highly productive agricultural areas the groundwater withdrawals from pumping wells are often unrestricted and unmonitored so that a consistent picture of rates of groundwater depletion is difficult to construct famiglietti et al 2011 groundwater withdrawal is one of the most significant anthropogenic activities affecting regional groundwater flow paths in addition to the recharge is the important parameter of water budget and regional groundwater flow modeling moreo et al 2003 the groundwater withdrawal gww is difficult to quantify and exhibit a certain degree of uncertainty and may vary both spatially and temporally across aquifer hartono 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 hydrological evaluation of an aquifer system for appropriate groundwater management requires detailed knowledge about the volume of groundwater withdrawals hurr and litke 1989 murkowski 2014 pumping rate also affects human induced geohazards such as saltwater intrusion and land subsidence lin et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 parizi et al 2019 quantitative estimation of groundwater pumping allows the estimation of groundwater storage constructing of groundwater hydrological models evaluation of sustainability of groundwater resources management and planning of groundwater use and conservation kim et al 2008 tsanis and apostolaki 2009 gww is significant yet an often poorly understood and unmeasured component of the water balance model ruud et al 2004 monitoring of pumping rate for all wells across the aquifer and equipping them to measurement instruments is impractical due to costs time and effort to finish such a task especially in a large aquifer with heavy withdrawal points hurr and litke 1989 lin et al 2013 the need for reliable estimates of the amount of groundwater withdrawn especially by the pumping wells is garnering increased global attention due to the growing demand for meeting water demands harris and diehl 2017 hosseini et al 2019 to face this challenge no comprehensive framework for accurate estimation of groundwater resource depletion currently exists lin et al 2013 surprisingly despite the importance of pumping volume estimation in aquifer management it often ranks as one of the least measured variables in hydroeconomic systems due to decentralized groundwater pumping inefficient management measurement errors and associated uncertainties sanchez 2003 ruud et al 2004 for example wang et al 2006 estimate the number of wells in china to be twice the official estimates in australia only 15 of the country s groundwater management units were metered by the year 2007 turral and fullagar 2007 an ideal procedure for estimating groundwater withdrawal volume should keep an acceptable level of accuracy and significantly reduce data collection luckey 1972 in the absence of direct metering of groundwater withdrawal by the pumping wells through installation of flow meters on pumping plants two general approaches have been developed to estimate pumping volume including direct and indirect approaches a summary of the studies using different methods to estimate gww by pumping wells are given in table 1 and are also discussed in the following sections 1 1 direct approaches to estimate gww direct approaches are those in which the withdrawal volume is either metered on each individual pumping plant manual or automatic or is calculated through rate time methods rtms by multiplying an average pumping rate by a cumulative pumping time hurr and litke 1989 since the direct measurement of pumping rate of all plants across the aquifer is impractical a representative pumping rate needs to be estimated energy consumption method is one of rtms which is based on finding the relation between well yield and energy costs through power consumption coefficients shah et al 2008 the relation of pumping rate and energy consumption for pumping is also served and well reported by hurr and litke 1989 obviously the rtms provide an accurate withdrawal estimation for stable hydrological and apparatus condition luckey 1972 needing comprehensive datasets about the type of pump electrical or diesel pumping plant efficiency application of a pressure correction factor and geometry of storage tanks especially for diesel plants and correction of transformers for electrical plants are amongst the method s drawbacks the estimation error of area wide groundwater withdrawal by rtms could be reduced by undertaking of random sampling of wells population and checking their yield and energy consumption church et al 2007 combined rtms and statistical methods the rtms methods may be combined with statistical methods such as random sampling regression analysis and analysis of variance anova to increase the accuracy of groundwater withdrawal estimation e g nrc 2002 averyt et al 2013 sims 2017 due to the historically uncertain quality of gww data statistical modeling may produce inconsistent results averyt et al 2013 in regression analysis gww is related to the most correlated explanatory variables e g groundwater storage recharge luckey 1972 hypothesis test of anova is used where the explanatory variables to be tested are discrete variables such as the source aquifer irrigation method and energy source this method is based on the assumptions that the data for each group are independent and are normally distributed with equal population variances it may be necessary to transform the data or use ranks in order to meet these assumptions moreo et al 2003 hypothesis tests e g anova and t test also help to test whether the grouped data of withdrawal volume have significantly different averages if so separation of the population into strata will produce improved estimates of total groundwater withdrawal than the use of ungrouped data 1 2 indirect approaches to estimate gww the indirect approaches could be classified in four groups of crop water requirement estimation method groundwater modeling approach water table fluctuation wtf method and satellite based estimation methods as described briefly in the following crop water requirement estimation method one of most frequently used approaches is measuring irrigated crop surface and then multiplying it by average crop water requirements this approach is used in the basins where the groundwater is pumped for irrigation calera belmonte et al 2005 this method has some drawbacks which mainly arise from the uncertainties due to climatological variables e g rainfall and temperature crop type and surface water sources affecting the crop water requirement and also challenges with the estimation of actual irrigation efficiency baker 1979 hartono 2005 groundwater modeling approach in this approach number of pumping wells and also withdrawal volume are calibrated through numerical modeling of groundwater system i e inverse modeling disadvantages of this approach is need to know the entire groundwater budget elements in time and space and the fitting problem when the number of pumping wells be very large groundwater flow models have been also used in a number of local and regional studies for assessment of pumping rates based on spatial and temporal conditions e g heath 1983 hartono 2005 however some challenges including the computational cost and insufficient knowledge of the pumping data lead to assigning the variability of pumping rates is not possible in most regional flow studies or the modeling of pumping rates and location values are mainly performed for small zones with few numbers of withdrawal wells guvanasen et al 2000 moreo et al 2003 estimated gww from the death valley regional flow system nevada and california by transient three dimensional ground water flow model withdrawal locations and depths of production intervals were estimated by the developed numerical model recently the usgs developed models for estimating gww at 1 290 thermoelectric plants based on electricity production to provide estimates independent from plant operator reported data collected by state agencies nrc 2002 according to this project statistical modeling of withdrawal coefficients liters per kilowatt hour is applied for groups of technologically similar plants the gww estimates obtained using the developed model were based on linked heat and water budgets constrained by power plant fuel consumption and electricity production generation technologies cooling system technologies and environmental variables diehl et al 2013 the model established five generation types classified by the types of steam turbines used to generate electricity water table fluctuation wtf method this approach uses the linkage between the change in groundwater storage with resulting water table fluctuations in unconfined aquifers tsanis and apostolaki 2009 the wtf method was used as early as the 1920s meinzer 1923 the wtf method is mostly designed for natural systems and often do not properly account for water level fluctuations from pumping discharge at the regional scale moreover this method requires the specific yield of the aquifer to estimate the variation of gw storage healy and cook 2002 healy and cook 2002 indicated that wtf is best applied over short periods in regions with sharp fluctuation of shallow water levels usually water table fluctuation method is coupled with the groundwater balance equation and a geostatistical method to estimate the annual gw pumping e g maréchal et al 2006 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 in situations where pumping data is lacking the withdrawals could be reasonably estimated by considering it as the closure term to the water balance model ruud et al 2004 satellite based estimation method however coupling the aforementioned methods by the remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis may promote the method s accuracy joodaki et al 2014 recent studies have clearly demonstrated that satellite driven estimates of gw depletion e g gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 is sufficiently accurate at large scales when combined with auxiliary hydrological datasets zaitchik et al 2008 satellite gravity has the ability of measuring groundwater storage change and ocean mass variations rodell et al 2009 usually satellite gravity approaches use depth of groundwater as the net result of recharge discharge process in the aquifer to calculate remaining saturation thickness resulting from the applied pumping rates famiglietti et al 2011 in most of the studies mentioned above and also those given in table 1 increasing attention is being given to groundwater withdrawal estimation through indirect techniques to have correct estimate of the pumping rates both the hydrologic and geologic characteristics of the aquifer should be considered lin et al 2013 in iran quantifying rates of groundwater depletion through pumping wells remains a challenge owing to a lack of monitoring infrastructure limited financial resources and the absence of water use reporting requirements iran is a developing country which is known as the fifth largest global gw user after india usa pakistan and china giordano 2009 döll et al 2012 iran has adopted and implemented combined statistical and rate and time methods to estimate average annual gww by licensed pumping wells over 536 study areas across the country established since 2007 iran water statistical yearbook 2012 due to lack of accurate and sustainable gw safe yield data and recharge rate in iran s aquifers incorporating the water table fluctuation method and gw balance model for iran s aquifers may introduce additional uncertainties into the developed model hosseini et al 2019 this study aimed to outline and modify a new approach to estimate groundwater withdrawal estimation from pumping wells adopted by iran s water resources basic studies bureau iran s bsb wrm company across this country this approach called representative pumping wells network rpwn has implemented over 536 study areas across iran since 2007 and could be considered as a promising tool to estimate gww by pumping wells in aquifer scale the rpwn method is a systematic combined procedure utilizes statistical random sampling and rate and time methods along with hydrogeological features of aquifer briefly in this approach pumping wells and aquifer characteristics are considered as fourteen explanatory or input variables the input features is rated and then overlaid in a gis environment the final overlaid map is then classified into different statistically independent zones random sampling is then used in each zone to select a few pumping wells for rpwn regarding two objectives of spatial coverage of sampled wells across the corresponding zone and their accuracy in the estimation of gww the official pumping data compilation e g pumping rate and time for all active pumping wells across an aquifer containing the true value of gww is used to determine the accuracy of the adopted rpwn the novelty of this study lies in the fact that the modified rpwn approach can be used in intensive pumped aquifers and efficiently reduces the costs and time associated with required data compilation to estimate gww whilst at the same time yielding acceptable accuracy adopting and implementing the original version of rpwn approach by iran s bsb wrm company for numerous aquifers 536 case studies across iran proves its efficiency for more than one decade since 2007 the paper following this introduction proceeds with the methodology of the adopted rpwn by the iran s bsb wrm company and modifications made to it in this study the description of the study area tehran aquifer the discussion of the results and the pertinent conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 rpwn approach the representative pumping wells network rpwn approach adopted by iran s bsb wrm company for estimating annual gww through pumpage across 536 study areas was established since 2007 the methodology of adopting rpwn as also shown schematically in fig 1 is based on a systematic combined procedure developed in gis platform this procedure uses rtm and a statistical methods for fourteen important features also called explanatory variable in gis environment iran s bsb wrm company 2007 these features including 1 type of aquifer confined semi confined unconfined leaky or perched 2 type of alluvial deposits clay silt sand 3 depth to groundwater in well location 4 aquifer thickness 5 depth of pumping well 6 pumping rate 7 annual pumping time 8 diameter of pump outlet pipe 9 date of the well drilling 10 drilling method of pumping well 11 water consumption type irrigation domestic and industrial 12 type of irrigation system 13 type of irrigated crop and 14 distance of well from main roads preparing these features in gis allows integration of large spatial data sets with different formats into one usable uniform format annual pumping time of each well is obtained by adding the recorded pumping time for different months pumping rate of each well is considered constant during its operation it should be mentioned that due to lack of field data some of these features may not be available or used for all aquifers therefore the explanatory variables used to adopt rpwn in all iran s aquifer are not same after reclassifying all input features the features are rated weighted overlapping method esri 2013 is used for overlapping of rated layers in raster format the final overlaid map is classified into different statistically independent zones the representative pumping wells rpws in each zone i are chosen based on optimizing two conflicting objectives 1 rpws in each zone should have the mean annual withdrawal volume mav rw close to the mean value of the total pumping wells in the corresponding zone mav pw fisher 2013 or 1 o f 1 minimizing i 1 n z 1 n rw j 1 n rw a v rw i j ma v rw 1 n pw j 1 n

are annual withdrawal volume estimated by rpws and total pumping wells according to official data compilation in each zone respectively 2 rpws in each zone should have an appropriate spatial coverage across the zone for this purpose a distance criterion is the most common for quantifying spatial coverage dhar and patil 2012 if inter well distances are summed up and maximized then it can ensure the desired goal wang et al 2016 2 of 2 m a x i m i z i n g j 1 n rw 1 l j 1 n rw d e j l d e i j x j x l 2 y j y l 2 where d e is euclidean distance between locations of two representative wells j and l in the zone i linear function of the normalized values of of 1 and of 2 is used to find the optimal set of rpws in each study area 3 of m i n i m i z i n g w 1 nof 1 w 2 1 nof 2 w 1 w 2 0 5 where nof 1 and nof 2 are normalized values of of 1 and of 2 respectively computed by dividing these functions by their maximum corresponding values during the optimization process 0 nof 1 nof 2 1 the subtracting 1 nof 2 is used to change the optimization type of of 2 from maximization to the minimization total annual gww by the pumping wells in each zone i t a w v i is obtained by multiplying the mav pw by the number of pumping wells including in the corresponding zone n pw annual withdrawal volume from each representative pumping well av rw can be obtained by multiplying the pumping rate of representative well r rw in its annual pumping time at rw at rw can be calculated by sum of the pumping time of representative well during twelve months finally t a w v across the aquifer during a given year can be calculated as 4 tawv i 1 n z n pw i t n pw 1 n rw j 1 n rw r rw i j k 1 12 t rw i j k a t rw ma v rw where n z is number of zones and k is index of month k 1 2 12 if units of r rw and t rw be l s and hr respectively a multiplier 3 6 should be added to the right hand side of eq 1 to have tawv in m 3 y r official inventories of all individual active pumping wells characteristics e g rate and time of pumping depth of pumping well diameter of pump outlet pipe and hydrogeological properties in well location e g depth to groundwater in 536 study areas across iran were conducted by the iran s bsb wrm company in a ten year interval this compilation is limited to the registered licensed pumping wells the last inventory was undertaken in 2007 this is the reason for choosing this time period 2007 2019 for this study these data constitute the population or true values to determine the accuracy of pumpage computations from the adopted rpwn in this study the data of groundwater withdrawal from rpwn were monitored monthly by field personnel at the end of each month it assumed that the extraction is distributed evenly in time over the month which ignores temporal variation of water needed during the important growing months the adopted rpwn requires that the sample gww data fits a theoretical distribution reasonably the same as the population i e distribution of all active pumping wells for this purpose the statistics of gww data of rpwn should be same as the population 3 study aquifers three unconfined aquifers of iran including tehran arak and qazvin are selected to evaluate the current and adopted rpwn in this study for gww estimation through pumping wells fig 2 tehran aquifer with area of 2250 km2 belongs to tehran and karaj provinces is located on the alluvial fans of the southern alborz mountains northern iran fig 2 tehran city the capital of iran with a population of 12 million 20 of iran s population is the 18th most populated city in the world heger and sarraf 2018 and started to pump its subsurface resources since 1963 tehran municipality 2006 the north tehran hilly area is cut by three north south rivers i e karaj kan and chitgar rivers tehran regional water authority 2014 which have significant effect on the geomorphology of the area and also on the tehran aquifer recharge process tamab 2004 the climate in this area is characterized by annual precipitation of 230 mm and annual mean temperature of 16 4 c and a semi arid climate tehran aquifer is composed of heterogeneous grains of clay silt sand and gravel as shown in fig 2 alluvial deposits in the study area can be divided into four formations hezardarreh formation as the oldest formation belongs to eocene age with average thickness 1000 m located in the east part of tehran city kahrizak formation belongs to middle pleistocene with thickness 10 60 m tehran alluvial formation with 50 m thickness belongs to upper pleistocene age and holocene alluvium recent alluvium with 1 5 m of thickness contains coating pebbles gravel and fine sediments rieben 1955 khaksar and tavassoli 2002 tehran alluvium as the third horizon has been the better depository of underground water in the alluvial fan of tehran region compared to other zones the fans are settled on the volcanic sedimentary bed rocks of the mesozoic era according to fig 3 a the thickness of alluvial deposit generally decreases from the north with an average of 250 m to the south with an average of 60 m gsi geological survey of iran 2007 there are two main water bearing zones in the area in the north local and shallow perched aquifers are formed in the piedmont zone of alborz mountains fed by urban returned water and in the south the main tehran aquifer is formed in the tehran alluvium formation as an unconfined aquifer in tehran plain no confined aquifer is logged yet in the plain transmissivity amounts to 1 200 m 2 day on average the lower values belong to southern parts storage coefficient or specific yield of the aquifer is reported as 3 to 6 percent hosseini et al 2019 arak aquifer with area of 1945 5 km2 is located in the markazi province and is surrounded by mountains of mesozoic and cenozoic age fig 2 b the tabarteh fault passes through the aquifer controls the seismicity of the region mighan playa fig 2 b is located in the center of the aquifer the pre neogene basement in the lake ranges in age from mesozoic to pliocene and comprises metamorphic rocks in the southern west part of the playa carbonate in eastern and paleogene assemblages that consist of tuff deposits and volcanic rocks in the northern part of the playa rajabi and ghorbani 2016 the flat surface of the study area consists of soft and fine deposits where clays and silts are predominant fig 3 b the climate in this area is characterized by annual precipitation of 261 mm annual mean temperature of 14 8 c and a semi arid climate qazvin aquifer with area of 3952 0 km2 is located in the qazvin province west of tehran the climate of qazvin aquifer is characterized by annual mean temperature of 14 9 c annual precipitation about 337 5 mm and an arid and semi arid climate this area is a flat terrain comprising a thick sequence of unconsolidated quaternary deposits and bounded in the south by the central mountains and in the north by the alborz mountains see fig 3 c since prehistoric times downwash from the mountains has led to considerable deposition in the plain schmidt and fazeli 2007 the storage volume of this aquifer is estimated to be about 2 1 109 m 3 and is one of the largest aquifers in iran the most important water resources in the study area are kharrud a seasonal river and three permanent rivers shahroud abharoud and hajiarab 189 springs and 23 qanats and 4 240 active pumping wells regional water company of qazvin 2015 the last low flow period in iran started in 1997 and lasted for almost 5 years in addition to population growth and unfavorable public consumption culture among citizens above 300 l per day this led to a serious water crisis in the study areas especially in the central parts in 2001 jahani and reyhani 2007 hosseini et al 2019 depth to the water table and groundwater level in three aquifers are illustrated in fig 4 a f derived based on the average groundwater level in 2010 from piezometric observations according to fig 4 a c and e the depth to water table is observed in the range of 10 m to 180 m in tehran aquifer 20 m to 80 m in arak aquifer and 20 m to 100 m in the qazvin aquifer the general direction of groundwater flow is from north to south in tehran aquifer and north and northeast to south and southwest in arak aquifer according to fig 4 b and d in the qazvin aquifer fig 4 f the general groundwater flow direction is from north west and south towards the east these figures also reveal that the tehran and arak aquifers experience heavy hydraulic gradient especially in the northwest and northeastern parts which implies that heavy groundwater withdrawal is occurring in those areas in the qazvin aquifer the heavy hydraulic gradient is also observed in the south and west boundaries three aquifers of tehran arak and qazvin have suffered from a continuously declining groundwater level of 0 31 m y r 0 56 m y r and 0 68 m y r respectively during the last 30 years iran water statistical yearbook 2012 according to long term groundwater balance studies performed by iran s bsb wrm company table 2 the main sources of recharge to the tehran arak and qazvin aquifers are return flows of domestic and industrial as 1135 6 106 m 3 yr lateral sub surface inflows as 100 64 106 m 3 yr and irrigation return water from the fields as 477 79 106 m 3 yr respectively unbalanced groundwater inflow and outflow volume lead to annual deficit of groundwater storage in the tehran arak and qazvin aquifers equal to 67 31 55 and 314 57 106 m 3 respectively 4 preparing of input data layers all required basic data on characteristics of aquifers and pumping wells information are obtained from the water wells database of iran s bsb wrm company for year 2007 as the last official data compilation from pumping wells has been conducted in this year the data of groundwater level and storage in all iran s aquifers are publicly available at http wrs wrm ir which are categorized based on iran s provinces and available in yearly intervals by iran water resources management company among the explanatory variables required to establish rpwn in an aquifer based on iran s bsb wrm company guideline explained formerly in the section of rpwn approach only ten following variables are measured and therefore available for three studied aquifers 1 type of alluvial deposits 2 aquifer thickness 3 saturation thickness of pumping well 4 pumping rate 5 annual pumping time 6 diameter of pump outlet pipe 7 transmissivity 8 water consumption type 9 land use land cover and 10 distance of well from main roads ten required explanatory variables to establish the rpwn for three studied aquifers are prepared in arc gis environment version 10 2 all with a spatial resolution of 100 m the format of all input data layers are converted to raster through the raster calculation and spatial analyst extensions of arc gis the prepared layers are shown in figs 5 9 summary description of each feature is provided in follows water consumption type the total number of active pumping wells over tehran arak and qazvin aquifers in 2007 is 22220 2022 and 4240 respectively which withdraw 1870 898 106 m 3 311 053 106 m 3 and 1515 143 106 m 3 from groundwater annually the three study areas are highly productive agricultural areas in the country in tehran aquifer the 63 40 of pumping volume is used for agricultural sector 1186 38 106 m 3 yr through 18 520 wells 35 10 for domestic 656 75 106 m 3 yr through 656 75 wells and 1 50 for industrial use 27 76 106 m 3 yr through 2 427 wells as shown in fig 5 a in arak aquifer the contribution of withdrawal groundwater volume for agricultural domestic and industrial use are 83 3 260 0 106 m 3 yr through 1 791 wells 16 0 50 0 106 m 3 yr through 120 wells and 0 6 1 90 106 m 3 yr through 111 wells respectively in qazvin aquifer groundwater pumping volume supplies the 93 2 1412 6 106 m 3 yr through 3 797 wells of agricultural use 2 15 32 8 106 m 3 yr through 214 wells of domestic use and 4 6 69 71 106 m 3 yr through 229 wells of industrial use fig 5 a c and e diameter of pump outlet pipe or discharge pipe diameter another explanatory variable which is adopted by iran s bsb wrm company to define the rpwn is diameter of pump outlet pipe according to fig 5 b d and f 70 of active pumping wells i e 15 520 wells in tehran aquifer have outlet pipe with diameter smaller than 2 in 50 mm whereas 15 of wells i e 3 310 wells has a diameter 4 in 100 mm in both aquifers of arak and qazvin 65 of total pumping wells have outlet pipe with diameter 4 in 100 mm pumping rate of wells according to fig 6 a from 22 220 active pumping wells in tehran aquifer 18 499 wells 83 2 withdraw groundwater in a rate of 10 l s fig 6 c 1 576 7 2 wells have pumping rate ranged from 10 to 20 l s and the others i e 2 145 wells or 9 6 have a pumping rate of 20 l s in arak aquifer fig 6 c 66 4 20 3 and 13 3 of all wells have a pumping rate of 10 l s 10 to 20 l s and 20 l s respectively surprisingly in the qazvin aquifer 42 3 of all active wells have a pumping rate of 20 l s annual pumping time of wells spatial distribution of annual pumping time of active wells over the study aquifers are shown in fig 6 b d and f in tehran aquifer pumping time of 45 46 active pumping wells 10 103 wells are 2 000 hr y r 29 0 6 451 wells have ranged from 4 000 to 6 000 hr y r and 25 44 5 666 wells pumped groundwater in duration 4 000 hr y r whereas in arak and qazvin plains 52 1 045 wells and 59 2 498 wells of all active wells have a pumping time 4 000 hr y r saturation thickness of pumping well length of pumping well screen which penetrates in saturated part of aquifer could be obtained by subtracting the layer of depth of pumping well from the depth to groundwater partially penetrating of well screen in saturated zone of aquifer will be less efficient due to distortion of the flow lines through well and greater head loss todd and mays 2005 in this study the layer of depth of pumping well is subtracted from the layer of depth to groundwater by the spatial analyst toolbox of arcgis to obtain the saturation thickness of each pumping well according to fig 7 a c and e 76 0 of pumping wells 16 870 wells in the tehran aquifer included in saturation thickness class of 30 m 11 5 2 571 wells in the range of 30 to 60 m and other 12 5 or 2 779 wells in class of 60 m whereas in arak and qazvin aquifers 43 of all active pumping wells 864 and 1 807 wells respectively are in saturation thickness class of 60 m aquifer thickness thickness of strata is another explanatory variable of aquifer that iran s bsb wrm company considered to adopt the rpwn in the aquifers this map is obtained based on interpolation of point data of aquifer thickness in location of observation wells by inverse distance weighting method idw in gis environment as also shown in fig 7 b d and f in the tehran aquifer 41 2 of aquifer area has a thickness 100 m 33 0 between 100 and 200 m and 25 6 200 m whereas 71 of arak aquifer and 78 of qazvin aquifer has a thickness 100 m and between 100 and 200 m respectively land use land cover in this study the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi proposed by tucker 1979 is used to identify and to improve the discrimination between land use land cover categories in the study areas this vegetation index provides information on the amount and vigor of vegetation considering the near infrared nir and visible red bands of the electromagnetic spectrum calculated by the eq 5 osunmadewa et al 2018 5 ndvi nir r e d nir r e d where nir and red represent the reflectance in the near infrared and red band respectively for the operational land imager oli sensor on the landsat 8 with spatial resolution of 30 m which used in this study the nir and red bands are band 5 0 85 0 88 μ m and band 4 0 64 0 67 μ m respectively the ndvi value ranges from 1 to 1 the pixels with ndvi values of 0 1 represents well and dense vegetation and the less values ndvi 0 1 classified as bare grounds piao et al 2011 mohajane et al 2018 fig 8 a c and e presents the spatial distribution of ndvi values across three study areas during growing season of 2018 the classes of moderate and high density vegetation i e ndvi 0 1 are the dominant ndvi land cover classes for the qazvin study area 60 while low density vegetation i e ndvi 0 1 occupied the largest portions of the tehran and arak areas 55 and 59 respectively distance of well from main roads accessibility of selected pumping well is crucial for data compilation and controlling change in pumping instruments distance from main roads is another explanatory variable that iran s bsb wrm company considered to adopt the rpwn fig 8 b d and f show the distance of active pumping wells from the main roads across three aquifers areas which categorized into three classes 200 m between 200 and 1000 m and 1000 m it reveals from this figure that in the urban areas the distance of pumping wells from roads is less than other land uses moreover the network of main road in tehran aquifer is denser than the others type of alluvial deposits fig 9 a c and e show spatial distribution of alluvial deposits across three study aquifers which are obtained based on interpolation of dominant alluvial in profile of exploration wells i e well logs by inverse distance weighting idw method in gis environment the amount of fine material clay silt and fine sand consists of 57 of tehran aquifer area the fine materials generally increase towards the center and the south of the aquifer medium sized deposits coarse sand and medium gravel consists 36 of aquifer area mainly observed in north zones arak aquifer mainly 69 2 consists of sand and medium gravel which observed all over aquifer the dominant deposits of qazvin aquifer is coarse gravel 61 6 spreads in north and east parts transmissivity aquifer transmissivity is one of most important variables affecting yields of a pumping well the higher the transmissivity the greater the capability of the aquifer to move water and the lower the drawdown in the pumping well sterrett 2007 the transmissivity maps of three aquifers are produced in gis environment based on interpolation of point data of transmissivity obtained from pumping tests according to fig 9 b d and f 16 7 of aquifer area in the north and northwest parts have the highest value of transmissivity 2000 m 2 d whereas 40 of aquifer has transmissivity 1000 m 2 d toward the central and south parts of the aquifer the values of transmissivity steadily reduces and reach to its minimum value at 200 m 2 d while no transmissivity value 2 000 m 2 d is observed in the arak aquifer 89 of this aquifer area has a transmissivity smaller than 1 000 m 2 d and 11 in southern part has a transmissivity between 1 000 to 2 000 m 2 d spatial distribution of high transmissivity values in qazvin aquifer indicates that 55 5 of aquifer area has a transmissivity 1 000 m 2 d 17 between 1 000 to 2 000 m 2 d and 27 3 2 000 m 2 d the reasons for decreasing transmissivity in the study aquifer are reduction of thickness of aquifer and decreasing hydraulic conductivity due to reduction of size of alluvial deposits 5 results and discussion the above mentioned classified features for three study aquifers are then rated in three categories of low medium and high values as summarized in table 3 the number of pumping wells and also annual pumping volume in each class of ten features are also presented in table 3 the final overlaid maps of study aquifers are produced by overlapping the ten rated layers the final overlaid maps are classified into ten statistically independent zones as shown in fig 10 a c result of paired t test on the difference of average withdrawal volume of pumping wells in ten considered zones a vw pw of obtained overlaid maps are shown in table 4 results in table 4 indicates the a vw pw of ten zones adopted for three aquifers are different in significance level of 95 i e α 0 05 since the calculated t statistics are much greater than the corresponding critical value t cal t crit therefore separation of all active pumping wells over the aquifers as the population into ten zones will produce improved estimates of total groundwater withdrawal than the use of ungrouped data the number of wells adopted by the iran s bsb wrm company current rpwn for tehran arak and qazvin aquifers are 118 56 and 99 respectively the difference between the zonation of the study aquifer adopted by iran s bsb wrm company and that generated in this study fig 10 a to c are the modifications made on the explanatory variables to establish rpwn these modifications as also described earlier in the section of rpwn approach include i the layer of depth of pumping well is subtracted from the layer of depth to groundwater to obtain the saturation thickness of each pumping well ii transmissivity of aquifer in the location of pumping wells is also considered as additional feature to increase the accuracy of the adopted method and iii the data layer type of irrigated crop is replaced by ndvi layer the representative pumping wells in each zone are selected by simultaneous optimization of two objective functions of 1 and of 2 presented in eqs 1 and 2 linear combination of of 1 and of 2 with equal weights is considered and optimized by optimization toolbox of matlab through constrained nonlinear minimization with discrete variables algorithm the gww estimations by the current rpwn adopted by iran s bsb wrm co modified rpwn this study and the last official data compilation on 2007 are summarized in table 5 assuming the official records on 2007 are true the errors of estimated g w w from the tehran arak and qazvin aquifers by the modified rpwn approach are 0 2 0 96 and 1 41 respectively these errors are much smaller than those obtained by the current rpwn on the study aquifers i e 20 0 19 87 and 26 15 respectively interestingly the small values of errors in gww estimation by modified rpwn are obtained for 50 selected wells whereas the number of selected wells for rpwn adopted by iran s bsb wrm company are 118 for tehran aquifer 56 for arak aquifer and 99 for qazvin aquifer the associated costs for data compilation required for gww estimation e g pumping rate and time is directly related to number of wells included in rpwn according to the fiscal year of 2018 the costs of data compilation for a representative well is 4 25 usd monthly 51 usd annually for twelve times data compilation at the end of each month bearing this in mind selecting 50 wells for modified rpwn of each study aquifer has a data compilation costs equal to 2 550 usd yearly see also table 5 this amount includes only the costs of traveling and filling the required form by staffs mainly about the pumping period once every month the costs of well drilling and installation of instruments are not included since the data compilation is carried out for the active pumping wells therefore the modified rpwn for three study aquifers has a reduction of data compilation costs as 58 0 for tehran aquifer 10 6 for arak aquifer and 49 4 for qazvin aquifer along with two modifications made on the input variables to generate final overlaid map the reason for larger discrepancy in estimation of gww by the rpwn adopted by iran s bsb wrm company in comparison to the rpwn developed in the study areas could be due to the way for solving the optimization problem based on iran s bsb wrm company guideline two objective functions of of 1 and of 2 eqs 1 and 2 should be optimized for selecting the representative wells in each zone optimization of of 1 and of 2 are often done manually i e trial and error by expert hydrogeologists whereas a global nonlinear automatic procedure is employed in this study for finding the optimal set of decision variables i e representative pumping wells in each zone using the automated optimization technique assures the selection of a globally optimal set detection while manual optimization of objective functions may result in poor local optimum traps motivated in part by the cost aspect of data compilation on wells included in rpwn the desired rpwn needs to have a trade off between cost of data compilation which depends on sample size i e number of selected wells in rpwn and its accuracy in estimation of gww across the aquifer the variations of data compilation cost monthly inventory of pumping rate and time of the representative wells and accuracy of adopted rpwn versus number of selected pumping wells for rpwn are computed only for tehran aquifer as example and the results are shown in fig 11 increasing the number of wells in the adopted rpwn between 5 and 30 and 70 to 120 has a minor effect 0 04 on enhancing the accuracy of the network in gww estimation whereas increasing the number of wells included in rpwn between 30 and 70 will significantly decrease the error of gww estimation 0 38 as an additional check we compared the probability density functions fitted to the annual gww from all individual pumping wells pumping wells selected for rpwn adopted in the study aquifers i e modified rpwn and the current rpwn implemented by iran s bsb wrm company in three study aquifers annual gww estimated by the current rpwn modified rpwn and formal data compilation from all active wells exhibit a log normal distribution at significance level of α 0 05 table 6 therefore the probability distribution of sampled wells for current and modified rpwn approaches are the same as the distribution of the population i e all active wells as a further investigation and due to complexity and spatial variability of the withdrawal volume across the studied aquifer multiple linear regression mlp between withdrawal volume of each individual pumping well and corresponding ten explanatory variables is undertaken to search for statistically significant explanatory variables table 7 results of stepwise regression analysis indicate that the pumping rate q is the most related explanatory variable to estimate the gww in three aquifers based on two goodness of fit criteria of determination coefficient r 2 ranged 0 766 to 0 875 and standard error of estimation se 113 87 103 to 138 06 103 m 3 yr the stepwise regression analysis given in table 7 also indicates that the explanatory variables which have the most correlation to the g w w in tehran aquifer are pumping rate q pumping time t diameter of pump outlet pipe d type of alluvial deposits s water consumption type c saturation thickness of pumping well b and transmissivity of aquifer t have the most correlation to the g w w in tehran aquifer r 2 0 850 and se 91 12 103 m 3 yr for the arak aquifer variables of q t c d s and ndvi as a proxy of land use land cover have the most correlation to gww with r 2 0 902 and se 68 52 103 m 3 yr the most related variables to gww in qazvin aquifer are q t and d with r 2 0 920 and se 110 61 103 m 3 yr the variables excluded in each case of regression analysis have an insignificant degree of modification in terms of r 2 and se the variables of aquifer thickness z and distance from the main roads r are the collaborative explanatory variables to estimate gww in three study areas whereas the difference between three study aquifers for estimation of gww are related to variables of ndvi c t and s table 7 more investigation is carried out to seek a promising tool for prediction of gww based on large dataset of the most correlated explanatory variables support vector regression svr vapnik 1995 with different kernel function is adopted for this purpose due to its proficiency in simulating and predicting large scale and complex phenomena schölkopf and smola 2002 gizaw and gan 2016 svr has been successfully applied in the fields of water resources engineering and hydrology for purposes such as streamflow prediction e g asefa et al 2006 luo et al 2019 lake and groundwater water level prediction e g khan and coulibaly 2006 yoon et al 2011 regionalization of contaminants in aquifers hosseini and mahjouri 2014 moreover results of t test indicates the explanatory variables to be tested in the multiple regression models are independent and are normally distributed with equal population variances and therefore no data transformation or ranking is required to undertake on the input variables sensitivity analysis was also performed to examine the contribution degree of explanatory variables to the gww estimated through the developed method in this study li and merchant 2013 parizi et al 2019 4 p v j av rw j av rw av rw 100 where pv is the percentage of variation in the estimated g w w av rw j is the estimated annual withdrawal volume of aquifer by removing the explanatory variable j in the adopted approach and av rw is the estimated annual withdrawal volume of aquifer considering all explanatory variables for instance the pv values corresponding to ten explanatory variables of tehran aquifer are shown in fig 12 results indicate the predominant influence of pumping rate and time on the estimation of gww from the study aquifer pv 3 61 and 3 13 respectively the impact of the distance from the roads and water consumption type has the minimum influence on gww estimation in this aquifer pv 0 07 and 0 06 respectively 6 conclusion the representative pumping wells network rpwn is a combined approach which incorporates ten explanatory features related to hydrogeological characteristics of aquifer and properties of pumping wells to estimate the total gww from aquifer by pumping wells was presented in this study this approach adopted by iran s bsb wrm company employs statistical and rate and time methods that have been implemented across 536 aquifers in the country since 2007 the original rpwn approach was modified in this study by incorporating more influential explanatory variables including use of the saturation thickness of each pumping well transmissivity of aquifer and the layer of ndvi and adopting an automatic optimization method for selection of representative wells the original rpwn uses a manual optimization procedure the modified rpwn approach were tested on three study aquifers of tehran with 22 220 pumping wells arak with 2 022 pumping wells and qazvin with 4 240 pumping wells in northern iran while the number of representative wells selected for the current rpwn by iran s bsb wrm company are 118 for tehran aquifer 56 for arak aquifer and 99 for qazvin aquifer the proposed rpwn in this study adopted only 50 wells for each study aquifer the reduced size of rpwn adopted in this study leads to decreasing the costs of monthly data compilation costs of traveling and filling the form by staffs required for gww estimation over developed network moreover the computational errors of gww estimation by the proposed rpwn in three study aquifers are 0 2 for tehran aquifer 0 96 for arak aquifer and 1 41 for qazvin aquifer which are much smaller than the current network i e 20 0 19 87 and 26 15 respectively the modified rpwn in this study has important benefits over existing network the problem of well selection is easier by adopting an automatic optimization procedure for manually optimization more accurate smaller error in gww estimation and impose less financial burden for data compilation i e pumping time monthly by significantly reducing the number of selected wells the adopted rpwn approach is also a robust consistent efficient and effective tool for estimation of gww by pumping wells since its original form is currently implemented in 536 study area and therefore its efficiency has been checked through data inventory during recent decade the proposed approach is also particularly suited to regions where the widespread presence of pumping wells provides a dense observation network in which data compilation from all of active pumping wells impose a great deal of financial load the methods presented here can easily be used for other aquifer systems particularly as the electronic availability of data increases also the flexibility of these gis based methods makes the incorporation of new data and integration of additional processes relatively straightforward the primary limitations associated with the rpwn approach is checking the robustness of the method over time only one official data compilation of all pumping wells exist for iran s aquifers in year 2007 in addition the accuracy of the adopted rpwn for the estimation of gww may become outdated after several years of use by changing the number of active pumping wells some of the included explanatory variables e g pumping time t and pumping rate q transmissivity of aquifer t saturation thickness of aquifer b and ndvi may change by groundwater level fluctuation and land use land cover dynamics however the variables of aquifer sediment s distance from the main roads r and aquifer thickness z have not significant change during time the pumping rate and time t of the rpwn have been monitored continuously at each season by iran s bsb wrm company since only an official inventory of all pumping wells in 2007 is available the verification of the proposed approach in this study is limited to this date as some of pumping wells over aquifer come online and others go offline their time rate relations changed therefore a redo the exercise from time to time may needed to make sure the well locations and numbers are always best at any given point in time moreover the method developed in this study does not consider the unmeasured gww by the unlicensed unauthorized pumping wells that is estimated to be significant in the iran s aquifers in the regions which precise estimation of gww through the unlicensed pumping wells the proposed approach can provide results with more accuracy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors behzad ataie ashtiani and

6160,in this study a review of the developed methods to estimate groundwater withdrawal gww from aquifers by pumping wells is provided then a method adopted by iran s basic studies bureau of water resources management company for estimation of gww through 536 aquifers across iran is presented and modified this so called representative pumping wells network rpwn approach is a combination of statistical and rate and time methods which has been implemented for all aquifers in iran since 2007 the rpwn approach is based on the overlaying of 10 important features in a gis environment and classified in a number of zones in which their withdrawals are statistically different the representative pumping wells in each zone are sampled for rpwn based on a multi objective optimization three aquifers of tehran arak and qazvin in iran are selected as real cases studies to demonstrate the efficiency of the modified rpwn approach metered pumpage of the all active wells obtained from the last official inventory in 2007 is considered as true gww values to evaluate the current and modified rpwns based on modified approach 50 representative pumping wells rpws are selected for each aquifer of tehran arak and qazvin respectively 58 11 and 50 less than number of wells considered in the current rpwn whereas the computational errors of gww by the current rpwn are between 19 9 and 26 2 the modified rpwn shows much smaller errors in the range of 0 2 to 1 41 moreover the modified rpwn reduces the cost of data compilation to 10 6 to 58 0 of the current rpwn the results of this study demonstrate that the modified rpwn approach is a robust efficient effective and consistent tool and particularly suited to the aquifers that pumping wells provides a dense observation network in which data compilation of gww impose a great deal of financial burden keywords groundwater withdrawal pumping wells rate and time method statistical approach representative pumping wells network 1 introduction during the last 100 years the global population has more than quadrupled 7 billion crop land area has doubled 15 million km 2 while irrigated area has increased six fold 3 0 million km 2 and water withdrawal has increased by nearly 8 times 4000 km 3 yr wada et al 2016 while 98 7 of all liquid freshwater is composed of groundwater rejani et al 2008 these resources contributes 42 36 and 27 of global water used for irrigation households and manufacturing respectively döll et al 2012 overexploitation of groundwater resources during this period has exerted financial social and political pressure to find a solution sophocleous 2004 ngigi et al 2008 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 easy to access the reliability of groundwater resources during droughts technological advances such as cheaper well drilling techniques and the popularization of the submersible pump make groundwater resources an excellent catalyst for rapid socioeconomic development in many regions giordano 2006 scanlon et al 2012 a recent drought occurring in the middle east in 2007 highlighted the need for sustainable management of water resources world bank 2007 in many countries of the middle east groundwater resources are nonrenewable insignificant natural recharge and monitoring the rates at which they are utilized under anthropogenic activities is important for sustainable planning purposes joodaki et al 2014 in highly productive agricultural areas the groundwater withdrawals from pumping wells are often unrestricted and unmonitored so that a consistent picture of rates of groundwater depletion is difficult to construct famiglietti et al 2011 groundwater withdrawal is one of the most significant anthropogenic activities affecting regional groundwater flow paths in addition to the recharge is the important parameter of water budget and regional groundwater flow modeling moreo et al 2003 the groundwater withdrawal gww is difficult to quantify and exhibit a certain degree of uncertainty and may vary both spatially and temporally across aquifer hartono 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 hydrological evaluation of an aquifer system for appropriate groundwater management requires detailed knowledge about the volume of groundwater withdrawals hurr and litke 1989 murkowski 2014 pumping rate also affects human induced geohazards such as saltwater intrusion and land subsidence lin et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 parizi et al 2019 quantitative estimation of groundwater pumping allows the estimation of groundwater storage constructing of groundwater hydrological models evaluation of sustainability of groundwater resources management and planning of groundwater use and conservation kim et al 2008 tsanis and apostolaki 2009 gww is significant yet an often poorly understood and unmeasured component of the water balance model ruud et al 2004 monitoring of pumping rate for all wells across the aquifer and equipping them to measurement instruments is impractical due to costs time and effort to finish such a task especially in a large aquifer with heavy withdrawal points hurr and litke 1989 lin et al 2013 the need for reliable estimates of the amount of groundwater withdrawn especially by the pumping wells is garnering increased global attention due to the growing demand for meeting water demands harris and diehl 2017 hosseini et al 2019 to face this challenge no comprehensive framework for accurate estimation of groundwater resource depletion currently exists lin et al 2013 surprisingly despite the importance of pumping volume estimation in aquifer management it often ranks as one of the least measured variables in hydroeconomic systems due to decentralized groundwater pumping inefficient management measurement errors and associated uncertainties sanchez 2003 ruud et al 2004 for example wang et al 2006 estimate the number of wells in china to be twice the official estimates in australia only 15 of the country s groundwater management units were metered by the year 2007 turral and fullagar 2007 an ideal procedure for estimating groundwater withdrawal volume should keep an acceptable level of accuracy and significantly reduce data collection luckey 1972 in the absence of direct metering of groundwater withdrawal by the pumping wells through installation of flow meters on pumping plants two general approaches have been developed to estimate pumping volume including direct and indirect approaches a summary of the studies using different methods to estimate gww by pumping wells are given in table 1 and are also discussed in the following sections 1 1 direct approaches to estimate gww direct approaches are those in which the withdrawal volume is either metered on each individual pumping plant manual or automatic or is calculated through rate time methods rtms by multiplying an average pumping rate by a cumulative pumping time hurr and litke 1989 since the direct measurement of pumping rate of all plants across the aquifer is impractical a representative pumping rate needs to be estimated energy consumption method is one of rtms which is based on finding the relation between well yield and energy costs through power consumption coefficients shah et al 2008 the relation of pumping rate and energy consumption for pumping is also served and well reported by hurr and litke 1989 obviously the rtms provide an accurate withdrawal estimation for stable hydrological and apparatus condition luckey 1972 needing comprehensive datasets about the type of pump electrical or diesel pumping plant efficiency application of a pressure correction factor and geometry of storage tanks especially for diesel plants and correction of transformers for electrical plants are amongst the method s drawbacks the estimation error of area wide groundwater withdrawal by rtms could be reduced by undertaking of random sampling of wells population and checking their yield and energy consumption church et al 2007 combined rtms and statistical methods the rtms methods may be combined with statistical methods such as random sampling regression analysis and analysis of variance anova to increase the accuracy of groundwater withdrawal estimation e g nrc 2002 averyt et al 2013 sims 2017 due to the historically uncertain quality of gww data statistical modeling may produce inconsistent results averyt et al 2013 in regression analysis gww is related to the most correlated explanatory variables e g groundwater storage recharge luckey 1972 hypothesis test of anova is used where the explanatory variables to be tested are discrete variables such as the source aquifer irrigation method and energy source this method is based on the assumptions that the data for each group are independent and are normally distributed with equal population variances it may be necessary to transform the data or use ranks in order to meet these assumptions moreo et al 2003 hypothesis tests e g anova and t test also help to test whether the grouped data of withdrawal volume have significantly different averages if so separation of the population into strata will produce improved estimates of total groundwater withdrawal than the use of ungrouped data 1 2 indirect approaches to estimate gww the indirect approaches could be classified in four groups of crop water requirement estimation method groundwater modeling approach water table fluctuation wtf method and satellite based estimation methods as described briefly in the following crop water requirement estimation method one of most frequently used approaches is measuring irrigated crop surface and then multiplying it by average crop water requirements this approach is used in the basins where the groundwater is pumped for irrigation calera belmonte et al 2005 this method has some drawbacks which mainly arise from the uncertainties due to climatological variables e g rainfall and temperature crop type and surface water sources affecting the crop water requirement and also challenges with the estimation of actual irrigation efficiency baker 1979 hartono 2005 groundwater modeling approach in this approach number of pumping wells and also withdrawal volume are calibrated through numerical modeling of groundwater system i e inverse modeling disadvantages of this approach is need to know the entire groundwater budget elements in time and space and the fitting problem when the number of pumping wells be very large groundwater flow models have been also used in a number of local and regional studies for assessment of pumping rates based on spatial and temporal conditions e g heath 1983 hartono 2005 however some challenges including the computational cost and insufficient knowledge of the pumping data lead to assigning the variability of pumping rates is not possible in most regional flow studies or the modeling of pumping rates and location values are mainly performed for small zones with few numbers of withdrawal wells guvanasen et al 2000 moreo et al 2003 estimated gww from the death valley regional flow system nevada and california by transient three dimensional ground water flow model withdrawal locations and depths of production intervals were estimated by the developed numerical model recently the usgs developed models for estimating gww at 1 290 thermoelectric plants based on electricity production to provide estimates independent from plant operator reported data collected by state agencies nrc 2002 according to this project statistical modeling of withdrawal coefficients liters per kilowatt hour is applied for groups of technologically similar plants the gww estimates obtained using the developed model were based on linked heat and water budgets constrained by power plant fuel consumption and electricity production generation technologies cooling system technologies and environmental variables diehl et al 2013 the model established five generation types classified by the types of steam turbines used to generate electricity water table fluctuation wtf method this approach uses the linkage between the change in groundwater storage with resulting water table fluctuations in unconfined aquifers tsanis and apostolaki 2009 the wtf method was used as early as the 1920s meinzer 1923 the wtf method is mostly designed for natural systems and often do not properly account for water level fluctuations from pumping discharge at the regional scale moreover this method requires the specific yield of the aquifer to estimate the variation of gw storage healy and cook 2002 healy and cook 2002 indicated that wtf is best applied over short periods in regions with sharp fluctuation of shallow water levels usually water table fluctuation method is coupled with the groundwater balance equation and a geostatistical method to estimate the annual gw pumping e g maréchal et al 2006 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 in situations where pumping data is lacking the withdrawals could be reasonably estimated by considering it as the closure term to the water balance model ruud et al 2004 satellite based estimation method however coupling the aforementioned methods by the remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis may promote the method s accuracy joodaki et al 2014 recent studies have clearly demonstrated that satellite driven estimates of gw depletion e g gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 is sufficiently accurate at large scales when combined with auxiliary hydrological datasets zaitchik et al 2008 satellite gravity has the ability of measuring groundwater storage change and ocean mass variations rodell et al 2009 usually satellite gravity approaches use depth of groundwater as the net result of recharge discharge process in the aquifer to calculate remaining saturation thickness resulting from the applied pumping rates famiglietti et al 2011 in most of the studies mentioned above and also those given in table 1 increasing attention is being given to groundwater withdrawal estimation through indirect techniques to have correct estimate of the pumping rates both the hydrologic and geologic characteristics of the aquifer should be considered lin et al 2013 in iran quantifying rates of groundwater depletion through pumping wells remains a challenge owing to a lack of monitoring infrastructure limited financial resources and the absence of water use reporting requirements iran is a developing country which is known as the fifth largest global gw user after india usa pakistan and china giordano 2009 döll et al 2012 iran has adopted and implemented combined statistical and rate and time methods to estimate average annual gww by licensed pumping wells over 536 study areas across the country established since 2007 iran water statistical yearbook 2012 due to lack of accurate and sustainable gw safe yield data and recharge rate in iran s aquifers incorporating the water table fluctuation method and gw balance model for iran s aquifers may introduce additional uncertainties into the developed model hosseini et al 2019 this study aimed to outline and modify a new approach to estimate groundwater withdrawal estimation from pumping wells adopted by iran s water resources basic studies bureau iran s bsb wrm company across this country this approach called representative pumping wells network rpwn has implemented over 536 study areas across iran since 2007 and could be considered as a promising tool to estimate gww by pumping wells in aquifer scale the rpwn method is a systematic combined procedure utilizes statistical random sampling and rate and time methods along with hydrogeological features of aquifer briefly in this approach pumping wells and aquifer characteristics are considered as fourteen explanatory or input variables the input features is rated and then overlaid in a gis environment the final overlaid map is then classified into different statistically independent zones random sampling is then used in each zone to select a few pumping wells for rpwn regarding two objectives of spatial coverage of sampled wells across the corresponding zone and their accuracy in the estimation of gww the official pumping data compilation e g pumping rate and time for all active pumping wells across an aquifer containing the true value of gww is used to determine the accuracy of the adopted rpwn the novelty of this study lies in the fact that the modified rpwn approach can be used in intensive pumped aquifers and efficiently reduces the costs and time associated with required data compilation to estimate gww whilst at the same time yielding acceptable accuracy adopting and implementing the original version of rpwn approach by iran s bsb wrm company for numerous aquifers 536 case studies across iran proves its efficiency for more than one decade since 2007 the paper following this introduction proceeds with the methodology of the adopted rpwn by the iran s bsb wrm company and modifications made to it in this study the description of the study area tehran aquifer the discussion of the results and the pertinent conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 rpwn approach the representative pumping wells network rpwn approach adopted by iran s bsb wrm company for estimating annual gww through pumpage across 536 study areas was established since 2007 the methodology of adopting rpwn as also shown schematically in fig 1 is based on a systematic combined procedure developed in gis platform this procedure uses rtm and a statistical methods for fourteen important features also called explanatory variable in gis environment iran s bsb wrm company 2007 these features including 1 type of aquifer confined semi confined unconfined leaky or perched 2 type of alluvial deposits clay silt sand 3 depth to groundwater in well location 4 aquifer thickness 5 depth of pumping well 6 pumping rate 7 annual pumping time 8 diameter of pump outlet pipe 9 date of the well drilling 10 drilling method of pumping well 11 water consumption type irrigation domestic and industrial 12 type of irrigation system 13 type of irrigated crop and 14 distance of well from main roads preparing these features in gis allows integration of large spatial data sets with different formats into one usable uniform format annual pumping time of each well is obtained by adding the recorded pumping time for different months pumping rate of each well is considered constant during its operation it should be mentioned that due to lack of field data some of these features may not be available or used for all aquifers therefore the explanatory variables used to adopt rpwn in all iran s aquifer are not same after reclassifying all input features the features are rated weighted overlapping method esri 2013 is used for overlapping of rated layers in raster format the final overlaid map is classified into different statistically independent zones the representative pumping wells rpws in each zone i are chosen based on optimizing two conflicting objectives 1 rpws in each zone should have the mean annual withdrawal volume mav rw close to the mean value of the total pumping wells in the corresponding zone mav pw fisher 2013 or 1 o f 1 minimizing i 1 n z 1 n rw j 1 n rw a v rw i j ma v rw 1 n pw j 1 n

are annual withdrawal volume estimated by rpws and total pumping wells according to official data compilation in each zone respectively 2 rpws in each zone should have an appropriate spatial coverage across the zone for this purpose a distance criterion is the most common for quantifying spatial coverage dhar and patil 2012 if inter well distances are summed up and maximized then it can ensure the

by the iran s bsb wrm company in a ten year interval this compilation is limited to the registered licensed pumping wells the last inventory was undertaken in 2007 this is the reason for choosing this time period 2007 2019 for this study these data constitute the population or true values to determine the accuracy of pumpage computations from the adopted rpwn in this study the data of groundwater withdrawal from rpwn were monitored monthly by field personnel at the end of each month it assumed that the extraction is distributed evenly in time over the month which ignores temporal variation of water needed during the important growing months the adopted rpwn requires that the sample gww data fits a theoretical distribution reasonably the same as the population i e distribution of all active pumping wells for this purpose the statistics of gww data of rpwn should be same as the population 3 study aquifers three unconfined aquifers of iran including tehran arak and qazvin are selected to evaluate the current and adopted rpwn in this study for gww estimation through pumping wells fig 2 tehran aquifer with area of 2250 km2 belongs to tehran and karaj provinces is located on the alluvial fans of the southern alborz mountains northern iran fig 2 tehran city the capital of iran with a population of 12 million 20 of iran s population is the 18th most populated city in the world heger and sarraf 2018 and started to pump its subsurface resources since 1963 tehran municipality 2006 the north tehran hilly area is cut by three north south rivers i e karaj kan and chitgar rivers tehran regional water authority 2014 which have significant effect on the geomorphology of the area and also on the tehran aquifer recharge process tamab 2004 the climate in this area is characterized by annual precipitation of 230 mm and annual mean temperature of 16 4 c and a semi arid climate tehran aquifer is composed of heterogeneous grains of clay silt sand and gravel as shown in fig 2 alluvial deposits in the study area can be divided into four formations hezardarreh formation as the oldest formation belongs to eocene age with average thickness 1000 m located in the east part of tehran city kahrizak formation belongs to middle pleistocene with thickness 10 60 m tehran alluvial formation with 50 m thickness belongs to upper pleistocene age and holocene alluvium recent alluvium with 1 5 m of thickness contains coating pebbles gravel and fine sediments rieben 1955 khaksar and tavassoli 2002 tehran alluvium as the third horizon has been the better depository of underground water in the alluvial fan of tehran region compared to other zones the fans are settled on the volcanic sedimentary bed rocks of the mesozoic era according to fig 3 a the thickness of alluvial deposit generally decreases from the north with an average of 250 m to the south with an average of 60 m gsi geological survey of iran 2007 there are two main water bearing zones in the area in the north local and shallow perched aquifers are formed in the piedmont zone of alborz mountains fed by urban returned water and in the south the main tehran aquifer is formed in the tehran alluvium formation as an unconfined aquifer in tehran plain no confined aquifer is logged yet in the plain transmissivity amounts to 1 200 m 2 day on average the lower values belong to southern parts storage coefficient or specific yield of the aquifer is reported as 3 to 6 percent hosseini et al 2019 arak aquifer with area of 1945 5 km2 is located in the markazi province and is surrounded by mountains of mesozoic and

climate in this area is characterized by annual precipitation of 261 mm annual mean temperature of 14 8 c and a semi arid climate qazvin aquifer with area of 3952 0 km2 is located in the qazvin province west of tehran the climate of qazvin aquifer is characterized by annual mean temperature of 14 9 c annual precipitation about 337 5 mm and an arid and semi arid climate this area is a flat terrain comprising a thick sequence of unconsolidated quaternary deposits and bounded in the south by the central mountains and in the north by the alborz mountains see fig 3 c since prehistoric times downwash from the mountains has led to considerable deposition in the plain schmidt and fazeli 2007 the storage volume of this aquifer is estimated to be about 2 1 109 m 3 and is one of the largest aquifers in iran the most important water resources in the study area are kharrud a seasonal river and three permanent rivers shahroud abharoud and hajiarab 189 springs and 23 qanats and 4 240 active pumping wells regional water company of qazvin 2015 the last low flow period in iran started in 1997 and lasted for almost 5 years in addition to population growth and unfavorable public consumption culture among citizens above 300 l per day this led to a serious water crisis in the study areas especially in the central parts in 2001 jahani and reyhani 2007 hosseini et al 2019 depth to the water table and groundwater level in three aquifers are illustrated in fig 4 a f derived based on the average groundwater level in 2010 from piezometric observations according to fig 4 a c and e the depth to water table is observed in the range of 10 m to 180 m in tehran aquifer 20 m to 80 m in arak aquifer and 20 m to 100 m in the qazvin aquifer the general direction of groundwater flow is from north to south in tehran aquifer and north and northeast to south and southwest in arak aquifer according to fig 4 b and d in the qazvin aquifer fig 4 f the general groundwater flow direction is from north west and south towards the east these figures also reveal that the tehran and arak aquifers experience heavy hydraulic gradient especially in the northwest and northeastern parts which implies that heavy groundwater withdrawal is occurring in those areas in the qazvin aquifer the heavy hydraulic gradient is also observed in the south and west boundaries three aquifers of tehran arak and qazvin have suffered from a continuously declining groundwater level of 0 31 m y r 0 56 m y r and 0 68 m y r respectively during the last 30 years iran water statistical yearbook 2012 according to long term groundwater balance studies performed by iran s bsb wrm company table 2 the main sources of recharge to the tehran arak and qazvin aquifers are return flows of domestic and industrial as 1135 6 106 m 3 yr lateral sub surface inflows as 100 64 106 m 3 yr and irrigation return water from the fields as 477 79 106 m 3 yr respectively unbalanced groundwater inflow and outflow volume lead to annual deficit of groundwater storage in the tehran arak and qazvin aquifers equal to 67 31 55 and 314 57 106 m 3 respectively 4 preparing of input data layers all required basic data on characteristics of aquifers and pumping wells information are obtained from the water wells database of iran s bsb wrm company for year 2007 as the last official data compilation from pumping wells has been conducted in this year the data of groundwater level and storage in all iran s aquifers are publicly available at http wrs wrm ir which are categorized based on iran s provinces and available in yearly intervals by iran water resources management company among the explanatory variables required to establish rpwn in an aquifer based on iran s bsb wrm company guideline explained formerly in the section of rpwn approach only ten following variables are measured and therefore available for three studied aquifers 1 type of alluvial deposits 2 aquifer thickness 3 saturation thickness of pumping well 4 pumping rate 5 annual pumping time 6 diameter of pump outlet pipe 7 transmissivity 8 water consumption type 9 land use land cover and 10 distance of well from main roads ten required explanatory variables to establish the rpwn for three studied aquifers are prepared in arc gis environment version 10 2 all with a spatial resolution of 100 m the format of all input data layers are converted to raster through the raster calculation and spatial analyst extensions of arc gis the prepared layers are shown in figs 5 9 summary description of each feature is provided in follows water consumption type the total number of active pumping wells over tehran arak and qazvin aquifers in 2007 is 22220 2022 and 4240 respectively which withdraw 1870 898 106 m 3 311 053 106 m 3 and 1515 143 106 m 3 from groundwater annually the three study areas are highly productive agricultural areas in the country in tehran aquifer the 63 40 of pumping volume is used for agricultural sector 1186 38 106 m 3 yr through 18 520 wells 35 10 for domestic 656 75 106 m 3 yr through 656 75 wells and 1 50 for industrial use 27 76 106 m 3 yr through 2 427 wells as shown in fig 5 a in arak aquifer the contribution of withdrawal groundwater volume for agricultural domestic and industrial use are 83 3 260 0 106 m 3 yr through 1 791 wells 16 0 50 0 106 m 3 yr through 120 wells and 0 6 1 90 106 m 3 yr through 111 wells respectively in qazvin aquifer groundwater pumping volume supplies the 93 2 1412 6 106 m 3 yr through 3 797 wells of agricultural use 2 15 32 8 106 m 3 yr through 214 wells of domestic use and 4 6 69 71 106 m 3 yr through 229 wells of industrial use fig 5 a c and e diameter of pump outlet pipe or discharge pipe diameter another explanatory variable which is adopted by iran s bsb wrm company to define the rpwn is diameter of pump outlet pipe according to fig 5 b d and f 70 of active pumping wells i e 15 520 wells in tehran aquifer have outlet pipe with diameter smaller than 2 in 50 mm whereas 15 of wells i e 3 310 wells has a diameter 4 in 100 mm in both aquifers of arak and qazvin 65 of total pumping wells have outlet pipe with diameter 4 in 100 mm pumping rate of wells according to fig 6 a from 22 220 active pumping wells in tehran aquifer 18 499 wells 83 2 withdraw groundwater in a rate of 10 l s fig 6 c 1 576 7 2 wells have pumping rate ranged from 10 to 20 l s and the others i e 2 145 wells or 9 6 have a pumping rate of 20 l s in arak aquifer fig 6 c 66 4 20 3 and 13 3 of all wells have a pumping rate of 10 l s 10 to 20 l s and 20 l s respectively surprisingly in the qazvin aquifer 42 3 of all active wells have a pumping rate of 20 l s annual pumping time of wells spatial distribution of annual pumping time of active wells over the study aquifers are shown in fig 6 b d and f in tehran aquifer pumping time of 45 46 active pumping wells 10 103 wells are 2 000 hr y r 29 0 6 451 wells have ranged from 4 000 to 6 000 hr y r and 25 44 5 666 wells pumped groundwater in duration 4 000 hr y r whereas in arak and qazvin plains 52 1 045 wells and 59 2 498 wells of all active wells have a pumping time 4 000 hr y r saturation thickness of pumping well length of pumping well screen which penetrates in saturated part of aquifer could be obtained by subtracting the layer of depth of pumping well from the depth to groundwater partially penetrating of well screen in saturated zone of aquifer will be less efficient due to distortion of the flow lines through well and greater head loss todd and mays 2005 in this study the layer of depth of pumping well is subtracted from the layer of depth to groundwater by the spatial analyst toolbox of arcgis to obtain the saturation thickness of each pumping well according to fig 7 a c and e 76 0 of pumping wells 16 870 wells in the tehran aquifer included in saturation thickness class of 30 m 11 5 2 571 wells in the range of 30 to 60 m and other 12 5 or 2 779 wells in class of 60 m whereas in arak and qazvin aquifers 43 of all active pumping wells 864 and 1 807 wells respectively are in saturation thickness class of 60 m aquifer thickness thickness of strata is another explanatory variable of aquifer that iran s bsb wrm company considered to adopt the rpwn in the aquifers this map is obtained based on interpolation of point data of aquifer thickness in location of observation wells by inverse distance weighting method idw in gis environment as also shown in fig 7 b d and f in the tehran aquifer 41 2 of aquifer area has a thickness 100 m 33 0 between 100 and 200 m and 25 6 200 m whereas 71 of arak aquifer and 78 of qazvin aquifer has a thickness 100 m and between 100 and 200 m respectively land use land cover in this study the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi proposed by tucker 1979 is used to identify and to improve the discrimination between land use land cover categories in the study areas this vegetation index provides information on the amount and vigor of vegetation considering the near infrared nir and visible red bands of the electromagnetic spectrum calculated by the eq 5 osunmadewa et al 2018 5 ndvi nir r e d nir r e d where nir and red represent the reflectance in the near infrared and red band respectively for the operational land imager oli sensor on the landsat 8 with spatial resolution of 30 m which used in this study the nir and red bands are band 5 0 85 0 88 μ m and band 4 0 64 0 67 μ m respectively the ndvi value ranges from 1 to 1 the pixels with ndvi values of 0 1 represents well and dense vegetation and the less values ndvi 0 1 classified as bare grounds piao et al 2011 mohajane et al 2018 fig 8 a c and e presents the spatial distribution of ndvi values across three study areas during growing season of 2018 the classes of moderate and high density vegetation i e ndvi 0 1 are the dominant ndvi land cover classes for the qazvin study area 60 while low density vegetation i e ndvi 0 1 occupied the largest portions of the tehran and arak areas 55 and 59 respectively distance of well from main roads accessibility of selected pumping well is crucial for data compilation and controlling change in pumping instruments distance from main roads is another explanatory variable that iran s bsb wrm company considered to adopt the rpwn fig 8 b d and f show the distance of active pumping wells from the main roads across three aquifers areas which categorized into three classes 200 m between 200 and 1000 m and 1000 m it reveals from this figure that in the urban areas the distance of pumping wells from roads is less than other land uses moreover the network of main road in tehran aquifer is denser than the others type of alluvial deposits fig 9 a c and e show spatial distribution of alluvial deposits across three study aquifers which are obtained based on interpolation of dominant alluvial in profile of exploration wells i e well logs by inverse distance weighting idw method in gis environment the amount of fine material clay silt and fine sand consists of 57 of tehran aquifer area the fine materials generally increase towards the center and the south of the aquifer medium sized deposits coarse sand and medium gravel consists 36 of aquifer area mainly observed in north zones arak aquifer mainly 69 2 consists of sand and medium gravel which observed all over aquifer the dominant deposits of qazvin aquifer is coarse gravel 61 6 spreads in north and east parts transmissivity aquifer transmissivity is one of most important variables affecting yields of a pumping well the higher the transmissivity the greater the capability of the aquifer to move water and the lower the drawdown in the pumping well sterrett 2007 the transmissivity maps of three aquifers are produced in gis environment based on interpolation of point data of transmissivity obtained from pumping tests according to fig 9 b d and f 16 7 of aquifer area in the north and northwest parts have the highest value of transmissivity 2000 m 2 d whereas 40 of aquifer has transmissivity 1000 m 2 d toward the central and south parts of the aquifer the values of transmissivity steadily reduces and reach to its minimum value at 200 m 2 d while no transmissivity value 2 000 m 2 d is observed in the arak aquifer 89 of this aquifer area has a transmissivity smaller than 1 000 m 2 d and 11 in southern part has a transmissivity between 1 000 to 2 000 m 2 d spatial distribution of high transmissivity values in qazvin aquifer indicates that 55 5 of aquifer area has a transmissivity 1 000 m 2 d 17 between 1 000 to 2 000 m 2 d and 27 3 2 000 m 2 d the reasons for decreasing transmissivity in the study aquifer are reduction of thickness of aquifer and decreasing hydraulic conductivity due to reduction of size of alluvial deposits 5 results and discussion the above mentioned classified features for three study aquifers are then rated in three categories of low medium and high values as summarized in table 3 the number of pumping wells and also annual pumping volume in each class of ten features are also presented in table 3 the final overlaid maps of study aquifers are produced by overlapping the ten rated layers the final overlaid maps are classified into ten statistically independent zones as shown in fig 10 a c result of paired t test on the difference of average withdrawal volume of pumping wells in ten considered zones a vw pw of obtained overlaid maps are shown in table 4 results in table 4 indicates the a vw pw of ten zones adopted for three aquifers are different in significance level of 95 i e α 0 05 since the calculated t statistics are much greater than the corresponding critical value t cal t crit therefore separation of all active pumping wells over the aquifers as the population into ten zones will produce improved estimates of total groundwater withdrawal than the use of ungrouped data the number of wells adopted by the iran s bsb wrm company current rpwn for tehran arak and qazvin aquifers are 118 56 and 99 respectively the difference between the zonation of the study aquifer adopted by iran s bsb wrm company and that generated in this study fig 10 a to c are the modifications made on the explanatory variables to establish rpwn these modifications as also described earlier in the section of rpwn approach include i the layer of depth of pumping well is subtracted from the layer of depth to groundwater to obtain the saturation thickness of each pumping well ii transmissivity of aquifer in the location of pumping wells is also considered as additional feature to increase the accuracy of the adopted method and iii the data layer type of irrigated crop is replaced by ndvi layer the representative pumping wells in each zone are selected by simultaneous optimization of two objective functions of 1 and of 2 presented in eqs 1 and 2 linear combination of of 1 and of 2 with equal weights is considered and optimized by optimization toolbox of matlab through constrained nonlinear minimization with discrete variables algorithm the gww estimations by the current rpwn adopted by iran s bsb wrm co modified rpwn this study and the last official data compilation on 2007 are summarized in table 5 assuming the official records on 2007 are true the errors of estimated g w w from the tehran arak and qazvin aquifers by the modified rpwn approach are 0 2 0 96 and 1 41 respectively these errors are much smaller than those obtained by the current rpwn on the study aquifers i e 20 0 19 87 and 26 15 respectively interestingly the small values of errors in gww estimation by modified rpwn are obtained for 50 selected wells whereas the number of selected wells for rpwn adopted by iran s bsb wrm company are 118 for tehran aquifer 56 for arak aquifer and 99 for qazvin aquifer the associated costs for data compilation required for gww estimation e g pumping rate and time is directly related to number of wells included in rpwn according to the fiscal year of 2018 the costs of data compilation for a representative well is 4 25 usd monthly 51 usd annually for twelve times data compilation at the end of each month bearing this in mind selecting 50 wells for modified rpwn of each study aquifer has a data compilation costs equal to 2 550 usd yearly see also table 5 this amount includes only the costs of traveling and filling the required form by staffs mainly about the pumping period once every month the costs of well drilling and installation of instruments are not included since the data compilation is carried out for the active pumping wells therefore the modified rpwn for three study aquifers has a reduction of data compilation costs as 58 0 for tehran aquifer 10 6 for arak aquifer and 49 4 for qazvin aquifer along with two modifications made on the input variables to generate final overlaid map the reason for larger discrepancy in estimation of gww by the rpwn adopted by iran s bsb wrm company in comparison to the rpwn developed in the study areas could be due to the way for solving the optimization problem based on iran s bsb wrm company guideline two objective functions of of 1 and of 2 eqs 1 and 2 should be optimized for selecting the representative wells in each zone optimization of of 1 and of 2 are often done manually i e trial and error by expert hydrogeologists whereas a global nonlinear automatic procedure is employed in this study for finding the optimal set of decision variables i e representative pumping wells in each zone using the automated optimization technique assures the selection of a globally optimal set detection while manual optimization of objective functions may result in poor local optimum traps motivated in part by the cost aspect of data compilation on wells included in rpwn the desired rpwn needs to have a trade off between cost of data compilation which depends on sample size i e number of selected wells in rpwn and its accuracy in estimation of gww across the aquifer the variations of data compilation cost monthly inventory of pumping rate and time of the representative wells and accuracy of adopted rpwn versus number of selected pumping wells for rpwn are computed only for tehran aquifer as example and the results are shown in fig 11 increasing the number of wells in the adopted rpwn between 5 and 30 and 70 to 120 has a minor effect 0 04 on enhancing the accuracy of the network in gww estimation whereas increasing the number of wells included in rpwn between 30 and 70 will significantly decrease the error of gww estimation 0 38 as an additional check we compared the probability density functions fitted to the annual gww from all individual pumping wells pumping wells selected for rpwn adopted in the study aquifers i e modified rpwn and the current rpwn implemented by iran s bsb wrm company in three study aquifers annual gww estimated by the current rpwn modified rpwn and formal data compilation from all active wells exhibit a log normal distribution at significance level of α 0 05 table 6 therefore the probability distribution of sampled wells for current and modified rpwn approaches are the same as the distribution of the population i e all active wells as a further investigation and due to complexity and spatial variability of the withdrawal volume across the studied aquifer multiple linear regression mlp between withdrawal volume of each individual pumping well and corresponding ten explanatory variables is undertaken to search for statistically significant explanatory variables table 7 results of stepwise regression analysis indicate that the pumping rate q is the most related explanatory variable to estimate the gww in three aquifers based on two goodness of fit criteria of determination coefficient r 2 ranged 0 766 to 0 875 and standard error of estimation se 113 87 103 to 138 06 103 m 3 yr the stepwise regression analysis given in table 7 also indicates that the explanatory variables which have the most correlation to the g w w in tehran aquifer are pumping rate q pumping time t diameter of pump outlet pipe d type of alluvial deposits s water consumption type c saturation thickness of pumping well b and transmissivity of aquifer t have the most correlation to the g w w in tehran aquifer r 2 0 850 and se 91 12 103 m 3 yr for the arak aquifer variables of q t c d s and ndvi as a proxy of land use land cover have the most correlation to gww with r 2 0 902 and se 68 52 103 m 3 yr the most related variables to gww in qazvin aquifer are q t and d with r 2 0 920 and se 110 61 103 m 3 yr the variables excluded in each case of regression analysis have an insignificant degree of modification in terms of r 2 and se the variables of aquifer thickness z and distance from the main roads r are the collaborative explanatory variables to estimate gww in three study areas whereas the difference between three study aquifers for estimation of gww are related to variables of ndvi c t and s table 7 more investigation is carried out to seek a promising tool for prediction of gww based on large dataset of the most correlated explanatory variables support vector regression svr vapnik 1995 with different kernel function is adopted for this purpose due to its proficiency in simulating and predicting large scale and complex phenomena schölkopf and smola 2002 gizaw and gan 2016 svr has been successfully applied in the fields of water resources engineering and hydrology for purposes such as streamflow prediction e g asefa et al 2006 luo et al 2019 lake and groundwater water level prediction e g khan and coulibaly 2006 yoon et al 2011 regionalization of contaminants in aquifers hosseini and mahjouri 2014 moreover results of t test indicates the explanatory variables to be tested in the multiple regression models are independent and are normally distributed with equal population variances and therefore no data transformation or ranking is required to undertake on the input variables sensitivity analysis was also performed to examine the contribution degree of explanatory variables to the gww estimated through the developed method in this study li and merchant 2013 parizi et al 2019 4 p v j av rw j av rw av rw 100 where pv is the percentage of variation in the estimated g w w av rw j is the estimated annual withdrawal volume of aquifer by removing the explanatory variable j in the adopted approach and av rw is the estimated annual withdrawal volume of aquifer considering all explanatory variables for instance the pv values corresponding to ten explanatory variables of tehran aquifer are shown in fig 12 results indicate the predominant influence of pumping rate and time on the estimation of gww from the study aquifer pv 3 61 and 3 13 respectively the impact of the distance from the roads and water consumption type has the minimum influence on gww estimation in this aquifer pv 0 07 and 0 06 respectively 6 conclusion the representative pumping wells network rpwn is a combined approach which incorporates ten explanatory features related to hydrogeological characteristics of aquifer and properties of pumping wells to estimate the total gww from aquifer by pumping wells was presented in this study this approach adopted by iran s bsb wrm company employs statistical and rate and time methods that have been implemented across 536 aquifers in the country since 2007 the original rpwn approach was modified in this study by incorporating more influential explanatory variables including use of the saturation thickness of each pumping well transmissivity of aquifer and the layer of ndvi and adopting an automatic optimization method for selection of representative wells the original rpwn uses a manual optimization procedure the modified rpwn approach were tested on three study aquifers of tehran with 22 220 pumping wells arak with 2 022 pumping wells and qazvin with 4 240 pumping wells in northern iran while the number of representative wells selected for the current rpwn by iran s bsb wrm company are 118 for tehran aquifer 56 for arak aquifer and 99 for qazvin aquifer the proposed rpwn in this study adopted only 50 wells for each study aquifer the reduced size of rpwn adopted in this study leads to decreasing the costs of monthly data compilation costs of traveling and filling the form by staffs required for gww estimation over developed network moreover the computational errors of gww estimation by the proposed rpwn in three study aquifers are 0 2 for tehran aquifer 0 96 for arak aquifer and 1 41 for qazvin aquifer which are much smaller than the current network i e 20 0 19 87 and 26 15 respectively the modified rpwn in this study has important benefits over existing network the problem of well selection is easier by adopting an automatic optimization procedure for manually optimization more accurate smaller error in gww estimation and impose less financial burden for data compilation i e pumping time monthly by significantly reducing the number of selected wells the adopted rpwn approach is also a robust consistent efficient and effective tool for estimation of gww by pumping wells since its original form is currently implemented in 536 study area and therefore its efficiency has been checked through data inventory during recent decade the proposed approach is also particularly suited to regions where the widespread presence of pumping wells provides a dense observation network in which data compilation from all of active pumping wells impose a great deal of financial load the methods presented here can easily be used for other aquifer systems particularly as the electronic availability of data increases also the flexibility of these gis based methods makes the incorporation of new data and integration of additional processes relatively straightforward the primary limitations associated with the rpwn approach is checking the robustness of the method over time only one official data compilation of all pumping wells exist for iran s aquifers in year 2007 in addition the accuracy of the adopted rpwn for the estimation of gww may become outdated after several years of use by changing the number of active pumping wells some of the included explanatory variables e g pumping time t and pumping rate q transmissivity of aquifer t saturation thickness of aquifer b and ndvi may change by groundwater level fluctuation and land use land cover dynamics however the variables of aquifer sediment s distance from the main roads r and aquifer thickness z have not significant change during time the pumping rate and time t of the rpwn have been monitored continuously at each season by iran s bsb wrm company since only an official inventory of all pumping wells in 2007 is available the verification of the proposed approach in this study is limited to this date as some of pumping wells over aquifer come online and others go offline their time rate relations changed therefore a redo the exercise from time to time may needed to make sure the well locations and numbers are always best at any given point in time moreover the method developed in this study does not consider the unmeasured gww by the unlicensed unauthorized pumping wells that is estimated to be significant in the iran s aquifers in the regions which precise estimation of gww through the unlicensed pumping wells the proposed approach can provide results with more accuracy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

components have been studied individually in previous work little attention has been paid to the integrated characteristics of nrw and the corresponding relationships among the components in fact few other studies have considered how nrw components form and change let alone how they contribute to land surface water lsw balance and influence crop water requirements in china in this paper a method will be established for identifying components of nrw based on a combination of lysimeter measurements and micro meteorological data from dingxi station in the summer monsoon transition zone smtz of china diurnal time series of nrw components will be given the relationship between nrw and climatic and environmental factors is then analyzed finally the diurnal and annual variations of nrw and how they contribute to lsw balance and crop water requirements are discussed the results show that the influence of climatic and environmental conditions to occur dew and wva is different even opposite affects such as relative humidity to that there is negative feedback between soil moisture and wva this does not hold however for dew the variation characteristics of dew and wva are different their diurnal variation shows the complementary characteristics of each other not only that the annual distribution of nrw also complemented with that of precipitation although nrw contributes to no more than 15 of the water balance in a full year nrw plays a leading role during the non monsoon period wherein the amount of nrw is 1 3 5 times that of precipitation moreover it is just the period of soil water conservation and sowing date for crops such as winter wheat therefore the existence of nrw is fundamental for alleviating agricultural drought it explained that nrw has great significance for reducing agricultural losses and understanding the lsw balance in the smtz keywords summer monsoon transition zone smtz lysimeter non rainfall water nrw land surface water lsw balance crop water requirement period 1 introduction non rainfall water nrw refers to land surface water lsw in liquid form from sources other than natural rainfall and irrigation agam and berliner 2006 and comprises fog water dew water and water vapor adsorption wva from the atmosphere as well as soil distilled water capillary water and guttation zhang et al 2010 uclés et al 2013 from the soil sometimes nrw exceeds even rainfall as one of the primary water source malek et al 1999 and plays a role to maintain the ecological system not only in arid and semi arid regions shachak and steinberger 1980 kidron 2000 henschel and seely 2008 weber et al 2016 kaseke et al 2017 but also in humid areas meissner et al 2007 xiao et al 2009 groh et al 2018a as a typical semi arid region the summer monsoon transition zone smtz in china is an ecologically fragile region in the asian summer monsoon system therefore nrw in this area is of great significance for ecology and water resource utilization compared to rainfall nrw has more particular ecological and climatic effects on the smtz in china as a factor in sustaining productivity in arid semi arid environments kaseke et al 2017 rainfall in the smtz occurs mainly in the summer monsoon period from june to september by contrast nrw appears throughout the year occurring even more frequently than that of rainfall during the non monsoon period and can therefore reduce the internal water deficit of plants and supplement plant water content during the non monsoon period which is a key period for conserving moisture and the sowing date of winter wheat moreover the efficiency of absorption and utilization of nrw is much greater than that of rainfall kidron et al 2000 2011 it plays a crucial role over the semi arid arid regions of the smtz where precipitation is critically low as far as plant water requirements are concerned nrw is also an important water source for the survival of insects and small animals in desert regions wang et al 2016 furthermore in simulations soil moisture often dries too quickly in numerical models involving the arid semi arid regions of the smtz sakaguchi and zeng 2009 which we assume is closely related to neglecting the contribution of nrw therefore nrw has important effects on soil water and ecological systems especially over the arid and semi arid regions of the smtz the nrw variation and the relationship between nrw components and impact factors deserve special attention in water resource management and agro ecological planning over the unique climatic and environmental region of the smtz among the different nrw components it remains difficult to measure the amounts of soil distilled water capillary water and guttation although the amounts of fog water dew and wva cannot be measured directly by instruments they can be estimated by observation and analysis agam and berliner 2004 2006 as fog rarely occurs in the smtz of china dew and wva are the two most important nrw components there and of the two dew has been researched more in depth previous studies have shown that dew is formed by the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere when the surface temperature is lower than the dew point temperature agam and berliner 2006 uclés et al 2013 the earliest exploiting of dew can be traced back to the 16th century beysens et al 2001 and the number of dew studies has increased gradually since the middle of the 20th century monteith 1957 garratt and segal 1988 jacobs et al 2000 kim and lee 2011 the methods for observing dew have improved from artificial condensation surfaces to actual underlying surfaces zhang et al 2011b the conditions for dew to form and the effects of dew have been studied in many locations worldwide a study in athens malek et al 1999 reported dew formation at levels of 0 068 0 09 mm day in the dry climate of morocco lekouch et al 2011 reported an average daily amount of 0 1 mm day while the maximum diurnal amount of dew for the semi arid area of the loess plateau can reach 0 3 mm day wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 found that dew on the crust surface in the gurbantunggut desert of china was 0 1 mm day the maximum amount of dew reported in the literature was 0 8 mm day as observed in the u s by kabela et al 2009 although the author states that this value may be overestimated it is significant that the amounts of dew reported in various areas worldwide vary widely the effect of dew on the overall water balance is very important in arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2015 the total amount of nrw in humid areas is larger than that in arid and semi arid area accounting for about 5 of annual precipitation jacobs et al 2006 meissner et al 2007 groh et al 2018a xiao et al 2009 still the ecological and hydrological role of nrw should not be ignored in humid areas compared to dew there has been less research previously into wva but some primary knowledge does exist for example wva is the direct absorption of water vapor from the air by soil agam and berliner 2006 due to the limitations of current observation and measurement techniques the magnitude of this absorption can only be estimated indirectly kosmas et al 1998 showed that wva is one reason for the diurnal variation of soil moisture during an eight month observation period the total amount of wva was observed to be 226 mm whereas the rainfall in the same period was only 179 mm by analyzing data collected from an inshore desert agam and berliner 2004 concluded that the surface of bare soil supports very little dew and that wva is the actual reason for the diurnal variation of soil moisture verhoef et al 2006 studied wva in the south of spain and found that the amount of wva accumulated in one day could reach 0 7 mm those previous studies indicate that wva is important in arid and semi arid areas influence factors of nrw are the premise to calculating nrw s amount and also help to understand the formation mechanism of nrw some results show that not only air temperature humidity wind speed and cloud cover are important for nrw occurrence muselli et al 2002 wang and zhang 2011 xiao et al 2013 but also daily amplitude of relative humidity rh soil structure soil water content and soil temperature kosmas et al 2001 verhoef et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 some studies involved the ecological relevance of nrw for crop growth so far which mostly appeared in dew research in general dew has two different effects on crops on the one hand it can help recover the crops state due to water loss went 1955 nikolayev et al 1996 agam and berliner 2006 by increasing the water use efficiency ben asher et al 2010 on the other hand dew also provides a moist environment for pathogens that may lead to the spread of crop diseases zuberer and kenerley 1993 wilson et al 1999 there are almost no results about the influence of wva on crop growth in the aforementioned more results have pointed out that dew has advantages and disadvantages for the growth of summer crops while the role of dew in winter and spring has not been studied due to the difficulty in observing nrw components a comprehensive understanding relationship between these components is not sufficient nrw s contribution to land water balance and the role of nrw for crop water supply is not clear so far especially in the smtz with particular rainfall and crop water requirements to date insufficient research attention has been paid to nrw and little research has been done on the integral characteristics of nrw in the present paper we address the following three main questions 1 what are the overall performance and matching characteristics of nrw components and how do the characteristics of nrw vary with impact factors in the smtz of china 2 what is the relationship between nrw components and climatic and environmental factors 3 how does nrw affect lsw balance and crop water supply in the smtz in order to answer these questions on the basis of effective nrw components obtained by a combination of lysimeter measurements and micro meteorological observations the present study begins by analyzing how climatic and environmental factors contribute to nrw formation the discussion then progresses to how nrw contributes to the balance of water and surface energy in the smtz finally the effect of nrw on crop water supply in the smtz is explored the results provide a better understanding of the characteristics of nrw in the smtz and serve as a reference for water resource management and agricultural planning services and also for considering parameterization nrw in numerical modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation site the data used in this study was collected from dingxi observational station 35 33 22 n 104 35 37 e dingxi is located in the smtz of china fig 1 a which is in a typical loess foothill environment in a semi arid region fig 1b the average annual precipitation there is 380 mm making it prone to drought given the critical state of crop and ecological water requirements rainfall is concentrated in the period of may to october providing almost 90 of the annual amount the temperature difference between day and night is relatively large with an annual average temperature of 6 7 c and an annual potential evaporation of 1536 mm the region is dominated by northwesterly wind in winter and spring but experiences mainly southeasterly wind in summer and autumn as is typical of a semi arid region the station is located approximately 5 km from the edge of an urban area with an elevation of 1860 m fig 1b 2 2 observation data the primary meteorological elements observed at dingxi fig 1c are wind temperature and humidity gradients 1 2 4 10 16 m with a sampling rate of every 10 min in the surface layer we used hmp45d sensors to measure the air temperature and humidity waa151 sensors to measure the wind speed and wav151 sensors to measure the wind direction all from vaisala corporation finland radiation fluxes including global radiation reflected radiation and upward and downward long wave radiation were measured by a set of radiometers pir psp eppley inc usa at a height of 1 5 m with a sampling rate of every 10 min soil temperature 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 80 cm model 107 l campbell scientific soil heat flux 5 cm model hfp01 hukse flux netherlands soil moisture 10 20 40 50 80 cm model cs616 campbell scientific with a sampling rate of every 20 min and rainfall te525mm campbell scientific with a sampling rate of every 10 min were also measured land surface actual evapotranspiration et and nrw were measured with a large lysimeter fig 1d to an accuracy of 0 03 mm and a sensitivity of 0 01 mm when the lysimeter data is less than the accuracy the data is considered low quality data the diameter of the lysimeter was 2 25 m and the effective evapotranspiration area was 4 0 m2 at a depth of 2 65 m data was recorded every hour evapotranspiration during twilight and night tolk et al 2006 groh et al 2019 which can be considered to be an opposite water flux to nrẃs at night naturally limit the occurrence of nrw using hourly values in our analyses to a certain extent might lead to an underestimation of nrw 2 3 data processing the observation period was from 1st june 2004 to 31st may 2005 hourly data was used to calculate the distribution of nrw whilst monthly mean data was used to calculate the rate of nrw hourly data was then converted to monthly data by simple arithmetic averaging namely the value of every hour data in a whole day divided by 24 in order to obtain a daily mean value the exception to this was the amount of rainfall and nrw which was calculated by a sum of every hour in a day then in order to obtain monthly data every daily mean value in a month divided by number of days 28 30 or 31 the occurrence frequency of nrw was the simple arithmetic averaging of wva and dew the lysimeter was calibrated on may 23rd 24th 2004 to ensure data quality the sampling frequency of lysimeter data was hourly lysimeter data pre and post processing was needed to reduce the impact of noise on the determination of water balance components from lysimeter observations hannes et al 2015 peters et al 2017 pütz et al 2016 gebler et al 2015 groh et al 2018b herbrich et al 2017 the data filtered hannes et al 2015 was adopted in this paper the proportion of efficiency data after filtering is about 71 firstly the data during rainfall snowfall and sandstorm periods were removed secondly outliers during unreliable periods were eliminated by visual detection then a threshold filter was implemented to remove the unrealistic data the threshold value in this paper was set to 0 08 mm h which based on the literature results kabela et al 2009 the data greater than 0 08 mm h was eliminated finally we extrapolated short term missing data by the linear trend interpolation method namely when a quantity was once an hour or twice in two hours the linear interpolation was adapted by using 2 adjacent points average according to the linear changing trend of quantity there is no imputation for long term missing data the same data have been applied zhang et al 2011a 2015 note that beijing time bt was used for all the data herein the specific method used to estimate the nrw from the lysimeter data is described in section 2 4 all observation data was quality controlled 2 4 determination of nrw component of land surface water in addition to precipitation nrw is also an important component of lsw previous studies have showed that the lsw balance should include the component of nrw fig 2 a an important reason for this is that the technology for observing nrw is not yet fully developed the most reliable way to observe and measure nrw is by means of a lysimeter van de griend and owe 1994 however this also needs to be combined with micro meteorological and conventional meteorological observation data in order to distinguish between different types of nrw observed with lysimeter weight changes herein we use the method described in fig 2b to calculate the nrw 2 5 several definitions the nrw component observed by a weighing lysimeter can be expressed as 1 w nrw 1000 i 0 i t δ w i ρ w s p where w nrw is the amount of dew or wva mm ρ w is the density of water kg m3 wi is weight value as nrw occurrence kg δ w i is the instantaneous nrw value observed by the lysimeter kg when there is no nrw we have δ w i 0 i is the series number of the instantaneous value at each 60 min interval sp is the lysimeter surface area m2 and t is the length of time for each data sampling s herein we assume t 3600 s i e 1 h based on the above statement it is easy to calculate the various statistics of the nrw component the average diurnal variation of the amount of nrw can be calculated as 2 w nrw j k 1 365 w a k j 365 where j is the hour number of each day ranked from 1 to 24 w nrw j is the dew amount or wva amount at hour j mm k is the sequence of days from 1 to 365 and w a k j is the dew amount and wva amount of hour j on day k the frequency of occurrence of the nrw s average diurnal variation can be calculated as 3 f nrw j n d j 365 100 where f nrw j is the frequency of occurrence of nrw at hour j as a percentage n d j is the number of days with the formation of nrw at hour j in the whole year i e fewer than 365 similarly the monthly amount of nrw in one year can be calculated as 4 w nrw s k 1 h s w a s k where w nrw s is the amount of nrw in month s mm k is the sequence of the hour number of month s h s is the number of hours in month s which differs each month but is never greater than 24 31 and w a s k is the amount of nrw in hour k of month s the frequency of occurrence of monthly nrw in one year can be calculated as 5 f nrw s m m s m 0 s 100 where f nrw s is the frequency of occurrence of nrw in month s as a percentage m m s is the day number for the occurrence of nrw in month s which is less than m 0 s and m 0 s is the number of days in month s which differs each month but never exceeds 31 finally the rate of nrw occurrence is calculated as 6 r nrw s a m s m 0 s where r nrw s is the rate of nrw occurrence mm d a m s is the daily average amount of nrw in a month m 0 s is the number of days in month s in addition when calculating the climatic factor gradient it is expressed as 4 m 1 m in our text if we calculated a variable gradient at 4 m minus that at 1 m for example the gradient of relative humidity between 4 m and 1 m was expressed 4 m 1 m relative humidity difference in this manuscript the same is applied to soil temperature and soil moisture then these factors are average divided into 3 5 groups in principle for example the soil moisture range is about from 0 15 m3 m3 to 0 5 m3 m3 but few values are near 0 15 m3 m3 or 0 42 m3 m3 groups were set arbitrarily to 3 for soil moisture 0 25 0 25 0 35 and 0 35 it is similar to other impact factors 3 results 3 1 diurnal and annual characteristics of nrw variation characteristics of dew and wva must differ because climatic and environmental factors produced different effect on dew and wva as shown in fig 10 the timings of the peak values of wva and dew clearly differ with the peak value of dew occurring at night and the peak value of wva occurring at 14 00 while the mean nrw diurnal variation fluctuated very little fig 3 a the maximum amount of dew occurred between 16 00 and 09 00 the following morning because dew can only occur when the surface temperature is below the dew point temperature the surface temperature cannot be below the dew point temperature during the day and consequently dew cannot occur from 09 00 to 16 00 the soil becomes relatively dry because of comparatively strong evaporation in the morning and the attraction between soil particles and water molecules is strongest at that time consequently this leads to wva being easier to occur and a high level of adsorption in the afternoon this indicates that diurnal variation of dew and wva exists in a good complementarity which maintains a steady daily amount of nrw the diurnal variations of occurrence frequency of dew wva and their sum are consistent with the diurnal variations of their amounts fig 3b though the wva occurrence frequency is greater than that of dew the maximum amount of dew 7mm occurred in october of non monsoon season and the minimum occurred in june of monsoon season when no dew formed fig 4 a this pattern occurred because in autumn following the temperature decrease the large diurnal temperature difference and sufficient water vapor conditions created the most beneficial conditions for dew condensation in june it was unlikely that the surface temperature would decrease to below the dew point temperature which together with the lack of water vapor in the semi arid environment at this time prevented the formation of dew the peak wva 4 8 mm occurred in november while the minimum occurred in june for most of the year except from june to september the region with the highest wva had the lowest formation of dew and vice versa this reflects their different formation mechanisms and also indicates their mutually complementary relationship the total amount of nrw was 52 mm during the whole year which represented the effective water supply to the semi arid climate region of the smtz especially in the dry non monsoon period the monthly wva occurrence frequency was very high fig 4b the maximum value was 25 days for november whereas the monthly frequency of occurrence of dew was relatively low the annual number of days on which absorption occurred was 152 whereas it was 135 days for the occurrence of dew thus wva was more likely to occur than was dew although their phases are asymmetric some complementarity exists 3 2 relationship between nrw and climatic and environmental factors the mean rate of wva shows an obvious decrease when the soil moisture increases correlation coefficient r 0 74 fig 5 a which is consistent with that frequency there is no clear trend from mean rates of dew when the soil moisture increases fig 5b also shows this the wva occurrence frequency was greater when the soil was drier less than 0 25 m3 m3 with the maximum value being close to 12 the dew occurrence frequency was highest when the soil moisture ranged from 0 25 to 0 35 m3 m3 with the maximum being just 5 6 there were small differences between the different soil moisture intervals with regard to the thermodynamic state mean rate variation of dew with surface temperature does not show obvious an trend whereas that of wva with surface temperature decreases and their correlation coefficient is 0 82 fig 6 a it indicated that the rate does not reflect the relationship between nrw and surface temperature from fig 6b it can be seen that wva occurrence frequency did not change significantly with surface temperature but there was an obvious change in the dew occurrence frequency the dew occurrence frequency was highest at 10 when the surface temperature ranged from 0 c to 10 c but this decreased when the surface temperature exceeded 10 c it is a remarkable fact that frequency of frost occurrence is also about 5 which exceeds the frequency of dew in summer the available energy difference between net radiation r n and soil heat flux g on the land as the main source of energy for water molecules on the soil surface determines the energy state of wva or evaporation condensation processes to some extent and is the most important condition influencing wva or evaporation condensation processes the rate of dew is evidently different from that of wva the former occurs mainly below 0 w m2 and the latter is mainly above 0 w m2 it shows that energy required for dew and wva to occur are completely different fig 7 a this just reflects the complementary characteristics of dew and wva it seems completely different from fig 7b in fact their trend is consistent if fig 7b is divided into two intervals less than 0 w m2 and greater than 0 w m2 phase change in the condensation process releases heat and the adsorption process converts the internal energy of molecules into heat energy and then releases it thus when the available energy was negative the amount of dew reached the maximum of 24 8 mm when the range of available energy was 0 150 w m2 evaporation was likely to occur and the amount of wva evidently decreased by contrast the decrease in the amount of dew was more rapid in this range when the energy was 0 150 w m2 evaporation was likely to occur and the amount of wva evidently decreased on the other hand the quantity of dew decreased rapidly in this range with the quantity of dew being less than 1 mm which was almost negligible this range of 0 150 w m2 in fact represents the alternating stage of wva occurrence and evaporation processes in which the strength or weakness of the attraction between soil particles and water molecules compared to the counterattraction provided by the available energy to water molecules was the key factor in the occurrence of evaporation or wva or condensation wva predominantly occurs when the soil moisture gradient is small the rate of wva drops sharply when the soil moisture gradient increases both fig 8 a and 8b show an increase after decreasing while dew occurs with the increase of soil moisture gradient wva occurred mainly where the soil moisture difference was less than 0 05 m3 m3 and occurrence frequency exceeded 8 which was mainly due to the low soil moisture of the surface soil over the range of soil moisture investigated the dew occurrence frequency was low in the middle part of the range when the difference in soil moisture was 0 025 0 05 m3 m3 the dew occurrence frequency was minimal however it increased gradually with soil moisture with the maximum occurrence frequency almost 8 in the range 0 075 0 1 m3 m3 the influences of environmental factors on each nrw component differ overall showing complementary characteristics that is to say the high value area of dew matches the low value area of wva and vice versa there are different soil temperature gradients as wva and dew occur and the boundary gradient is at about 2 c fig 8c the occurrence frequency also indicates the characteristic fig 8d that of wva was highest when the gradient of 10 cm 0 cm soil temperature ranged from 15 c to 10 c reaching 17 4 however the frequency was very low when the gradient was colder than 15 c or warmer than 0 c in short the rate of dew and wva is controlled by different soil hydrothermal conditions atmospheric wind the temperature humidity of the surface layer and their vertical gradients determine the water vapor source and transmission of nrw of these parameters the relative humidity has a very significant influence on nrw the rate of wva decreases but dew increases with the increase of rh fig 9 a wva occurs mainly when the relative humidity is 6 50 with occurrence frequency of over 10 fig 9b wva decreases significantly at higher rh with an occurrence frequency of less than 4 it is consistent with fig 7a this indicates that it would be difficult to meet the necessary water vapor conditions for the occurrence of adsorption if the atmosphere was too dry if on the other hand the atmosphere was too wet fog and dew would form easily which would restrain the adsorption of water vapor dew occurs mainly when the relative humidity exceeds 50 but the dew occurrence frequency is lower than that of wva it also shows the complementary characteristics which is similar to that in fig 8 nrw is also related to the daily amplitude of relative humidity in the surface layer fig 9c the adsorption rate of water vapor and the condensation rate both raise with an increased daily amplitude of relative humidity and therefore daily amplitude of relative humidity has an effect on the generation of wva and dew for wva an increased daily amplitude of relative humidity means that the minimum daily relative humidity decreases for dew increased daily amplitude of relative humidity means that the maximum daily relative humidity increases thereby facilitating the condensation process the variation of the rh gradient of the surface layer had a complex influence on nrw it is shown that wva increases with the increase of rh gradient in fig 10 a and 10b when rh at the heights of 1 m was greater than that of 4 m both the rate and occurrence frequency of wva were very low the converse was high at approximately 12 of the frequency this indicated that a weak humidity inversion in the surface layer favored the process of soil wva for condensation the frequency of dew in fig 10b shows the trend of first increasing and then decreasing it seems that this trend also exists in fig 10a but the dispersion is too large to draw the trend line effectively when the rh gradient was negative the dew occurrence frequency was higher than that under a positive humidity gradient a weak humidity inversion results in dew occurrence frequency being decreased this is also consistent with the temperature gradient relationship fig 10c shows a good complementary relationship between dew and wva wherein wva mainly occurs in the interval where the temperature gradient is less than 0 and dew mainly occurs in an interval of that 0 when the temperature gradient in the surface layer ranged from 1 c to 0 c the occurrence frequency of wva reached a maximum of 12 fig 10d this indicates that the temperature gradient of the surface layer facilitates adsorption simultaneously however adsorption still occurs and condensation increases when there is a weak temperature inversion in the surface layer of the atmosphere it indicates that a weak temperature inversion is more important for dew than that for wva when the temperature gradient ranged from 0 c to 2 c the dew occurrence frequency was high 6 and that of wva became weaker thereby enabling dew and wva to occur simultaneously it is more common for the two processes to supplement each other wind speed is another important factor that was found to influence nrw the influence of wind speed on dew and wva also shows complementary characteristics fig 11 an adequate wind speed facilitates the transmission of water vapor in the surface layer towards the surface and increasing the wind speed also increases the downward heat flux keeping the surface warmer it is beneficial to forming dew however but an excessive wind speed will increase evapotranspiration and water vapor loss from the surface layer resulting in decreased dew and then low soil moisture increased wva it is shown that negative feedback exists between wind speed and dew occurrence but positive feedback exists between wind speed and wva occurrence 3 3 contribution of nrw to water balance and role of nrw in non monsoon period as can be seen from the contribution of nrw to lsw balance fig 12 a rainfall remains the leading component of the annual lsw balance in smtz accounting for 85 of the evapotranspiration et which is calculated by lysimeter data the amounts of dew and wva are of the same order accounting for approximately 10 of evaporation with fog making the lowest contribution to the water balance of just 1 3 mm which is completely negligible additionally there is still a 4 6 difference which is called others fig 12b the possible main factors covered by the category others are i the lsw deficit caused by climate warming and drying thereby leading to water imbalance ii instrumental error however it should be noted this category accounts for only 4 of evaporation which meets the needs of the overall water balance nrw accounts for approximately 10 of the overall contribution to evapotranspiration this also shows that the role of nrw in the water balance cannot be ignored in the smtz of china although nrw is not dominant in lsw it plays a special role in the smtz of china its ratio relative to rainfall was high in the non monsoon period october march exceeding 2 and rising to 3 7 in november fig 13 whereas the ratio was much lower in the monsoon period may september the ratio of wva to rainfall was also high in the non monsoon period exceeding 2 and the ratio for dew was also high in that period moreover spring wheat and winter wheat are the main grain crops in the smtz of china precipitation is very low mostly close to zero during the sowing and emergence of winter wheat in the non monsoon period which is not conducive to the emergence of winter wheat under dry soil at this time nrw alone provides the moisture required by crops thereby reducing crop mortality at least even if during the greening period which is the water requirement stage nrw supplies water and is beneficial to the growth of winter wheat as the amount of nrw exceeds that of precipitation in other words nrw supplied the predominant water source in the highest growth period of winter wheat and partial growth stage of the spring wheat in non monsoon period therefore nrw plays an important and even decisive role in maintaining the survival of spring wheat and winter wheat in the non monsoon period over the smtz of china the contribution of nrw to lsw can also be reflected from evapotranspiration fig 14 large ratios of nrw to evapotranspiration also occurred in the non monsoon period with all ratios being greater than 0 1 and rising to 0 51 in december consequently large amount of nrw and weak evapotranspiration in the non monsoon season resulted in the contribution of nrw to the lsw balance being more significant 4 discussion 4 1 formation conditions of nrw component generally speaking nrw is influenced mainly by local climate factors and environmental factors such as air temperature relative humidity wind speed soil temperature and soil moisture et al kosmas et al 2001 xiao et al 2013 the present study makes it clear that different nrw components have different relationships with climatic and environmental factors in particular micro meteorological elements such as wind speed relative humidity and moisture gradient have almost opposite effects on dew and wva which is reflected by their different formation mechanisms adsorption occurs readily which is consistent with the results agam and berliner 2006 florentin and agam 2017 the occurrence of dew clearly depends on both humidity and temperature several authors has shown these factors effect on dew garratt and segal 1988 xiao et al 2013 liu et al 2018 the vertical gradients of soil moisture and temperature effect the transmission of water and energy as well as the dynamic characteristics of soil moisture and temperature gao et al 2007 when the surface soil was warmer than the subsoil the transmission of water from the subsoil to the surface soil was restrained thereby facilitating the occurrence of wva an increase in the vertical gradient of soil temperature decreased wva but increased dew formation we attribute this to the increased vertical gradient of soil temperature as the surface cooled agam and berliner 2006 in particular a moisture inversion in the surface layer promoted the occurrence of wva whereas the occurrence of dew was favored under the opposite conditions dew occurred frequently when the relative humidity gradient was negative but far less so when the relative humidity gradient was positive wva and dew condensation are two completely different kinds of physical mechanisms the former is determined by the characteristics of the soil particles and atmospheric humidity whereas the latter is influenced mainly by microclimate in addition to the provision of water vapor dew formation is controlled by the thermal state of the surface wva occurrence was in favor of a temperature gradient from 1 c to 0 c in surface layer both the rate and occurrence frequency of nrw indicate that there is a good complementary relationship between wva and dew evapotranspiration and wva are also two inverse processes on the diurnal time scale wva occurs more favorably when the soil is dry though the evapotranspiration process is dominant at this time wva can compete with evapotranspiration during the daytime wva is more likely to occur under the following conditions when the relative humidity of the surface layer is 6 50 the wind speed is 3 4 m s the diurnal variation of relative humidity is large humidity inversion and weak instability occur the soil water content is low and the surface temperature is not very high we attribute a more humid environment being more favorable to the generation of dew wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 because a weak humidity inversion in the atmosphere causes a water vapor divergence in the bottom layer garratt and segal 1988 de vries 1958 reported that wva is dominant only when the relative humidity of the air around soil particles is less than 60 when the relative humidity exceeds 60 condensation is dominant zhuang and ratcliff 2012 reported that a relative humidity of the surface layer of more than 80 facilitates the generation of dew kosmas et al 2001 also reported similar results on the other hand dew is more likely to occur when the relative humidity of the surface layer exceeds 50 wind speed is 1 2 m s diurnal variation of relative humidity is large and a weak inversion of the air temperature the occurrence condition of dew is a little more different than that in humid areas liu et al 2018 dew and wva display obvious annual to seasonal variations wva occurs mainly by day with an annual peak in december whereas dew occurs mainly in the evening with an annual peak in october the minimum values of both parameters occur in june it should be noted that the rate of nrw is nearly consistent with their occurrence frequency small differences between them may be caused by their own incomplete meanings 4 2 nrw s contribution to lsw balance and crop water requirements in terms of the lsw balance the nrw in the present study is no more than 15 of the lsw but is an important supplement to the smtz where precipitation is critical for crop and ecological water requirements the ratio of nrw to precipitation is close to the results of a mediterranean semiarid steppe ecosystem uclés et al 2014 larger than that of haarweg station in a humid region jacobs et al 2006 but smaller than that in rice fields in a subtropical monsoon climate liu et al 2018 the amount of nrw can reach 3 5 times that of the precipitation during the dry non monsoon season which coincides with the sowing date and the emergence of winter wheat a previous study uclés et al 2016 also showed that the contribution of nrw to the water balance during a dry period was 94 in fact nrw during the non monsoon period is very important until the standing and jointing period of winter wheat and the emergence of spring wheat because rainfall is rare during non monsoon periods nrw has a more prominent influence at that time some studies have shown nrw has an important impact on the recovery of crops after water loss went 1955 agam and berliner 2006 the growth of lichens zhang et al 2009 kaseke et al 2012 and the increased total biomass of plants zhuang and ratcliff 2012 but there are few results in studying the effects of nrw on the growth period of crops this may be a field worth studying in the future so nrw should be considered as a water resource in drought prone smtz areas an excellent complementarity exists between nrw and rainfall thereby helping to alleviate seasonal droughts contribution of wva to water balance is almost equal to that of dew in the smtz in the dry season the amount of dew and wva significantly exceeds the contribution of precipitation to the water budget nrw is of great significance to water resource management agriculture and ecological planning a standard rain gauge was used to quantify the annual rainfall amount in this study we knew this kind of rain gauge underestimates the amount of rainfall in comparison to rainfall obtained from lysimeter observations gebler et al 2015 hoffmann et al 2016 herbrich et al 2017 groh et al 2018b that affects nrw on contribution to precipitation at the annual scale until now the contribution of nrw on precipitation might be overestimated because rain gauges underestimate precipitation and thus also increase the ratio of nrw on precipitation increasing the measurement frequency of lysimeter e g recording lysimeter mass changes each minute is a potentially successful method perhaps precipitation may be estimated based on lysimeter mass changes or a weighing rain gauge colli et al 2014 with more observation points thus reducing the underestimation of precipitation additionally climate warming and drying also influences lsw balance as it will change soil water when soil water increases during a period of time the ratio of nrw to et will increase and then will overestimate the ratio of nrw to et on the contrary it underestimates however the impact on lsw balance is limited cf others in fig 12 finally to appreciate the specificity of nrw in the smtz we require more extensive observations to improve our understanding of nrw characteristics and formation mechanisms in non smtz regions 5 conclusion in this work components of nrw were analyzed scientifically through a combination of lysimeter measurements and micro meteorological data the impacts of environmental and meteorological conditions on nrw were analyzed and the contributions of nrw to water balance were also investigated nrw plays an important role in alleviating drought during the critical period of crop growth in the semi arid region of the smtz the climatic and environmental conditions of dew and wva occurrence vary considerably in terms of diurnal variation wva can occur at almost any time of the day whereas dew occurs normally overnight and not during the day and the period with the highest wva has the lowest formation of dew and vice versa thus there is good complementarity between dew and wva on the diurnal scale in terms of annual variation the nrw amount during the non monsoon period is evidently higher than that during the monsoon period the annual total amount of nrw is a considerable water input to a region with a semi arid climate among the total amount of nrw dew and wva are very close which are 25 9 mm and 26 1 mm respectively that contribution to annual precipitation is 5 9 and 6 respectively wva is more likely to occur than dew thus complementarity exists additionally on the annual scale furthermore nrw dominates lsw during the non monsoon period which is vital for crop growth during that period that nrw is an important

6161,comprising mainly fog water dew water and water vapor adsorption wva non rainfall water nrw makes an important contribution to the local ecology in the arid and semi arid regions although nrw components have been studied individually in previous work little attention has been paid to the integrated characteristics of nrw and the corresponding relationships among the components in fact few other studies have considered how nrw components form and change let alone how they contribute to land surface water lsw balance and influence crop water requirements in china in this paper a method will be established for identifying components of nrw based on a combination of lysimeter measurements and micro meteorological data from dingxi station in the summer monsoon transition zone smtz of china diurnal time series of nrw components will be given the relationship between nrw and climatic and environmental factors is then analyzed finally the diurnal and annual variations of nrw and how they contribute to lsw balance and crop water requirements are discussed the results show that the influence of climatic and environmental conditions to occur dew and wva is different even opposite affects such as relative humidity to that there is negative feedback between soil moisture and wva this does not hold however for dew the variation characteristics of dew and wva are different their diurnal variation shows the complementary characteristics of each other not only that the annual distribution of nrw also complemented with that of precipitation although nrw contributes to no more than 15 of the water balance in a full year nrw plays a leading role during the non monsoon period wherein the amount of nrw is 1 3 5 times that of precipitation moreover it is just the period of soil water conservation and sowing date for crops such as winter wheat therefore the existence of nrw is fundamental for alleviating agricultural drought it explained that nrw has great significance for reducing agricultural losses and understanding the lsw balance in the smtz keywords summer monsoon transition zone smtz lysimeter non rainfall water nrw land surface water lsw balance crop water requirement period 1 introduction non rainfall water nrw refers to land surface water lsw in liquid form from sources other than natural rainfall and irrigation agam and berliner 2006 and comprises fog water dew water and water vapor adsorption wva from the atmosphere as well as soil distilled water capillary water and guttation zhang et al 2010 uclés et al 2013 from the soil sometimes nrw exceeds even rainfall as one of the primary water source malek et al 1999 and plays a role to maintain the ecological system not only in arid and semi arid regions shachak and steinberger 1980 kidron 2000 henschel and seely 2008 weber et al 2016 kaseke et al 2017 but also in humid areas meissner et al 2007 xiao et al 2009 groh et al 2018a as a typical semi arid region the summer monsoon transition zone smtz in china is an ecologically fragile region in the asian summer monsoon system therefore nrw in this area is of great significance for ecology and water resource utilization compared to rainfall nrw has more particular ecological and climatic effects on the smtz in china as a factor in sustaining productivity in arid semi arid environments kaseke et al 2017 rainfall in the smtz occurs mainly in the summer monsoon period from june to september by contrast nrw appears throughout the year occurring even more frequently than that of rainfall during the non monsoon period and can therefore reduce the internal water deficit of plants and supplement plant water content during the non monsoon period which is a key period for conserving moisture and the sowing date of winter wheat moreover the efficiency of absorption and utilization of nrw is much greater than that of rainfall kidron et al 2000 2011 it plays a crucial role over the semi arid arid regions of the smtz where precipitation is critically low as far as plant water requirements are concerned nrw is also an important water source for the survival of insects and small animals in desert regions wang et al 2016 furthermore in simulations soil moisture often dries too quickly in numerical models involving the arid semi arid regions of the smtz sakaguchi and zeng 2009 which we assume is closely related to neglecting the contribution of nrw therefore nrw has important effects on soil water and ecological systems especially over the arid and semi arid regions of the smtz the nrw variation and the relationship between nrw components and impact factors deserve special attention in water resource management and agro ecological planning over the unique climatic and environmental region of the smtz among the different nrw components it remains difficult to measure the amounts of soil distilled water capillary water and guttation although the amounts of fog water dew and wva cannot be measured directly by instruments they can be estimated by observation and analysis agam and berliner 2004 2006 as fog rarely occurs in the smtz of china dew and wva are the two most important nrw components there and of the two dew has been researched more in depth previous studies have shown that dew is formed by the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere when the surface temperature is lower than the dew point temperature agam and berliner 2006 uclés et al 2013 the earliest exploiting of dew can be traced back to the 16th century beysens et al 2001 and the number of dew studies has increased gradually since the middle of the 20th century monteith 1957 garratt and segal 1988 jacobs et al 2000 kim and lee 2011 the methods for observing dew have improved from artificial condensation surfaces to actual underlying surfaces zhang et al 2011b the conditions for dew to form and the effects of dew have been studied in many locations worldwide a study in athens malek et al 1999 reported dew formation at levels of 0 068 0 09 mm day in the dry climate of morocco lekouch et al 2011 reported an average daily amount of 0 1 mm day while the maximum diurnal amount of dew for the semi arid area of the loess plateau can reach 0 3 mm day wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 found that dew on the crust surface in the gurbantunggut desert of china was 0 1 mm day the maximum amount of dew reported in the literature was 0 8 mm day as observed in the u s by kabela et al 2009 although the author states that this value may be overestimated it is significant that the amounts of dew reported in various areas worldwide vary widely the effect of dew on the overall water balance is very important in arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2015 the total amount of nrw in humid areas is larger than that in arid and semi arid area accounting for about 5 of annual precipitation jacobs et al 2006 meissner et al 2007 groh et al 2018a xiao et al 2009 still the ecological and hydrological role of nrw should not be ignored in humid areas compared to dew there has been less research previously into wva but some primary knowledge does exist for example wva is the direct absorption of water vapor from the air by soil agam and berliner 2006 due to the limitations of current observation and measurement techniques the magnitude of this absorption can only be estimated indirectly kosmas et al 1998 showed that wva is one reason for the diurnal variation of soil moisture during an eight month observation period the total amount of wva was observed to be 226 mm whereas the rainfall in the same period was only 179 mm by analyzing data collected from an inshore desert agam and berliner 2004 concluded that the surface of bare soil supports very little dew and that wva is the actual reason for the diurnal variation of soil moisture verhoef et al 2006 studied wva in the south of spain and found that the amount of wva accumulated in one day could reach 0 7 mm those previous studies indicate that wva is important in arid and semi arid areas influence factors of nrw are the premise to calculating nrw s amount and also help to understand the formation mechanism of nrw some results show that not only air temperature humidity wind speed and cloud cover are important for nrw occurrence muselli et al 2002 wang and zhang 2011 xiao et al 2013 but also daily amplitude of relative humidity rh soil structure soil water content and soil temperature kosmas et al 2001 verhoef et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 some studies involved the ecological relevance of nrw for crop growth so far which mostly appeared in dew research in general dew has two different effects on crops on the one hand it can help recover the crops state due to water loss went 1955 nikolayev et al 1996 agam and berliner 2006 by increasing the water use efficiency ben asher et al 2010 on the other hand dew also provides a moist environment for pathogens that may lead to the spread of crop diseases zuberer and kenerley 1993 wilson et al 1999 there are almost no results about the influence of wva on crop growth in the aforementioned more results have pointed out that dew has advantages and disadvantages for the growth of summer crops while the role of dew in winter and spring has not been studied due to the difficulty in observing nrw components a comprehensive understanding relationship between these components is not sufficient nrw s contribution to land water balance and the role of nrw for crop water supply is not clear so far especially in the smtz with particular rainfall and crop water requirements to date insufficient research attention has been paid to nrw and little research has been done on the integral characteristics of nrw in the present paper we address the following three main questions 1 what are the overall performance and matching characteristics of nrw components and how do the characteristics of nrw vary with impact factors in the smtz of china 2 what is the relationship between nrw components and climatic and environmental factors 3 how does nrw affect lsw balance and crop water supply in the smtz in order to answer these questions on the basis of effective nrw components obtained by a combination of lysimeter measurements and micro meteorological observations the present study begins by analyzing how climatic and environmental factors contribute to nrw formation the discussion then progresses to how nrw contributes to the balance of water and surface energy in the smtz finally the effect of nrw on crop water supply in the smtz is explored the results provide a better understanding of the characteristics of nrw in the smtz and serve as a reference for water resource management and agricultural planning services and also for considering parameterization nrw in numerical modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation site the data used in this study was collected from dingxi observational station 35 33 22 n 104 35 37 e dingxi is located in the smtz of china fig 1 a which is in a typical loess foothill environment in a semi arid region fig 1b the average annual precipitation there is 380 mm making it prone to drought given the critical state of crop and ecological water requirements rainfall is concentrated in the period of may to october providing almost 90 of the annual amount the temperature difference between day and night is relatively large with an annual average temperature of 6 7 c and an annual potential evaporation of 1536 mm the region is dominated by northwesterly wind in winter and spring but experiences mainly southeasterly wind in summer and autumn as is typical of a semi arid region the station is located approximately 5 km from the edge of an urban area with an elevation of 1860 m fig 1b 2 2 observation data the primary meteorological elements observed at dingxi fig 1c are wind temperature and humidity gradients 1 2 4 10 16 m with a sampling rate of every 10 min in the surface layer we used hmp45d sensors to measure the air temperature and humidity waa151 sensors to measure the wind speed and wav151 sensors to measure the wind direction all from vaisala corporation finland radiation fluxes including global radiation reflected radiation and upward and downward long wave radiation were measured by a set of radiometers pir psp eppley inc usa at a height of 1 5 m with a sampling rate of every 10 min soil temperature 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 80 cm model 107 l campbell scientific soil heat flux 5 cm model hfp01 hukse flux netherlands soil moisture 10 20 40 50 80 cm model cs616 campbell scientific with a sampling rate of every 20 min and rainfall te525mm campbell scientific with a sampling rate of every 10 min were also measured land surface actual evapotranspiration et and nrw were measured with a large lysimeter fig 1d to an accuracy of 0 03 mm and a sensitivity of 0 01 mm when the lysimeter data is less than the accuracy the data is considered low quality data the diameter of the lysimeter was 2 25 m and the effective evapotranspiration area was 4 0 m2 at a depth of 2 65 m data was recorded every hour evapotranspiration during twilight and night tolk et al 2006 groh et al 2019 which can be considered to be an opposite water flux to nrẃs at night naturally limit the occurrence of nrw using hourly values in our analyses to a certain extent might lead to an underestimation of nrw 2 3 data processing the observation period was from 1st june 2004 to 31st may 2005 hourly data was used to calculate the distribution of nrw whilst monthly mean data was used to calculate the rate of nrw hourly data was then converted to monthly data by simple arithmetic averaging namely the value of every hour data in a whole day divided by 24 in order to obtain a daily mean value the exception to this was the amount of rainfall and nrw which was calculated by a sum of every hour in a day then in order to obtain monthly data every daily mean value in a month divided by number of days 28 30 or 31 the occurrence frequency of nrw was the simple arithmetic averaging of wva and dew the lysimeter was calibrated on may 23rd 24th 2004 to ensure data quality the sampling frequency of lysimeter data was hourly lysimeter data pre and post processing was needed to reduce the impact of noise on the determination of water balance components from lysimeter observations hannes et al 2015 peters et al 2017 pütz et al 2016 gebler et al 2015 groh et al 2018b herbrich et al 2017 the data filtered hannes et al 2015 was adopted in this paper the proportion of efficiency data after filtering is about 71 firstly the data during rainfall snowfall and sandstorm periods were removed secondly outliers during unreliable periods were eliminated by visual detection then a threshold filter was implemented to remove the unrealistic data the threshold value in this paper was set to 0 08 mm h which based on the literature results kabela et al 2009 the data greater than 0 08 mm h was eliminated finally we extrapolated short term missing data by the linear trend interpolation method namely when a quantity was once an hour or twice in two hours the linear interpolation was adapted by using 2 adjacent points average according to the linear changing trend of quantity there is no imputation for long term missing data the same data have been applied zhang et al 2011a 2015 note that beijing time bt was used for all the data herein the specific method used to estimate the nrw from the lysimeter data is described in section 2 4 all observation data was quality controlled 2 4 determination of nrw component of land surface water in addition to precipitation nrw is also an important component of lsw previous studies have showed that the lsw balance should include the component of nrw fig 2 a an important reason for this is that the technology for observing nrw is not yet fully developed the most reliable way to observe and measure nrw is by means of a lysimeter van de griend and owe 1994 however this also needs to be combined with micro meteorological and conventional meteorological observation data in order to distinguish between different types of nrw observed with lysimeter weight changes herein we use the method described in fig 2b to calculate the nrw 2 5 several definitions the nrw component observed by a weighing lysimeter can be expressed as 1 w nrw 1000 i 0 i t δ w i ρ w s p where w nrw is the amount of dew or wva mm ρ w is the density of water kg m3 wi is weight value as nrw occurrence kg δ w i is the instantaneous nrw value observed by the lysimeter kg when there is no nrw we have δ w i 0 i is the series number of the instantaneous value at each 60 min interval sp is the lysimeter surface area m2 and t is the length of time for each data sampling s herein we assume t 3600 s i e 1 h based on the above statement it is easy to calculate the various statistics of the nrw component the average diurnal variation of the amount of nrw can be calculated as 2 w nrw j k 1 365 w a k j 365 where j is the hour number of each day ranked from 1 to 24 w nrw j is the dew amount or wva amount at hour j mm k is the sequence of days from 1 to 365 and w a k j is the dew amount and wva amount of hour j on day k the frequency of occurrence of the nrw s average diurnal variation can be calculated as 3 f nrw j n d j 365 100 where f nrw j is the frequency of occurrence of nrw at hour j as a percentage n d j is the number of days with the formation of nrw at hour j in the whole year i e fewer than 365 similarly the monthly amount of nrw in one year can be calculated as 4 w nrw s k 1 h s w a s k where w nrw s is the amount of nrw in month s mm k is the sequence of the hour number of month s h s is the number of hours in month s which differs each month but is never greater than 24 31 and w a s k is the amount of nrw in hour k of month s the frequency of occurrence of monthly nrw in one year can be calculated as 5 f nrw s m m s m 0 s 100 where f nrw s is the frequency of occurrence of nrw in month s as a percentage m m s is the day number for the occurrence of nrw in month s which is less than m 0 s and m 0 s is the number of days in month s which differs each month but never exceeds 31 finally the rate of nrw occurrence is calculated as 6 r nrw s a m s m 0 s where r nrw s is the rate of nrw occurrence mm d a m s is the daily average amount of nrw in a month m 0 s is the number of days in month s in addition when calculating the climatic factor gradient it is expressed as 4 m 1 m in our text if we calculated a variable gradient at 4 m minus that at 1 m for example the gradient of relative humidity between 4 m and 1 m was expressed 4 m 1 m relative humidity difference in this manuscript the same is applied to soil temperature and soil moisture then these factors are average divided into 3 5 groups in principle for example the soil moisture range is about from 0 15 m3 m3 to 0 5 m3 m3 but few values are near 0 15 m3 m3 or 0 42 m3 m3 groups were set arbitrarily to 3 for soil moisture 0 25 0 25 0 35 and 0 35 it is similar to other impact factors 3 results 3 1 diurnal and annual characteristics of nrw variation characteristics of dew and wva must differ because climatic and environmental factors produced different effect on dew and wva as shown in fig 10 the timings of the peak values of wva and dew clearly differ with the peak value of dew occurring at night and the peak value of wva occurring at 14 00 while the mean nrw diurnal variation fluctuated very little fig 3 a the maximum amount of dew occurred between 16 00 and 09 00 the following morning because dew can only occur when the surface temperature is below the dew point temperature the surface temperature cannot be below the dew point temperature during the day and consequently dew cannot occur from 09 00 to 16 00 the soil becomes relatively dry because of comparatively strong evaporation in the morning and the attraction between soil particles and water molecules is strongest at that time consequently this leads to wva being easier to occur and a high level of adsorption in the afternoon this indicates that diurnal variation of dew and wva exists in a good complementarity which maintains a steady daily amount of nrw the diurnal variations of occurrence frequency of dew wva and their sum are consistent with the diurnal variations of their amounts fig 3b though the wva occurrence frequency is greater than that of dew the maximum amount of dew 7mm occurred in october of non monsoon season and the minimum occurred in june of monsoon season when no dew formed fig 4 a this pattern occurred because in autumn following the temperature decrease the large diurnal temperature difference and sufficient water vapor conditions created the most beneficial conditions for dew condensation in june it was unlikely that the surface temperature would decrease to below the dew point temperature which together with the lack of water vapor in the semi arid environment at this time prevented the formation of dew the peak wva 4 8 mm occurred in november while the minimum occurred in june for most of the year except from june to september the region with the highest wva had the lowest formation of dew and vice versa this reflects their different formation mechanisms and also indicates their mutually complementary relationship the total amount of nrw was 52 mm during the whole year which represented the effective water supply to the semi arid climate region of the smtz especially in the dry non monsoon period the monthly wva occurrence frequency was very high fig 4b the maximum value was 25 days for november whereas the monthly frequency of occurrence of dew was relatively low the annual number of days on which absorption occurred was 152 whereas it was 135 days for the occurrence of dew thus wva was more likely to occur than was dew although their phases are asymmetric some complementarity exists 3 2 relationship between nrw and climatic and environmental factors the mean rate of wva shows an obvious decrease when the soil moisture increases correlation coefficient r 0 74 fig 5 a which is consistent with that frequency there is no clear trend from mean rates of dew when the soil moisture increases fig 5b also shows this the wva occurrence frequency was greater when the soil was drier less than 0 25 m3 m3 with the maximum value being close to 12 the dew occurrence frequency was highest when the soil moisture ranged from 0 25 to 0 35 m3 m3 with the maximum being just 5 6 there were small differences between the different soil moisture intervals with regard to the thermodynamic state mean rate variation of dew with surface temperature does not show obvious an trend whereas that of wva with surface temperature decreases and their correlation coefficient is 0 82 fig 6 a it indicated that the rate does not reflect the relationship between nrw and surface temperature from fig 6b it can be seen that wva occurrence frequency did not change significantly with surface temperature but there was an obvious change in the dew occurrence frequency the dew occurrence frequency was highest at 10 when the surface temperature ranged from 0 c to 10 c but this decreased when the surface temperature exceeded 10 c it is a remarkable fact that frequency of frost occurrence is also about 5 which exceeds the frequency of dew in summer the available energy difference between net radiation r n and soil heat flux g on the land as the main source of energy for water molecules on the soil surface determines the energy state of wva or evaporation condensation processes to some extent and is the most important condition influencing wva or evaporation condensation processes the rate of dew is evidently different from that of wva the former occurs mainly below 0 w m2 and the latter is mainly above 0 w m2 it shows that energy required for dew and wva to occur are completely different fig 7 a this just reflects the complementary characteristics of dew and wva it seems completely different from fig 7b in fact their trend is consistent if fig 7b is divided into two intervals less than 0 w m2 and greater than 0 w m2 phase change in the condensation process releases heat and the adsorption process converts the internal energy of molecules into heat energy and then releases it thus when the available energy was negative the amount of dew reached the maximum of 24 8 mm when the range of available energy was 0 150 w m2 evaporation was likely to occur and the amount of wva evidently decreased by contrast the decrease in the amount of dew was more rapid in this range when the energy was 0 150 w m2 evaporation was likely to occur and the amount of wva evidently decreased on the other hand the quantity of dew decreased rapidly in this range with the quantity of dew being less than 1 mm which was almost negligible this range of 0 150 w m2 in fact represents the alternating stage of wva occurrence and evaporation processes in which the strength or weakness of the attraction between soil particles and water molecules compared to the counterattraction provided by the available energy to water molecules was the key factor in the occurrence of evaporation or wva or condensation wva predominantly occurs when the soil moisture gradient is small the rate of wva drops sharply when the soil moisture gradient increases both fig 8 a and 8b show an increase after decreasing while dew occurs with the increase of soil moisture gradient wva occurred mainly where the soil moisture difference was less than 0 05 m3 m3 and occurrence frequency exceeded 8 which was mainly due to the low soil moisture of the surface soil over the range of soil moisture investigated the dew occurrence frequency was low in the middle part of the range when the difference in soil moisture was 0 025 0 05 m3 m3 the dew occurrence frequency was minimal however it increased gradually with soil moisture with the maximum occurrence frequency almost 8 in the range 0 075 0 1 m3 m3 the influences of environmental factors on each nrw component differ overall showing complementary characteristics that is to say the high value area of dew matches the low value area of wva and vice versa there are different soil temperature gradients as wva and dew occur and the boundary gradient is at about 2 c fig 8c the occurrence frequency also indicates the characteristic fig 8d that of wva was highest when the gradient of 10 cm 0 cm soil temperature ranged from 15 c to 10 c reaching 17 4 however the frequency was very low when the gradient was colder than 15 c or warmer than 0 c in short the rate of dew and wva is controlled by different soil hydrothermal conditions atmospheric wind the temperature humidity of the surface layer and their vertical gradients determine the water vapor source and transmission of nrw of these parameters the relative humidity has a very significant influence on nrw the rate of wva decreases but dew increases with the increase of rh fig 9 a wva occurs mainly when the relative humidity is 6 50 with occurrence frequency of over 10 fig 9b wva decreases significantly at higher rh with an occurrence frequency of less than 4 it is consistent with fig 7a this indicates that it would be difficult to meet the necessary water vapor conditions for the occurrence of adsorption if the atmosphere was too dry if on the other hand the atmosphere was too wet fog and dew would form easily which would restrain the adsorption of water vapor dew occurs mainly when the relative humidity exceeds 50 but the dew occurrence frequency is lower than that of wva it also shows the complementary characteristics which is similar to that in fig 8 nrw is also related to the daily amplitude of relative humidity in the surface layer fig 9c the adsorption rate of water vapor and the condensation rate both raise with an increased daily amplitude of relative humidity and therefore daily amplitude of relative humidity has an effect on the generation of wva and dew for wva an increased daily amplitude of relative humidity means that the minimum daily relative humidity decreases for dew increased daily amplitude of relative humidity means that the maximum daily relative humidity increases thereby facilitating the condensation process the variation of the rh gradient of the surface layer had a complex influence on nrw it is shown that wva increases with the increase of rh gradient in fig 10 a and 10b when rh at the heights of 1 m was greater than that of 4 m both the rate and occurrence frequency of wva were very low the converse was high at approximately 12 of the frequency this indicated that a weak humidity inversion in the surface layer favored the process of soil wva for condensation the frequency of dew in fig 10b shows the trend of first increasing and then decreasing it seems that this trend also exists in fig 10a but the dispersion is too large to draw the trend line effectively when the rh gradient was negative the dew occurrence frequency was higher than that under a positive humidity gradient a weak humidity inversion results in dew occurrence frequency being decreased this is also consistent with the temperature gradient relationship fig 10c shows a good complementary relationship between dew and wva wherein wva mainly occurs in the interval where the temperature gradient is less than 0 and dew mainly occurs in an interval of that 0 when the temperature gradient in the surface layer ranged from 1 c to 0 c the occurrence frequency of wva reached a maximum of 12 fig 10d this indicates that the temperature gradient of the surface layer facilitates adsorption simultaneously however adsorption still occurs and condensation increases when there is a weak temperature inversion in the surface layer of the atmosphere it indicates that a weak temperature inversion is more important for dew than that for wva when the temperature gradient ranged from 0 c to 2 c the dew occurrence frequency was high 6 and that of wva became weaker thereby enabling dew and wva to occur simultaneously it is more common for the two processes to supplement each other wind speed is another important factor that was found to influence nrw the influence of wind speed on dew and wva also shows complementary characteristics fig 11 an adequate wind speed facilitates the transmission of water vapor in the surface layer towards the surface and increasing the wind speed also increases the downward heat flux keeping the surface warmer it is beneficial to forming dew however but an excessive wind speed will increase evapotranspiration and water vapor loss from the surface layer resulting in decreased dew and then low soil moisture increased wva it is shown that negative feedback exists between wind speed and dew occurrence but positive feedback exists between wind speed and wva occurrence 3 3 contribution of nrw to water balance and role of nrw in non monsoon period as can be seen from the contribution of nrw to lsw balance fig 12 a rainfall remains the leading component of the annual lsw balance in smtz accounting for 85 of the evapotranspiration et which is calculated by lysimeter data the amounts of dew and wva are of the same order accounting for approximately 10 of evaporation with fog making the lowest contribution to the water balance of just 1 3 mm which is completely negligible additionally there is still a 4 6 difference which is called others fig 12b the possible main factors covered by the category others are i the lsw deficit caused by climate warming and drying thereby leading to water imbalance ii instrumental error however it should be noted this category accounts for only 4 of evaporation which meets the needs of the overall water balance nrw accounts for approximately 10 of the overall contribution to evapotranspiration this also shows that the role of nrw in the water balance cannot be ignored in the smtz of china although nrw is not dominant in lsw it plays a special role in the smtz of china its ratio relative to rainfall was high in the non monsoon period october march exceeding 2 and rising to 3 7 in november fig 13 whereas the ratio was much lower in the monsoon period may september the ratio of wva to rainfall was also high in the non monsoon period exceeding 2 and the ratio for dew was also high in that period moreover spring wheat and winter wheat are the main grain crops in the smtz of china precipitation is very low mostly close to zero during the sowing and emergence of winter wheat in the non monsoon period which is not conducive to the emergence of winter wheat under dry soil at this time nrw alone provides the moisture required by crops thereby reducing crop mortality at least even if during the greening period which is the water requirement stage nrw supplies water and is beneficial to the growth of winter wheat as the amount of nrw exceeds that of precipitation in other words nrw supplied the predominant water source in the highest growth period of winter wheat and partial growth stage of the spring wheat in non monsoon period therefore nrw plays an important and even decisive role in maintaining the survival of spring wheat and winter wheat in the non monsoon period over the smtz of china the contribution of nrw to lsw can also be reflected from evapotranspiration fig 14 large ratios of nrw to evapotranspiration also occurred in the non monsoon period with all ratios being greater than 0 1 and rising to 0 51 in december consequently large amount of nrw and weak evapotranspiration in the non monsoon season resulted in the contribution of nrw to the lsw balance being more significant 4 discussion 4 1 formation conditions of nrw component generally speaking nrw is influenced mainly by local climate factors and environmental factors such as air temperature relative humidity wind speed soil temperature and soil moisture et al kosmas et al 2001 xiao et al 2013 the present study makes it clear that different nrw components have different relationships with climatic and environmental factors in particular micro meteorological elements such as wind speed relative humidity and moisture gradient have almost opposite effects on dew and wva which is reflected by their different formation mechanisms adsorption occurs readily which is consistent with the results agam and berliner 2006 florentin and agam 2017 the occurrence of dew clearly depends on both humidity and temperature several authors has shown these factors effect on dew garratt and segal 1988 xiao et al 2013 liu et al 2018 the vertical gradients of soil moisture and temperature effect the transmission of water and energy as well as the dynamic characteristics of soil moisture and temperature gao et al 2007 when the surface soil was warmer than the subsoil the transmission of water from the subsoil to the surface soil was restrained thereby facilitating the occurrence of wva an increase in the vertical gradient of soil temperature decreased wva but increased dew formation we attribute this to the increased vertical gradient of soil temperature as the surface cooled agam and berliner 2006 in particular a moisture inversion in the surface layer promoted the occurrence of wva whereas the occurrence of dew was favored under the opposite conditions dew occurred frequently when the relative humidity gradient was negative but far less so when the relative humidity gradient was positive wva and dew condensation are two completely different kinds of physical mechanisms the former is determined by the characteristics of the soil particles and atmospheric humidity whereas the latter is influenced mainly by microclimate in addition to the provision of water vapor dew formation is controlled by the thermal state of the surface wva occurrence was in favor of a temperature gradient from 1 c to 0 c in surface layer both the rate and occurrence frequency of nrw indicate that there is a good complementary relationship between wva and dew evapotranspiration and wva are also two inverse processes on the diurnal time scale wva occurs more favorably when the soil is dry though the evapotranspiration process is dominant at this time wva can compete with evapotranspiration during the daytime wva is more likely to occur under the following conditions when the relative humidity of the surface layer is 6 50 the wind speed is 3 4 m s the diurnal variation of relative humidity is large humidity inversion and weak instability occur the soil water content is low and the surface temperature is not very high we attribute a more humid environment being more favorable to the generation of dew wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 because a weak humidity inversion in the atmosphere causes a water vapor divergence in the bottom layer garratt and segal 1988 de vries 1958 reported that wva is dominant only when the relative humidity of the air around soil particles is less than 60 when the relative humidity exceeds 60 condensation is dominant zhuang and ratcliff 2012 reported that a relative humidity of the surface layer of more than 80 facilitates the generation of dew kosmas et al 2001 also reported similar results on the other hand dew is more likely to occur when the relative humidity of the surface layer exceeds 50 wind speed is 1 2 m s diurnal variation of relative humidity is large and a weak inversion of the air temperature the occurrence condition of dew is a little more different than that in humid areas liu et al 2018 dew and wva display obvious annual to seasonal variations wva occurs mainly by day with an annual peak in december whereas dew occurs mainly in the evening with an annual peak in october the minimum values of both parameters occur in june it should be noted that the rate of nrw is nearly consistent with their occurrence frequency small differences between them may be caused by their own incomplete meanings 4 2 nrw s contribution to lsw balance and crop water requirements in terms of the lsw balance the nrw in the present study is no more than 15 of the lsw but is an important supplement to the smtz where precipitation is critical for crop and ecological water requirements the ratio of nrw to precipitation is close to the results of a mediterranean semiarid steppe ecosystem uclés et al 2014 larger than that of haarweg station in a humid region jacobs et al 2006 but smaller than that in rice fields in a subtropical monsoon climate liu et al 2018 the amount of nrw can reach 3 5 times that of the precipitation during the dry non monsoon season which coincides with the sowing date and the emergence of winter wheat a previous study uclés et al 2016 also showed that the contribution of nrw to the water balance during a dry period was 94 in fact nrw during the non monsoon period is very important until the standing and jointing period of winter wheat and the emergence of spring wheat because rainfall is rare during non monsoon periods nrw has a more prominent influence at that time some studies have shown nrw has an important impact on the recovery of crops after water loss went 1955 agam and berliner 2006 the growth of lichens zhang et al 2009 kaseke et al 2012 and the increased total biomass of plants zhuang and ratcliff 2012 but there are few results in studying the effects of nrw on the growth period of crops this may be a field worth studying in the future so nrw should be considered as a water resource in drought prone smtz areas an excellent complementarity exists between nrw and rainfall thereby helping to alleviate seasonal droughts contribution of wva to water balance is almost equal to that of dew in the smtz in the dry season the amount of dew and wva significantly exceeds the contribution of precipitation to the water budget nrw is of great significance to water resource management agriculture and ecological planning a standard rain gauge was used to quantify the annual rainfall amount in this study we knew this kind of rain gauge underestimates the amount of rainfall in comparison to rainfall obtained from lysimeter observations gebler et al 2015 hoffmann et al 2016 herbrich et al 2017 groh et al 2018b that affects nrw on contribution to precipitation at the annual scale until now the contribution of nrw on precipitation might be overestimated because rain gauges underestimate precipitation and thus also increase the ratio of nrw on precipitation increasing the measurement frequency of lysimeter e g recording lysimeter mass changes each minute is a potentially successful method perhaps precipitation may be estimated based on lysimeter mass changes or a weighing rain gauge colli et al 2014 with more observation points thus reducing the underestimation of precipitation additionally climate warming and drying also influences lsw balance as it will change soil water when soil water increases during a period of time the ratio of nrw to et will increase and then will overestimate the ratio of nrw to et on the contrary it underestimates however the impact on lsw balance is limited cf others in fig 12 finally to appreciate the specificity of nrw in the smtz we require more extensive observations to improve our understanding of nrw characteristics and formation mechanisms in non smtz regions 5 conclusion in this work components of nrw were analyzed scientifically through a combination of lysimeter measurements and micro meteorological data the impacts of environmental and meteorological conditions on nrw were analyzed and the contributions of nrw to water balance were also investigated nrw plays an important role in alleviating drought during the critical period of crop growth in the semi arid region of the smtz the climatic and environmental conditions of dew and wva occurrence vary considerably in terms of diurnal variation wva can occur at almost any time of the day whereas dew occurs normally overnight and not during the day and the period with the highest wva has the lowest formation of dew and vice versa thus there is good complementarity between dew and wva on the diurnal scale in terms of annual variation the nrw amount during the non monsoon period is evidently higher than that during the monsoon period the annual total amount of nrw is a considerable water input to a region with a semi arid climate among the total amount of nrw dew and wva are very close which are 25 9 mm and 26 1 mm respectively that contribution to annual precipitation is 5 9 and 6 respectively wva is more likely to occur than dew thus complementarity exists additionally on the annual scale furthermore nrw dominates lsw during the non monsoon period which is vital for crop growth during that period that nrw is an important

6162,this study proposes a bayesian model for the nonstationary generalized extreme value gev distributions with abrupt changes of location parameters and smooth change of scale parameters our motivation is that the quantiles of hydrological process depend on scale parameter as well as location parameter in the gev distribution the proposed model extends the nonstationary bayesian model with jumping location parameters on the time domain and it provides a wider class of models to explain abrupt location changes and smooth dispersion changes simultaneously as well as separately in the hydrological processes this study also suggests the use of the bayesian model selection procedure by logarithm of the pseudo marginal likelihood lpml numerical study reveals that the proposed method can provide viable estimates of return levels through model selection we apply the proposed method to analyze annual maximum precipitation acquired from the korea meteorological administration keywords abrupt change bayesian model selection gev distribution scale varying 1 introduction in the field of hydrology recent studies on nonstationary models have primarily focused on the development of models reflecting various types of nonstationarities generally the nonstationarity is modeled by the parametrization of the conditional distribution for given predictors in the view of the parametrization the existing nonstationary models are roughly categorized into two types the model with a trend and the model with an abrupt change the nonstationary models proposed by smith 1989 wang et al 2010 clarke 2002a b nogaj et al 2007 fall into the first category where the location and the scale of the distribution are represented as a smooth function of predictors or time the nonstationary model with an abrupt change are studied by perreault et al 2000a b c rasmussen 2001 chu and zhao 2004 zhao and chu 2006 in particular chu et al 2012 fischer et al 2012 beaulieu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 investigate the empirical evidences of the abrupt changes in precipitation and temperature these studies consider as potential causes of the changes the artificial or natural discontinuities regime shifts in climate and human intervention since the detection of abrupt changes is necessary for planning and adaptation against the natural disasters developing the nonstationary models with an abrupt change is crucial in extreme data analysis jeon et al 2016 and jo et al 2016 propose the nonstationary model with an abrupt change for the generalized extreme value gev distribution and examine the efficacy of the models by numerical studies but in real data analysis of these studies it is observed that the nonstationarity associated with the abrupt change is misleading when the dispersion of distributions tends to be larger thus we consider a toy example to quantify the misleading results by the nonstationary model the toy example demonstrates how different estimated results are obtained by the model misspecification data are generated by the gev distribution with abruptly changing location parameters and smoothly varying scale parameters on the time domain t 1 50 denote the generated observation at time t by y t and write the gev distribution with location parameter μ and scale parameter σ and shape parameter ξ by gev μ σ ξ in our case the location and scale parameters depend on time so that we write them as μ t and σ t to empathize their time dependence the generative model in the example is given by y t gev μ t σ t ξ where μ t 100 i t 25 200 i t 25 σ t exp 3 0 02 t for t t and ξ 0 2 here i t a is the indicator function to denote whether t a or not suppose that we know that the change occurs at time t 26 when the nonstationary model with only location abrupt changes jeon et al 2016 is used for estimating 200 year return level a monte carlo simulation reveals that the estimate return level at t 50 is approximately 572 on average which is 44 lower than the true return level at t 50 the difference is the bias of return levels induced by model mis specification ignoring smooth changes in scale parameters of the generative model even though the fitted model may reflect abrupt changes in the location parameter it cannot explain increasing of variability by nonstationary scale parameter σ t therefore it is essential to develop the model covering various nonstationary patterns the purpose of this paper is twofold the first one is extending the nonstationary bayesian model jo et al 2016 to incorporate the abrupt changes in the location parameters and the smooth drift in the scale parameters the proposed model captures not only multiple changes of location parameters but also smooth changes in scale parameters on time domain in general the nonstationarity of scale parameters can be understood as those of variances or inter quartile ranges iqr in the cross sectional distribution of considered hydrological processes the second one is to provide a model selection method in the proposed nonstationary models to the best of our knowledge the model selection method is first introduced in the field of hydrology when the nonstationary model interfaces with change points by spike and slab priors the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 presents motivation of considering scale varying model with abrupt changes of location in the gev distribution section 3 explains the proposed bayesian model including likelihood priors and posteriors section 4 suggests model selection procedure and section 5 exhibits the numerical result of simulations the real data of south korea are analyzed by the proposed method in section 6 and the concluding remarks follow in section 7 2 motivation the motivational real example of this study is the annual maximum of precipitations amps acquired from the korean meteorological administration kma in the south korean peninsula the nonstationarity of the amps is studied by jeon et al 2016 and jo et al 2016 which focus on abrupt changes in the location parameters of the gev distribution these studies consistently show statistical evidences of abrupt changes in the location parameters we extend the bayesian model jeon et al 2016 to explain changes in scale parameters that could lead to nonstationarity in variability as well as average of the amps nonstationarity in scale parameter of the gev distribution affects changes of location and dispersion in hydrological processes simultaneously here we consider α quantile and interquartile range iqr as measures of location and dispersion of a distribution suppose that y t is a random sample of amps at time t that follows gev μ t σ t ξ the α quantile of y t is given by q α μ t σ t ξ 1 log α ξ 1 for ξ 0 and q α μ t σ t log log α for ξ 0 the iqr at time t which explains the variability is given by σ t ξ 1 log 0 75 ξ log 0 25 ξ for ξ 0 σ t log log 0 75 log log 0 25 for ξ 0 note that the nonstationarity in the iqr depends only on σ t also it is easily shown that the variance of y t depends on σ t and ξ such that its nonstationarity depends on σ t a simple data analysis for the amps in south korean peninsula shows the possibility of nonstationarity in dispersions to estimate iqrs of the amps on time domain we apply quantile regression koenker 2005 to estimate the first quartile and the third quartile fig 1 shows the estimated first and third quartiles of amps and the estimated iqrs even though it is unknown that the variations are statistically significant the estimated iqr seems to decrease it is clear that the nonstationary model only on the location parameters is not able to capture such a varying dispersion ignorance of nonstationarity in dispersion could lead a bias in estimating scale parameters in the gev distribution it is worthy noting that the bias of scale parameters more sensitively affects the estimation of high quantiles of the gev distribution than that of location parameters denote the differential of α quantile with respect to μ t and σ t by q α t μ t and q α t σ t respectively then q α t μ t is always 1 regardless of α while q α t σ t is given by ξ 1 log α ξ 1 which depends on α since lim α 1 ξ 1 log α ξ 1 for ξ 0 the scale parameter is much more sensitive to the high quantiles to reflect the characteristic in time varying dispersion we introduce the varying scale parameter in the nonstationary model with abruptly jumping location we let the scale parameters σ t as a regression model e log σ t β 0 β 1 t where β 0 and β 1 are random regression parameters the model for scale parameters was used by cannon 2010 coles 2001 el adlouni 2007 hundecha et al 2008 in the non bayesian model in the view of stochastic modeling the changes in extreme distribution can be explained by the nonstationarity of the underlying distribution that consists of the max stable processes see the section 3 2 embrechts et al 2013 also in the sense of approximation we can reflect the changes of the underlying distribution in the corresponding extreme distribution for example if we use the gev distribution as an approximated distribution for the annual maxima of daily precipitations the abrupt changes in the location parameter of the gev distribution can be explained by the change in the distribution of daily precipitations in the next section we extend the bayesian model for the nonstationary gev distribution by incorporating abrupt jump process in location parameters and smooth varying process in scale parameters 3 priors and posteriors for nonstationary location and scale in this section we construct the bayesian model for the nonstationary hydrological processes fig 2 shows the general overview of the proposed bayesian models the left panel of fig 2 displays the generative model of observations for given gev parameters the circuit arrow of the μ t denotes the dependence with a delay of a single time step note that μ t and σ t are time dependent but ξ is not the right panel of fig 2 illustrates the hierarchical structure of the prior distribution for the gev parameters the red circles at the top denote the process of scale parameters associated with the regression model the regression parameters β 0 and β 1 depend on the hierarchical hyperprior distribution of τ 2 2 τ 3 2 and α the yellow circles in the middle denote the process of location parameters whose prior distribution are defined by spike and slab priors jo et al 2016 the details of priors likelihood and posteriors are explained in the next subsections 3 1 priors for abrupt changes in location consider a location parameter μ t for t t 1 2 3 under the stationary model all of location parameters are equal that is μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 if we consider the change of location parameters at least one of μ t s for t t is not equal to the others thus there are five partitions associated with the change of the location parameters p 1 1 2 3 p 2 1 2 3 p 3 1 2 3 p 4 1 3 2 and p 5 1 2 3 the number of partitions is known as the bell numbers which is recursively defined by b n 1 k 0 n n k b k b 0 1 here b n denotes the number of partitions of a set that has n elements the bell number is rapidly increases as n a naive priors for the partitions is defined as the high dimensional model to avoid the curse of dimensionality the developed priors for the partition has a restricted support on the partition for example product partition priors barry and hartigan 1993 assign positive probability only to consecutive partitions in our example the prior distribution of p 4 is zero since μ 1 and μ 3 in the same partition are not adjacent even though the prior probabilities for partitions were defined on the 4 dimensional standard simplex the product priors is defined on the 3 dimensional standard simplex which simplifies the prior distribution on the low dimensional space spike and slab priors model an event of partition by the occurrence of change this prior is defined by conditional distribution as for t 2 n 1 μ t μ t 1 1 p t δ μ t 1 p t π l μ t 1 0 p t 1 where δ is the dirac delta function having a point mass only at μ t 1 and π l μ t 1 is a continuous probability density function with mean μ t 1 here p t is a bernoulli random variable denoting whether a change at time t occurs or not conditionally on the occurrence of change at the time t μ t is a continuous random variable with mean μ t 1 thus pr μ t μ s p t 1 0 for s t which implies that the spike and slab prior induces a probability for partitions which assign a positive probability only on consecutive blocks table 1 shows that the probability of partitions induced by spike and slab priors when p t w for all t even though the partition priors can address a wide class of probabilities for partitions the computation cost is very high except for a special case such as gaussian model to avoid the computational problem we adopt spike and slab priors in the location parameters of the gev distribution as follows p t w iid ber ω ω beta a w b w a w 0 b w 0 π l μ t 1 π l x μ t 1 λ exp x μ t 1 λ 2 λ λ 0 μ 1 τ 1 2 n μ 0 τ 1 2 τ 1 2 gamma α α α unif 0 l l 0 note that π l is a probability density function of the laplace double exponential distribution having heavier tails than those of normal distribution we set the hyper parameters as a w b w 0 5 λ 100 l 50 and μ 0 μ where μ the maximum likelihood estimator of the stationary model jo et al 2016 3 2 priors for scale varying and others in the modeling of scale we consider the smoothing change in scale because the value of scale is positive we use priors through the log link as follows log σ t β 0 β 1 τ 2 n β 0 β 1 t τ 2 τ 2 gamma γ σ γ σ β 0 τ 2 2 n 0 τ 2 2 β 1 τ 3 2 n 0 τ 3 2 τ 2 2 τ 3 2 iid gamma α α α unif 0 l l 0 given α the marginal priors of μ 1 β 0 β 1 follow t distributions and this model and priors can explain the increasing or decreasing scale parameter at last we uses n 0 τ ξ 2 as a prior distribution of the shape parameter of the gev distribution ξ we set hyper parameters as γ σ 0 01 l 50 and τ ξ 2 1000 3 3 likelihood and posteriors in the proposed model the likelihood function is given by l y μ σ ξ t 1 n 1 σ t 1 ξ y t μ t σ t 1 ξ 1 exp 1 ξ y t μ t σ t 1 ξ i y t μ t σ t ξ ξ 0 i y t μ t σ t ξ ξ 0 1 σ t exp y t μ t σ t exp exp y t μ t σ t i ξ 0 where μ μ 1 μ n t and σ σ 1 σ n t as a result the proposed model and the priors are rewritten as follows 2a y t y μ σ ξ gev μ t σ t ξ t 1 n 2b μ t μ t 1 p t 1 p t δ μ t 1 p t π l μ t 1 λ t 2 n 2c μ 1 n μ 0 τ 1 2

the parameters thus the prior is valid only on the set satisfying the following constraints y i μ i σ i ξ i ξ 0 ξ 0 μ i σ i ξ i ξ 0 when the support of the priors depends on the observations it is difficult to select an efficient proposal distribution for the mcmc markov chain monte carlo truncated normal distribution may be a candidate of the proposal distribution but computational efficiency is not exploited in this paper we implemented the mcmc by an open software openbugs that uses the multivariate normal distribution as the proposal distribution the details of the joint distribution and posteriors are given in the appendix the posteriors sampling is not straightforward because the posteriors are not of an explicit form except for that of ω each step therefore requires a rejection sampling see for example ripley 1987 adaptive rejection metropolis sampling gilks et al 1995 or the metropolis hastings method hastings 1970 metropolis et al 1953 we used openbugs for the mcmc and uploaded the r code in github https github com s88012 gev bayesian remark 1 letting μ μ 1 μ n or σ σ 1 σ n and a prior σ gamma γ 0 γ 0 allows us to construct reduced models where the location and scale are stationary we set γ 0 0 01 in the model with the stationary location and scale parameter in bayesian tests the simplest model can show better performance when using strongly shruk priors thus we used the prior σ gamma d d 10 d unif 0 1 for the model having constant location and scale remark 2 the employed priors in this study are carefully selected for the convergence of the mcmc the priors of scale parameters and spike and slab priors gives the shrinkage effects to the estimated model such that we can avoid the overfitting problem 4 bayesian model selection and considered models model selection is required to avoid under fitting or over fitting problem in bayesian data analysis we briefly review the bayesian model selection using bayes factor and introduce the new method applied to the considered models bayes factor kass and raftery 1995 is widely studied by kim et al 2017 and shively and walker 2018 as a useful tool of the bayesian model selection let y be the vector of observations and denote the likelihood function by f y θ k m k i 1 n f i y i θ k m k where θ k is the parameter of model m k for k 1 k bayes factor b k 1 k 2 for the model m k 1 and m k 2 with k 1 k 2 1 k 2 is defined by the ratio of marginal likelihood of the two models b k 1 k 2 f y θ k 1 m k 1 π k 1 d θ k 1 m k 1 f y θ k 2 m k 2 π k 2 d θ k 2 m k 2 here π k i and θ k i are priors and parameter in m k i i 1 2 respectively if b k 1 k 2 is sufficiently large then we select the model of m k 1 note that pr m k 1 y f y m k 1 pr m k 1 which implies that bayes factor indicates the ratio of the evidences of the two models based on the observed data even though bayes factor is attractive in the theoretical aspect applying the bayes factor to model selection usually has a practical issue related to computations as an alternative we use the following logarithm of pseudo marginal likelihood lpml geisser and eddy 1979 lplm m k i 1 n log f i y i y i m k where y i y 1 y i 1 y i 1 y n t lpml employs an predictive density function f i y i y i m k instead of marginal density function f i y i m k which generally requires high computational cost the lpml is approximated by posterior samples from mcmc as i 1 n log cpo i m k cpo i m k 1 s j 1 s 1 f i y i θ kj m k 1 where θ kj j 1 s is a posterior sample of size s with model m k here cpo i m k is the approximated value of f i y i y i m k such that it is called of the ith conditional predictive ordinate of m k this approximation is shown by 1 s j 1 s 1 f i y i θ kj m k f i y i θ k m k 1 π d θ k y m k f y θ k m k f y m k f i y i θ k m k 1 π d θ k m k f y i m k f y m k 1 f i y i y i m k when there are several fitted bayesian models the final model with the largest lpml is selected lpml can be interpreted as the surrogate for the log p y i m k of which values indicates the adequacy of the model for the data thus we select the model with the largest lpml among the fitted models 5 simulation studies 5 1 setups simulated data y t t 1 120 are generated from gev μ t σ t ξ t 1 120 four types of the nonstationary models are used to generate simulated data and the four estimated models for each simulated data are obtained by the proposed methods listed in table 2 the nonstarionary models for μ t and σ t are given in table 3 and ξ is fixed as 0 2 across the all considered models we conduct 50 replications in all cases and run the gibbs sampler for 300 000 iterations with two chains at different initial values for each chain we keep a posterior sample for every 30th iteration after a burn in period of 75 000 samples and obtained 5000 samples from the two chains the auto correlation plots histograms and trace plots for μ 80 σ 80 and ξ of m 11 are displayed in fig 5 in appendix which show an efficient mixing in posterior samples of mcmc for all fitted models lpmls and estimates of return levels were obtained based on the bayes estimates of μ 120 σ 120 and ξ to compare the estimated return levels with the true return levels we define r rmse relative root mean squared error as j 1 n l j α l α 2 n l α where l j α and l α are the estimate of α year return level in the jth replication and the true α year return level respectively 5 2 results the results of model selections based on lpmls are summarized in table 4 the row and column of table 4 denote the case of simulation setting to generate data and the type of fitted model recall that the types of fitted models provided in table 2 and the models of the simulated data are given in table 3 each value in table 4 indicates the selection probability of the finally fitted model by bayesian model selection and the diagonal element denotes the probability of the correct model selection the probability are attained from the result of 50 iterative simulations table 4 shows that lpml can provide a good model selection procedure under the simulated data it also indicates that lpml works well for cases with varying scales when there is a jump in location even though the proportion of correct selection is relatively low in case 1 compared to other cases the finally selected model is close to the stationary model and it is a commonly observed phenomenon in bayesian test mcvinish et al 2009 we compare the r rmses for the four fitted models and select the final model by lpml for each case all results are summarized in table 5 first r rmses have the lowest value when the correct model is fitted to the associated case interestingly the differences of r rmses of m 00 and m 10 are very small when simulated data come from the case 1 also the differences of r rmses between m 01 and m 11 are very small when simulated data come from case 2 this implies that the model allowing jumps in location is very robust but if we do not incorporate scale changes into the model we have a serious bias in the estimated model table 5 shows that estimation of the return levels by m results in slightly higher r rmse than the true model associated with each simulated data because the model selection procedure contains the uncertainty from data itself it is reasonable that m is not superior to the true model note that m shows the lower r rmse than the other models except for the true model overall simulation results show the consistencies of model selection and estimation of return levels fig 3 displays bayes estimates of μ t σ t and p t for a replication of all cases which shows the proposed model captures varying dispersion the top left and top right panel in each figure illustrate the results of case 1 and 2 the bottom left and bottom right panel show those of case 3 and 4 each panel displays bayes estimates of locations posterior probabilities of jumps and scales respectively in case 3 and 4 the posterior probabilities of jumps become larger almost 0 5 or more near the time point 60 which is the true change point in the simulation 6 real data analysis we apply the proposed method for frequency analysis of annual maximum daily precipitations amps in the south korean peninsula from 1971 to 2012 the amps at 60 sites are acquired from the korean meteorological administration kma and these data were studied by jo et al 2016 detailed information including l moments of the amps and geographic information of the sites are listed in table 7 of the appendix four bayesian models m 00 m 01 m 10 m 11 in 2 are fitted and the posterior samples of parameters for each site are obtained by the mcmc algorithm referred in section 3 3 because real data can be more complex than simulation studies we increase the number of discarded samples and thinning 500 000 burn in thinned by 100 and obtain 5000 posterior samples the final model for each site is determined by lpml discussed in section 4 the same priors and hyper parameters used in section 5 are also adopted table 6 shows the results of bayesian model selections the sites with m 00 indicate that the amps are well fitted to the stationary gev distributions and one third of sites in south korea fall into this case the previous study jo et al 2016 classified hongcheon and yangpyoung as the sites with minor abrupt location changes of the amps based on the posterior distributions of location parameters because jo et al 2016 does not consider any model selection procedure it is impossible to evaluate the conclusions of model selection considering only abrupt changes in location we differently conclude from lpml that the amps in the two sites are more well fitted to stationary distributions which are supported by the bayesian model selection method the results indicate that there are sites with various types of nonstationarities in the inland areas only locational change models m 10 are selected at 12 sites and only scale varying models m 01 are chosen at 12 sites in particular m 01 includes the sites classified into sites with minor and gradual locational changes jo et al 2016 such as cheongju gumi and jeongeup in fact minor and gradual locational changes are not easily discriminated by smooth scale changes which is nonstationary model m 01 considered in this study in addition location changing and scale varying models m 11 are selected at 10 sites where most are near the western and southern coastal regions tongyeoung referred in section 2 is assigned to m 11 which implies that the amps are well fitted to the nonstationary model with abrupt location changes and smooth scale changes we display bayes estimates of sites which show clear patterns of the selected models in fig 4 three panels in each figure show the results of the location parameters the posterior probabilities of abrupt changes at the time and the scale parameters the solid lines and dashed lines in the figure indicate the bayes estimators posterior means and point wise 90 credible intervals of parameters jeju is classified into m 01 thus scale varying explains the recent changes compared to jeju there are abrupt changes of locations in icheon and wonju recently wonju has the changing locations and varying scale simultaneously 7 concluding remarks our contributions are two folds the first one is to extend the nonstationary bayesian model covering scale changes as well as abrupt location changes in the gev distribution the proposed model can capture abrupt changes in locations and smooth changes in scales simultaneously by well chosen priors such as spike and slab type one the second is to construct the model selection procedure to detect the nonstationary hydrological processes we apply the lpml method to evaluate the various fitted models and select the final model our simulation study shows that the applied method provides viable results in model selection and estimation of parameters in the real data analysis bayesian model selection procedures are applied to identify the nonstationarities in the gev distributions and diverse nonstationarities are detected over all sites previous study in jo et al 2016 screens sites with nonstationarities by mann kendal tests and fit the nonstationary model having abrupt location changes while we compared several nonstationary models with bayesian model selection procedures and finalize the model and estimation thus we obtain different results of regional distributions with the previous study of jo et al 2016 ignoring the changes of scales originally the proposed method is applied to each site independently thus our method does not provide any information to predict hydrological processes in unobserved sites we expect that considering spatial correlation and geo

6162,this study proposes a bayesian model for the nonstationary generalized extreme value gev distributions with abrupt changes of location parameters and smooth change of scale parameters our motivation is that the quantiles of hydrological process depend on scale parameter as well as location parameter in the gev distribution the proposed model extends the nonstationary bayesian model with jumping location parameters on the time domain and it provides a wider class of models to explain abrupt location changes and smooth dispersion changes simultaneously as well as separately in the hydrological processes this study also suggests the use of the bayesian model selection procedure by logarithm of the pseudo marginal likelihood lpml numerical study reveals that the proposed method can provide viable estimates of return levels through model selection we apply the proposed method to analyze annual maximum precipitation acquired from the korea meteorological administration keywords abrupt change bayesian model selection gev distribution scale varying 1 introduction in the field of hydrology recent studies on nonstationary models have primarily focused on the development of models reflecting various types of nonstationarities generally the nonstationarity is modeled by the parametrization of the conditional distribution for given predictors in the view of the parametrization the existing nonstationary models are roughly categorized into two types the model with a trend and the model with an abrupt change the nonstationary models proposed by smith 1989 wang et al 2010 clarke 2002a b nogaj et al 2007 fall into the first category where the location and the scale of the distribution are represented as a smooth function of predictors or time the nonstationary model with an abrupt change are studied by perreault et al 2000a b c rasmussen 2001 chu and zhao 2004 zhao and chu 2006 in particular chu et al 2012 fischer et al 2012 beaulieu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 investigate the empirical evidences of the abrupt changes in precipitation and temperature these studies consider as potential causes of the changes the artificial or natural discontinuities regime shifts in climate and human intervention since the detection of abrupt changes is necessary for planning and adaptation against the natural disasters developing the nonstationary models with an abrupt change is crucial in extreme data analysis jeon et al 2016 and jo et al 2016 propose the nonstationary model with an abrupt change for the generalized extreme value gev distribution and examine the efficacy of the models by numerical studies but in real data analysis of these studies it is observed that the nonstationarity associated with the abrupt change is misleading when the dispersion of distributions tends to be larger thus we consider a toy example to quantify the misleading results by the nonstationary model the toy example demonstrates how different estimated results are obtained by the model misspecification data are generated by the gev distribution with abruptly changing location parameters and smoothly varying scale parameters on the time domain t 1 50 denote the generated observation at time t by y t and write the gev distribution with location parameter μ and scale parameter σ and shape parameter ξ by gev μ σ ξ in our case the location and scale parameters depend on time so that we write them as μ t and σ t to empathize their time dependence the generative model in the example is given by y t gev μ t σ t ξ where μ t 100 i t 25 200 i t 25 σ t exp 3 0 02 t for t t and ξ 0 2 here i t a is the indicator function to denote whether t a or not suppose that we know that the change occurs at time t 26 when the nonstationary model with only location abrupt changes jeon et al 2016 is used for estimating 200 year return level a monte carlo simulation reveals that the estimate return level at t 50 is approximately 572 on average which is 44 lower than the true return level at t 50 the difference is the bias of return levels induced by model mis specification ignoring smooth changes in scale parameters of the generative model even though the fitted model may reflect abrupt changes in the location parameter it cannot explain increasing of variability by nonstationary scale parameter σ t therefore it is essential to develop the model covering various nonstationary patterns the purpose of this paper is twofold the first one is extending the nonstationary bayesian model jo et al 2016 to incorporate the abrupt changes in the location parameters and the smooth drift in the scale parameters the proposed model captures not only multiple changes of location parameters but also smooth changes in scale parameters on time domain in general the nonstationarity of scale parameters can be understood as those of variances or inter quartile ranges iqr in the cross sectional distribution of considered hydrological processes the second one is to provide a model selection method in the proposed nonstationary models to the best of our knowledge the model selection method is first introduced in the field of hydrology when the nonstationary model interfaces with change points by spike and slab priors the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 presents motivation of considering scale varying model with abrupt changes of location in the gev distribution section 3 explains the proposed bayesian model including likelihood priors and posteriors section 4 suggests model selection procedure and section 5 exhibits the numerical result of simulations the real data of south korea are analyzed by the proposed method in section 6 and the concluding remarks follow in section 7 2 motivation the motivational real example of this study is the annual maximum of precipitations amps acquired from the korean meteorological administration kma in the south korean peninsula the nonstationarity of the amps is studied by jeon et al 2016 and jo et al 2016 which focus on abrupt changes in the location parameters of the gev distribution these studies consistently show statistical evidences of abrupt changes in the location parameters we extend the bayesian model jeon et al 2016 to explain changes in scale parameters that could lead to nonstationarity in variability as well as average of the amps nonstationarity in scale parameter of the gev distribution affects changes of location and dispersion in hydrological processes simultaneously here we consider α quantile and interquartile range iqr as measures of location and dispersion of a distribution suppose that y t is a random sample of amps at time t that follows gev μ t σ t ξ the α quantile of y t is given by q α μ t σ t ξ 1 log α ξ 1 for ξ 0 and q α μ t σ t log log α for ξ 0 the iqr at time t which explains the variability is given by σ t ξ 1 log 0 75 ξ log 0 25 ξ for ξ 0 σ t log log 0 75 log log 0 25 for ξ 0 note that the nonstationarity in the iqr depends only on σ t also it is easily shown that the variance of y t depends on σ t and ξ such that its nonstationarity depends on σ t a simple data analysis for the amps in south korean peninsula shows the possibility of nonstationarity in dispersions to estimate iqrs of the amps on time domain we apply quantile regression koenker 2005 to estimate the first quartile and the third quartile fig 1 shows the estimated first and third quartiles of amps and the estimated iqrs even though it is unknown that the variations are statistically significant the estimated iqr seems to decrease it is clear that the nonstationary model only on the location parameters is not able to capture such a varying dispersion ignorance of nonstationarity in dispersion could lead a bias in estimating scale parameters in the gev distribution it is worthy noting that the bias of scale parameters more sensitively affects the estimation of high quantiles of the gev distribution than that of location parameters denote the differential of α quantile with respect to μ t and σ t by q α t μ t and q α t σ t respectively then q α t μ t is always 1 regardless of α while q α t σ t is given by ξ 1 log α ξ 1 which depends on α since lim α 1 ξ 1 log α ξ 1 for ξ 0 the scale parameter is much more sensitive to the high quantiles to reflect the characteristic in time varying dispersion we introduce the varying scale parameter in the nonstationary model with abruptly jumping location we let the scale parameters σ t as a regression model e log σ t β 0 β 1 t where β 0 and β 1 are random regression parameters the model for scale parameters was used by cannon 2010 coles 2001 el adlouni 2007 hundecha et al 2008 in the non bayesian model in the view of stochastic modeling the changes in extreme distribution can be explained by the nonstationarity of the underlying distribution that consists of the max stable processes see the section 3 2 embrechts et al 2013 also in the sense of approximation we can reflect the changes of the underlying distribution in the corresponding extreme distribution for example if we use the gev distribution as an approximated distribution for the annual maxima of daily precipitations the abrupt changes in the location parameter of the gev distribution can be explained by the change in the distribution of daily precipitations in the next section we extend the bayesian model for the nonstationary gev distribution by incorporating abrupt jump process in location parameters and smooth varying process in scale parameters 3 priors and posteriors for nonstationary location and scale in this section we construct the bayesian model for the nonstationary hydrological processes fig 2 shows the general overview of the proposed bayesian models the left panel of fig 2 displays the generative model of observations for given gev parameters the circuit arrow of the μ t denotes the dependence with a delay of a single time step note that μ t and σ t are time dependent but ξ is not the right panel of fig 2 illustrates the hierarchical structure of the prior distribution for the gev parameters the red circles at the top denote the process of scale parameters associated with the regression model the regression parameters β 0 and β 1 depend on the hierarchical hyperprior distribution of τ 2 2 τ 3 2 and α the yellow circles in the middle denote the process of location parameters whose prior distribution are defined by spike and slab priors jo et al 2016 the details of priors likelihood and posteriors are explained in the next subsections 3 1 priors for abrupt changes in location consider a location parameter μ t for t t 1 2 3 under the stationary model all of location parameters are equal that is μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 if we consider the change of location parameters at least one of μ t s for t t is not equal to the others thus there are five partitions associated with the change of the location parameters p 1 1 2 3 p 2 1 2 3 p 3 1 2 3 p 4 1 3 2 and p 5 1 2 3 the number of partitions is known as the bell numbers which is recursively defined by b n 1 k 0 n n k b k b 0 1 here b n denotes the number of partitions of a set that has n elements the bell number is rapidly increases as n a naive priors for the partitions is defined as the high dimensional model to avoid the curse of dimensionality the developed priors for the partition has a restricted support on the partition for example product partition priors barry and hartigan 1993 assign positive probability only to consecutive partitions in our example the prior distribution of p 4 is zero since μ 1 and μ 3 in the same partition are not adjacent even though the prior probabilities for partitions were defined on the 4 dimensional standard simplex the product priors is defined on the 3 dimensional standard simplex which simplifies the prior distribution on the low dimensional space spike and slab priors model an event of partition by the occurrence of change this prior is defined by conditional distribution as for t 2 n 1 μ t μ t 1 1 p t δ μ t 1 p t π l μ t 1 0 p t 1 where δ is the dirac delta function having a point mass only at μ t 1 and π l μ t 1 is a continuous probability density function with mean μ t 1 here p t is a bernoulli random variable denoting whether a change at time t occurs or not conditionally on the occurrence of change at the time t μ t is a continuous random variable with mean μ t 1 thus pr μ t μ s p t 1 0 for s t which implies that the spike and slab prior induces a probability for partitions which assign a positive probability only on consecutive blocks table 1 shows that the probability of partitions induced by spike and slab priors when p t w for all t even though the partition priors can address a wide class of probabilities for partitions the computation cost is very high except for a special case such as gaussian model to avoid the computational problem we adopt spike and slab priors in the location parameters of the gev distribution as follows p t w iid ber ω ω beta a w b w a w 0 b w 0 π l μ t 1 π l x μ t 1 λ exp x μ t 1 λ 2 λ λ 0 μ 1 τ 1 2 n μ 0 τ 1 2 τ 1 2 gamma α α α unif 0 l l 0 note that π l is a probability density function of the laplace double exponential distribution having heavier tails than those of normal distribution we set the hyper parameters as a w b w 0 5 λ 100 l 50 and μ 0 μ where μ the maximum likelihood estimator of the stationary model jo et al 2016 3 2 priors for scale varying and others in the modeling of scale we consider the smoothing change in scale because the value of scale is positive we use priors through the log link as follows log σ t β 0 β 1 τ 2 n β 0 β 1 t τ 2 τ 2 gamma γ σ γ σ β 0 τ 2 2 n 0 τ 2 2 β 1 τ 3 2 n 0 τ 3 2 τ 2 2 τ 3 2 iid gamma α α α unif 0 l l 0 given α the marginal priors of μ 1 β 0 β 1 follow t distributions and this model and priors can explain the increasing or decreasing scale parameter at last we uses n 0 τ ξ 2 as a prior distribution of the shape parameter of the gev distribution ξ we set hyper parameters as γ σ 0 01 l 50 and τ ξ 2 1000 3 3 likelihood and posteriors in the proposed model the likelihood function is given by l y μ σ ξ t 1 n 1 σ t 1 ξ y t μ t σ t 1 ξ 1 exp 1 ξ y t μ t σ t 1 ξ i y t μ t σ t ξ ξ 0 i y t μ t σ t ξ ξ 0 1 σ t exp y t μ t σ t exp exp y t μ t σ t i ξ 0 where μ μ 1 μ n t and σ σ 1 σ n t as a result the proposed model and the priors are rewritten as follows 2a y t y μ σ ξ gev μ t σ t ξ t 1 n 2b μ t μ t 1 p t 1 p t δ μ t 1 p t π l μ t 1 λ t 2 n 2c μ 1 n μ 0 τ 1 2

the parameters thus the prior is valid only on the set satisfying the following constraints y i μ i σ i ξ i ξ 0 ξ 0 μ i σ i ξ i ξ 0 when the support of the priors depends on the observations it is difficult to select an efficient proposal distribution for the mcmc markov chain monte carlo truncated normal distribution may be a candidate of the proposal distribution but computational efficiency is not exploited in this paper we implemented the mcmc by an open software openbugs that uses the multivariate normal distribution as the proposal distribution the details of the joint distribution and posteriors are given in the appendix the posteriors sampling is not straightforward because the posteriors are not of an explicit form except for that of ω each step therefore requires a rejection sampling see for example ripley 1987 adaptive rejection metropolis sampling gilks et al 1995 or the metropolis hastings method hastings 1970 metropolis et al 1953 we used openbugs for the mcmc and uploaded the r code in github https github com s88012 gev bayesian remark 1 letting μ μ 1 μ n or σ σ 1 σ n and a prior σ gamma γ 0 γ 0 allows us to construct reduced models where the location and scale are stationary we set γ 0 0 01 in the model with the stationary location and scale parameter in bayesian tests the simplest model can show better performance when using strongly shruk priors thus we used the prior σ gamma d d 10 d unif 0 1 for the model having constant location and scale remark 2 the employed priors in this study are carefully selected for the convergence of the mcmc the priors of scale parameters and spike and slab priors gives the shrinkage effects to the estimated model such that we can avoid the overfitting problem 4 bayesian model selection and considered models model selection is required to avoid under fitting or over fitting problem in bayesian data analysis we briefly review the bayesian model selection using bayes factor and introduce the new method applied to the considered models bayes factor kass and raftery 1995 is widely studied by kim et al 2017 and shively and walker 2018 as a useful tool of the bayesian model selection let y be the vector of observations and denote the likelihood function by f y θ k m k i 1 n f i y i θ k m k where θ k is the parameter of model m k for k 1 k bayes factor b k 1 k 2 for the model m k 1 and m k 2 with k 1 k 2 1 k 2 is defined by the ratio of marginal likelihood of the two models b k 1 k 2 f y θ k 1 m k 1 π k 1 d θ k 1 m k 1 f y θ k 2 m k 2 π k 2 d θ k 2 m k 2 here π k i and θ k i are priors and parameter in m k i i 1 2 respectively if b k 1 k 2 is sufficiently large then we select the model of m k 1 note that pr m k 1 y f y m k 1 pr m k 1 which implies that bayes factor indicates the ratio of the evidences of the two models based on the observed data even though bayes factor is attractive in the theoretical aspect applying the bayes factor to model selection usually has a practical issue related to computations as an alternative we use the following logarithm of pseudo marginal likelihood lpml geisser and eddy 1979 lplm m k i 1 n log f i y i y i m k where y i y 1 y i 1 y i 1 y n t lpml employs an predictive density function f i y i y i m k instead of marginal density function f i y i m k which generally requires high computational cost the lpml is approximated by posterior samples from mcmc as i 1 n log cpo i m k cpo i m k 1 s j 1 s 1 f i y i θ kj m k 1 where θ kj j 1 s is a posterior sample of size s with model m k here cpo i m k is the approximated value of f i y i y i m k such that it is called of the ith conditional predictive ordinate of m k this approximation is shown by 1 s j 1 s 1 f i y i θ kj m k f i y i θ k m k 1 π d θ k y m k f y θ k m k f y m k f i y i θ k m k 1 π d θ k m k f y i m k f y m k 1 f i y i y i m k when there are several fitted bayesian models the final model with the largest lpml is selected lpml can be interpreted as the surrogate for the log p y i m k of which values indicates the adequacy of the model for the data thus we select the model with the largest lpml among the fitted models 5 simulation studies 5 1 setups simulated data y t t 1 120 are generated from gev μ t σ t ξ t 1 120 four types of the nonstationary models are used to generate simulated data and the four estimated models for each simulated data are obtained by the proposed methods listed in table 2 the nonstarionary models for μ t and σ t are given in table 3 and ξ is fixed as 0 2 across the all considered models we conduct 50 replications in all cases and run the gibbs sampler for 300 000 iterations with two chains at different initial values for each chain we keep a posterior sample for every 30th iteration after a burn in period of 75 000 samples and obtained 5000 samples from the two chains the auto correlation plots histograms and trace plots for μ 80 σ 80 and ξ of m 11 are displayed in fig 5 in appendix which show an efficient mixing in posterior samples of mcmc for all fitted models lpmls and estimates of return levels were obtained based on the bayes estimates of μ 120 σ 120 and ξ to compare the estimated return levels with the true return levels we define r rmse relative root mean squared error as j 1 n l j α l α 2 n l α where l j α and l α are the estimate of α year return level in the jth replication and the true α year return level respectively 5 2 results the results of model selections based on lpmls are summarized in table 4 the row and column of table 4 denote the case of simulation setting to generate data and the type of fitted model recall that the types of fitted models provided in table 2 and the models of the simulated data are given in table 3 each value in table 4 indicates the selection probability of the finally fitted model by bayesian model selection and the diagonal element denotes the probability of the correct model selection the probability are attained from the result of 50 iterative simulations table 4 shows that lpml can provide a good model selection procedure under the simulated data it also indicates that lpml works well for cases with varying scales when there is a jump in location even though the proportion of correct selection is relatively low in case 1 compared to other cases the finally selected model is close to the stationary model and it is a commonly observed phenomenon in bayesian test mcvinish et al 2009 we compare the r rmses for the four fitted models and select the final model by lpml for each case all results are summarized in table 5 first r rmses have the lowest value when the correct model is fitted to the associated case interestingly the differences of r rmses of m 00 and m 10 are very small when simulated data come from the case 1 also the differences of r rmses between m 01 and m 11 are very small when simulated data come from case 2 this implies that the model allowing jumps in location is very robust but if we do not incorporate scale changes into the model we have a serious bias in the estimated model table 5 shows that estimation of the return levels by m results in slightly higher r rmse than the true model associated with each simulated data because the model selection procedure contains the uncertainty from data itself it is reasonable that m is not superior to the true model note that m shows the lower r rmse than the other models except for the true model overall simulation results show the consistencies of model selection and estimation of return levels fig 3 displays bayes estimates of μ t σ t and p t for a replication of all cases which shows the proposed model captures varying dispersion the top left and top right panel in each figure illustrate the results of case 1 and 2 the bottom left and bottom right panel show those of case 3 and 4 each panel displays bayes estimates of locations posterior probabilities of jumps and scales respectively in case 3 and 4 the posterior probabilities of jumps become larger almost 0 5 or more near the time point 60 which is the true change point in the simulation 6 real data analysis we apply the proposed method for frequency analysis of annual maximum daily precipitations amps in the south korean peninsula from 1971 to 2012 the amps at 60 sites are acquired from the korean meteorological administration kma and these data were studied by jo et al 2016 detailed information including l moments of the amps and geographic information of the sites are listed in table 7 of the appendix four bayesian models m 00 m 01 m 10 m 11 in 2 are fitted and the posterior samples of parameters for each site are obtained by the mcmc algorithm referred in section 3 3 because real data can be more complex than simulation studies we increase the number of discarded samples and thinning 500 000 burn in thinned by 100 and obtain 5000 posterior samples the final model for each site is determined by lpml discussed in section 4 the same priors and hyper parameters used in section 5 are also adopted table 6 shows the results of bayesian model selections the sites with m 00 indicate that the amps are well fitted to the stationary gev distributions and one third of sites in south korea fall into this case the previous study jo et al 2016 classified hongcheon and yangpyoung as the sites with minor abrupt location changes of the amps based on the posterior distributions of location parameters because jo et al 2016 does not consider any model selection procedure it is impossible to evaluate the conclusions of model selection considering only abrupt changes in location we differently conclude from lpml that the amps in the two sites are more well fitted to stationary distributions which are supported by the bayesian model selection method the results indicate that there are sites with various types of nonstationarities in the inland areas only locational change models m 10 are selected at 12 sites and only scale varying models m 01 are chosen at 12 sites in particular m 01 includes the sites classified into sites with minor and gradual locational changes jo et al 2016 such as cheongju gumi and jeongeup in fact minor and gradual locational changes are not easily discriminated by smooth scale changes which is nonstationary model m 01 considered in this study in addition location changing and scale varying models m 11 are selected at 10 sites where most are near the western and southern coastal regions tongyeoung referred in section 2 is assigned to m 11 which implies that the amps are well fitted to the nonstationary model with abrupt location changes and smooth scale changes we display bayes estimates of sites which show clear patterns of the selected models in fig 4 three panels in each figure show the results of the location parameters the posterior probabilities of abrupt changes at the time and the scale parameters the solid lines and dashed lines in the figure indicate the bayes estimators posterior means and point wise 90 credible intervals of parameters jeju is classified into m 01 thus scale varying explains the recent changes compared to jeju there are abrupt changes of locations in icheon and wonju recently wonju has the changing locations and varying scale simultaneously 7 concluding remarks our contributions are two folds the first one is to extend the nonstationary bayesian model covering scale changes as well as abrupt location changes in the gev distribution the proposed model can capture abrupt changes in locations and smooth changes in scales simultaneously by well chosen priors such as spike and slab type one the second is to construct the model selection procedure to detect the nonstationary hydrological processes we apply the lpml method to evaluate the various fitted models and select the final model our simulation study shows that the applied method provides viable results in model selection and estimation of parameters in the real data analysis bayesian model selection procedures are applied to identify the nonstationarities in the gev distributions and diverse nonstationarities are detected over all sites previous study in jo et al 2016 screens sites with nonstationarities by mann kendal tests and fit the nonstationary model having abrupt location changes while we compared several nonstationary models with bayesian model selection procedures and finalize the model and estimation thus we obtain different results of regional distributions with the previous study of jo et al 2016 ignoring the changes of scales originally the proposed method is applied to each site independently thus our method does not provide any information to predict hydrological processes in unobserved sites we expect that considering spatial correlation and geo statistical information helps to solve this problem under the bayesian model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

6163,the propagation of meteorological drought in a complete water cycle is not limited to hydrological and agricultural droughts but also involves groundwater drought moreover the intensification of water cycle under the background of global warming may also affect the time of drought propagation therefore studying the dynamic propagation and possible influence factors from meteorological to groundwater drought is helpful to monitor and assess the risk of groundwater drought here we use terrestrial water storage anomalies observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites and simulated soil moisture and runoff variations from the global land data assimilation system to show that the groundwater storage anomalies in the pearl river basin prb the standardized precipitation index and drought severity index were used to characterize meteorological and groundwater drought respectively results indicated that 1 the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought in the prb during 2002 2015 was 8 months and that in spring and summer was shorter than that in autumn and winter 2 the time of drought propagation has a significant deceasing trend p 0 01 indicating that the water cycle in the prb was accelerating 3 increasing soil moisture accelerates the response of groundwater to precipitation in the surplus period due to the stored full runoff mechanism whilst intensifying evapotranspiration rate and heat wave facilitate the drought propagation in the deficit period 4 compared with arctic oscillation and el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation is the main driving force to accelerate drought propagation in the prb keywords groundwater drought meteorological drought drought propagation dynamic 1 introduction compared to other kinds of natural hazards the spatial extent of drought is extremely larger and its influencing time is commonly much longer thus the damages caused by drought are expected to be highly larger than other natural hazards mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2014a generally droughts are classified into four categories including meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 guo et al 2019a b another form of drought called groundwater drought when groundwater systems are affected by drought first groundwater recharge and later groundwater levels and groundwater discharge decrease such droughts are called groundwater droughts van lanen and peters 2000 furthermore meteorological and groundwater droughts are inter related through interactions that happen within the water cycle van loon and laaha 2015 however the earth s climate system is experiencing significant climate change which directly leads to changes in the hydrological cycle yoon et al 2015 han et al 2019 fang et al 2019a b this means that the propagation of groundwater systems to drought and their performance under drought conditions becomes increasingly important calow et al 1999 drought are mostly caused by periods of lower than average precipitation and propagation through the hydrological system peters et al 2006 when meteorological drought propagates to the groundwater system groundwater drought will not be detected as early as hydrological drought and agricultural drought inversely only when groundwater drought seriously affects human life it can arouse extensive attention more important extraction of groundwater will significantly affect the energy exchange between soil moisture and land atmosphere leading to the depletion of surface and groundwater resources and thus leading to secondary disasters zeng et al 2016 e g land subsidence soil salinization seawater intrusion and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity forkutsa et al 2009 park et al 2012 many studies involving various methods have analyzed groundwater drought and explored the relationship between the precipitation and groundwater level castle et al 2014 tallaksen et al 2006 bloomfield et al 2015 huang et al 2016 however drought is a multi scalar phenomenon with the effects of precipitation deficits meteorological drought becoming evident in various systems e g surface and groundwater hydrology vegetation activity and crop production at various temporal scale lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 meanwhile research on drought propagation focuses on meteorological to hydrological drought and seldom on meteorological to groundwater drought furthermore the propagated of meteorological drought in the water cycle is not limited to hydrological and agricultural droughts which is seldom noticed by people hence studying the dynamic propagation of meteorological to groundwater drought is not only a vital step in the field of hydrology but also an important practical significance for establishing an effective monitoring and early warning system of meteorological drought based on groundwater drought in addition the holistic regional groundwater assessments would be valuable in promoting environmental restoration and for hydrologic research but such assessments are difficult to generate on the basic of well surveys which are typically unsystematic rodell et al 2009 satellite observations of time variable gravity from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission present a new and valuable tool to fill these gaps in data availability and water monitoring tapley et al 2004 terrestrial water storage tws variations observed by grace include the combined contributions of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow ice and biomass rodell et al 2005 besides groundwater storage variations can be isolated from grace data given auxiliary information on the other components of tws from either in situ observations or land surface models rodell et al 2007 meanwhile tws estimates derived from the grace have been widely used to examine regional scale droughts worldwide hughes et al 2012 elmore et al 2010 in particular zhao et al 2017 developed a new drought severity index dsi based solely on grace tws based estimates compared to previous tws based drought studies the grace dsi is calculated without model assimilation and considers spatial and temporal variability of local hydro climatology however tws contains all water components on land when meteorological propagates to hydrology agriculture and groundwater drought grace dsi shows a superimposed drought signal based on this to remove its effect and thus isolate the groundwater storage anomalies gwsa we estimated the storage variations of soil moisture and runoff through the global land data assimilation system gldas then the gwsa are calculated by grace dsi and the groundwater drought index gwsa dsi is effectively obtained in general groundwater responds more slowly to meteorological conditions than the near surface components of the terrestrial water cycle changnon et al 1988 its residence time the ratio of quantity in storage to average rate of recharge or discharge ranges from months in shallow aquifers to a million or more years in deep desert aquifers sturchio et al 2004 however the standardized precipitation index spi can monitor both short term and long term drought effects and is comparable among different locations due to its probabilistic nature importantly the fundamental advantage of spi is that it can be computed for a variety of time scales soleimani motlagh et al 2017 hence it can be used as an effective tool for the propagation of meteorological to groundwater drought previous studies have shown that climate change has led to more frequent and severe extreme natural events liu et al 2016 2018 günter et al 2019 huang et al 2019 ren et al 2019 the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has indicated that the frequency intensity and duration of some climate extreme events will increase by the end of this century oliver 2013 huang et al 2014b in particular brutsaert 2012 found that the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and el niño southern oscillation enso affected groundwater storage in four desert regions of north america apurv et al 2017 found in the latest study that the inter annual variability of precipitation has a strong control over groundwater recharge and consumption due to climate change therefore teleconnection factors directly regional precipitation and indirectly also affect groundwater thus affecting the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought however how teleconnection factors affect drought propagation through influencing meteorological factors is unclear based on these it is particularly important to analyze the impact of teleconnection factors on the drought propagation it can not only reveal the main driving factors affecting the propagation time but also predict and evaluate the occurrence of regional drought events in advance the primary objectives of this study are 1 to capture and identify groundwater drought 2 to investigate the propagation time and dynamic change of meteorological to groundwater drought 3 to explore the possible influencing and driving factors on the propagation dynamics 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the prb 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n is located in south china with a drainage area of 4 537

meteorological drought index based on probability distribution of precipitation spi values are dimensionless and are computed by fitting a gamma distribution function to precipitation values during the time month period the spi can be adopted to indicate the precipitation conditions in a specific period in a long time series and shows the precipitation deficits corresponding to the period since the spi can capture the drought features at various time scales 1 3 6 9 12 24 48 months it has been broadly applied to investigate different aspects of droughts mckee et al 1993 here we have computed spi for the time scales of 1 12 month using the precipitation data sets gldas the spi can be calculated as follows 2 spi s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 t ln 1 h x 2 3 g x 1 β γ γ γ 0 0 x x γ

water cycle i e soil moisture storage smsa snow water equivalent storage swea and surface water reservoir storage resa were removed from twsa anomaly in any of the components was calculated by removing the mean value for the entire study period from the data value in the particular month the study region is not subjected to snow accumulation activities hence we have not considered snow water equivalents using a priori monitoring or model based estimates of resa and smsa the gwsa can be calculated as a residual from the disaggregation equation scanlon et al 2015 4 gwsa t w s a s m s a r e s a the dsi is a standardized drought severity index exclusively based on grace derived tws we have utilized monthly estimates of csr mascon solutions rl05m v01 of land water storage from grace to compute gwsa dsi following the algorithm provided in zhao et al 2017 5 gwsa d s i i j gws a i j gws a j σ j where i is year ranging from 2002 to 2015 j is month ranging from january to december and gws a j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of groundwater storage anomalies in month j respectively besides the gwsa dsi is a dimensionless quantity used to detect drought events table 1 detailed grading can be found in zhao et al 2017 3 3 cross wavelet transformation the cross wavelet transformation cwt is able to present the correlation between two time series in both time and frequency domains combined with the wavelet transformation and cross spectrum analysis hudgins and huang 1996 the cwt is often used to explore the correlations between two annual hydrological and climatic time series the cwt of two time series xn and yn can be expressed as w xy w x w y where denotes their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w xy the complex argument arg w xy is regarded as the local relative phase between xn and yn in time frequency field the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two times series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y torrence and compo 1998 is expressed as follows 6 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level corresponding to the probability p for a probability distribution function defined by the square root of the two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 identification and variation characteristics of groundwater drought in the prb fig 2 shows that the groundwater drought mainly occurred in 2003 2006 and 2009 2010 which matched the two severe droughts wang et al 2017 outbreaks in the prb during that period among the drought from 2003 to 2006 the gwsa dsi reached the lowest value 2 79 in july 2004 and its intensity and duration were particularly severe during this period most parts of southern china suffered the worst drought in 53 years drought has caused economic losses of more than 4 billion rmb more than 7 2 million people have difficulties in drinking water http news sina com cn c 2004 11 03 06294122595s shtml which indicate that the grace twsa and the gwsa calculated by us have applicability in drought identification in addition the reliability of the gwsa based on grace had been verified in many areas henry et al 2011 bhanja and mukherjee 2016 to further verify the reliability of the results we compared the annual groundwater resources in the prb with the annual average gwsa dsi based on its monthly series fig 3 and found that the correlation reached 0 51 p 0 08 although some short term drought events occurred after 2009 the amplitude of gwsa dsi increased significantly which is consistent with the trend of groundwater resources data provided by the ministry of water resources of china additionally as a nature link between soil atmosphere and water vegetation plays an indicator role in the studies of global change vegetation can reflect the state of nature environment most intuitively and clearly sato and tateishi 2004 soumendra et al 2019 used data from more than 15 000 groundwater observation wells in india to find that ndvi has a good correlation with groundwater level r 0 6 in natural vegetated areas we carried out a 11 month moving average of ndvi and gwsa dsi in the prb fig 4 and found that there was a signification positive correlation r 0 64 p 0 01 between them moreover during the two groundwater droughts ndvi decreased dramatically which further verifies the ability of gwsa dsi to identify and capture groundwater drought 4 2 the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought and its seasonality the various time scale of spi 1 month 2 month 24 month were obtained by calculating the monthly precipitation data of the prb from 1979 to 2015 we find that spi 8 and the gwsa dsi have a significant correlation r 0 56 p 0 01 in the 2002 2015 series fig 5 this is consistent with the response time of hydrological to meteorological drought in nanpan river basin belonging to the prb is for 6 months zhang et al 2014 because when meteorological drought propagates to groundwater drought it needs to pass through the soil layer and lags behind fig 5 shows that the gwsa dsi has captured multiple droughts in different degrees of which the duration and intensity of three groundwater droughts in 2004 2005 2006 2009 2010 are the most abnormal meteorological drought always occurs before groundwater drought the longer the spi continues to decline the more likely it will lead to more severe drought however the number of groundwater droughts with low intensity and short duration increased obviously after 2009 especially after 2011 there was no meteorological drought in the prb while the groundwater drought still occurred it shows that the influence of groundwater drought is not only a single factor of precipitation bhuiyan 2009 at the same time it also shows that the propagation time from meteorology to groundwater drought tends to be faster the correlation coefficients between the monthly gwsa dsi and spi series with various time scales in the prb is illustrated in fig 6 it can be easily seen from fig 6 that the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought in the prb has noticeably seasonal characteristics spring groundwater drought propagation time and spi 7 have the strongest correlation r 0 86 p 0 01 summer and autumn have significant correlation with spi 10 r 0 76 p 0 01 and spi 14 r 0 76 p 0 01 respectively compared with other seasons groundwater drought in december is significantly correlated with spi 17 r 0 83 p 0 01 indicating that the propagation time in spring and summer was shorter than that in autumn and winter table 2 this was consistent with the seasonal characteristics of meteorological propagation to hydrological drought huang et al 2017a b it should be noted that the gwsa dsi in december has a strong correlation p 0 01 with other scale spi fig 6 precipitation in the prb is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn which results in meteorological drought and groundwater drought mostly occurring in winter 4 3 dynamic propagation from meteorological to groundwater drought to further analyze the dynamic changes of the time from meteorology to groundwater drought propagation in the prb we slipped gwsa dsi on the scale of 3 years and 5 years and analyzed the correlation with spi series with various time scales fig 7 during the period of extreme groundwater drought from 2003 to 2006 and from 2009 to 2010 the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought corresponding to the three year sliding window was mainly concentrated in 7 14 months correlation was between 0 47 and 0 70 p 0 01 while the propagation time corresponding to the five year sliding window was mainly concentrated in 8 13 months correlation was between 0 39 and 0 56 p 0 01 in other periods the drought propagation time of the two windows mainly concentrated in 7 10 months correlation was between 0 40 and 0 54 p 0 01 therefore the change of drought propagation time corresponding to different sliding windows indicates that the time of meteorological to groundwater drought is dynamic more importantly the propagation time of both sliding downwards shows a decreasing trend fig 7 which further illustrates that the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought is accelerating which means that the time of monitoring and preventing drought is shortening which should be paid more attention to 4 4 the possible influencing factors of accelerating drought propagation in the prb to reveal the possible factors affecting the intensification of drought propagation in the prb fig 8 shows the relationship between the propagation time and meteorological and underlying surface factors under the sliding window for three years it is found that the evapotranspiration et rate r 0 79 p 0 01 and precipitation r 0 76 p 0 01 in meteorological factors and soil moisture r 0 48 p 0 12 in underlying surface factors are the most important factors affecting the intensification of drought propagation although soil moisture has not passed the 99 significance test as a medium of communication between precipitation and soil moisture the influence of meteorological factors on groundwater resources is realized by controlling the process of soil moisture seepage green et al 2011 therefore soil moisture should not be neglected when considering the propagation from meteorological to groundwater drought however in the process of accelerating the propagation of meteorology to groundwater drought in the prb the drought year 2003 2005 and 2009 2010 has a long propagation time fig 7 to consider the role of et rate precipitation and soil moisture in the process of propagation we divide it into dry and wet cases in surplus period precipitation and soil moisture increase et rate decrease soil moisture is in a relatively wet state the mechanism of stored full runoff in the study area will accelerate the rate of precipitation infiltration to recharge groundwater thus speeding up the response time of groundwater to precipitation as a result the propagation time is accelerated in deficit period precipitation and soil moisture decrease et rate increase when meteorological propagates to groundwater drought it will first cause the continuous loss of soil moisture and the increase of et rate will magnify the soil moisture anomaly and aggravate the drought situation teuling et al 2013 mo and lettenmaier 2015 at the same time the ndvi of the prb is relatively high and when precipitation cannot provide enough water vegetation will preferentially consume soil moisture resulting in further loss of soil moisture however the buffering effect of soil moisture in the process of drought propagation slows down the propagation time relative to the surplus period but the result is more serious groundwater drought 5 discussion 5 1 the effect of human factors on groundwater drought in many parts of the world groundwater has long been exploited as a resource for public water supply and irrigation furthermore free for all groundwater policies have resulted in water being pumped at far greater rates than can be replenished naturally famiglietti 2014 to consider the influence of groundwater extraction on groundwater drought and propagation in the prb we obtained the annual groundwater supply data of the prb from the ministry of water resources of china fig 9 a shows that the annual groundwater supply in the prb tends to decline especially after 2008 the continuous decline is due to the restriction of groundwater exploitation in some provinces and regions and the protection measures of groundwater resources such as sealing up self provided wells wang et al 2015 for comparison we calculated annual average gwsa dsi based on its monthly series and found that there was a significant negative correlation r 0 83 p 0 01 with groundwater supply fig 9b it shows that the artificial extraction of groundwater is an important factor to aggravate groundwater drought which is similar to the depletion of groundwater in northern india rodell et al 2009 and california valley famiglietti et al 2011 meanwhile it also explains why the groundwater drought in the prb has been alleviated after 2009 fig 5 in addition the correlation between groundwater supply and propagation time was 0 19 p 0 55 indicating that extraction of groundwater had no significant acceleration effect on drought propagation fig 9c because of the acceleration of meteorological propagation to groundwater drought groundwater exploitation cannot be considered solely further the meteorological and underlying surface elements precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture that connect precipitation and groundwater are the main factors fig 8 in general the artificial extraction of groundwater can significantly aggravate groundwater drought but the acceleration of the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought in the prb should be concerned with the factors of climate change and aggravation of water cycle 5 2 impact of intensified water cycle on drought propagation because similar to traditional droughts a change in groundwater drought is not only associated with the change in terrestrial hydrological cycle but also influenced by the change in terrestrial energy cycle and the related heatwaves as well as the interaction between the land and atmosphere dai 2013 under global warming the risk of heatwave is increasing meehl and tebaldi 2004 and the terrestrial hydrological cycle is also expected to be intensified with increasing water vapor feedback huntington 2006 leading to the changes in precipitation soil moisture and et as well as characteristics of climate extremes the concurrent drought and heatwave events with low soil moisture fig 10 e and high et are recently termed as flash drought yuan et al 2015 wang et al 2016 found that flash drought mainly occurred in south china with an average of 16 24 times per decade and the number of occurrences showed an upward trend although the temperature has been relatively lower in the whole series fig 10c this is because the global mean temperature remained flat during the first decade of the 21st century which is related to the intermittent period of global warming foster and rahmstorf 2011 however the decreasing temperature was compensated by the accelerated drying trends of soil moisture and enhanced et leading to an acceleration of flash droughts during the warming hiatus wang et al 2016 as a result more serious drought events tend to occur during this period in addition precipitation is another major factor that aggravates the propagation of drought when considering precipitation magnitude we further consider the precipitation concentration degree pcd prior to 2011 the higher pcd indicates that the annual precipitation distribution in the prb is uneven fig 10b at the same time relevant studies duan et al 2017 show that the extreme precipitation level and frequency in the prb have increased significantly since the 21st century in addition the increase of extreme high temperature events and the decrease of extreme low temperature events aggravate the water cycle in the basin and the response time of groundwater to meteorological drought hundecha and bárdossy 2005 gornall et al 2010 it is worth noting that after 2011 the increase of precipitation fig 10a lead to the decrease of et rate fig 10d however the decrease of pcd p 0 05 indicates that precipitation in the basin distributes evenly during the year which results in high humidity in the year and the accompanying high temperature further increases the risk of heat wave peterson et al 2013 in general the flash drought and heat wave events caused by global warming and the intensification of water cycle have further aggravated the propagation drought 5 3 the influence of teleconnection factors on dynamic propagation of drought to reveal how the atmospheric circulation anomaly affects the time of drought propagation cross wavelet analysis of the teleconnection factors and the main factors et rate precipitation pcd and soil moisture affecting drought propagation were carried out fig 11 a shows that the significant influence of ao on each factor is mainly concentrated on the scale of 1 2 years enso had no significant effect on pcd but had significant correlation with other factors in 2 7 years fig 11b which was consistent with the periodic variation of enso dash et al 2013 compared with ao and enso the influence of pdo on factors is mainly concentrated on the scale of 1 4 years showing a significant positive correlation between precipitation and soil moisture and a significant negative correlation between et rate and pcd fig 11c in addition the influence of pdo on the factors is mainly on the scale of 1993 2000 and 2006 2013 because at the end of the 20th century pdo changed from warm phase to cold phase while during the negative phase the precipitation intensity in southern china decreased significantly huang et al 2017a b lack of rainfall usually occurs in conjunction with cloud reduction associated with anticyclone circulation patterns resulting in a strong increase in net radiation under dry conditions and an increase in et rates teuling et al 2013 as a result soil moisture anomalies were magnified and drought was exacerbated meanwhile the precipitation in the prb is mainly affected by the east asian summer monsoon and the south asian summer monsoon zhao et al 2014a b because of the geographical pattern of the prb which is high in the north and low in the south and high in the west and low in the east this geographical pattern is conducive to the flow of water vapor to the mainland besides the increasing frequency of extreme precipitation in the prb is mainly affected by the negative phase of the pdo zhao et al 2014a b which increases the risk of flash drought and heat wave in the prb as the most significant interdecadal change signal in the north pacific pdo is the most important factor regulating the teleconnection between enso and climate in east asia chen et al 2013 especially in the 21st century the phase transformation and amplitude fluctuation of pdo and enso are obviously enhanced which intensifies the changes of meteorological elements such as temperature precipitation and evaporation chen and grasby 2014 thus the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the prb was accelerated 6 conclusion the gwsa dsi proposed in this paper is based on grace dsi which can effectively identify and capture groundwater drought in the prb the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought in the prb from 2002 to 2015 was 8 months through sliding in different time scales it was found that the time of drought propagation has a significant deceasing trend p 0 01 indicating that the water cycle in the prb was accelerating besides artificial exploitation of groundwater in the prb will aggravate the groundwater drought but it has no significant effect on the propagation time the et rate r 0 79 p 0 01 precipitation r 0 76 p 0 01 and soil moisture r 0 48 p 0 12 are the main factors affecting drought propagation increasing soil moisture accelerates the response of groundwater to precipitation in the surplus period due to the stored full runoff mechanism whilst intensifying et rate and heat wave facilitate the drought propagation in the deficit period compared with ao and enso pdo has more significant effects on temperature precipitation and et rate and is the main driving force affecting the drought propagation

6163,the propagation of meteorological drought in a complete water cycle is not limited to hydrological and agricultural droughts but also involves groundwater drought moreover the intensification of water cycle under the background of global warming may also affect the time of drought propagation therefore studying the dynamic propagation and possible influence factors from meteorological to groundwater drought is helpful to monitor and assess the risk of groundwater drought here we use terrestrial water storage anomalies observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites and simulated soil moisture and runoff variations from the global land data assimilation system to show that the groundwater storage anomalies in the pearl river basin prb the standardized precipitation index and drought severity index were used to characterize meteorological and groundwater drought respectively results indicated that 1 the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought in the prb during 2002 2015 was 8 months and that in spring and summer was shorter than that in autumn and winter 2 the time of drought propagation has a significant deceasing trend p 0 01 indicating that the water cycle in the prb was accelerating 3 increasing soil moisture accelerates the response of groundwater to precipitation in the surplus period due to the stored full runoff mechanism whilst intensifying evapotranspiration rate and heat wave facilitate the drought propagation in the deficit period 4 compared with arctic oscillation and el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation is the main driving force to accelerate drought propagation in the prb keywords groundwater drought meteorological drought drought propagation dynamic 1 introduction compared to other kinds of natural hazards the spatial extent of drought is extremely larger and its influencing time is commonly much longer thus the damages caused by drought are expected to be highly larger than other natural hazards mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2014a generally droughts are classified into four categories including meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 guo et al 2019a b another form of drought called groundwater drought when groundwater systems are affected by drought first groundwater recharge and later groundwater levels and groundwater discharge decrease such droughts are called groundwater droughts van lanen and peters 2000 furthermore meteorological and groundwater droughts are inter related through interactions that happen within the water cycle van loon and laaha 2015 however the earth s climate system is experiencing significant climate change which directly leads to changes in the hydrological cycle yoon et al 2015 han et al 2019 fang et al 2019a b this means that the propagation of groundwater systems to drought and their performance under drought conditions becomes increasingly important calow et al 1999 drought are mostly caused by periods of lower than average precipitation and propagation through the hydrological system peters et al 2006 when meteorological drought propagates to the groundwater system groundwater drought will not be detected as early as hydrological drought and agricultural drought inversely only when groundwater drought seriously affects human life it can arouse extensive attention more important extraction of groundwater will significantly affect the energy exchange between soil moisture and land atmosphere leading to the depletion of surface and groundwater resources and thus leading to secondary disasters zeng et al 2016 e g land subsidence soil salinization seawater intrusion and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity forkutsa et al 2009 park et al 2012 many studies involving various methods have analyzed groundwater drought and explored the relationship between the precipitation and groundwater level castle et al 2014 tallaksen et al 2006 bloomfield et al 2015 huang et al 2016 however drought is a multi scalar phenomenon with the effects of precipitation deficits meteorological drought becoming evident in various systems e g surface and groundwater hydrology vegetation activity and crop production at various temporal scale lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 meanwhile research on drought propagation focuses on meteorological to hydrological drought and seldom on meteorological to groundwater drought furthermore the propagated of meteorological drought in the water cycle is not limited to hydrological and agricultural droughts which is seldom noticed by people hence studying the dynamic propagation of meteorological to groundwater drought is not only a vital step in the field of hydrology but also an important practical significance for establishing an effective monitoring and early warning system of meteorological drought based on groundwater drought in addition the holistic regional groundwater assessments would be valuable in promoting environmental restoration and for hydrologic research but such assessments are difficult to generate on the basic of well surveys which are typically unsystematic rodell et al 2009 satellite observations of time variable gravity from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission present a new and valuable tool to fill these gaps in data availability and water monitoring tapley et al 2004 terrestrial water storage tws variations observed by grace include the combined contributions of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow ice and biomass rodell et al 2005 besides groundwater storage variations can be isolated from grace data given auxiliary information on the other components of tws from either in situ observations or land surface models rodell et al 2007 meanwhile tws estimates derived from the grace have been widely used to examine regional scale droughts worldwide hughes et al 2012 elmore et al 2010 in particular zhao et al 2017 developed a new drought severity index dsi based solely on grace tws based estimates compared to previous tws based drought studies the grace dsi is calculated without model assimilation and considers spatial and temporal variability of local hydro climatology however tws contains all water components on land when meteorological propagates to hydrology agriculture and groundwater drought grace dsi shows a superimposed drought signal based on this to remove its effect and thus isolate the groundwater storage anomalies gwsa we estimated the storage variations of soil moisture and runoff through the global land data assimilation system gldas then the gwsa are calculated by grace dsi and the groundwater drought index gwsa dsi is effectively obtained in general groundwater responds more slowly to meteorological conditions than the near surface components of the terrestrial water cycle changnon et al 1988 its residence time the ratio of quantity in storage to average rate of recharge or discharge ranges from months in shallow aquifers to a million or more years in deep desert aquifers sturchio et al 2004 however the standardized precipitation index spi can monitor both short term and long term drought effects and is comparable among different locations due to its probabilistic nature importantly the fundamental advantage of spi is that it can be computed for a variety of time scales soleimani motlagh et al 2017 hence it can be used as an effective tool for the propagation of meteorological to groundwater drought previous studies have shown that climate change has led to more frequent and severe extreme natural events liu et al 2016 2018 günter et al 2019 huang et al 2019 ren et al 2019 the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has indicated that the frequency intensity and duration of some climate extreme events will increase by the end of this century oliver 2013 huang et al 2014b in particular brutsaert 2012 found that the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and el niño southern oscillation enso affected groundwater storage in four desert regions of north america apurv et al 2017 found in the latest study that the inter annual variability of precipitation has a strong control over groundwater recharge and consumption due to climate change therefore teleconnection factors directly regional precipitation and indirectly also affect groundwater thus affecting the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought however how teleconnection factors affect drought propagation through influencing meteorological factors is unclear based on these it is particularly important to analyze the impact of teleconnection factors on the drought propagation it can not only reveal the main driving factors affecting the propagation time but also predict and evaluate the occurrence of regional drought events in advance the primary objectives of this study are 1 to capture and identify groundwater drought 2 to investigate the propagation time and dynamic change of meteorological to groundwater drought 3 to explore the possible influencing and driving factors on the propagation dynamics 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the prb 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n is located in south china with a drainage area of 4 537

meteorological drought index based on probability distribution of precipitation spi values are dimensionless and are computed by fitting a gamma distribution function to precipitation values during the time month period the spi can be adopted to indicate the precipitation conditions in a specific period in a long time series and shows the precipitation deficits corresponding to the period since the spi can capture the drought features at various time scales 1 3 6 9 12 24 48 months it has been broadly applied to investigate different aspects of droughts mckee et al 1993 here we have computed spi for the time scales of 1 12 month using the precipitation data sets gldas the spi can be calculated as follows 2 spi s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 t ln 1 h x 2 3 g x 1 β γ γ γ 0 0 x x γ

water cycle i e soil moisture storage smsa snow water equivalent storage swea and surface water reservoir storage resa were removed from twsa anomaly in any of the components was calculated by removing the mean value for the entire study period from the data value in the particular month the study region is not subjected to snow accumulation activities hence we have not considered snow water equivalents using a priori monitoring or model based estimates of resa and smsa the gwsa can be calculated as a residual from the disaggregation equation scanlon et al 2015 4 gwsa t w s a s m s a r e s a the dsi is a standardized drought severity index exclusively based on grace derived tws we have utilized monthly estimates of csr mascon solutions rl05m v01 of land water storage from grace to compute gwsa dsi following the algorithm provided in zhao et al 2017 5 gwsa d s i i j gws a i j gws a j σ j where i is year ranging from 2002 to 2015 j is month ranging from january to december and gws a j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of groundwater storage anomalies in month j respectively besides the gwsa dsi is a dimensionless quantity used to detect drought events table 1 detailed grading can be found in zhao et al 2017 3 3 cross wavelet transformation the cross wavelet transformation cwt is able to present the correlation between two time series in both time and frequency domains combined with the wavelet transformation and cross spectrum analysis hudgins and huang 1996 the cwt is often used to explore the correlations between two annual hydrological and climatic time series the cwt of two time series xn and yn can be expressed as w xy w x w y where denotes their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w xy the complex argument arg w xy is regarded as the local relative phase between xn and yn in time frequency field the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two times series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y torrence and compo 1998 is expressed as follows 6 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level corresponding to the probability p for a probability distribution function defined by the square root of the two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 identification and variation characteristics of groundwater drought in the prb fig 2 shows that the groundwater drought mainly occurred in 2003 2006 and 2009 2010 which matched the two severe droughts wang et al 2017 outbreaks in the prb during that period among the drought from 2003 to 2006 the gwsa dsi reached the lowest value 2 79 in july 2004 and its intensity and duration were particularly severe during this period most parts of southern china suffered the worst drought in 53 years drought has caused economic losses of more than 4 billion rmb more than 7 2 million people have difficulties in drinking water http news sina com cn c 2004 11 03 06294122595s shtml which indicate that the grace twsa and the gwsa calculated by us have applicability in drought identification in addition the reliability of the gwsa based on grace had been verified in many areas henry et al 2011 bhanja and mukherjee 2016 to further verify the reliability of the results we compared the annual groundwater resources in the prb with the annual average gwsa dsi based on its monthly series fig 3 and found that the correlation reached 0 51 p 0 08 although some short term drought events occurred after 2009 the amplitude of gwsa dsi increased significantly which is consistent with the trend of groundwater resources data provided by the ministry of water resources of china additionally as a nature link between soil atmosphere and water vegetation plays an indicator role in the studies of global change vegetation can reflect the state of nature environment most intuitively and clearly sato and tateishi 2004 soumendra et al 2019 used data from more than 15 000 groundwater observation wells in india to find that ndvi has a good correlation with groundwater level r 0 6 in natural vegetated areas we carried out a 11 month moving average of ndvi and gwsa dsi in the prb fig 4 and found that there was a signification positive correlation r 0 64 p 0 01 between them moreover during the two groundwater droughts ndvi decreased dramatically which further verifies the ability of gwsa dsi to identify and capture groundwater drought 4 2 the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought and its seasonality the various time scale of spi 1 month 2 month 24 month were obtained by calculating the monthly precipitation data of the prb from 1979 to 2015 we find that spi 8 and the gwsa dsi have a significant correlation r 0 56 p 0 01 in the 2002 2015 series fig 5 this is consistent with the response time of hydrological to meteorological drought in nanpan river basin belonging to the prb is for 6 months zhang et al 2014 because when meteorological drought propagates to groundwater drought it needs to pass through the soil layer and lags behind fig 5 shows that the gwsa dsi has captured multiple droughts in different degrees of which the duration and intensity of three groundwater droughts in 2004 2005 2006 2009 2010 are the most abnormal meteorological drought always occurs before groundwater drought the longer the spi continues to decline the more likely it will lead to more severe drought however the number of groundwater droughts with low intensity and short duration increased obviously after 2009 especially after 2011 there was no meteorological drought in the prb while the groundwater drought still occurred it shows that the influence of groundwater drought is not only a single factor of precipitation bhuiyan 2009 at the same time it also shows that the propagation time from meteorology to groundwater drought tends to be faster the correlation coefficients between the monthly gwsa dsi and spi series with various time scales in the prb is illustrated in fig 6 it can be easily seen from fig 6 that the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought in the prb has noticeably seasonal characteristics spring groundwater drought propagation time and spi 7 have the strongest correlation r 0 86 p 0 01 summer and autumn have significant correlation with spi 10 r 0 76 p 0 01 and spi 14 r 0 76 p 0 01 respectively compared with other seasons groundwater drought in december is significantly correlated with spi 17 r 0 83 p 0 01 indicating that the propagation time in spring and summer was shorter than that in autumn and winter table 2 this was consistent with the seasonal characteristics of meteorological propagation to hydrological drought huang et al 2017a b it should be noted that the gwsa dsi in december has a strong correlation p 0 01 with other scale spi fig 6 precipitation in the prb is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn which results in meteorological drought and groundwater drought mostly occurring in winter 4 3 dynamic propagation from meteorological to groundwater drought to further analyze the dynamic changes of the time from meteorology to groundwater drought propagation in the prb we slipped gwsa dsi on the scale of 3 years and 5 years and analyzed the correlation with spi series with various time scales fig 7 during the period of extreme groundwater drought from 2003 to 2006 and from 2009 to 2010 the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought corresponding to the three year sliding window was mainly concentrated in 7 14 months correlation was between 0 47 and 0 70 p 0 01 while the propagation time corresponding to the five year sliding window was mainly concentrated in 8 13 months correlation was between 0 39 and 0 56 p 0 01 in other periods the drought propagation time of the two windows mainly concentrated in 7 10 months correlation was between 0 40 and 0 54 p 0 01 therefore the change of drought propagation time corresponding to different sliding windows indicates that the time of meteorological to groundwater drought is dynamic more importantly the propagation time of both sliding downwards shows a decreasing trend fig 7 which further illustrates that the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought is accelerating which means that the time of monitoring and preventing drought is shortening which should be paid more attention to 4 4 the possible influencing factors of accelerating drought propagation in the prb to reveal the possible factors affecting the intensification of drought propagation in the prb fig 8 shows the relationship between the propagation time and meteorological and underlying surface factors under the sliding window for three years it is found that the evapotranspiration et rate r 0 79 p 0 01 and precipitation r 0 76 p 0 01 in meteorological factors and soil moisture r 0 48 p 0 12 in underlying surface factors are the most important factors affecting the intensification of drought propagation although soil moisture has not passed the 99 significance test as a medium of communication between precipitation and soil moisture the influence of meteorological factors on groundwater resources is realized by controlling the process of soil moisture seepage green et al 2011 therefore soil moisture should not be neglected when considering the propagation from meteorological to groundwater drought however in the process of accelerating the propagation of meteorology to groundwater drought in the prb the drought year 2003 2005 and 2009 2010 has a long propagation time fig 7 to consider the role of et rate precipitation and soil moisture in the process of propagation we divide it into dry and wet cases in surplus period precipitation and soil moisture increase et rate decrease soil moisture is in a relatively wet state the mechanism of stored full runoff in the study area will accelerate the rate of precipitation infiltration to recharge groundwater thus speeding up the response time of groundwater to precipitation as a result the propagation time is accelerated in deficit period precipitation and soil moisture decrease et rate increase when meteorological propagates to groundwater drought it will first cause the continuous loss of soil moisture and the increase of et rate will magnify the soil moisture anomaly and aggravate the drought situation teuling et al 2013 mo and lettenmaier 2015 at the same time the ndvi of the prb is relatively high and when precipitation cannot provide enough water vegetation will preferentially consume soil moisture resulting in further loss of soil moisture however the buffering effect of soil moisture in the process of drought propagation slows down the propagation time relative to the surplus period but the result is more serious groundwater drought 5 discussion 5 1 the effect of human factors on groundwater drought in many parts of the world groundwater has long been exploited as a resource for public water supply and irrigation furthermore free for all groundwater policies have resulted in water being pumped at far greater rates than can be replenished naturally famiglietti 2014 to consider the influence of groundwater extraction on groundwater drought and propagation in the prb we obtained the annual groundwater supply data of the prb from the ministry of water resources of china fig 9 a shows that the annual groundwater supply in the prb tends to decline especially after 2008 the continuous decline is due to the restriction of groundwater exploitation in some provinces and regions and the protection measures of groundwater resources such as sealing up self provided wells wang et al 2015 for comparison we calculated annual average gwsa dsi based on its monthly series and found that there was a significant negative correlation r 0 83 p 0 01 with groundwater supply fig 9b it shows that the artificial extraction of groundwater is an important factor to aggravate groundwater drought which is similar to the depletion of groundwater in northern india rodell et al 2009 and california valley famiglietti et al 2011 meanwhile it also explains why the groundwater drought in the prb has been alleviated after 2009 fig 5 in addition the correlation between groundwater supply and propagation time was 0 19 p 0 55 indicating that extraction of groundwater had no significant acceleration effect on drought propagation fig 9c because of the acceleration of meteorological propagation to groundwater drought groundwater exploitation cannot be considered solely further the meteorological and underlying surface elements precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture that connect precipitation and groundwater are the main factors fig 8 in general the artificial extraction of groundwater can significantly aggravate groundwater drought but the acceleration of the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought in the prb should be concerned with the factors of climate change and aggravation of water cycle 5 2 impact of intensified water cycle on drought propagation because similar to traditional droughts a change in groundwater drought is not only associated with the change in terrestrial hydrological cycle but also influenced by the change in terrestrial energy cycle and the related heatwaves as well as the interaction between the land and atmosphere dai 2013 under global warming the risk of heatwave is increasing meehl and tebaldi 2004 and the terrestrial hydrological cycle is also expected to be intensified with increasing water vapor feedback huntington 2006 leading to the changes in precipitation soil moisture and et as well as characteristics of climate extremes the concurrent drought and heatwave events with low soil moisture fig 10 e and high et are recently termed as flash drought yuan et al 2015 wang et al 2016 found that flash drought mainly occurred in south china with an average of 16 24 times per decade and the number of occurrences showed an upward trend although the temperature has been relatively lower in the whole series fig 10c this is because the global mean temperature remained flat during the first decade of the 21st century which is related to the intermittent period of global warming foster and rahmstorf 2011 however the decreasing temperature was compensated by the accelerated drying trends of soil moisture and enhanced et leading to an acceleration of flash droughts during the warming hiatus wang et al 2016 as a result more serious drought events tend to occur during this period in addition precipitation is another major factor that aggravates the propagation of drought when considering precipitation magnitude we further consider the precipitation concentration degree pcd prior to 2011 the higher pcd indicates that the annual precipitation distribution in the prb is uneven fig 10b at the same time relevant studies duan et al 2017 show that the extreme precipitation level and frequency in the prb have increased significantly since the 21st century in addition the increase of extreme high temperature events and the decrease of extreme low temperature events aggravate the water cycle in the basin and the response time of groundwater to meteorological drought hundecha and bárdossy 2005 gornall et al 2010 it is worth noting that after 2011 the increase of precipitation fig 10a lead to the decrease of et rate fig 10d however the decrease of pcd p 0 05 indicates that precipitation in the basin distributes evenly during the year which results in high humidity in the year and the accompanying high temperature further increases the risk of heat wave peterson et al 2013 in general the flash drought and heat wave events caused by global warming and the intensification of water cycle have further aggravated the propagation drought 5 3 the influence of teleconnection factors on dynamic propagation of drought to reveal how the atmospheric circulation anomaly affects the time of drought propagation cross wavelet analysis of the teleconnection factors and the main factors et rate precipitation pcd and soil moisture affecting drought propagation were carried out fig 11 a shows that the significant influence of ao on each factor is mainly concentrated on the scale of 1 2 years enso had no significant effect on pcd but had significant correlation with other factors in 2 7 years fig 11b which was consistent with the periodic variation of enso dash et al 2013 compared with ao and enso the influence of pdo on factors is mainly concentrated on the scale of 1 4 years showing a significant positive correlation between precipitation and soil moisture and a significant negative correlation between et rate and pcd fig 11c in addition the influence of pdo on the factors is mainly on the scale of 1993 2000 and 2006 2013 because at the end of the 20th century pdo changed from warm phase to cold phase while during the negative phase the precipitation intensity in southern china decreased significantly huang et al 2017a b lack of rainfall usually occurs in conjunction with cloud reduction associated with anticyclone circulation patterns resulting in a strong increase in net radiation under dry conditions and an increase in et rates teuling et al 2013 as a result soil moisture anomalies were magnified and drought was exacerbated meanwhile the precipitation in the prb is mainly affected by the east asian summer monsoon and the south asian summer monsoon zhao et al 2014a b because of the geographical pattern of the prb which is high in the north and low in the south and high in the west and low in the east this geographical pattern is conducive to the flow of water vapor to the mainland besides the increasing frequency of extreme precipitation in the prb is mainly affected by the negative phase of the pdo zhao et al 2014a b which increases the risk of flash drought and heat wave in the prb as the most significant interdecadal change signal in the north pacific pdo is the most important factor regulating the teleconnection between enso and climate in east asia chen et al 2013 especially in the 21st century the phase transformation and amplitude fluctuation of pdo and enso are obviously enhanced which intensifies the changes of meteorological elements such as temperature precipitation and evaporation chen and grasby 2014 thus the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the prb was accelerated 6 conclusion the gwsa dsi proposed in this paper is based on grace dsi which can effectively identify and capture groundwater drought in the prb the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought in the prb from 2002 to 2015 was 8 months through sliding in different time scales it was found that the time of drought propagation has a significant deceasing trend p 0 01 indicating that the water cycle in the prb was accelerating besides artificial exploitation of groundwater in the prb will aggravate the groundwater drought but it has no significant effect on the propagation time the et rate r 0 79 p 0 01 precipitation r 0 76 p 0 01 and soil moisture r 0 48 p 0 12 are the main factors affecting drought propagation increasing soil moisture accelerates the response of groundwater to precipitation in the surplus period due to the stored full runoff mechanism whilst intensifying et rate and heat wave facilitate the drought propagation in the deficit period compared with ao and enso pdo has more significant effects on temperature precipitation and et rate and is the main driving force affecting the drought propagation generally the findings of this study help to reveal the dynamic and influence factors of drought propagation thus being useful and valuable for local drought mitigation declaration of competing

6164,accurate and reliable water temperature forecasting models can help in environmental impact assessment as well as in effective fisheries management in river systems in this paper a hybrid model that couples discrete wavelet transforms wt and artificial neural networks ann is proposed for forecasting water temperature four mother wavelets including daubechies symlet discrete meyer and haar are considered to develop the wt ann hybrid model the hybrid model is applied to forecast daily water temperature on the warta river in poland time series of daily water temperatures in eight river gauges as well as daily air temperatures of seven meteorological stations are used for forecasting daily water temperature the performance of this wt ann hybrid model is evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from linear and non linear regression models as well as a traditional ann model the results show that the wt ann models perform well in simulating and forecasting river water temperature time series and outperform the linear non linear and traditional ann models the superior performance of the wt ann models is particularly observed for extreme weather conditions such as heat waves and drought among the four mother wavelets applied the discrete meyer performs the best slightly better than the daubechies at level 10 and symlet while the haar mother wavelet has the lowest accuracy in addition the model performance improves with an increase in the decomposition level indicating the importance of the choice of decomposition level the outcomes of this study have important implications for water temperature forecasting and ecosystem management of rivers keywords water temperature forecasting wavelet transform artificial neural networks regression model warta river 1 introduction the temperature of water in rivers is a good indicator of climate variability and change as well as an indicator of the control of processes occurring in river ecosystems and their services webb et al 2008 letcher et al 2016 it is an important abiotic factor that shapes optimal conditions for the existence and growth of organisms and preserves the ecological function of the watercourses caissie 2006 padilla et al 2015 letcher et al 2016 analysis of the thermal regime of rivers in various climatic and environmental conditions constitutes key information for the assessment of the ecological status of waters the temperature of water in rivers is shaped by the influence of the natural environment undergoing daily seasonal annual and decadal changes changes in water temperature are mainly in terms of surface heat exchange with the atmosphere as well as turbulent mixing of water of different temperatures caissie 2006 accurate and reliable water temperature forecasting models can help in environmental impact assessments as well as in effective fisheries management in river systems many studies on the relationships between water temperature and air temperature have been carried out for the evaluation of long term trends of their changes and the possibility of their predictions mohseni et al 1998 mohseni and stefan 1999 webb et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 webb and nobilis 2007 van vliet et al 2011 grbić et al 2013 johnson et al 2014 nury et al 2017 graf 2018 zhu et al 2018 2019a b such studies have applied simple linear and non linear regression models and more complex parametric and nonparametric methods st hilaire et al 2012 detenbeck et al 2016 interesting examples are the gaussian process regression models which are non parametric kernel based probabilistic models grbić et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 and the cross correlation function or granger s causality graf 2018 a majority of such studies have also reported high coefficients of determination 0 8 demonstrating high dependence of water temperature on air temperature pilgrim et al 1998 caissie et al 2001 webb et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 the traditional statistical time series methods such as linear and non linear regression models are simple to implement however they produce in general large modelling errors van vliet et al 2011 on the other hand the process based deterministic models are accurate however they are often complex and need a lot of information as model inputs such as river bathymetry a complete set of meteorological information air temperature solar radiation wind etc inflow and outflow conditions etc as a result application of such models for regions with limited data is impractical during the past two decades or so artificial neural networks ann have been gaining wider applications in forecasting time series including geophysical meteorological and hydrological time series most ann applications are used for forecasting in situations where there is an unknown relationship between the set of input factors and the outputs the ann model has become a valuable tool for modeling non linear hydrometeorological phenomena such as precipitation forecasting kuligowski and barros 1998 tokar and markus 2000 ramírez et al 2005 chiang et al 2007 aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 mandal and jothiprakash 2012 streamflow forecasting hsu et al 1995 sivakumar et al 2002 noori and kalin 2016 shiau and hsu 2016 prasad et al 2017 ground water level simulation coulibaly et al 2001 lallahem et al 2005 daliakopoulos et al 2005 nayak et al 2006 mohanty et al 2015 chang et al 2015 as well as river water temperature forecasting hadzima nyarko et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 2019a b piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 despite their merits and usefulness applications of the linear and non linear regression models as well as the traditional ann models for river water temperature modeling frequently have limitations especially in processing of non stationary data which most hydrological time series are tiwari and chatterjee 2010 adamowski and chan 2011 in this regard wavelet transform as a good pre processing method for non stationary data can be a potential complement for the traditional methods wavelet transform wt has been widely used to reveal information signal both over time and on a domain scale frequency it spreads the main time series into subcomponents which improves the decomposition of data used in forecasts and thus enables the capture of useful information at different levels of data resolution it is particularly useful during data and function analysis highlighting characteristic points and discontinuities of the input signal it has been extensively applied in hydrology such as rainfall runoff relations for karstic springs labat et al 2001 2005 scale dependent synthetic streamflow generation niu and sivakumar 2013 temporal patterns of precipitation niu 2013 roushangar et al 2018 variabilities of hydrological processes niu and chen 2016 sang et al 2018 and hydrological forecasting and regionalization maheswaran and khosa 2012 agarwal et al 2016 with the ability of anns and wt to perform different functions on time series many studies have developed hybrid wt ann models and applied such for forecasting time series in different fields such hybrid wt ann models have been shown to provide good performance in hydrological studies such as rainfall runoff modelling shoaib et al 2016 2019 streamflow forecasting kasiviswanathan et al 2016 partal 2016 peng et al 2017 yaseen et al 2018 and river water and groundwater level forecasting adamowski and chan 2011 seo et al 2015 barzegar et al 2017 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 among others several studies have also shown that the wt ann hybrid models perform better than some other widely used models for example peng et al 2017 applied empirical wavelet transform and artificial neural networks for streamflow forecasting and reported that the hybrid model can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series and thus provide more accurate forecasts than the traditional ann model adamowski and chan 2011 applied the wt ann model to predict groundwater level and stated that the wt ann model provided better forecasting accuracy than the conventional ann model similar results have also been reported by rajaee et al 2011 and seo et al 2016 these studies indicate that the wt ann hybrid models allow users to achieve forecasts with higher accuracies despite the fact that the wt ann models have found widespread applications in hydrology their applications for forecasting river water temperature rwt have been very limited to our knowledge the studies of piotrowski et al 2015 and zhu et al 2019b have been the only two thus far to apply the hybrid wt ann models for rwt prediction the study of piotrowski et al 2015 mainly focused on comparing various artificial neural network types for rwt simulation including multi layer perceptron product units adaptive network based fuzzy inference systems and wt ann zhu et al 2019b applied the wt ann models for rwt forecasting in the drava river croatia they used the daubechies at level 10 wavelet the results showed that the combination of wt and ann yields better models than the conventional forecasting models for rwt simulation since there are many mother wavelets within wt the choice of the most applicable one is of great importance to accurately forecast rwt this provided the motivation for the present study in this paper a hybrid model based on coupling discrete wt and ann for daily river water temperature forecasting was proposed compared with previous studies four widely used mother wavelets were evaluated for the first time for rwt forecasting daubechies db symlet sym discrete meyer dmey and haar one of the most widely used ann type namely the multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn was used here eight river gauges in the warta river in poland were studied with observation series covering a period of 22 to 27 years the performance of the hybrid model wt ann was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from linear and non linear regression models as well as a traditional ann model 2 methodology 2 1 linear and non linear regression models 2 1 1 linear regression model for linear regression models where one dependent variable exists water temperature is modelled with linear functions linear regression models provide a first order estimation of the sensitivity of water temperature to air temperature zhu et al 2018 this simple model is represented as 1 t w t a b t a ε t where tw t is water temperature for a given day t a and b are regression parameters and ε t is an error term ta is the smoothed air temperature which can be obtained by the air temperatures from the recent several days as follows 2 t a i 0 n t a t i λ i where λ0 to λn are the regression parameters in the present study air temperatures over the recent seven days were used 2 1 2 non linear regression model mohseni et al 1998 found a non linear relationship between water and air temperature they developed a non linear regression model for water temperature forecasting based on a logistic s shaped function the non linear regression model proposed by mohseni et al 1998 is given as 3 t w t μ α μ 1 e γ β t a where α is a coefficient which estimates the maximum water temperature μ is a coefficient which estimates the minimum water temperature β represents the air temperature at the inflexion point and γ represents the steepest slope of the logistic s shaped function 2 2 multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn artificial neural network models were inspired from the function of human brain and they have been widely used in various fields a neural network can be used to forecast future values based on past history the objective of developing an ann model is to transform the inputs into meaningful outputs the mlpnn is one of the most widely used ann types the mlpnn model consists of an input layer a single hidden layer and one output layer fig 1 the input signal are transmitted through the network in a forward direction and layer by layer the connections between neurons in different layers are supplied by adjusted weighting values each neuron is connected only with neurons in the subsequent layers and each neuron sums its inputs and later produces its output using a non linear activation function the goal of an mlpnn model is to develop a relationship of the form 4 y m f x n where xn is model input including variables x1 x2 xn and ym is model output including variables y1 y2 ym for rwt forecasting in this study xi is air temperature and yi is rwt in the mlpnn model used in this study the observed data were divided into three sets namely a training dataset a validation dataset and a testing dataset a trial and error method was used to determine the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used to train the mlpnn models because it is accurate and reliable adeloye and de munari 2006 adamowski and chan 2011 in the model calibration period the mean squared error was used to define the network error for each mlpnn model we repeated every calibration 30 times and used the mean squared error as the performance index to prevent overfitting early stopping method was used for each model as suggested by piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 one of the simplest methods of early stopping namely the generalization loss class prechlet 1998 rowinski and piotrowski 2008 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 was used which can help to terminate the training process when validation error exceeds its previously defined minimum value by 20 then the previously defined solution with the lowest objective function value for validation data set was considered as the optimal one in the present study the traditional mlpnn models used the original time series data of air temperature without transformation by wt as the model input to consider the time lags between air temperature and water temperature air temperature of the recent seven days were used as input data normalization is an important step for mlpnn models in this study all the variables were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance using the z score method olden et al 2004 zhu et al 2019a 5 x ni k x i k m k s dk where xni k is the normalized value of the variable k input or output for each sample i xi k is the original value of the variable k and mk and sdk are the mean value and standard deviation of the variable k 2 3 coupled wavelet transform and artificial neural networks wt ann model fig 1 presents the flow diagram of the steps involved in the combined wt ann model as mentioned earlier the mlpnn was selected in this study to represent the ann model the combination of wt and mlpnn was named wtmlpnn fig 1 the raw time series of daily average air temperatures were firstly transformed into approximation part a and several details d by wt as pre processing see below for further details about wt then the transformed forms of the raw time series of daily average air temperatures were fed into the ann model as model inputs wavelet transform has been widely applied for the analysis and de noising of signals and images wavelet transform deals with the expansion of functions based on the basis functions different from the classical fourier analysis wt expands functions in terms of wavelets rather than trigonometric polynomials which are produced with the form of translations and dilations using a fixed function namely the mother wavelet the raw time series is decomposed by the wavelet transformation into wavelets a scaled and shifted version of the mother wavelet robertson et al 1996 chaari et al 1996 compared with the fourier transform ft wt has the advantage of simultaneously obtaining information on the time location and frequency of a signal while the ft can only provide the frequency information of a signal daubechies 1990 the wt can be divided into two categories the continuous wavelet transform cwt and the discrete wavelet transform dwt compared with the classical cwt which requires a significant amount of computational time and data dwt needs less time and is easier to implement adamowski and chan 2011 demirel and anbarjafari 2011 nayak et al 2016 in this study the dwt was employed to decompose the original time series data of daily average air temperatures in the dwt digital filtering techniques are used to obtain a time scale signal the original time series is passed through high pass and low pass filters and detailed coefficients and approximation series are obtained with the wavelet algorithm gurley and kareem 1999 choices of the appropriate mother wavelet and the decomposition level are the two main issues in the applications of dwt sun and chang 2002 tascikaraoglu et al 2016 there are several types of mother wavelets in this study we used and compared four widely used mother wavelets daubechies db symlet sym discrete meyer dmey and haar these wavelets have been frequently employed in the literature nourani et al 2009 2011 chouakri et al 2011 adamowski and chan 2011 seo et al 2015 as for db in particular the daubechies at level 10 db10 wavelet has been widely used in the literature since its wavelet coefficients can capture the maximum amount of signal energy chouakri et al 2011 seo et al 2015 and was therefore used in this study as well the decomposition level can be determined using the method provided by nourani et al 2009 the method has also been applied in adamowski and chan 2011 and seo et al 2015 2016 for water level and river stage forecasting this log10 based method determines the decomposition level using the length of time series data and is given by 6 l int log p where l is the number of decomposition levels and p is the number of time series data to investigate the impact of the decomposition level on modeling performance we compared wavelets with different decomposition levels in this study the four mother wavelets db10 haar sym and dmey were used separately to decompose the original time series of daily air temperatures and the obtained approximation part a and several details d were fed into the mlpnn model as forecasters for rwt respectively the output results of the four mother wavelets db10 haar sym and dmey coupled with mlpnn were named as wtmlpnn1 wtmlpnn2 wtmlpnn3 and wtmlpnn4 respectively the wtmlpnn models were calibrated by the same algorithm levenberg marquardt algorithm as the traditional mlpnn models and used early stopping to avoid over fitting for each wtmlpnn model we repeated every calibration 30 times and used the mean squared error as the performance index 2 4 performance indices in this study model performance was evaluated using three indices the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae these three indices have been widely used in the literature to assess modeling performance morrill et al 2005 singh et al 2009 adamowski and chan 2011 the r2 measures the degree of correlation between the observed and modelled values and is given by 7 r 2 1 n o i o m m i m m 1 n i 1 n o i o m 2 1 n i 1 n m i m m 2 2 where n is the number of samples oi is the observed water temperature and mi is the predicted water temperature at time i om and mm are the average values of oi and mi the r2 values range from 0 0 to 1 0 with 1 0 indicating a perfect fit between the modelled values and the observed data the rmse indicates the discrepancy between the observed and modelled values and is given by 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i m i 2 a perfect fit would have an rmse value of 0 0 the mae measures the mean of all the individual errors and is given by 9 mae 1 n i 1 n m i o i 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the warta river in poland is 808 2 km long and is the largest tributary of the river oder which flows into the baltic sea fig 2 the warta river basin covers an area of 5 45 104 km2 which is about 17 4 the entire area of poland the main tributaries are noteć prosna ner and obra a majority of the region is lowland areas the northern part of the basin is dominated by low glacial lowland landscapes whereas in the southern part periglacial plains prevails in the north western part of the basin there are extensive forest complexes separated by agricultural areas while the middle part is typically agricultural with a small share of forests urban areas are also important components of the landscape with the largest urban areas being poznań łódź and częstochowa the warta river in the area of uniejów and poznań stations see fig 2 is under the strong influence of anthropopressure in uniejów the temperature of river waters is influenced by the operation of the jeziorsko dam reservoir in poznań a high urbanization index is registered which is manifested among others in increased pollution of river waters through uncontrolled inflow of sewage and sewage waters the warta river basin has a typical feature of the transitional climate with a significant share of oceanic climate features lower temperature amplitudes early spring and summer and relatively short winter in the northern and northwestern parts the impact of the maritime climate resulting from the impact of the baltic sea more cloudy lower air temperature amplitudes and cooler summer is increasingly visible in the eastern part of the basin the share of continental climate features higher amplitudes of air temperature longer and colder winter increases the average annual air temperature in the region ranges from about 8 3 c in the northeast to around 8 8 c in the south and south west poznań is one of the warmest places in this area and the entire region is one of the warmest in poland in terms of average annual air temperature the hottest month is july and the coldest is january the average monthly temperature in the region is below zero only in january and february from 0 0 to 1 0 c the summer months are characterized by a smaller range of temperature and july s average temperature can range from 15 0 c to over 23 5 c the warta river region like the whole of poland belongs to the regions where the last four decades have seen an increase in temperature in all seasons owczarek and filipiak 2016 3 2 data daily monitoring of the warta river water temperature is conducted by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imgw pib warsaw poland with eight river gauges across the region bobry sieradz and uniejów located in the upper course nowa wieś podgórna śrem and poznań middle course and skwierzyna and gorzów wielkopolski lower course fig 2 in the vicinity of the water gauge stations the imgw pib meteorological stations are located where the daily air temperatures are recorded data from these featured river gauges and meteorological stations were analyzed in this study the data considered cover a period of 22 to 27 hydrological years hydrological year in poland is november 1 to october 31 for each river gauge data sets were divided chronologically into training 4 9 validation 2 9 and testing 1 3 parts the paired river gauges and meteorological stations with training and testing periods are summarized in table 1 fig 3 presents the time series of daily rwt for the eight river gauges as seen rwt in the eight gauges generally is in the range of 0 0 25 c 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance for the eight study basin stations all the parameters for the linear and non linear regression models were fitted using least squares regression in excel in the ann models the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied between 10 and 13 for the eight studied gauges the performances of the different models in the training validation and testing periods for the eight stations in the warta river are summarized in table 2 linear regression model the linear model showed slight differences in performance for individual river stations in the training validation and testing periods the r2 values ranged from 0 883 uniejów to 0 924 sieradz in the testing periods higher values of r2 were obtained which confirms better performance of the model for this data series with the exception of skwierzyna and nowa wieś podgórna stations these two stations are located at warta s valleys with low impact of anthropopressure fig 4 for example presents a comparison of the observed and modelled daily water temperature for the linear first row for the testing period at the bobry station fig 4 also includes such a comparison for the other models used in this study for the bobry station see below for details as seen the linear regression model yielded many lower water temperature values tw 0 0 c in the winter period when air temperatures were relatively low below zero which is inconsistent with the observed data tw 0 0 c non linear regression model the non linear regression model based on the logistic s shaped function showed greater suitability for forecasting the warta river water temperature as compared to the linear model this is evidenced by the higher r2 values and lower rmse and mae values table 2 for the training validation and testing datasets for all the eight stations the nonlinear regression model reproduced the relationship between the air temperature and water temperature r2 0 914 0 957 better than what the linear model did r2 0 883 0 924 the lowest performance by the non linear model was observed for the uniejów station upper river and the poznań station middle river yielding lower r2 and higher rmse and mae values r2 0 914 0 920 rmse 1 823 2 144 c mae 1 458 1 650 c the non linear model in the testing periods showed an even better performance which is reflected by the significantly higher r2 and the decreased values of rmse and mae for most of the gauges fig 4 second row for example presents a comparison of the observed and modelled daily water temperature using the non linear model for the testing period at the bobry station as seen the matching between the observed and modelled values was better than that obtained with the linear regression model mlpnn model the mlpnn performed better than that of the non linear and linear regression models for each of the eight river stations the r2 values ranged from 0 947 for the gorzów wielkopolski station testing set to 0 969 for the sieradz station testing set table 2 generally the modelling results of mlpnn models are acceptable with the rmse and mae values ranging from 1 241 to 1 646 c and from 0 970 to 1 473 c in the testing period respectively fig 4 third row presents a comparison of the observed and modelled daily water temperature for the mlpnn for the testing period at the bobry station the matching between the observed and modelled values was slightly better than that obtained using the non linear regression model and much better than that obtained using the linear regression model wt ann hybrid models the hybrid models used in the forecasting of river water temperature time series showed a high similarity in the results for all the eight stations table 2 the results were definitely better than those obtained from the other models including the mlpnn as clearly shown in fig 5 with the boxplots of r2 rmse and mae higher r2 values and lower rmse and mae values comparing the hybrid and the traditional models both in terms of individual matching of observed versus modelled values through time series and scatter diagrams fig 4 and in terms of the overall performance measures through boxplots of r2 rmse and mae values fig 5 it can be concluded that the combination of wt and mlpnn yielded more accurate results than the conventional forecasting models used to forecast water temperature in the warta river the reason why the wt mlpnn combination performed better might be that the wt method provided useful decompositions of the original air temperature time series and the transformed data improved the performance of the mlpnn model by analyzing useful information on various decomposition levels see adamowski and chan 2011 for details although the above conclusion for the warta river cannot be generalized for all rivers and for all situations the outcomes are nevertheless certainly encouraging on the usefulness and effectiveness of the hybrid wt ann models for river water temperature forecasting wavelet transform allows for the transition from a time value system to a time scale frequency system which allows analysis of frequency change in the time domain the present results for the eight stations in the warta river have shown that the wtmlpnn4 model with dmey wavelet decomposition performed the best table 2 and fig 5 this model showed slightly better performance compared to the db wavelet i e daubechie at level 10 db10 whose wavelet coefficients can capture the maximum amount of signal energy seo et al 2015 compared with other wtmlpnn models the wtmlpnn2 models have the lowest accuracies and the modelling results of the wtmlpnn3 models are relatively acceptable table 2 and fig 5 it is relevant to note at this point the study of nourani et al 2011 on rainfall runoff forecasting nourani et al 2011 found that the haar and db mother wavelets outperformed sym they reasoned that since runoff time series peaks could be approximated as a single peaked event with varying durations the single peaked wavelets such as the haar might provide a good estimation of the sharp events contained in the runoff records however for rwt forecasting as is the case in the present study due to the diurnal variations of air and water temperature there are usually many peaked values with varying durations therefore the haar wavelet performed poorly and the dmey method performed well considering the hybrid models the best performance was seen for the sieradz station for which r2 in the testing period was in the range of 0 964 0 983 rmse in the range of 0 981 1 245 c and mae in the range of 0 781 0 984 c similarly a high degree of fit was demonstrated by the wtmlpnn models in the case of the śrem station in the testing period r2 0 956 0 987 rmse 1 008 1 338 c mae 0 893 1 049 c in the middle region of the warta river to investigate the impact of decomposition level on the performances of the wtmlpnn models wtmlpnn4 we considered two gauges bobry and sieradz as examples in this study the method of nourani et al 2009 was used this method has also been used in the past for water level forecasting and river stage forecasting in adamowski and chan 2011 and seo et al 2015 2016 and the results showed that the method is reliable in the present study application of this method yielded a decomposition level of 4 for the bobry and sieradz stations however to confirm this further we evaluated six decomposition levels for each station table 3 for both gauges model performances improved with an increase in the decomposition level table 3 indicating the importance of the choice of the decomposition level however improvements in model performances slowed down when the decomposition level was larger than 4 this suggested that using a decomposition level of 4 was enough for the wtmlpnn4 model to obtain considerable accuracy table 3 these results further supported the suitability and effectiveness of the method of nourani et al 2009 additionally a recent study by quilty and adamowski 2018 showed that an incorrect development of wavelet based forecasting models can occur during wavelet decomposition and as a result errors can be introduced into the forecast model inputs one of the main issues in this regard is an inappropriate selection of decomposition levels and wavelet filters quilty and adamowski 2018 which further indicated the importance of appropriate decomposition levels 4 2 model performance during the heat wave and summer drought of 2003 in europe in order to properly assess the effectiveness of the models in forecasting water temperature in extreme weather conditions the model performances were compared for two different periods that had extreme weather conditions across europe including poland 1 2000 2005 which corresponded to heat waves across europe and 2 the summer drought of 2003 fig 6 left presents the time series comparison of the observed and modelled river water temperatures for the period 2000 2005 when the traditional ann model mlpnn and a hybrid model wtmlpnn4 were used for three stations bobry upstream top panel śrem middle river run middle panel and gorzów wielkopolski downstream bottom panel the figure also includes the air temperature for a proper perspective on the relationship between air temperature and water temperature as seen the modelling results of the mlpnn fluctuate sharply compared with the observed data however the wtmlpnn4 model was more stable and accurate for each station indicating that with the coupling of wt the mlpnn model tended to be more robust and could better capture the seasonal thermal dynamics during heat wave events the validity of the mlpnn and wtmlpnn4 models for the three river stations was also tested specifically for the heat wave and drought of july and august 2003 fig 6 right the wtmlpnn4 model well reproduced the observed time series of water temperature and it clearly outperformed the traditional mlpnn model for each station the results further indicated that with the coupling of wt the mlpnn model was able to better capture the thermal dynamics during summer droughts 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid model wtmlpnn by coupling wavelet transform wt and multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn was developed to achieve better forecasts for water temperature in rivers the model was applied to data from eight stations in the warta river in poland four different wtmlpnn models were considered based on four different mother wavelets the performances of these models were compared with linear and non linear regression models as well as traditional mlpnn models the results lead to the following conclusions 1 the mlpnn models outperformed the linear and non linear regression models for the eight stations 2 the hybrid wtmlpnn models performed much better than the traditional mlpnn model in both normal and heat wave drought conditions 3 the wtmlpnn model with the discrete meyer dmey mother wavelet performed the best average r2 0 979 rmse 1 084 c mae 0 919 c slightly better than the daubechies level 10 db10 mother wavelet average r2 0 974 rmse 1 157 c mae 0 979 c and the symlet sym average r2 0 975 rmse 1 148 c mae 0 979 c the wtmlpnn model with the haar mother wavelet performed the worst average r2 0 967 rmse 1 246 c mae 1 029 c 4 model performances improved with an increase in the decomposition level in the wavelet transform indicating the importance of the choice of the decomposition level the results in this study provided further support to the applicability of the method of nourani et al 2009 to determine the optimum decomposition level the outcomes of the present study have important implications for research on forecasting the temperature of water in rivers especially from the viewpoint of coupling integrating wavelets and anns in particular and different time series data based methods more broadly though the hybrid wtmlpnn models performed well there is still scope for further improvements through additional studies firstly according to some previous studies flow discharge may play an important role on river water temperature forecasting especially in rivers impacted by snow or higher altitude hydropower reservoirs piccolroaz et al 2016 zhu et al 2019a however due to lack of complete data flow discharge was not considered in this study therefore in a future study we will further improve the hybrid models by including flow discharge as a model input for rivers with available flow discharge data secondly there are many other factors that influence river temperature as well e g irradiance shading water depth slope groundwater inputs and we have not considered all these factors in this study nevertheless our model showed good predictability in calibration and validation period using long term observed data and during model calibration and validation even when the above factors were not taken into consideration we intend to look into the other factors in our future research to further improve the model accuracy lastly though eight river gauges were assessed in the present study they were all in only one river therefore offering general conclusions on the effectiveness of the hybrid wtmlpnn models and the superiority of such over traditional models for any river around the world is not possible our future research will focus on further refining the coupling as well as application of the hybrid models to different rivers around the world to more properly test the suitability and effectiveness of the models for rivers characterized by different climatic hydrological and land use regimes credit authorship contribution statement renata graf

6164,accurate and reliable water temperature forecasting models can help in environmental impact assessment as well as in effective fisheries management in river systems in this paper a hybrid model that couples discrete wavelet transforms wt and artificial neural networks ann is proposed for forecasting water temperature four mother wavelets including daubechies symlet discrete meyer and haar are considered to develop the wt ann hybrid model the hybrid model is applied to forecast daily water temperature on the warta river in poland time series of daily water temperatures in eight river gauges as well as daily air temperatures of seven meteorological stations are used for forecasting daily water temperature the performance of this wt ann hybrid model is evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from linear and non linear regression models as well as a traditional ann model the results show that the wt ann models perform well in simulating and forecasting river water temperature time series and outperform the linear non linear and traditional ann models the superior performance of the wt ann models is particularly observed for extreme weather conditions such as heat waves and drought among the four mother wavelets applied the discrete meyer performs the best slightly better than the daubechies at level 10 and symlet while the haar mother wavelet has the lowest accuracy in addition the model performance improves with an increase in the decomposition level indicating the importance of the choice of decomposition level the outcomes of this study have important implications for water temperature forecasting and ecosystem management of rivers keywords water temperature forecasting wavelet transform artificial neural networks regression model warta river 1 introduction the temperature of water in rivers is a good indicator of climate variability and change as well as an indicator of the control of processes occurring in river ecosystems and their services webb et al 2008 letcher et al 2016 it is an important abiotic factor that shapes optimal conditions for the existence and growth of organisms and preserves the ecological function of the watercourses caissie 2006 padilla et al 2015 letcher et al 2016 analysis of the thermal regime of rivers in various climatic and environmental conditions constitutes key information for the assessment of the ecological status of waters the temperature of water in rivers is shaped by the influence of the natural environment undergoing daily seasonal annual and decadal changes changes in water temperature are mainly in terms of surface heat exchange with the atmosphere as well as turbulent mixing of water of different temperatures caissie 2006 accurate and reliable water temperature forecasting models can help in environmental impact assessments as well as in effective fisheries management in river systems many studies on the relationships between water temperature and air temperature have been carried out for the evaluation of long term trends of their changes and the possibility of their predictions mohseni et al 1998 mohseni and stefan 1999 webb et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 webb and nobilis 2007 van vliet et al 2011 grbić et al 2013 johnson et al 2014 nury et al 2017 graf 2018 zhu et al 2018 2019a b such studies have applied simple linear and non linear regression models and more complex parametric and nonparametric methods st hilaire et al 2012 detenbeck et al 2016 interesting examples are the gaussian process regression models which are non parametric kernel based probabilistic models grbić et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 and the cross correlation function or granger s causality graf 2018 a majority of such studies have also reported high coefficients of determination 0 8 demonstrating high dependence of water temperature on air temperature pilgrim et al 1998 caissie et al 2001 webb et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 the traditional statistical time series methods such as linear and non linear regression models are simple to implement however they produce in general large modelling errors van vliet et al 2011 on the other hand the process based deterministic models are accurate however they are often complex and need a lot of information as model inputs such as river bathymetry a complete set of meteorological information air temperature solar radiation wind etc inflow and outflow conditions etc as a result application of such models for regions with limited data is impractical during the past two decades or so artificial neural networks ann have been gaining wider applications in forecasting time series including geophysical meteorological and hydrological time series most ann applications are used for forecasting in situations where there is an unknown relationship between the set of input factors and the outputs the ann model has become a valuable tool for modeling non linear hydrometeorological phenomena such as precipitation forecasting kuligowski and barros 1998 tokar and markus 2000 ramírez et al 2005 chiang et al 2007 aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 mandal and jothiprakash 2012 streamflow forecasting hsu et al 1995 sivakumar et al 2002 noori and kalin 2016 shiau and hsu 2016 prasad et al 2017 ground water level simulation coulibaly et al 2001 lallahem et al 2005 daliakopoulos et al 2005 nayak et al 2006 mohanty et al 2015 chang et al 2015 as well as river water temperature forecasting hadzima nyarko et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 2019a b piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 despite their merits and usefulness applications of the linear and non linear regression models as well as the traditional ann models for river water temperature modeling frequently have limitations especially in processing of non stationary data which most hydrological time series are tiwari and chatterjee 2010 adamowski and chan 2011 in this regard wavelet transform as a good pre processing method for non stationary data can be a potential complement for the traditional methods wavelet transform wt has been widely used to reveal information signal both over time and on a domain scale frequency it spreads the main time series into subcomponents which improves the decomposition of data used in forecasts and thus enables the capture of useful information at different levels of data resolution it is particularly useful during data and function analysis highlighting characteristic points and discontinuities of the input signal it has been extensively applied in hydrology such as rainfall runoff relations for karstic springs labat et al 2001 2005 scale dependent synthetic streamflow generation niu and sivakumar 2013 temporal patterns of precipitation niu 2013 roushangar et al 2018 variabilities of hydrological processes niu and chen 2016 sang et al 2018 and hydrological forecasting and regionalization maheswaran and khosa 2012 agarwal et al 2016 with the ability of anns and wt to perform different functions on time series many studies have developed hybrid wt ann models and applied such for forecasting time series in different fields such hybrid wt ann models have been shown to provide good performance in hydrological studies such as rainfall runoff modelling shoaib et al 2016 2019 streamflow forecasting kasiviswanathan et al 2016 partal 2016 peng et al 2017 yaseen et al 2018 and river water and groundwater level forecasting adamowski and chan 2011 seo et al 2015 barzegar et al 2017 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 among others several studies have also shown that the wt ann hybrid models perform better than some other widely used models for example peng et al 2017 applied empirical wavelet transform and artificial neural networks for streamflow forecasting and reported that the hybrid model can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series and thus provide more accurate forecasts than the traditional ann model adamowski and chan 2011 applied the wt ann model to predict groundwater level and stated that the wt ann model provided better forecasting accuracy than the conventional ann model similar results have also been reported by rajaee et al 2011 and seo et al 2016 these studies indicate that the wt ann hybrid models allow users to achieve forecasts with higher accuracies despite the fact that the wt ann models have found widespread applications in hydrology their applications for forecasting river water temperature rwt have been very limited to our knowledge the studies of piotrowski et al 2015 and zhu et al 2019b have been the only two thus far to apply the hybrid wt ann models for rwt prediction the study of piotrowski et al 2015 mainly focused on comparing various artificial neural network types for rwt simulation including multi layer perceptron product units adaptive network based fuzzy inference systems and wt ann zhu et al 2019b applied the wt ann models for rwt forecasting in the drava river croatia they used the daubechies at level 10 wavelet the results showed that the combination of wt and ann yields better models than the conventional forecasting models for rwt simulation since there are many mother wavelets within wt the choice of the most applicable one is of great importance to accurately forecast rwt this provided the motivation for the present study in this paper a hybrid model based on coupling discrete wt and ann for daily river water temperature forecasting was proposed compared with previous studies four widely used mother wavelets were evaluated for the first time for rwt forecasting daubechies db symlet sym discrete meyer dmey and haar one of the most widely used ann type namely the multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn was used here eight river gauges in the warta river in poland were studied with observation series covering a period of 22 to 27 years the performance of the hybrid model wt ann was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from linear and non linear regression models as well as a traditional ann model 2 methodology 2 1 linear and non linear regression models 2 1 1 linear regression model for linear regression models where one dependent variable exists water temperature is modelled with linear functions linear regression models provide a first order estimation of the sensitivity of water temperature to air temperature zhu et al 2018 this simple model is represented as 1 t w t a b t a ε t where tw t is water temperature for a given day t a and b are regression parameters and ε t is an error term ta is the smoothed air temperature which can be obtained by the air temperatures from the recent several days as follows 2 t a i 0 n t a t i λ i where λ0 to λn are the regression parameters in the present study air temperatures over the recent seven days were used 2 1 2 non linear regression model mohseni et al 1998 found a non linear relationship between water and air temperature they developed a non linear regression model for water temperature forecasting based on a logistic s shaped function the non linear regression model proposed by mohseni et al 1998 is given as 3 t w t μ α μ 1 e γ β t a where α is a coefficient which estimates the maximum water temperature μ is a coefficient which estimates the minimum water temperature β represents the air temperature at the inflexion point and γ represents the steepest slope of the logistic s shaped function 2 2 multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn artificial neural network models were inspired from the function of human brain and they have been widely used in various fields a neural network can be used to forecast future values based on past history the objective of developing an ann model is to transform the inputs into meaningful outputs the mlpnn is one of the most widely used ann types the mlpnn model consists of an input layer a single hidden layer and one output layer fig 1 the input signal are transmitted through the network in a forward direction and layer by layer the connections between neurons in different layers are supplied by adjusted weighting values each neuron is connected only with neurons in the subsequent layers and each neuron sums its inputs and later produces its output using a non linear activation function the goal of an mlpnn model is to develop a relationship of the form 4 y m f x n where xn is model input including variables x1 x2 xn and ym is model output including variables y1 y2 ym for rwt forecasting in this study xi is air temperature and yi is rwt in the mlpnn model used in this study the observed data were divided into three sets namely a training dataset a validation dataset and a testing dataset a trial and error method was used to determine the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used to train the mlpnn models because it is accurate and reliable adeloye and de munari 2006 adamowski and chan 2011 in the model calibration period the mean squared error was used to define the network error for each mlpnn model we repeated every calibration 30 times and used the mean squared error as the performance index to prevent overfitting early stopping method was used for each model as suggested by piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 one of the simplest methods of early stopping namely the generalization loss class prechlet 1998 rowinski and piotrowski 2008 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 was used which can help to terminate the training process when validation error exceeds its previously defined minimum value by 20 then the previously defined solution with the lowest objective function value for validation data set was considered as the optimal one in the present study the traditional mlpnn models used the original time series data of air temperature without transformation by wt as the model input to consider the time lags between air temperature and water temperature air temperature of the recent seven days were used as input data normalization is an important step for mlpnn models in this study all the variables were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance using the z score method olden et al 2004 zhu et al 2019a 5 x ni k x i k m k s dk where xni k is the normalized value of the variable k input or output for each sample i xi k is the original value of the variable k and mk and sdk are the mean value and standard deviation of the variable k 2 3 coupled wavelet transform and artificial neural networks wt ann model fig 1 presents the flow diagram of the steps involved in the combined wt ann model as mentioned earlier the mlpnn was selected in this study to represent the ann model the combination of wt and mlpnn was named wtmlpnn fig 1 the raw time series of daily average air temperatures were firstly transformed into approximation part a and several details d by wt as pre processing see below for further details about wt then the transformed forms of the raw time series of daily average air temperatures were fed into the ann model as model inputs wavelet transform has been widely applied for the analysis and de noising of signals and images wavelet transform deals with the expansion of functions based on the basis functions different from the classical fourier analysis wt expands functions in terms of wavelets rather than trigonometric polynomials which are produced with the form of translations and dilations using a fixed function namely the mother wavelet the raw time series is decomposed by the wavelet transformation into wavelets a scaled and shifted version of the mother wavelet robertson et al 1996 chaari et al 1996 compared with the fourier transform ft wt has the advantage of simultaneously obtaining information on the time location and frequency of a signal while the ft can only provide the frequency information of a signal daubechies 1990 the wt can be divided into two categories the continuous wavelet transform cwt and the discrete wavelet transform dwt compared with the classical cwt which requires a significant amount of computational time and data dwt needs less time and is easier to implement adamowski and chan 2011 demirel and anbarjafari 2011 nayak et al 2016 in this study the dwt was employed to decompose the original time series data of daily average air temperatures in the dwt digital filtering techniques are used to obtain a time scale signal the original time series is passed through high pass and low pass filters and detailed coefficients and approximation series are obtained with the wavelet algorithm gurley and kareem 1999 choices of the appropriate mother wavelet and the decomposition level are the two main issues in the applications of dwt sun and chang 2002 tascikaraoglu et al 2016 there are several types of mother wavelets in this study we used and compared four widely used mother wavelets daubechies db symlet sym discrete meyer dmey and haar these wavelets have been frequently employed in the literature nourani et al 2009 2011 chouakri et al 2011 adamowski and chan 2011 seo et al 2015 as for db in particular the daubechies at level 10 db10 wavelet has been widely used in the literature since its wavelet coefficients can capture the maximum amount of signal energy chouakri et al 2011 seo et al 2015 and was therefore used in this study as well the decomposition level can be determined using the method provided by nourani et al 2009 the method has also been applied in adamowski and chan 2011 and seo et al 2015 2016 for water level and river stage forecasting this log10 based method determines the decomposition level using the length of time series data and is given by 6 l int log p where l is the number of decomposition levels and p is the number of time series data to investigate the impact of the decomposition level on modeling performance we compared wavelets with different decomposition levels in this study the four mother wavelets db10 haar sym and dmey were used separately to decompose the original time series of daily air temperatures and the obtained approximation part a and several details d were fed into the mlpnn model as forecasters for rwt respectively the output results of the four mother wavelets db10 haar sym and dmey coupled with mlpnn were named as wtmlpnn1 wtmlpnn2 wtmlpnn3 and wtmlpnn4 respectively the wtmlpnn models were calibrated by the same algorithm levenberg marquardt algorithm as the traditional mlpnn models and used early stopping to avoid over fitting for each wtmlpnn model we repeated every calibration 30 times and used the mean squared error as the performance index 2 4 performance indices in this study model performance was evaluated using three indices the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae these three indices have been widely used in the literature to assess modeling performance morrill et al 2005 singh et al 2009 adamowski and chan 2011 the r2 measures the degree of correlation between the observed and modelled values and is given by 7 r 2 1 n o i o m m i m m 1 n i 1 n o i o m 2 1 n i 1 n m i m m 2 2 where n is the number of samples oi is the observed water temperature and mi is the predicted water temperature at time i om and mm are the average values of oi and mi the r2 values range from 0 0 to 1 0 with 1 0 indicating a perfect fit between the modelled values and the observed data the rmse indicates the discrepancy between the observed and modelled values and is given by 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i m i 2 a perfect fit would have an rmse value of 0 0 the mae measures the mean of all the individual errors and is given by 9 mae 1 n i 1 n m i o i 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the warta river in poland is 808 2 km long and is the largest tributary of the river oder which flows into the baltic sea fig 2 the warta river basin covers an area of 5 45 104 km2 which is about 17 4 the entire area of poland the main tributaries are noteć prosna ner and obra a majority of the region is lowland areas the northern part of the basin is dominated by low glacial lowland landscapes whereas in the southern part periglacial plains prevails in the north western part of the basin there are extensive forest complexes separated by agricultural areas while the middle part is typically agricultural with a small share of forests urban areas are also important components of the landscape with the largest urban areas being poznań łódź and częstochowa the warta river in the area of uniejów and poznań stations see fig 2 is under the strong influence of anthropopressure in uniejów the temperature of river waters is influenced by the operation of the jeziorsko dam reservoir in poznań a high urbanization index is registered which is manifested among others in increased pollution of river waters through uncontrolled inflow of sewage and sewage waters the warta river basin has a typical feature of the transitional climate with a significant share of oceanic climate features lower temperature amplitudes early spring and summer and relatively short winter in the northern and northwestern parts the impact of the maritime climate resulting from the impact of the baltic sea more cloudy lower air temperature amplitudes and cooler summer is increasingly visible in the eastern part of the basin the share of continental climate features higher amplitudes of air temperature longer and colder winter increases the average annual air temperature in the region ranges from about 8 3 c in the northeast to around 8 8 c in the south and south west poznań is one of the warmest places in this area and the entire region is one of the warmest in poland in terms of average annual air temperature the hottest month is july and the coldest is january the average monthly temperature in the region is below zero only in january and february from 0 0 to 1 0 c the summer months are characterized by a smaller range of temperature and july s average temperature can range from 15 0 c to over 23 5 c the warta river region like the whole of poland belongs to the regions where the last four decades have seen an increase in temperature in all seasons owczarek and filipiak 2016 3 2 data daily monitoring of the warta river water temperature is conducted by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imgw pib warsaw poland with eight river gauges across the region bobry sieradz and uniejów located in the upper course nowa wieś podgórna śrem and poznań middle course and skwierzyna and gorzów wielkopolski lower course fig 2 in the vicinity of the water gauge stations the imgw pib meteorological stations are located where the daily air temperatures are recorded data from these featured river gauges and meteorological stations were analyzed in this study the data considered cover a period of 22 to 27 hydrological years hydrological year in poland is november 1 to october 31 for each river gauge data sets were divided chronologically into training 4 9 validation 2 9 and testing 1 3 parts the paired river gauges and meteorological stations with training and testing periods are summarized in table 1 fig 3 presents the time series of daily rwt for the eight river gauges as seen rwt in the eight gauges generally is in the range of 0 0 25 c 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance for the eight study basin stations all the parameters for the linear and non linear regression models were fitted using least squares regression in excel in the ann models the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied between 10 and 13 for the eight studied gauges the performances of the different models in the training validation and testing periods for the eight stations in the warta river are summarized in table 2 linear regression model the linear model showed slight differences in performance for individual river stations in the training validation and testing periods the r2 values ranged from 0 883 uniejów to 0 924 sieradz in the testing periods higher values of r2 were obtained which confirms better performance of the model for this data series with the exception of skwierzyna and nowa wieś podgórna stations these two stations are located at warta s valleys with low impact of anthropopressure fig 4 for example presents a comparison of the observed and modelled daily water temperature for the linear first row for the testing period at the bobry station fig 4 also includes such a comparison for the other models used in this study for the bobry station see below for details as seen the linear regression model yielded many lower water temperature values tw 0 0 c in the winter period when air temperatures were relatively low below zero which is inconsistent with the observed data tw 0 0 c non linear regression model the non linear regression model based on the logistic s shaped function showed greater suitability for forecasting the warta river water temperature as compared to the linear model this is evidenced by the higher r2 values and lower rmse and mae values table 2 for the training validation and testing datasets for all the eight stations the nonlinear regression model reproduced the relationship between the air temperature and water temperature r2 0 914 0 957 better than what the linear model did r2 0 883 0 924 the lowest performance by the non linear model was observed for the uniejów station upper river and the poznań station middle river yielding lower r2 and higher rmse and mae values r2 0 914 0 920 rmse 1 823 2 144 c mae 1 458 1 650 c the non linear model in the testing periods showed an even better performance which is reflected by the significantly higher r2 and the decreased values of rmse and mae for most of the gauges fig 4 second row for example presents a comparison of the observed and modelled daily water temperature using the non linear model for the testing period at the bobry station as seen the matching between the observed and modelled values was better than that obtained with the linear regression model mlpnn model the mlpnn performed better than that of the non linear and linear regression models for each of the eight river stations the r2 values ranged from 0 947 for the gorzów wielkopolski station testing set to 0 969 for the sieradz station testing set table 2 generally the modelling results of mlpnn models are acceptable with the rmse and mae values ranging from 1 241 to 1 646 c and from 0 970 to 1 473 c in the testing period respectively fig 4 third row presents a comparison of the observed and modelled daily water temperature for the mlpnn for the testing period at the bobry station the matching between the observed and modelled values was slightly better than that obtained using the non linear regression model and much better than that obtained using the linear regression model wt ann hybrid models the hybrid models used in the forecasting of river water temperature time series showed a high similarity in the results for all the eight stations table 2 the results were definitely better than those obtained from the other models including the mlpnn as clearly shown in fig 5 with the boxplots of r2 rmse and mae higher r2 values and lower rmse and mae values comparing the hybrid and the traditional models both in terms of individual matching of observed versus modelled values through time series and scatter diagrams fig 4 and in terms of the overall performance measures through boxplots of r2 rmse and mae values fig 5 it can be concluded that the combination of wt and mlpnn yielded more accurate results than the conventional forecasting models used to forecast water temperature in the warta river the reason why the wt mlpnn combination performed better might be that the wt method provided useful decompositions of the original air temperature time series and the transformed data improved the performance of the mlpnn model by analyzing useful information on various decomposition levels see adamowski and chan 2011 for details although the above conclusion for the warta river cannot be generalized for all rivers and for all situations the outcomes are nevertheless certainly encouraging on the usefulness and effectiveness of the hybrid wt ann models for river water temperature forecasting wavelet transform allows for the transition from a time value system to a time scale frequency system which allows analysis of frequency change in the time domain the present results for the eight stations in the warta river have shown that the wtmlpnn4 model with dmey wavelet decomposition performed the best table 2 and fig 5 this model showed slightly better performance compared to the db wavelet i e daubechie at level 10 db10 whose wavelet coefficients can capture the maximum amount of signal energy seo et al 2015 compared with other wtmlpnn models the wtmlpnn2 models have the lowest accuracies and the modelling results of the wtmlpnn3 models are relatively acceptable table 2 and fig 5 it is relevant to note at this point the study of nourani et al 2011 on rainfall runoff forecasting nourani et al 2011 found that the haar and db mother wavelets outperformed sym they reasoned that since runoff time series peaks could be approximated as a single peaked event with varying durations the single peaked wavelets such as the haar might provide a good estimation of the sharp events contained in the runoff records however for rwt forecasting as is the case in the present study due to the diurnal variations of air and water temperature there are usually many peaked values with varying durations therefore the haar wavelet performed poorly and the dmey method performed well considering the hybrid models the best performance was seen for the sieradz station for which r2 in the testing period was in the range of 0 964 0 983 rmse in the range of 0 981 1 245 c and mae in the range of 0 781 0 984 c similarly a high degree of fit was demonstrated by the wtmlpnn models in the case of the śrem station in the testing period r2 0 956 0 987 rmse 1 008 1 338 c mae 0 893 1 049 c in the middle region of the warta river to investigate the impact of decomposition level on the performances of the wtmlpnn models wtmlpnn4 we considered two gauges bobry and sieradz as examples in this study the method of nourani et al 2009 was used this method has also been used in the past for water level forecasting and river stage forecasting in adamowski and chan 2011 and seo et al 2015 2016 and the results showed that the method is reliable in the present study application of this method yielded a decomposition level of 4 for the bobry and sieradz stations however to confirm this further we evaluated six decomposition levels for each station table 3 for both gauges model performances improved with an increase in the decomposition level table 3 indicating the importance of the choice of the decomposition level however improvements in model performances slowed down when the decomposition level was larger than 4 this suggested that using a decomposition level of 4 was enough for the wtmlpnn4 model to obtain considerable accuracy table 3 these results further supported the suitability and effectiveness of the method of nourani et al 2009 additionally a recent study by quilty and adamowski 2018 showed that an incorrect development of wavelet based forecasting models can occur during wavelet decomposition and as a result errors can be introduced into the forecast model inputs one of the main issues in this regard is an inappropriate selection of decomposition levels and wavelet filters quilty and adamowski 2018 which further indicated the importance of appropriate decomposition levels 4 2 model performance during the heat wave and summer drought of 2003 in europe in order to properly assess the effectiveness of the models in forecasting water temperature in extreme weather conditions the model performances were compared for two different periods that had extreme weather conditions across europe including poland 1 2000 2005 which corresponded to heat waves across europe and 2 the summer drought of 2003 fig 6 left presents the time series comparison of the observed and modelled river water temperatures for the period 2000 2005 when the traditional ann model mlpnn and a hybrid model wtmlpnn4 were used for three stations bobry upstream top panel śrem middle river run middle panel and gorzów wielkopolski downstream bottom panel the figure also includes the air temperature for a proper perspective on the relationship between air temperature and water temperature as seen the modelling results of the mlpnn fluctuate sharply compared with the observed data however the wtmlpnn4 model was more stable and accurate for each station indicating that with the coupling of wt the mlpnn model tended to be more robust and could better capture the seasonal thermal dynamics during heat wave events the validity of the mlpnn and wtmlpnn4 models for the three river stations was also tested specifically for the heat wave and drought of july and august 2003 fig 6 right the wtmlpnn4 model well reproduced the observed time series of water temperature and it clearly outperformed the traditional mlpnn model for each station the results further indicated that with the coupling of wt the mlpnn model was able to better capture the thermal dynamics during summer droughts 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid model wtmlpnn by coupling wavelet transform wt and multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn was developed to achieve better forecasts for water temperature in rivers the model was applied to data from eight stations in the warta river in poland four different wtmlpnn models were considered based on four different mother wavelets the performances of these models were compared with linear and non linear regression models as well as traditional mlpnn models the results lead to the following conclusions 1 the mlpnn models outperformed the linear and non linear regression models for the eight stations 2 the hybrid wtmlpnn models performed much better than the traditional mlpnn model in both normal and heat wave drought conditions 3 the wtmlpnn model with the discrete meyer dmey mother wavelet performed the best average r2 0 979 rmse 1 084 c mae 0 919 c slightly better than the daubechies level 10 db10 mother wavelet average r2 0 974 rmse 1 157 c mae 0 979 c and the symlet sym average r2 0 975 rmse 1 148 c mae 0 979 c the wtmlpnn model with the haar mother wavelet performed the worst average r2 0 967 rmse 1 246 c mae 1 029 c 4 model performances improved with an increase in the decomposition level in the wavelet transform indicating the importance of the choice of the decomposition level the results in this study provided further support to the applicability of the method of nourani et al 2009 to determine the optimum decomposition level the outcomes of the present study have important implications for research on forecasting the temperature of water in rivers especially from the viewpoint of coupling integrating wavelets and anns in particular and different time series data based methods more broadly though the hybrid wtmlpnn models performed well there is still scope for further improvements through additional studies firstly according to some previous studies flow discharge may play an important role on river water temperature forecasting especially in rivers impacted by snow or higher altitude hydropower reservoirs piccolroaz et al 2016 zhu et al 2019a however due to lack of complete data flow discharge was not considered in this study therefore in a future study we will further improve the hybrid models by including flow discharge as a model input for rivers with available flow discharge data secondly there are many other factors that influence river temperature as well e g irradiance shading water depth slope groundwater inputs and we have not considered all these factors in this study nevertheless our model showed good predictability in calibration and validation period using long term observed data and during model calibration and validation even when the above factors were not taken into consideration we intend to look into the other factors in our future research to further improve the model accuracy lastly though eight river gauges were assessed in the present study they were all in only one river therefore offering general conclusions on the effectiveness of the hybrid wtmlpnn models and the superiority of such over traditional models for any river around the world is not possible our future research will focus on further refining the coupling as well as application of the hybrid models to different rivers around the world to more properly test the suitability and effectiveness of the models for rivers characterized by different climatic hydrological and land use regimes credit authorship contribution statement renata graf
