1280,the effectiveness of most in situ remedial technologies including nanoremediation lies on successful delivery of reagents to a subsurface target treatment zone targeted delivery of engineered nanoparticles nps to treat petroleum hydrocarbons present in the unsaturated zone requires an understanding of their transport behaviour in these systems a series of column experiments explored the effect of initial water saturation flowrate input dosage and porous medium texture on the transport of iron oxide or cobalt ferrite nps coated with an amphiphilic co polymer as well as their targeted attachment to a crude oil zone as the initial water content increased with a concomitant reduction in air saturation the degree of tailing present in the np breakthrough curves btcs reduced and the mass of nps recovered increased air saturation is positively correlated with the magnitude of air water interfaces which provide additional np retention sites at a lower injection flow rate np retention increased due to a longer residence time and comparatively high air saturation np transport behaviour was not sensitive to np injection dose over the range tested increased retention and retardation of the np btc was observed in sediments with a higher clay and silt content nps coated with a lower concentration of a pluronic block co polymer to promote binding were preferentially retained within the crude oil zone to simulate the asymmetrical np breakthrough curves observed from the unsaturated systems required the use of a model that accounted for both mobile and immobile flow regions as well as np attachment and detachment with nonlinear langmuirian blocking this model allowed examination of attachment and detachment rate coefficients which captured np interaction with the porous medium and or crude oil it was found that the initial water saturation and flow rate did not have an appreciable impact on the np attachment rate coefficient while it increased by 10 with increasing clay and silt content and by 100 in the presence of crude oil indicating preferential np attachment within the crude oil zone as a result of the lower np polymer concentration coating used to promote increased attachment to crude oil higher retention was observed near the column inlet and was captured quantitatively by adding a depth dependent straining term to the model this retention behaviour represents a combination of irreversible attachment at the air water interfaces and straining near the column inlet enhanced by the formation of np aggregates the detachment rate coefficient decreased with a lower initial water saturation and flowrate but increased with higher clay and silt content the findings from this study contribute to our understanding of the transport and binding behaviour of pluronic coated nps in unsaturated conditions and in particular the role of initial water content flowrate and porous medium texture demonstrated delivery of nps to a target zone is an important step towards expanding the utility of nps as treatment reagents keywords nanoparticles unsaturated porous media targeted binding modeling column experiments crude oil 1 introduction soil and groundwater contamination by light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls such as gasoline and crude oil can be detrimental to the environment and human health labud et al 2007 following a near surface release a lnapl will migrate downward through the unsaturated zone where some of the mass is retained largely due to capillary forces brown et al 2017 since this immobile lnapl mass represents a long term contaminant source in situ treatment methods that are able to effectively target this mass would be valuable to remediation practitioners kuppusamy et al 2016 schrick et al 2004 environmental remediation has been transformed over the past two decades by the integration of engineered nanoscale materials which have been used to treat water soil and air linley and thomson 2021 nanoremediation methods benefit from the high reactive surface area provided by nano size particles which offer enhanced interactions with target contaminants molnar et al 2016 o carroll et al 2013 schrick et al 2004 tratnyek and johnson 2006 and have the potential to minimize clean up cost and time relative to more traditional technologies tosco et al 2014 tratnyek and johnson 2006 nanomaterials such as metal oxides carbon nanotubes and bimetallic nanoparticles have been explored for the treatment of a variety of contaminants including heavy metals chlorinated compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls karn et al 2009 a major challenge for nanoremediation methods is to ensure efficient delivery of the nanoparticles nps throughout the target treatment zone while at the same time avoiding migration of the nps beyond this zone bishop et al 2010 elliott and zhang 2001 one effective strategy to minimize this issue is targeted delivery in which specific np coating materials such as polymers and surfactants are used to ensure both np mobility in the porous medium and binding to a target napl bishop et al 2010 linley et al 2019 by taking advantage of this capability the accumulation of nps within the target treatment zone increases with a concomitant decrease in the mass of nps required to achieve treatment goals bishop et al 2010 consequently treatment efficiency may be increased and the environmental risk of unwanted np migration and deposition beyond the target treatment zone can be reduced this targeted delivery concept mimics the injection of functionalized nanoparticles carrying therapeutic payloads into the human body to target specific receptors on tumors diseased cells or tissues davis et al 2008 targeted binding of nps to a napl source zone present in porous media has been investigated with some success through various modifications of the coating material bishop et al 2010 phenrat et al 2011 quinn et al 2005 sridevi and lakshmi 2013 the concept of targeted binding of nps to a napl interface was first demonstrated by saleh et al 2005 using a triblock copolymer coating around an iron np core quinn et al 2005 demonstrated enhanced partitioning of surfactant stabilized nonionic sorbitan triolate span 85 nano zero valent iron nzvi particles to napl in a field scale investigation while saleh et al 2007 used amphiphilic copolymer nps with a high hydrophobe hydrophile ratio for targeted binding at napl water interfaces a similar approach was evaluated by phenrat et al 2011 who reported improved targeted binding of copolymer coated nzvi particles to a napl recently we reported successful targeted binding of engineered iron oxide core nps towards napl impacted sand under saturated conditions linley et al 2019 linley et al 2020a 2020b this targeted binding was achieved by adding a copolymer coating to the surface of iron oxide nps which promoted hydrophobic interactions with a target napl crude oil as well as stability in an aqueous solution the hydrophobicity and stability of the nps were found to be proportional to the polymer structure and concentration nanoparticle attachment in oil impacted sand was found to increase when using polymers with a more hydrophobic structure and at lower concentrations while nanoparticle retention in non impacted sand columns decreased with decreasing hydrophobicity and increasing concentration although we have examined some factors affecting the binding response of these engineered nps to crude oil in saturated systems their transport and binding behaviour in unsaturated systems has yet to be established the transport of nps in a porous medium is controlled by their retention within pores lecoanet and wiesner 2004 which is predominantly affected by the system moisture content the composition of the porous medium sediments the physiochemical properties of the nps and the delivery rate of the injected np solution kumahor et al 2016 lin et al 2010 park et al 2016 in addition in some porous media the porosity can be separated into mobile porosity where water flow is continuous and immobile porosity where water is present as isolated clusters but loosely connected to the mobile porosity kumahor et al 2015b both solutes and nps can enter the immobile porosity by slow advection and or diffusion gao et al 2006 however some nps may be excluded from the immobile porosity due to their size bradford et al 2003 moisture content is often cited as a controlling parameter positively correlated with np transport e g torkzaban et al 2008 in saturated porous media retention is usually limited to pore straining and attachment at solid water interfaces swis while in unsaturated porous media the presence of an air phase introduces additional retention sites such as air water interfaces awis and low velocity regions such as air water solid aws interfaces bradford et al 2003 torkzaban et al 2008 retention at swis includes np attachment to sediment grains which depends on the physiochemical characteristics of the nps and the sediment surface properties an awi can retain nps by either capillary electrostatic or hydrophobic forces that depend on the np surface properties wan and wilson 1994 straining involves the physical trapping of nps in pores and pore throats which occurs in both saturated and unsaturated media it is typically predominant in unsaturated porous media due to constrained water flow in regions with smaller pores bradford et al 2003 and thin water films wan and wilson 1994 chen et al 2008 investigated the role of awis on the retention of titanium dioxide tio2 nps and concluded that more nps were retained at lower water saturations corresponding to film straining i e retention of nps in thin water films formed around air filled pores or sediments yecheskel et al 2018 found that the retention of silver nps to sediments increased with decreasing moisture content due to the presence of more awis leading to an increasing number of retention sites supporting this claim kumahor et al 2015a suggested that the retention of citrate coated silver nps in unsaturated sand packed columns was controlled by the presence of awis and swis using different flowrates corresponding to different water contents 0 17 0 29 and 0 35 v v the results from their model simulations indicated non equilibrium attachment at the swis and equilibrium attachment at the awis torkzaban et al 2008 investigated the impact of water content on np transport using experimentation and modeling tools and suggested that the extent of immobile porosity increased with decreasing water content which lead to greater retention of nps carboxylate modified latex in these regions in contrast fang et al 2013b showed that the retention of tio2 nps was not enhanced by decreasing water saturation in sand columns likely due to repulsive interactions between the negatively charged awi and the tio2 nps rahmatpour et al 2018 also reported a negligible effect of water saturation on the mobility of silver nps in undisturbed soil columns transient flow through an unsaturated system alters the water saturation and consequently the retention of nps at awis and swis prédélus et al 2017 torkzaban et al 2008 increasing the flowrate decreases the retention of nps due to a reduced immobile porosity and an increase in hydrodynamic forces acting on particles weakly retained at the swis torkzaban et al 2008 gao et al 2006 found that increased flowrate in unsaturated columns granular quartz sand remobilized nps retained at the aws interfaces and from immobile porosity regions liang et al 2013a observed less retention of surfactant stabilized silver nps at a higher darcy velocity 0 02 vs 0 006 cm min in columns loamy sand under unsaturated conditions kumahor et al 2015b investigated the effect of flowrate on the transport of citrate coated silver nps in unsaturated columns and reported less retention with increasing darcy velocity 0 04 to 0 28 cm min as a result of reduced immobile porosity similarly prédélus et al 2017 reported reduced np retention at a higher darcy velocity 0 127 vs 0 025 cm min presumably due to increased hydrodynamic forces acting on particles weakly retained at the awis natural porous medium properties such as texture i e sand silt clay content or grain size can significantly impact the transport and retention of nps fang et al 2009 observed significantly increased retention of tio2 nps in saturated soil columns with increasing clay content as a result of higher straining fang et al 2013a later investigated the transport of carbon nanotubes in 14 different soils using column experiments and showed increased nps retention in soils with smaller grain sizes d50 45 8 vs 165 3 μm and higher clay contents 53 vs 1 v v likely due to the presence of smaller pores which resulted in additional np straining raychoudhury et al 2014 investigated the retention of stabilized nzvi particles in columns packed with four different silica sands d50 775 510 250 150 μm and observed more retention in the finer sand which was attributed to straining as a dominant mechanism similarly kamrani et al 2018 also reported higher retention of carbon based nps at the swis in a smaller grain size quartz sand 0 2 0 5 mm vs 1 5 2 0 mm under both saturated and unsaturated conditions presumably due to increased straining hoggan et al 2016 investigated the mobility of tio2 nps in a lysimeter packed with layers of fine and medium sand and observed higher retention of nps in the fine sand layers which was attributed to smaller pore sizes and an increase in attachment sites increased transport of nps has been reported with higher dosing product of the input concentration and volume of the injected np solution which contributes to blocking or saturation of retention sites i e swis awis and aws surfaces and subsequent repulsive interaction between the retained nps and those in the aqueous phase chowdhury et al 2011 kasel et al 2013 showed a direct correlation between the mobility of multi wall carbon nanotubes and input concentration chowdhury et al 2011 found that a higher tio2 injection concentration 800 vs 100 mg l contributed to increased effluent mass recovery from saturated columns possibly as a result of particle particle repulsion in contrast phenrat et al 2010 reported higher mobility of nzvi at lower concentrations 30 mg l likely because of less agglomeration i e sticking of two or more nps and formation of clusters the research presented here is a continuation of the work reported by linley et al 2019 2020a 2020b on the design transport and binding of pluronic coated nps linley et al 2019 applied a tunable amphiphilic co polymer coating to iron oxide nps and demonstrated stability of these nps in aqueous suspension as well as interaction with a hydrophobic phase such that the nps preferentially bound to napl water interfaces in comparison to a non impacted porous medium the transport and targeted binding behaviour of these nps was demonstrated through saturated column experiments binding batch tests and np transport modeling linley et al 2019 linley et al 2020a 2020b the results showed that 54 of the mass of injected nps eluted i e were recovered from non impacted sand packed columns 15 cm and 100 cm long while almost all nps were retained in napl crude oil impacted sand packed columns 0 4 recovery linley et al 2020b also reported that the binding affinity of these nps to the napl was enhanced by decreasing the np coating concentration increasing the napl concentration and increasing temperature collectively this effort demonstrated that targeted delivery of nps to crude oil impacted porous media in saturated conditions is possible and contributed to our understanding of the application conditions required for efficient targeting based on their observations linley et al 2020a it was reported that binding of these nps was not dependent on dlvo interactions that are impacted by solution ionic strength in this paper we extend our previous findings to unsaturated conditions by initially evaluating the effect of initial water saturation porous medium texture input dosage and flowrate on np transport behaviour and then examine targeted np binding to crude oil impacted sediments using a series of column experiments to support the experimental observations and characterize the unsaturated transport and binding of the nps in unsaturated systems an advective dispersive reactive transport model that simulates mobile and immobile porosity regions reversible kinetic attachment detachment irreversible and depth dependent retention was used our discussion of the results focusses on differences amongst the various breakthrough curves generated the distribution of nps retained along the columns packed with crude oil and variations in np attachment and detachment rate coefficients 2 materials methods 2 1

oxide poly ethylene oxide peo ppo peo as previously mentioned the transport and binding properties of these nps are affected by the composition and concentration of the pluronic coating linley et al 2020a in this work fe nps with a pluronic coating concentration of 10 g l np diameter of 7 6 1 8 nm and cofe nps with a pluronic coating concentration of 2 5 g l np diameter of 89 7 28 2 nm were used linley 2019 nps with the higher coating concentration identified as the transport formulation have increased mobility and stability in aqueous suspension whereas nps with the lower coating

material sm section see fig sm 1 tem data indicated distinct particles with crystalline spherical cores within an amorphous polymer coating the lower coating concentration i e 2 5 g l resulted in the presence of small individually stabilized nps along with spherical np aggregates with an average size of 115 41 nm while for the higher coating concentration 10 g l the presence of large aggregates diminished as sufficient amount of pluronic fully saturated the surface of all individual nps crude oil sour crude api gravity 13 3 density of 0 977 g cm3 average linear carbon number of 25 1

bs d10 of 75 μm cu of 2 7 with 2 gravel 92 sand 5 9 silt and 0 1 clay was collected from 1 m below ground surface bgs at the university of waterloo groundwater research facility at the canadian force base cfb borden on canada bs is comprised of mostly quartz with minor amounts of other minerals and has a total iron content of 1 wt 29 6 g kg ball et al 1990 a silty sand d10 of 0 9 μm cu of 39 with

repeatedly rinsed with millipore water until the filtrate ran clear and oven dried at 90 c overnight the nc sediment ncs was first dried at 90 c overnight gently homogenized and then sieved 1 mm mesh a synthetic silty sand sss d10 of 40 μm cu of 4 material 75 sand 23 silt and 2 clay was created by homogenizing 80 of the bs with 20 of the ncs particle size distributions were determined using

experiments were performed using plexiglas columns length of 15 cm inner diameter of 3 5 cm uniformly dry packed in 1 cm thick lifts with the selected porous medium material fig 1 the top and bottom of each column was fitted with a stainless steel screen 75 μm to contain the material and 1 cm thick layer of glass beads 0 2 mm fisher scientific to distribute flow to achieve consistent initial unsaturated conditions each column was first saturated bottom up with millipore water and then suction drained using a vacuum pump ma 32 gilson set at 6 86 kpa 70 cm of h2o to obtain saturated conditions each dry packed column was flushed with co2 gas for 2 h and then millipore water was injected bottom up for 10 h at a flowrate of 0 1 ml min the initial water content v v of each column was estimated through differential mass measurements before and after saturation and following the applied vacuum multiplied by the column bulk density mass of dry sediment volume of packed column to explore the impact of initial moisture content flowrate sediment type and np dosing on the transport behaviour of pluronic coated nps eight sets of experiments were performed table 1 using fe nps coated with 10 g l pluronic i e transport formulation although the primary focus was on the transport of np under unsaturated conditions np transport was also investigated in a fully saturated system and in an initially dry system to establish endpoint behaviour in all column experiments sodium bromide nabr was added as a conservative tracer to the fe np injection solution to reach a br concentration between 100 and 200 mg l results from preliminary transport experiments indicated that the presence of the nabr did not affect np transport behaviour each transport experiment involved a pulse injection of a specified volume of the np and br solution at the top of a column at a constant flowrate 0 14 ml min using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex 7535 04 the duration of the pulse injection was approximately 70 or 320 min depending on the experimental set table 1 following the pulse injection the influent was immediately switched to millipore water at the same flowrate until near complete breakthrough of the nps was achieved typically between 600 and 900 min to ensure unsaturated conditions were maintained as the np pulse migrated down the column the maximum darcy velocity flowrate cross sectional area used was less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 43 0 01 cm min for the bs and 0 16 0 00 cm min for the sss of a representative sediment packed column was estimated using a constant head test astm 2434 a low np 50 mg l middle np 500 mg l or high np 1000 mg l target injection np concentration denoted as set b1 b2 and b3 respectively was used depending on the experimental set table 1 for the fully saturated system set a and the initially dry system set c np 500 mg l was used to investigate the role of velocity a lower flowrate 0 06 ml min with np 1000 mg l was employed set d table 1 the np binding batch test data described below indicated a higher np mass attached to the sss compared to the bs and therefore a longer pulse duration 400 mins in conjunction with the high injection np concentration was selected for the transport experiments using sss set e1 for comparison purposes the identical higher np dose was used for a column packed with bs set e2 effluent samples were collected every 20 mins in 1 7 ml microcentrifuge polypropylene vials vwr mississauga on canada the effluent volume was continuously recorded and used to estimate the effluent flowrate each experimental set was conducted at room temperature 22 c and performed in triplicate except for set e2 which was a control experiment for set e1 and only one trial was performed a total of 22 column experiments were executed the targeted binding of nps towards a crude oil source zone present in an unsaturated system set f1 was explored using the cofe nps with 2 5 g l pluronic coating i e binding formulation the cofe nps were used in these transport and binding experiments to minimize the analytical interference caused by the background fe present in the bs when estimating the mass of nps attached to sediment sub samples linley 2019 demonstrated that the nps with either the fe or cofe core material with the same coating formulation behave similarly in porous media to prepare the crude oil impacted sediment to use for packing dry bs was first moistened using millipore water 0 2 v v then mixed with crude oil 2 wt heated to 60 c and homogenized by stirring a 5 cm thick layer of the impacted bs was packed using 1 cm thick lifts in the middle of each column from 5 to 10 cm from the bottom non impacted moistened bs was packed below and above the impacted zone see fig 1 the flowrate and cofe np input concentration were selected based on the results from the transport experiments table 1 similar to the fe np transport experiments a pulse injection of the np and br solution at the top of a column at a constant flowrate 0 14 ml min was followed by millipore water at the same flowrate until near complete breakthrough of the nps was achieved at the conclusion of this experiment the packed sediment was carefully excavated in 1 cm lifts from top to bottom and the mass of cofe nps retained in each lift was determined and used to generate a np retention profile as a control a transport experiment using br and the cofe np solution was also conducted in a column uniformly packed with moist bs 0 2 v v set f2 in total 4 column experiments were performed at room temperature 22 c 3 trials in set f1 and one trial in set f2 the np mass that can be attached to clean or crude oil impacted sediment mattached was determined by batch binding tests see sm 1 for a description for the fe np transport formulation values ranged from 7 8 2 3 mg kg for bs linley 2019 to 37 3 2 4 mg kg for sss while for the cofe np binding formulation values ranged from 8 2 0 6 mg kg for bs to 25 9 2 1 mg kg for crude oil impacted bs table sm 1 2 3 analyses the np concentration mg l was estimated from the total iron or cobalt concentration fet cot in aqueous samples by assuming the core material was composed 100 of fe3o4 or cofe2o4 to measure fet or cot an aliquot of the effluent sample was digested with hcl

method detection limit mdl of 0 004 mg l for both fe and co the concentration of bromide in each effluent sample was measured using ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 with a mdl of 0 5 mg l to estimate the mass of nps retained in each sediment lift epa method 3050b was used each lift was oven dried at 90 c for 12 h to remove water then homogenized before a 1 g sub sample was transferred into a 50 ml digestion tube vwr mississauga ontario to digest the oil and nps present in the sub sample 10 ml of concentrated hno3 70 was added to each tube which was then heated at 95 c for 30 min after cooling 5 ml of concentrated hno3 70 was added and the tube re heated to 95 c until the reaction was complete indicated by lack of brown smoke and the solution volume was reduced to 5 ml after the tube was cooled 3 ml of h2o2 was added and gently heated at 85 to 90 c until effervescence was observed once effervescence subsided the tube was removed from the heating block and allowed to cool when cooled an additional 3 ml of h2o2 30 was added and the tube heated 95 c until effervescence was insignificant and the solution volume was reduced to 5 ml to ensure complete digestion of the nps 10 ml of concentrated hcl 37 was added and the tube was heated 95 c until the volume was reduced to 5 ml the digestate was then diluted by millipore water to a total volume of 10 ml and filtered whatman no 41 the filtrate was analysed by icp oes to estimate cot which was used to calculate the mass of nps in each sediment sub sample mg of cofe nps per kg of dry sediment 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 description to simulate br transport and the np transport and binding behaviour observed in the column experiments a flexible one dimensional unsaturated flow and transport model 1dusat was used thomson 2019 in this model the mixed form of richards equation celia et al 1990 is used to estimate the unsaturated saturated flow conditions in conjunction with the single valued non hysteretic capillary pressure water saturation relationship and relative permeability function developed by van genuchten 1980 the numerical solution of the richards equation requires the knowledge of the porous medium hydraulic parameters including the residual water content θ r m3 m3 van genuchten model parameters n and α 1 m saturated hydraulic conductivity k s m s tortuosity factor l for the hydraulic conductivity function and the total porosity ϕ t m3 m3 the transport domain or total porosity is divided into a mobile region ϕ m and an immobile region ϕ im such that ϕ t ϕ m ϕ im with the rate of

be attached to the sediment or oil impacted sediment mg kg to reduce complexity the mass transfer rate of flow between the regions of mobile and immobile porosity was assumed to be sufficiently large so that s w m and s w i m can be considered essentially equal šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 eqs 1 and 2 provide the mathematical framework to investigate the observed transport and binding of the nps in both mobile and immobile regions linley et al 2020b demonstrated that the reversible kinetic attachment detachment model employed in this model was able to represent the attachment behaviour of the fe nps in saturated column systems 2 4 2 parametrization to simulate the observed hydraulic behaviour for each column experiment the saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat was assigned the estimated values from hydraulic testing and the remaining required hydraulic parameters including total porosity ϕ t residual water saturation s wr and the van genuchten model parameters n and α were determined by calibration in this study the dynamically dimensioned search dds optimization method tolson and shoemaker 2007 within the ostrich toolkit matott 2017 was used as the calibration tool the dds method is a heuristic global search algorithm which overcomes common issues with other automatic calibration methods that find locally optimal solutions in the neighborhood of the initial solution e g quasi newton method or are relatively inefficient e g shuffled complex evolution algorithm the dds optimization method initially searches globally across the calibration range provided for each parameter and then becomes more local as it advances towards the specified number of total model evaluations the observed column outflow data were used as calibration targets with a root mean square error rmse objective function as the model calibration measure to ensure that an optimal solution was obtained three different calibration trials and 100 model evaluations were performed for each calibration trial a different initial parameter set was generated randomly from the calibration parameter range specified for each parameter to allow the dds algorithm to initiate from a new starting solution the parameter set from the calibration trial that generated the lowest rmse was deemed optimal posterior residual analyses were also used to assess goodness of fit r2 and the randomness of the residuals observed simulated values was evaluated using the shapiro wilk normality test shapiro and wilk 1965 for the suction drained columns an initial equilibrium pressure head and corresponding water saturation distribution was specified based on the measured value of the applied vacuum at the bottom of the column for the initial conditions of the crude oil impacted columns the average estimated water content was used to prescribe a pressure head at the bottom of the column using representative hydraulic parameters from the fe np transport experiment simulations this prescribed pressure was used to establish an initial hydrostatic pressure and water saturation profile transient boundary conditions for all unsaturated column systems see table 1 were identical with a free exit condition assigned at the bottom and a specified water flux assigned at the top of the column for the saturated column simulations constant water flux and constant pressure head boundary conditions were applied at the top and bottom of the column respectively the initial br and np concentrations in the computational domain were assigned zero and a total mass flux consistent with the duration of the injection pulse was specified as the top boundary condition and a zero dispersive flux as the bottom boundary condition the 15 cm long spatial domain was discretized into 1000 computational volumes and an initial time step interval of 1 0 s was used and allowed to increase by 0 02 until a maximum time step increment of 10 s was reached based on preliminary simulations the mass balance for water br and nps were all 0 07 using the calibrated hydraulic parameters column transport parameters dispersivity α l mobile porosity ϕ m immobile porosity ϕ im and first order mass exchange coefficient γ br for br were estimated a similar calibration approach as described above for the hydraulic parameters was used in conjunction with the observed br effluent data as the calibration target the np attachment detachment and straining terms in eqs 1 and 2 were not used in these br simulations finally using the calibrated hydraulic and transport parameters for each column the np transport and attachment parameters m a t t a c h m a x k a k d γ np were determined by calibration with the observed np effluent data as the calibration target for all np transport experiments table 1 the bulk density was assumed to be 1800 kg m3 ball et al 1990 for all column systems to account for minor variations between the batch binding tests and the column experiments the calibration range for m attach max was constrained to the 95 confidence interval ci as determined from the binding batch tests see table sm 1 based on preliminary simulations using the breakthrough curve btc data from the targeted binding experiment set f1 and f2 the straining term in eq 1 was activated introducing the straining rate coefficient k str as an additional calibration parameter for the targeted binding column simulations the mean grain diameter d 50 was assigned a value of 0 02 cm based on fig sm 2 and β was set to 0 432 as presented by bradford et al 2003 3 results discussion 3 1 hydraulic behaviour the average observed flowrates were 0 13 0 02 ml min n 21 and 0 06 0 01 ml min n 3 closely matching the target flowrates of 0 14 and 0 06 ml min table 1 for the target flowrate of 0 14 ml min flow started to appear at the column outlet between 85 and 122 mins for the bs suction drained systems sets b1 b2 b3 between 75 and 95 mins for the sss suction drained system set e1 and between 95 and 135 mins for the impacted system set f1 for the target flowrate of 0 06 ml min flow appeared at the column outlet between 165 and 245 mins in comparison for the initially dry system set c flow appeared at the column outlet later between 265 and 285 mins due to the lower initial water content in all systems the flow breakthrough profile reflecting the shape of the wetting front was sharp increasing from essentially no flow to a near steady flowrate in 20 5 mins e g see fig sm 3 the model was able to capture this sharp wetting front and provided flow behaviour representative of the observations r2 0 93 fig sm 3 the normality of residuals was also confirmed p 0 05 see fig sm 4 for example residual plots the calibrated hydraulic parameters ϕ t s wr n and α varied slightly between experiments due to minor differences in packing giving rise to small changes in pore connectivity see table sm 2 hydraulic parameters for the initially dry column systems were not determined since the capillary pressure water saturation relationship used in 1dusat is not appropriate for initially dry systems for the bs packed columns n 18 the average calibrated ϕ t s wr n and α were 0 33 0 05 0 20 0 02 1 28 0 08 and 14 93 0 19 1 m respectively and for the sss packed columns n 3 the average ϕ t s wr n and α were 0 31 0 01 0 19 0 01 1 17 0 65 and 11 00 0 82 1 m respectively the calibrated s wr and ϕ t values for both sss and bs suction drained column systems are similar as expected since sss is comprised of 80 bs and 20 of the silty sand material the estimated n values for the sss and bs materials are also similar which is reflective of the near identical shape of the pore size distribution the slightly larger estimated α value for bs compared to the sss is reflective of the lower fraction of fine grained particles fig sm 2 and hence the ability to drain at a lower capillary pressure fig sm 3 presents the observed and simulated effluent flow profiles for a suction drained column packed with sss from set e1 and one packed with bs from set e2 consistent with the estimated hydraulic parameters a similar flow profile shape was observed in these trials flow breakthrough at the column outlet occurred around the same time for both columns indicating similar initial water content and pore size distribution as can be observed in fig sm 3 the effluent flow profile from an impacted column set f1 and a control column set f2 have the same shape with nearly identical flow arrival at the column outlet indicating that the presence of the crude oil did not significantly alter flow behaviour 3 2 column experiments 3 2 1 btc observations to facilitate comparison between the various btcs generated the br and np concentrations were normalized by the injection concentration c o and the time axis was normalized by the time to the center of mass of the br btc t c br representative observed br and fe np btcs from the saturated set a suction drained set b2 and initially dry set c column experiments are shown in fig 2 see fig sm 5 for the btcs from the remaining trials the shape of the br btcs from all experiments except for the saturated columns set a were asymmetrical with a characteristic steep increase to the peak concentration followed by a falling limb with a noticeable tail fig 2 shortly after effluent breakthrough from the initially dry columns the br concentration increased rapidly to the peak concentration while for the suction drained systems the rising limb of the br btc began slightly after effluent breakthrough and then increased relatively slower than observed for set c to the peak concertation the higher degree of br btc tailing observed in initially dry columns compared to the suction drained columns is indicative of greater diversity of flow pathways in contrast the br btcs from the saturated columns were symmetric confirming that the observed br tail from the suction drained and initially dry columns is related to the unsaturated conditions similar tracer behaviour has been reported by others akhtar et al 2011 padilla et al 1999 prédélus et al 2017 and was attributed to the presence of either zones of immobile water i e low velocity regions or dead end pores leading to non equilibrium physical transport gao et al 2006 kumahor et al 2015b molnar et al 2014 torkzaban et al 2006 the shape of the observed fe np btcs from the initially dry and suction drained systems were also asymmetrical fig 2 while the fe np btcs from the saturated columns similar to their respective br btcs were symmetrical with a slightly lower normalized peak concentration compared to br in comparison to the suction drained system the fe np btcs from the initially dry system had significantly lower peak concentrations more tailing and delayed arrival this behaviour suggests an increase in retention sites for np attachment possibly due to more air phase present and more gradual release of nps from retention sites btc metrics for br and nps for all experimental sets are presented in table 2 the mass recovery of br and fe nps were estimated by integrating under their btcs and normalizing by the total mass injected m r m out m in x 100 see table 2 the recovery of br a conservative tracer was 100 while fe np recovery decreased from 83 in the saturated columns to 76 in the suction drained columns and to 25 in the initially dry columns consistent with the fe np m r estimates the average retained mass of nps per mass of solid estimated from mass balance mb c r e t a i n e d m b table 2 was significantly higher for the initially dry columns 18 6 0 2 mg kg compared to the suction drained 4 3 1 9 mg kg and saturated columns 3 4 mg kg the c r e t a i n e d m b for the dry columns set c is 2 4 times higher than the attachment capacity of fe nps to bs as estimated from the batch binding tests under saturated conditions 7 8 2 3 mg kg this increased np retention for the initially dry systems may be caused by fe np attachment to awi in addition to swis as well as physical trapping in lower velocity regions e g aws interfaces and grain grain junctions the attachment of fe nps to swis may occur due to van der waals forces acting between the peo block of the nps pluronic coating and the silica sio2 on sediment surfaces linley et al 2019 while capillary forces are mainly responsible for the fe np attachment at the awis these retention mechanisms produced fe np btcs that are significantly suppressed and delayed relative to their respective br btcs in the initially dry and suction drained columns as the water content increased behind the wetting front the extent of awis and the immobile regions decreased and some of the fe nps attached at these retention sites may have detached producing a long fe np btc tail fig 2 a b these observations are consistent with the effect of awis on np transport seen in the wider literature chen et al 2008 gao et al 2006 kumahor et al 2015a shang et al 2008 torkzaban et al 2008 yecheskel et al 2018 for example gao et al 2006 suggested that during transient flow a fraction of nps in contact with immobile region awis are susceptible to release when these regions are reconnected with the mobile porosity similarly shang et al 2008 observed mobilization of colloids nps and their subsequent elution by a wetting front indicating the importance of capillary forces on np migration to quantify the delayed breakthrough of fe nps compared to br the time to the center of mass of the fe np btc t c np was divided by t c br to calculate an arrival time ratio t c np t c br table 2 the arrival of the center of mass of the fe nps btcs was significantly delayed with respect to br for the initially dry columns compared to the saturated and suction drained columns i e t c np t c br of 1 22 compared to 1 00 for set a and 1 01 for set b2 the near simultaneous arrival of the center of mass of the fe nps and br btcs in most experimental sets as well as a delayed arrival of fe nps in other sets i e set c and set e1 table 2 indicate that size exclusion did not occur in any of the systems investigated bradford et al 2003 prédélus et al 2014 2017 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 fig 3 shows btc data for suction drained bs systems at low 0 06 ml min set d and high 0 14 ml min set b3 flowrates no substantial difference is observed between the shapes of these btcs except for a slightly lower peak concentration and less tailing at the lower flowrate breakthrough of fe nps and br occurred around the same normalized time t t c br and both sets had the same arrival time ratio t c np t c br of 1 01 0 01 for set b3 and 1 00 0 01 for set d the m r of fe nps table 2 for the lower and higher flowrate sets were 76 7 and 91 5 respectively due to an increase in both residence time and air saturation in the lower flowrate columns chen et al 2008 demonstrated that slow flowrates resulted in higher retention of nps due to the longer residence time for nps tio2 to attach to awis shang et al 2008 observed decreased colloid np mass recovery under lower velocity conditions 0 288 to 0 018 cm min and related this behaviour to an increase in the awis kumahor et al 2015a investigated silver np transport in unsaturated columns subjected to three flowrates i e 2 5 9 7 and 17 0 cm h and observed increased mobility with increased flowrate consistent with the results from experimental sets b1 b2 and b3 the lower flowrate corresponds to an increase in awis and higher np retention representative br and fe np btcs for the suction drained bs systems at three different fe np injection concentrations 50 mg l set b1 500 mg l set b2 1000 mg l set b3 are shown in fig 4 all btcs had similar asymmetrical profiles with a center of mass arrival time ratio of 1 table 2 as expected the fe np peak concentration c c 0 increased with a higher injection concentration from an average of 0 48 b1 to 0 57 b2 and 0 61 b3 consistent with the increasing mass recovery average m r 53 for b1 76 5 for b2 and 91 5 for b3 this is consistent with other literature findings for example mass recovery increased with injection dosage for tio2 nps in saturated columns and was attributed to particle particle repulsion chowdhury et al 2011 when nps are attached to sand grains i e swis they can form a shield of nps on the surface where unfavorable particle particle interactions limit further np attachment at higher dosages more nps occupy attachment sites and particle particle repulsion dominates leading to higher elution of nps high np concentrations can also decrease mass recovery due to agglomeration phenrat et al 2010 raychoudhury et al 2012 or attractive interactions e g electrostatic forces between the attached and suspended nps liu et al 1995 however in this work the pluronic np coating establishes a neutral charge and for the concentrations range investigated np agglomeration is hindered by steric interactions fig 5 compares representative btcs from sss packed columns e1 and bs packed columns e2 in contrast to the btcs from the other suction drained experiments with a lower injection volume or dose the btcs for both set e1 and set e2 reached a plateau peak concentration of c c 0 1 the fe np and br btcs from the bs column essentially overlap t c np t c br 1 00 while the fe np btc for the sss column was delayed with t c np t c br 1 09 table 2 leading to an average m r of 65 1 and 96 for sss and bs columns respectively the addition of 20 of the silty sand material in the sss compared to bs had a significant impact on np transport and retention behaviour the average c retained mb was 65 1 mg kg for the sss packed columns which is significantly higher than the average c retained mb of 6 4 mg kg for the bs columns and the estimated attachment capacity of fe nps to sss sediment in binding batch tests m attached 37 3 2 4 mg kg table sm 1 this increased np retention in the column system is likely due to the presence of awis that would not be encountered in the batch test previous work that evaluated the effect of porous medium texture on np transport has reported both a lower mass recovery and peak concentration with decreasing grain size fang et al 2009 kamrani et al 2018 liang et al 2013b in contrast for the fe nps used in this study the breakthrough front fig 5 a was essentially delayed until all attachment sites were saturated and then the concentration increased to c c 0 1 similar to observations reported by torkzaban et al 2010 and wang et al 2014 to evaluate the targeted binding capability and transport of the cofe nps under unsaturated conditions experimental parameters bs flowrate of 0 14 ml min np injection concentration of 500 mg l were selected based on the findings from the fe np transport experiments in addition an injection pulse of 20 ml table 1 high input dosage was used to ensure sufficient cofe np mass was observed in the effluent since the batch binding test results indicated a higher attachment capacity to clean and crude oil impacted bs as compared to fe nps table sm 1 representative br and cofe np btcs for the crude oil impacted set f1 and control set f2 columns are shown in fig 6 the br btcs shape was similar for both experimental sets with a slightly lower t c br for the crude oil impacted column likely due to minor packing variations and presence of the crude oil in both column sets the cofe np btcs were delayed relative to their respective br btcs and had lower peak concentrations both of these features were more pronounced in the crude oil impacted columns compared to the control columns the average t c np t c br was 1 22 0 04 with m r 26 3 for the oil impacted columns and 1 05 with m r 49 for the control column table 2 consistent with these values the retained mass of cofe nps per mass of solid c retained mb is twice as high in the oil impacted columns compared to the control column 33 0 2 0 vs 15 0 mg kg the increase in the mass of cofe nps retained and the delay in arrival of the btcs for the oil impacted columns reflects the ability of the cofe nps to preferentially bind to the crude oil under unsaturated conditions the distribution of cofe nps retained along the oil impacted columns using the solid digestion and icp oes method are presented in fig 7 for the two trials of set f1 these profiles clearly show a higher concentration of cofe nps retained in the crude oil zone 27 to 35 mg kg compared to the lower non impacted zone 0 to 0 05 m of the columns 8 to 18 mg kg in the non impacted zone adsorptive interactions between peo and the surface of the sand grains as well as capillary forces at awis contribute to np attachment np aggregation as a result of the lower pluronic coating concentration used on the cofe nps may have also contributed to np attachment especially near the column inlet additionally hydrophobic forces stronger due to the lower pluronic coating concentration on the cofe nps between the cofe np and the air phase may increase retention compared to fe nps which saw c retained mb between 4 and 6 mg kg in suction drained bs packed columns these hydrophobic interactions are also responsible for cofe np attachment to the crude oil impacted zone in the non impacted zone above the crude oil zone 0 10 to 0 15 m the concentration of cofe nps ranged from 19 to 32 mg kg for the first trial of set f1 and 15 to 28 mg kg for the second trial with a distribution suggestive of depth dependent straining these retention mechanisms decreased cofe np transport compared to the fe nps as demonstrated by the lower m r 49 vs 91 5 and c retained mb 15 0 vs 4 3 0 6 mg kg for sets f2 and b3 respectively under nearly identical conditions i e same flowrate input dosage aquifer material this is also manifested as a decreased peak concentration and delayed arrival of cofe nps with respect to fe nps fig sm 6 3 2 2 model simulations the asymmetrical shape of the br btcs indicative of physical non equilibrium transport was captured by the model eqs 1 and 2 without the attachment detachment and straining terms with r2 0 95 see figs 2 to 6 attempts to fit the br btcs from all the suction drained columns considering a single porosity system f s 1 were unable to replicate the significant observed tail in contrast since no tailing was observed in the br btcs from the saturated columns set a the model was able to produce a good fit r2 0 99 by considering a single porosity system fig 2 c see fig sm 4 for example residual plots a summary of the calibrated br transport parameters for each experimental set is provided in table 3 see sm 2 for explanations we assumed that the np transport and attachment detachment parameters were identical in both the mobile and immobile porosity regions because the sediments were homogenized prior to packing the columns a range of values for the ratio of the np diameter to the mean grain diameter d p d 50 has been suggested from 0 002 bradford et al 2002 to 0 154 herzig et al 1970 as the threshold when physical straining is dominant for the fe nps dp 7 6 10 6 mm and porous media d 50 bs 0 18 mm sss 0 14 mm employed in this study this ratio is 0 002 and thus the straining term was not used for simulations of the fe np transport experiments acceptable fits to the observed fe np btcs r2 0 92 were obtained and residuals were normally distributed p 0 05 selected simulated fe np btcs are shown on figs 2 to 5 attempts to fit the observed cofe np btcs from the impacted and control columns using the model components employed for the simulation of fe np btcs were unable to reproduce the peak concentrations as noted above the cofe np retention profiles for set f1 fig 7 above the crude oil zone 0 10 to 0 15 m appear to follow an exponential shape characteristic of depth dependant straining likely due to aggregation from the lower pluronic coating concentration on the cofe nps fig sm 1 the lower pluronic coating concentration used for the cofe nps 2 5 vs 10 g l p104 is thought to be insufficient to completely saturate the surface of individual particles fig sm 1 making them more susceptible to aggregation with the inclusion of depth dependent straining the model was able to reproduce the cofe np btcs fig 6 r2 0 95 residuals normally distributed p 0 05 and the retention profile fig 7 r2 0 83 residuals normally distributed p 0 05 the calibrated straining rate coefficient k str 3 0 0 6 10 4 s is similar to the value reported by linley et al 2021 for the same cofe nps and same coating formulation in saturated conditions see sm 3 table 3 lists the calibrated parameters while evidence of straining was observed in the np binding experiment and addressed by a depth dependent straining term in the model a mechanistic investigation into this retention behaviour was not within the scope of this research for all the suction drained and saturated column systems except for set e1 the optimal m a t t a c h m a x was within the 95 ci of the np attachment capacity as estimated from the batch binding tests in general the calibrated m a t t a c h m a x value was slightly higher than the average observed c r e t a i n e d m b values table 2 depending on the injected dose of the fe nps to achieve an acceptable calibration of the observed btcs from the suction drained columns packed with sss set e1 the upper bound of the calibration range for m a t t a c h m a x was increased the average calibrated value was 65 4 0 3 mg kg which was consistent with the observed mass of retained fe nps c r e t a i n e d m b 65 2 4 4 mg kg and almost twice the estimated attachment capacity from the batch binding tests table sm 1 the need for a higher m a t t a c h m a x value indicates that additional or enhanced np attachment mechanisms were occurring during the migration of fe nps through the sss packed systems that were not captured by the batch binding test treumann et al 2014 explored differences in np attachment mechanisms between batch and saturated column studies and speculated on the role of a variety of forces acting on the nps during their transport in column systems including hydrodynamic drag and lift electrical double layer repulsion or attraction and london van der waals interaction the calibrated first order mass transfer rate coefficient for the fe nps γ fe np varied slightly 1 10 5 to 4 10 5 s except for experimental set d where the calibrated value was an order of magnitude smaller 6 10 6 s due to the lower injection flowrate the calibrated γ fe np values are consistent with the observation noted above for γ br prédélus et al 2014 also found that the mass transfer rate coefficient for nps and tracer between mobile and immobile regions was on the same order of magnitude 2 10 4 to 9 10 4 s for np vs 3 4 10 4 s for tracer the calibrated attachment rate coefficient k a for all column systems packed with bs varied over a narrow range from 1 10 5 to 5 10 5 s the presence of additional retention sites i e awis in the suction drained columns set b2 compared to the saturated experimental set a did not have a statistically significant impact on k a 5 1 10 5 s for set b3 vs 1 6 10 5 s for set a p 0 05 conversely the calibrated detachment rate coefficient k d was found to be statistically different between the two sets for set b2 it was an order of magnitude larger than k d for set a 6 0 10 7 vs 7 5 10 6 s which manifests as a longer tail in the fe nps btcs this is attributed to the gradual release of nps from the additional retention sites i e awis in the drained columns set b2 due to the gradual decrease in the air water interfacial area during transient flow conditions sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 it has been reported that nps usually attach to awis irreversibly by capillary forces bradford et al 2003 flury and aramrak 2017 until the dissolution of trapped air behind the wetting front occurs sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 no significant difference in the calibrated k a was attained for the three experimental systems that were used to investigate the impact of dosing or concentration on fe np transport set b1 set b2 and set b3 fig 4 however k d slightly increased with higher dosing from 3 0 to 7 5 to 9 1 10 6 s for set b1 b2 and b3 respectively p 0 05 the increase in k d in response to the higher injection dosing is likely due to increased particle particle collision between those in the bulk solution and those attached and their subsequent remobilization collectively based on the observed btcs and the calibrated parameters it appears that for the range of input concentrations investigated 50 to 1000 mg l concentration had no significant impact on the transport behaviour of the fe nps used for set d lower flowrate k a was nearly identical to that determined for set b3 1 50 0 8 10 5 s compared to 1 91 0 43 10 5 s while the average k d was about 36 times smaller 2 5 0 8 10 7 s compared to 9 1 0 4 10 6 s suggesting a relative decrease in detachment the decreased connectivity between the mobile and immobile regions indicated by an order of magnitude lower γ fe np is also responsible it has been reported that the primary retention mechanism of nps at awis is capillary forces during steady or low flowrates wan and wilson 1994 where the remobilization of retained nps was found to be very slow or negligible and thus the attachment of nps at awis can be considered irreversible any changes in the flowrate may alter the retention of nps by affecting kinetics i e k a or k d torkzaban et al 2008 liang et al 2013b and makselon et al 2017 suggested that the rate of np attachment increased higher k a while k d decreased or became negligible with lower flowrates indicating irreversible attachment for the columns packed with the sss material set e1 the average calibrated k a was an order of magnitude larger than the column systems packed with bs 4 0 1 03 10 4 s vs 1 10 5 to 5 10 5 s while the calibrated k d was 8 times smaller than the bs packed systems table 3 suggesting a significant increase in attachment to and decrease in detachment from the sss material the increased k a in combination with a larger m attach max manifested the delayed arrival of the fe nps btc fig 5 as a result of the increased clay and silt content larger surface area and thus more np retention sites an increase in k a with decreasing grain size was reported by liang et al 2013b who observed a higher mass of silver nps retained in columns packed with smaller sized sand and concluded that the higher k a represented increased mass transfer to the grain surfaces driven by larger surface area it has been proposed that straining becomes the dominant retention mechanism as the average grain size decreases raychoudhury et al 2014 hoggan et al 2016 fang et al 2013b kamrani et al 2018 however in the case of the fe nps straining was unlikely as previously described the calibrated m attach max was 3 times higher for the crude oil zone in the oil impacted columns 26 4 1 2 mg kg compared to the control column 7 8 mg kg and the upper and lower clean zones within the impacted column 8 2 1 3 mg kg the calibrated attachment rate coefficient k a for the crude oil zone 2 8 0 15 10 2 s was two orders of magnitude greater than k a for the clean sand zones in the oil impacted and the control columns 2 4 10 4 and 2 7 1 2 10 4 s in contrast the calibrated detachment rate coefficient k d for the crude oil zone and the clean zones of the oil impacted columns set f1 as well as the control column set f2 were essentially the same values varied from 4 8 1 1 10 6 to 7 6 1 1 10 6 s the significantly larger attachment capacity m attach max and rate coefficient k a determined for the crude oil zone is a direct result of the hydrophobic forces between the amphiphilic np coating and crude oil compared to non impacted zones comparing the estimated parameters for the fe nps in set b3 with cofe nps in set f2 under nearly identical conditions the estimated k a for the cofe nps in control column was about an order of magnitude higher than k a for fe nps in set b3 24 10 5 vs 1 9 0 4 10 5 s while the estimated m attach max and k d were nearly equal for both sets the higher ratio of k a to k d for the cofe nps in unsaturated columns compared to fe nps in drained columns is consistent with the lower recovered mass of cofe nps from the control column f2 4 summary and implications a series of unsaturated column experiments were used to investigate the role of initial water saturation porous medium texture input dosage and flowrate on the transport of amphiphilic co polymer coated iron oxide nps fe nps while the focus was on the transport behaviour of the fe nps in unsaturated porous media experiments in saturated and initially dry systems provided endpoint controls to contextualize the results which showed fe np transport was affected by the initial water content under near identical fe np injection conditions 83 of the fe np mass injected was eluted from the saturated columns while 25 was eluted from initially dry columns and 76 from suction drained columns the fe np and br btcs co injected conservative tracer from the saturated columns were symmetric while for the suction drained columns both the fe np and br btcs had an asymmetrical shape with a noticeable tail indicative of physical non equilibrium transport the fe np btcs were also dampened relative to the br btcs with lower normalized peak concentrations compared to those from the saturated columns considerably more br btc tailing was observed for the initially dry columns indicative of a greater diversity of flow paths compared to the suction drained columns additionally the fe np btcs showed significantly lower peak concentrations a higher degree of tailing and delayed arrival of the center of mass relative to their respective br btcs compared to those from the suction drained columns the changes in fe nps transport behaviour from saturated to suction drained and then to initially dry conditions are reflective of an increase in fe np retention sites due to a decrease in water saturation with a concomitant increase in the magnitude of awis behind the wetting front the quantity of awis is expected to gradually decrease as the water saturation increases and some attached fe nps are slowly released which manifests as a long tail in np btcs the asymmetrical shape of the br and fe np btcs from the suction drained systems were successfully described using a model that considered br and fe np transport in mobile and immobile porosity regions in contrast a single porosity system was sufficient to characterize the observed btcs from the saturated columns a simple attachment detachment model with nonlinear langmuirian blocking was used to represent fe np retention and release the presence of additional retention sites i e awis in the suction drained columns compared to the saturated columns did not have a significant impact on the fe np attachment rate coefficient k a however the detachment rate coefficient k d was found to be an order of magnitude smaller for the saturated columns compared to the suction drained columns a combination of the mass transfer of fe nps between the immobile and mobile porosity as well as the gradual detachment from the retention sites swis and awis was responsible for a longer observed tail of the fe np btcs for the suction drained columns compared to the saturated columns the slow detachment of nps from awis is expected under transient flow conditions due to the gradual decrease in the air water interfacial area and the extent of immobile porosity regions a lower recovered mass of fe nps from the columns with a lower flowrate 76 vs 91 was attributed to an increase in the residence time and decrease in water saturation the estimated k a was nearly identical at both flowrates while the k d was 36 times smaller at the lower flowrate the significantly smaller k d compared to k a at the lower flowrate represents a relative lower rate of detachment and is consistent with the lower recovered mass of nps for the range of injection concentrations investigated 50 to 1000 mg l no substantial impact was observed on fe np transport behaviour it was also observed that for the columns packed with higher clay and silt content sediments more fe np retention larger m attach max and k a occurred resulting in a significantly delayed arrival of the fe np btc with respect to br which was attributed to the larger surface area the estimated m attach max for the sss packed columns was twice the value determined by the binding batch tests clearly indicating that additional np attachment mechanisms occurred during the transport of fe nps through these sediments that were not captured in the binding batch tests the capability of targeted binding of cofe nps coated with a lower concentration of a pluronic block co polymer to crude oil present in an unsaturated system was investigated under identical cofe np injection conditions 49 of the cofe np mass injected was recovered from the non impacted control column while only 26 was recovered from the oil impacted columns the cofe np btcs from the impacted columns exhibited lower peak concentrations and significantly delayed arrival of the center of mass relative to the respective br btcs and those from the control column both the simulated cofe np btcs and cofe np retention profile compared well with the observed data when a depth dependant straining term in the model was used this added model requirement is a result of a combination of increased retention of cofe nps capillary and or hydrophobic forces at the awis and aggregation due to the lower pluronic coating concentration and larger size compared to fe nps the m attach max for the crude oil zone was 3 times higher than that for the surrounding non impacted zones as well as the control column the estimated k a was about two orders of magnitude higher for the crude oil zone than the k a for the non impacted zones and control column however the estimated k d was nearly identical the significant higher ratio of k a to k d in the crude oil zone compared to non impacted zone is indicative of stronger attachment of cofe nps to the crude oil these findings extend our understanding of the transport and binding behaviour of pluronic coated nps from saturated to unsaturated systems where the presence of an air phase significantly impacts np transport specifically the additional retention processes in unsaturated porous media e g np attachment at the air water and air water solid interfaces increase the transport complexity of these nps relative to saturated porous media findings established the significant role of initial water content injection flowrate and porous medium texture on np transport and retention behaviour this study also confirmed targeted delivery of pluronic coated nps to a crude oil zone in unsaturated column systems which was previously only understood in saturated conditions broadening their potential utility finally our simulation efforts indicated that a model that considered np transport in both mobile and immobile porosity regions could better reproduce np physical and chemical non equilibrium transport than a conventional single porosity model this study has clarified the influence of porous medium and injection parameters on the transport of polymer coated engineered nps as well as a modeling approach that should be used to capture their transport behaviour hence these parameters and approaches should be considered when designing np delivery strategies in natural porous media enabling optimal np utilization for monitoring or

1280,the effectiveness of most in situ remedial technologies including nanoremediation lies on successful delivery of reagents to a subsurface target treatment zone targeted delivery of engineered nanoparticles nps to treat petroleum hydrocarbons present in the unsaturated zone requires an understanding of their transport behaviour in these systems a series of column experiments explored the effect of initial water saturation flowrate input dosage and porous medium texture on the transport of iron oxide or cobalt ferrite nps coated with an amphiphilic co polymer as well as their targeted attachment to a crude oil zone as the initial water content increased with a concomitant reduction in air saturation the degree of tailing present in the np breakthrough curves btcs reduced and the mass of nps recovered increased air saturation is positively correlated with the magnitude of air water interfaces which provide additional np retention sites at a lower injection flow rate np retention increased due to a longer residence time and comparatively high air saturation np transport behaviour was not sensitive to np injection dose over the range tested increased retention and retardation of the np btc was observed in sediments with a higher clay and silt content nps coated with a lower concentration of a pluronic block co polymer to promote binding were preferentially retained within the crude oil zone to simulate the asymmetrical np breakthrough curves observed from the unsaturated systems required the use of a model that accounted for both mobile and immobile flow regions as well as np attachment and detachment with nonlinear langmuirian blocking this model allowed examination of attachment and detachment rate coefficients which captured np interaction with the porous medium and or crude oil it was found that the initial water saturation and flow rate did not have an appreciable impact on the np attachment rate coefficient while it increased by 10 with increasing clay and silt content and by 100 in the presence of crude oil indicating preferential np attachment within the crude oil zone as a result of the lower np polymer concentration coating used to promote increased attachment to crude oil higher retention was observed near the column inlet and was captured quantitatively by adding a depth dependent straining term to the model this retention behaviour represents a combination of irreversible attachment at the air water interfaces and straining near the column inlet enhanced by the formation of np aggregates the detachment rate coefficient decreased with a lower initial water saturation and flowrate but increased with higher clay and silt content the findings from this study contribute to our understanding of the transport and binding behaviour of pluronic coated nps in unsaturated conditions and in particular the role of initial water content flowrate and porous medium texture demonstrated delivery of nps to a target zone is an important step towards expanding the utility of nps as treatment reagents keywords nanoparticles unsaturated porous media targeted binding modeling column experiments crude oil 1 introduction soil and groundwater contamination by light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls such as gasoline and crude oil can be detrimental to the environment and human health labud et al 2007 following a near surface release a lnapl will migrate downward through the unsaturated zone where some of the mass is retained largely due to capillary forces brown et al 2017 since this immobile lnapl mass represents a long term contaminant source in situ treatment methods that are able to effectively target this mass would be valuable to remediation practitioners kuppusamy et al 2016 schrick et al 2004 environmental remediation has been transformed over the past two decades by the integration of engineered nanoscale materials which have been used to treat water soil and air linley and thomson 2021 nanoremediation methods benefit from the high reactive surface area provided by nano size particles which offer enhanced interactions with target contaminants molnar et al 2016 o carroll et al 2013 schrick et al 2004 tratnyek and johnson 2006 and have the potential to minimize clean up cost and time relative to more traditional technologies tosco et al 2014 tratnyek and johnson 2006 nanomaterials such as metal oxides carbon nanotubes and bimetallic nanoparticles have been explored for the treatment of a variety of contaminants including heavy metals chlorinated compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls karn et al 2009 a major challenge for nanoremediation methods is to ensure efficient delivery of the nanoparticles nps throughout the target treatment zone while at the same time avoiding migration of the nps beyond this zone bishop et al 2010 elliott and zhang 2001 one effective strategy to minimize this issue is targeted delivery in which specific np coating materials such as polymers and surfactants are used to ensure both np mobility in the porous medium and binding to a target napl bishop et al 2010 linley et al 2019 by taking advantage of this capability the accumulation of nps within the target treatment zone increases with a concomitant decrease in the mass of nps required to achieve treatment goals bishop et al 2010 consequently treatment efficiency may be increased and the environmental risk of unwanted np migration and deposition beyond the target treatment zone can be reduced this targeted delivery concept mimics the injection of functionalized nanoparticles carrying therapeutic payloads into the human body to target specific receptors on tumors diseased cells or tissues davis et al 2008 targeted binding of nps to a napl source zone present in porous media has been investigated with some success through various modifications of the coating material bishop et al 2010 phenrat et al 2011 quinn et al 2005 sridevi and lakshmi 2013 the concept of targeted binding of nps to a napl interface was first demonstrated by saleh et al 2005 using a triblock copolymer coating around an iron np core quinn et al 2005 demonstrated enhanced partitioning of surfactant stabilized nonionic sorbitan triolate span 85 nano zero valent iron nzvi particles to napl in a field scale investigation while saleh et al 2007 used amphiphilic copolymer nps with a high hydrophobe hydrophile ratio for targeted binding at napl water interfaces a similar approach was evaluated by phenrat et al 2011 who reported improved targeted binding of copolymer coated nzvi particles to a napl recently we reported successful targeted binding of engineered iron oxide core nps towards napl impacted sand under saturated conditions linley et al 2019 linley et al 2020a 2020b this targeted binding was achieved by adding a copolymer coating to the surface of iron oxide nps which promoted hydrophobic interactions with a target napl crude oil as well as stability in an aqueous solution the hydrophobicity and stability of the nps were found to be proportional to the polymer structure and concentration nanoparticle attachment in oil impacted sand was found to increase when using polymers with a more hydrophobic structure and at lower concentrations while nanoparticle retention in non impacted sand columns decreased with decreasing hydrophobicity and increasing concentration although we have examined some factors affecting the binding response of these engineered nps to crude oil in saturated systems their transport and binding behaviour in unsaturated systems has yet to be established the transport of nps in a porous medium is controlled by their retention within pores lecoanet and wiesner 2004 which is predominantly affected by the system moisture content the composition of the porous medium sediments the physiochemical properties of the nps and the delivery rate of the injected np solution kumahor et al 2016 lin et al 2010 park et al 2016 in addition in some porous media the porosity can be separated into mobile porosity where water flow is continuous and immobile porosity where water is present as isolated clusters but loosely connected to the mobile porosity kumahor et al 2015b both solutes and nps can enter the immobile porosity by slow advection and or diffusion gao et al 2006 however some nps may be excluded from the immobile porosity due to their size bradford et al 2003 moisture content is often cited as a controlling parameter positively correlated with np transport e g torkzaban et al 2008 in saturated porous media retention is usually limited to pore straining and attachment at solid water interfaces swis while in unsaturated porous media the presence of an air phase introduces additional retention sites such as air water interfaces awis and low velocity regions such as air water solid aws interfaces bradford et al 2003 torkzaban et al 2008 retention at swis includes np attachment to sediment grains which depends on the physiochemical characteristics of the nps and the sediment surface properties an awi can retain nps by either capillary electrostatic or hydrophobic forces that depend on the np surface properties wan and wilson 1994 straining involves the physical trapping of nps in pores and pore throats which occurs in both saturated and unsaturated media it is typically predominant in unsaturated porous media due to constrained water flow in regions with smaller pores bradford et al 2003 and thin water films wan and wilson 1994 chen et al 2008 investigated the role of awis on the retention of titanium dioxide tio2 nps and concluded that more nps were retained at lower water saturations corresponding to film straining i e retention of nps in thin water films formed around air filled pores or sediments yecheskel et al 2018 found that the retention of silver nps to sediments increased with decreasing moisture content due to the presence of more awis leading to an increasing number of retention sites supporting this claim kumahor et al 2015a suggested that the retention of citrate coated silver nps in unsaturated sand packed columns was controlled by the presence of awis and swis using different flowrates corresponding to different water contents 0 17 0 29 and 0 35 v v the results from their model simulations indicated non equilibrium attachment at the swis and equilibrium attachment at the awis torkzaban et al 2008 investigated the impact of water content on np transport using experimentation and modeling tools and suggested that the extent of immobile porosity increased with decreasing water content which lead to greater retention of nps carboxylate modified latex in these regions in contrast fang et al 2013b showed that the retention of tio2 nps was not enhanced by decreasing water saturation in sand columns likely due to repulsive interactions between the negatively charged awi and the tio2 nps rahmatpour et al 2018 also reported a negligible effect of water saturation on the mobility of silver nps in undisturbed soil columns transient flow through an unsaturated system alters the water saturation and consequently the retention of nps at awis and swis prédélus et al 2017 torkzaban et al 2008 increasing the flowrate decreases the retention of nps due to a reduced immobile porosity and an increase in hydrodynamic forces acting on particles weakly retained at the swis torkzaban et al 2008 gao et al 2006 found that increased flowrate in unsaturated columns granular quartz sand remobilized nps retained at the aws interfaces and from immobile porosity regions liang et al 2013a observed less retention of surfactant stabilized silver nps at a higher darcy velocity 0 02 vs 0 006 cm min in columns loamy sand under unsaturated conditions kumahor et al 2015b investigated the effect of flowrate on the transport of citrate coated silver nps in unsaturated columns and reported less retention with increasing darcy velocity 0 04 to 0 28 cm min as a result of reduced immobile porosity similarly prédélus et al 2017 reported reduced np retention at a higher darcy velocity 0 127 vs 0 025 cm min presumably due to increased hydrodynamic forces acting on particles weakly retained at the awis natural porous medium properties such as texture i e sand silt clay content or grain size can significantly impact the transport and retention of nps fang et al 2009 observed significantly increased retention of tio2 nps in saturated soil columns with increasing clay content as a result of higher straining fang et al 2013a later investigated the transport of carbon nanotubes in 14 different soils using column experiments and showed increased nps retention in soils with smaller grain sizes d50 45 8 vs 165 3 μm and higher clay contents 53 vs 1 v v likely due to the presence of smaller pores which resulted in additional np straining raychoudhury et al 2014 investigated the retention of stabilized nzvi particles in columns packed with four different silica sands d50 775 510 250 150 μm and observed more retention in the finer sand which was attributed to straining as a dominant mechanism similarly kamrani et al 2018 also reported higher retention of carbon based nps at the swis in a smaller grain size quartz sand 0 2 0 5 mm vs 1 5 2 0 mm under both saturated and unsaturated conditions presumably due to increased straining hoggan et al 2016 investigated the mobility of tio2 nps in a lysimeter packed with layers of fine and medium sand and observed higher retention of nps in the fine sand layers which was attributed to smaller pore sizes and an increase in attachment sites increased transport of nps has been reported with higher dosing product of the input concentration and volume of the injected np solution which contributes to blocking or saturation of retention sites i e swis awis and aws surfaces and subsequent repulsive interaction between the retained nps and those in the aqueous phase chowdhury et al 2011 kasel et al 2013 showed a direct correlation between the mobility of multi wall carbon nanotubes and input concentration chowdhury et al 2011 found that a higher tio2 injection concentration 800 vs 100 mg l contributed to increased effluent mass recovery from saturated columns possibly as a result of particle particle repulsion in contrast phenrat et al 2010 reported higher mobility of nzvi at lower concentrations 30 mg l likely because of less agglomeration i e sticking of two or more nps and formation of clusters the research presented here is a continuation of the work reported by linley et al 2019 2020a 2020b on the design transport and binding of pluronic coated nps linley et al 2019 applied a tunable amphiphilic co polymer coating to iron oxide nps and demonstrated stability of these nps in aqueous suspension as well as interaction with a hydrophobic phase such that the nps preferentially bound to napl water interfaces in comparison to a non impacted porous medium the transport and targeted binding behaviour of these nps was demonstrated through saturated column experiments binding batch tests and np transport modeling linley et al 2019 linley et al 2020a 2020b the results showed that 54 of the mass of injected nps eluted i e were recovered from non impacted sand packed columns 15 cm and 100 cm long while almost all nps were retained in napl crude oil impacted sand packed columns 0 4 recovery linley et al 2020b also reported that the binding affinity of these nps to the napl was enhanced by decreasing the np coating concentration increasing the napl concentration and increasing temperature collectively this effort demonstrated that targeted delivery of nps to crude oil impacted porous media in saturated conditions is possible and contributed to our understanding of the application conditions required for efficient targeting based on their observations linley et al 2020a it was reported that binding of these nps was not dependent on dlvo interactions that are impacted by solution ionic strength in this paper we extend our previous findings to unsaturated conditions by initially evaluating the effect of initial water saturation porous medium texture input dosage and flowrate on np transport behaviour and then examine targeted np binding to crude oil impacted sediments using a series of column experiments to support the experimental observations and characterize the unsaturated transport and binding of the nps in unsaturated systems an advective dispersive reactive transport model that simulates mobile and immobile porosity regions reversible kinetic attachment detachment irreversible and depth dependent retention was used our discussion of the results focusses on differences amongst the various breakthrough curves generated the distribution of nps retained along the columns packed with crude oil and variations in np attachment and detachment rate coefficients 2 materials methods 2 1

linley 2019 nps with the higher coating concentration identified as the transport formulation have increased mobility and stability in aqueous suspension whereas nps with the lower coating

material sm section see fig sm 1 tem data indicated distinct particles with crystalline spherical cores within an amorphous polymer coating the lower coating concentration i e 2 5 g l resulted in the presence of small individually stabilized nps along with spherical np aggregates with an average size of 115 41 nm while for the higher coating concentration 10 g l the presence of large aggregates

repeatedly rinsed with millipore water until the filtrate ran clear and oven dried at 90 c overnight the nc sediment ncs was first dried at 90 c overnight gently homogenized and then sieved 1 mm mesh a synthetic silty sand sss d10 of 40 μm cu of 4 material 75 sand 23 silt and 2 clay was created by homogenizing 80 of the bs with 20 of the ncs particle size distributions were determined using

experiments were performed using plexiglas columns length of 15 cm inner diameter of 3 5 cm uniformly dry packed in 1 cm thick lifts with the selected porous medium material fig 1 the top and bottom of each column was fitted with a stainless steel screen 75 μm to contain the material and 1 cm thick layer of glass beads 0 2 mm fisher scientific to distribute flow to achieve consistent initial unsaturated conditions each column was first saturated bottom up with millipore water and then suction drained using a vacuum pump ma 32 gilson set at 6 86 kpa 70 cm of h2o to obtain saturated conditions each dry packed column was flushed with co2 gas for 2 h and then millipore water was injected bottom up for 10 h at a flowrate of 0 1 ml min the initial water content v v of each column was estimated through differential mass measurements before and after saturation and following the applied vacuum multiplied by the column bulk density mass of dry sediment volume of packed column to explore the impact of initial moisture content flowrate sediment type and np dosing on the transport behaviour of pluronic coated nps eight sets of experiments were performed table 1 using fe nps coated with 10 g l pluronic i e transport formulation although the primary focus was on the transport of np under unsaturated conditions np transport was also investigated in a fully saturated system and in an initially dry system to establish endpoint behaviour in all column experiments sodium bromide nabr was added as a conservative tracer to the fe np injection solution to reach a br concentration between 100 and 200 mg l results from preliminary transport experiments indicated that the presence of the nabr did not affect np transport behaviour each transport experiment involved a pulse injection of a specified volume of the np and br solution at the top of a column at a constant flowrate 0 14 ml min using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex 7535 04 the duration of the pulse injection was approximately 70 or 320 min depending on the experimental set table 1 following the pulse injection the influent was immediately switched to millipore water at the same flowrate until near complete breakthrough of the nps was achieved typically between 600 and 900 min to ensure unsaturated conditions were maintained as the np pulse migrated down the column the maximum darcy velocity flowrate cross sectional area used was less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 43 0 01 cm min for the bs and 0 16 0 00 cm min for the sss of a representative sediment packed column was estimated using a constant head test astm 2434 a low np 50 mg l middle np 500 mg l or high np 1000 mg l target injection np concentration denoted as set b1 b2 and b3 respectively was used depending on the experimental set table 1 for the fully saturated system set a and the initially dry system set c np 500 mg l was used to investigate the role of velocity a lower flowrate 0 06 ml min with np 1000 mg l was employed set d table 1 the np binding batch test data described below indicated a higher np mass attached to the sss compared to the bs and therefore a longer pulse duration 400 mins in conjunction with the high injection np concentration was selected for the transport experiments using sss set e1 for comparison purposes the identical higher np dose was used for a column packed with bs set e2 effluent samples were collected every 20 mins in 1 7 ml microcentrifuge polypropylene vials vwr mississauga on canada the effluent volume was continuously recorded and used to estimate the effluent flowrate each experimental set was conducted at room temperature 22 c and performed in triplicate except for set e2 which was a control experiment for set e1 and only one trial was performed a total of 22 column experiments were executed the targeted binding of nps towards a crude oil source zone present in an unsaturated system set f1 was explored using the cofe nps with 2 5 g l pluronic coating i e binding formulation the cofe nps were used in these transport and binding experiments to minimize the analytical interference caused by the background fe present in the bs when estimating the mass of nps attached to sediment sub samples linley 2019 demonstrated that the nps with either the fe or cofe core material with the same coating formulation behave similarly in porous media to prepare the crude oil impacted sediment to use for packing dry bs was first moistened using millipore water 0 2 v v then mixed with crude oil 2 wt heated to 60 c and homogenized by stirring a 5 cm thick layer of the impacted bs was packed using 1 cm thick lifts in the middle of each column from 5 to 10 cm from the bottom non impacted moistened bs was packed below and above the impacted zone see fig 1 the flowrate and cofe np input concentration were selected based on the results from the transport experiments table 1 similar to the fe np transport experiments a pulse injection of the np and br solution at the top of a column at a constant flowrate 0 14 ml min was followed by millipore water at the same flowrate until near complete breakthrough of the nps was achieved at the conclusion of this experiment the packed sediment was carefully excavated in 1 cm lifts from top to bottom and the mass of cofe nps retained in each lift was determined and used to generate a np retention profile as a control a transport experiment using br and the cofe np solution was also conducted in a column uniformly packed with moist bs 0 2 v v set f2 in total 4 column experiments were performed at room temperature 22 c 3 trials in set f1 and one trial in set f2 the np mass that can be attached to clean or crude oil impacted sediment mattached was determined by batch binding tests see sm 1 for a description for the fe np transport formulation values ranged from 7 8 2 3 mg kg for bs linley 2019 to 37 3 2 4 mg kg for sss while for the cofe np binding formulation values ranged from 8 2 0 6 mg kg for bs to 25 9 2 1 mg kg for crude oil impacted bs table sm 1 2 3 analyses the np concentration mg l was estimated from the total iron

method detection limit mdl of 0 004 mg l for both fe and co the concentration of bromide in each effluent sample was measured using ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 with a mdl of 0 5 mg l to estimate the mass of nps retained in each sediment lift epa method 3050b was used each lift was oven dried at 90 c for 12 h to remove water then homogenized before a 1 g sub sample was transferred into a 50 ml digestion tube vwr mississauga ontario to digest the oil and nps present in the sub sample 10 ml of concentrated hno3 70 was added to each tube which was then heated at 95 c for 30 min after cooling 5 ml of concentrated hno3 70 was added and the tube re heated to 95 c until the reaction was complete indicated by lack of brown smoke and the solution volume was reduced to 5 ml after the tube was cooled 3 ml of h2o2 was added and gently heated at 85 to 90 c until effervescence was observed once effervescence subsided the tube was removed from the heating block and allowed to cool when cooled an additional 3 ml of h2o2 30 was added and the tube heated 95 c until effervescence was insignificant and the solution volume was reduced to 5 ml to ensure complete digestion of the nps 10 ml of concentrated hcl 37 was added and the tube was heated 95 c until the volume was reduced to 5 ml the digestate was then diluted by millipore water to a total volume of 10 ml and filtered whatman no 41 the filtrate was analysed by icp oes to estimate cot which was used to calculate the mass of nps in each sediment sub sample mg of cofe nps per kg of dry sediment 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 description to simulate br transport and the np transport and binding behaviour observed in the column experiments a flexible one dimensional unsaturated flow and transport model 1dusat was used thomson 2019 in this model the mixed form of richards equation celia et al 1990 is used to estimate the unsaturated saturated flow conditions in conjunction with the single valued non hysteretic capillary pressure water saturation relationship and relative permeability function developed by van genuchten 1980 the numerical solution of the richards equation requires the knowledge of the porous medium hydraulic parameters including the residual water content θ r m3 m3 van genuchten model parameters n and α 1 m saturated hydraulic conductivity k s m s tortuosity factor l for the hydraulic

so that s w m and s w i m can be considered essentially equal šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 eqs 1 and 2 provide the mathematical framework to investigate the observed transport and binding of the nps in both mobile and immobile regions linley et al 2020b demonstrated that the reversible kinetic attachment detachment model employed in this model was able to represent the attachment behaviour of the fe nps in saturated column systems 2 4 2 parametrization to simulate the observed hydraulic behaviour for each column experiment the saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat was assigned the estimated values from hydraulic testing and the remaining required hydraulic parameters including total porosity ϕ t residual water saturation s wr and the van genuchten model parameters n and α were determined by calibration in this study the dynamically dimensioned search dds optimization method tolson and shoemaker 2007 within the ostrich toolkit matott 2017 was used as the calibration tool the dds method is a heuristic global search algorithm which overcomes common issues with other automatic calibration methods that find locally optimal solutions in the neighborhood of the initial solution e g quasi newton method or are relatively inefficient e g shuffled complex evolution algorithm the dds optimization method initially searches globally across the calibration range provided for each parameter and then becomes more local as it advances towards the specified number of total model evaluations the observed column outflow data were used as calibration targets with a root mean square error rmse objective function as the model calibration measure to ensure that an optimal solution was obtained three different calibration trials and 100 model evaluations were performed for each calibration trial a different initial parameter set was generated randomly from the calibration parameter range specified for each parameter to allow the dds algorithm to initiate from a new starting solution the parameter set from the calibration trial that generated the lowest rmse was deemed optimal posterior residual analyses were also used to assess goodness of fit r2 and the randomness of the residuals observed simulated values was evaluated using the shapiro wilk normality test shapiro and wilk 1965 for the suction drained columns an initial equilibrium pressure head and corresponding water saturation distribution was specified based on the measured value of the applied vacuum at the bottom of the column for the initial conditions of the crude oil impacted columns the average estimated water content was used to prescribe a pressure head at the bottom of the column using representative hydraulic parameters from the fe np transport experiment simulations this prescribed pressure was used to establish an initial hydrostatic pressure and water saturation profile transient boundary conditions for all unsaturated column systems see table 1 were identical with a free exit condition assigned at the bottom and a specified water flux assigned at the top of the column for the saturated column simulations constant water flux and constant pressure head boundary conditions were applied at the top and bottom of the column respectively the initial br and np concentrations in the computational domain were assigned zero and a total mass flux consistent with the duration of the injection pulse was specified as the top boundary condition and a zero dispersive flux as the bottom boundary condition the 15 cm long spatial domain was discretized into 1000 computational volumes and an initial time step interval of 1 0 s was used and allowed to increase by 0 02 until a maximum time step increment of 10 s was reached based on preliminary simulations the mass balance for water br and nps were all 0 07 using the calibrated hydraulic parameters column transport parameters dispersivity α l mobile porosity ϕ m immobile porosity ϕ im and first order mass exchange coefficient γ br for br were estimated a similar calibration approach as described above for the hydraulic parameters was used in conjunction with the observed br effluent data as the calibration target the np attachment detachment and straining terms in eqs 1 and 2 were not used in these br simulations finally using the calibrated hydraulic and transport parameters for each column the np transport and attachment parameters m a t t a c h m a x k a k d γ np were determined by calibration with the observed np effluent data as the calibration target for all np transport experiments table 1 the bulk density was assumed to be 1800 kg m3 ball et al 1990 for all column systems to account for minor variations between the batch binding tests and the column experiments the calibration range for m attach max was constrained to the 95 confidence interval ci as determined from the binding batch tests see table sm 1 based on preliminary simulations using the breakthrough curve btc data from the targeted binding experiment set f1 and f2 the straining term in eq 1 was activated introducing the straining rate coefficient k str as an additional calibration parameter for the targeted binding column simulations the mean grain diameter d 50 was assigned a value of 0 02 cm based on fig sm 2 and β was set to 0 432 as presented by bradford et al 2003 3 results discussion 3 1 hydraulic behaviour the average observed flowrates were 0 13 0 02 ml min n 21 and 0 06 0 01 ml min n 3 closely matching the target flowrates of 0 14 and 0 06 ml min table 1 for the target flowrate of 0 14 ml min flow started to appear at the column outlet between 85 and 122 mins for the bs suction drained systems sets b1 b2 b3 between 75 and 95 mins for the sss suction drained system set e1 and between 95 and 135 mins for the impacted system set f1 for the target flowrate of 0 06 ml min flow appeared at the column outlet between 165 and 245 mins in comparison for the initially dry system set c flow appeared at the column outlet later between 265 and 285 mins due to the lower initial water content in all systems the flow breakthrough profile reflecting the shape of the wetting front was sharp increasing from essentially no flow to a near steady flowrate in 20 5 mins e g see fig sm 3 the model was able to capture this sharp wetting front and provided flow behaviour representative of the observations r2 0 93 fig sm 3 the normality of residuals was also confirmed p 0 05 see fig sm 4 for example residual plots the calibrated hydraulic parameters ϕ t s wr n and α varied slightly between experiments due to minor differences in packing giving rise to small changes in pore connectivity see table sm 2 hydraulic parameters for the initially dry column systems were not determined since the capillary pressure water saturation relationship used in 1dusat is not appropriate for initially dry systems for the bs packed columns n 18 the average calibrated ϕ t s wr n and α were 0 33 0 05 0 20 0 02 1 28 0 08 and 14 93 0 19 1 m respectively and for the sss packed columns n 3 the average ϕ t s wr n and α were 0 31 0 01 0 19 0 01 1 17 0 65 and 11 00 0 82 1 m respectively the calibrated s wr and ϕ t values for both sss and bs suction drained column systems are similar as expected since sss is comprised of 80 bs and 20 of the silty sand material the estimated n values for the sss and bs materials are also similar which is reflective of the near identical shape of the pore size distribution the slightly larger estimated α value for bs compared to the sss is reflective of the lower fraction of fine grained particles fig sm 2 and hence the ability to drain at a lower capillary pressure fig sm 3 presents the observed and simulated effluent flow profiles for a suction drained column packed with sss from set e1 and one packed with bs from set e2 consistent with the estimated hydraulic parameters a similar flow profile shape was observed in these trials flow breakthrough at the column outlet occurred around the same time for both columns indicating similar initial water content and pore size distribution as can be observed in fig sm 3 the effluent flow profile from an impacted column set f1 and a control column set f2 have the same shape with nearly identical flow arrival at the column outlet indicating that the presence of the crude oil did not significantly alter flow behaviour 3 2 column experiments 3 2 1 btc observations to facilitate comparison between the various btcs generated the br and np concentrations were normalized by the injection concentration c o and the time axis was normalized by the time to the center of mass of the br btc t c br representative observed br and fe np btcs from the saturated set a suction drained set b2 and initially dry set c column experiments are shown in fig 2 see fig sm 5 for the btcs from the remaining trials the shape of the br btcs from all experiments except for the saturated columns set a were asymmetrical with a characteristic steep increase to the peak concentration followed by a falling limb with a noticeable tail fig 2 shortly after effluent breakthrough from the initially dry columns the br concentration increased rapidly to the peak concentration while for the suction drained systems the rising limb of the br btc began slightly after effluent breakthrough and then increased relatively slower than observed for set c to the peak concertation the higher degree of br btc tailing observed in initially dry columns compared to the suction drained columns is indicative of greater diversity of flow pathways in contrast the br btcs from the saturated columns were symmetric confirming that the observed br tail from the suction drained and initially dry columns is related to the unsaturated conditions similar tracer behaviour has been reported by others akhtar et al 2011 padilla et al 1999 prédélus et al 2017 and was attributed to the presence of either zones of immobile water i e low velocity regions or dead end pores leading to non equilibrium physical transport gao et al 2006 kumahor et al 2015b molnar et al 2014 torkzaban et al 2006 the shape of the observed fe np btcs from the initially dry and suction drained systems were also asymmetrical fig 2 while the fe np btcs from the saturated columns similar to their respective br btcs were symmetrical with a slightly lower normalized peak concentration compared to br in comparison to the suction drained system the fe np btcs from the initially dry system had significantly lower peak concentrations more tailing and delayed arrival this behaviour suggests an increase in retention sites for np attachment possibly due to more air phase present and more gradual release of nps from retention sites btc metrics for br and nps for all experimental sets are presented in table 2 the mass recovery of br and fe nps were estimated by integrating under their btcs and normalizing by the total mass injected m r m out m in x 100 see table 2 the recovery of br a conservative tracer was 100 while fe np recovery decreased from 83 in the saturated columns to 76 in the suction drained columns and to 25 in the initially dry columns consistent with the fe np m r estimates the average retained mass of nps per mass of solid estimated from mass balance mb c r e t a i n e d m b table 2 was significantly higher for the initially dry columns 18 6 0 2 mg kg compared to the suction drained 4 3 1 9 mg kg and saturated columns 3 4 mg kg the c r e t a i n e d m b for the dry columns set c is 2 4 times higher than the attachment capacity of fe nps to bs as estimated from the batch binding tests under saturated conditions 7 8 2 3 mg kg this increased np retention for the initially dry systems may be caused by fe np attachment to awi in addition to swis as well as physical trapping in lower velocity regions e g aws interfaces and grain grain junctions the attachment of fe nps to swis may occur due to van der waals forces acting between the peo block of the nps pluronic coating and the silica sio2 on sediment surfaces linley et al 2019 while capillary forces are mainly responsible for the fe np attachment at the awis these retention mechanisms produced fe np btcs that are significantly suppressed and delayed relative to their respective br btcs in the initially dry and suction drained columns as the water content increased behind the wetting front the extent of awis and the immobile regions decreased and some of the fe nps attached at these retention sites may have detached producing a long fe np btc tail fig 2 a b these observations are consistent with the effect of awis on np transport seen in the wider literature chen et al 2008 gao et al 2006 kumahor et al 2015a shang et al 2008 torkzaban et al 2008 yecheskel et al 2018 for example gao et al 2006 suggested that during transient flow a fraction of nps in contact with immobile region awis are susceptible to release when these regions are reconnected with the mobile porosity similarly shang et al 2008 observed mobilization of colloids nps and their subsequent elution by a wetting front indicating the importance of capillary forces on np migration to quantify the delayed breakthrough of fe nps compared to br the time to the center of mass of the fe np btc t c np was divided by t c br to calculate an arrival time ratio t c np t c br table 2 the arrival of the center of mass of the fe nps btcs was significantly delayed with respect to br for the initially dry columns compared to the saturated and suction drained columns i e t c np t c br of 1 22 compared to 1 00 for set a and 1 01 for set b2 the near simultaneous arrival of the center of mass of the fe nps and br btcs in most experimental sets as well as a delayed arrival of fe nps in other sets i e set c and set e1 table 2 indicate that size exclusion did not occur in any of the systems investigated bradford et al 2003 prédélus et al 2014 2017 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 fig 3 shows btc data for suction drained bs systems at low 0 06 ml min set d and high 0 14 ml min set b3 flowrates no substantial difference is observed between the shapes of these btcs except for a slightly lower peak concentration and less tailing at the lower flowrate breakthrough of fe nps and br occurred around the same normalized time t t c br and both sets had the same arrival time ratio t c np t c br of 1 01 0 01 for set b3 and 1 00 0 01 for set d the m r of fe nps table 2 for the lower and higher flowrate sets were 76 7 and 91 5 respectively due to an increase in both residence time and air saturation in the lower flowrate columns chen et al 2008 demonstrated that slow flowrates resulted in higher retention of nps due to the longer residence time for nps tio2 to attach to awis shang et al 2008 observed decreased colloid np mass recovery under lower velocity conditions 0 288 to 0 018 cm min and related this behaviour to an increase in the awis kumahor et al 2015a investigated silver np transport in unsaturated columns subjected to three flowrates i e 2 5 9 7 and 17 0 cm h and observed increased mobility with increased flowrate consistent with the results from experimental sets b1 b2 and b3 the lower flowrate corresponds to an increase in awis and higher np retention representative br and fe np btcs for the suction drained bs systems at three different fe np injection concentrations 50 mg l set b1 500 mg l set b2 1000 mg l set b3 are shown in fig 4 all btcs had similar asymmetrical profiles with a center of mass arrival time ratio of 1 table 2 as expected the fe np peak concentration c c 0 increased with a higher injection concentration from an average of 0 48 b1 to 0 57 b2 and 0 61 b3 consistent with the increasing mass recovery average m r 53 for b1 76 5 for b2 and 91 5 for b3 this is consistent with other literature findings for example mass recovery increased with injection dosage for tio2 nps in saturated columns and was attributed to particle particle repulsion chowdhury et al 2011 when nps are attached to sand grains i e swis they can form a shield of nps on the surface where unfavorable particle particle interactions limit further np attachment at higher dosages more nps occupy attachment sites and particle particle repulsion dominates leading to higher elution of nps high np concentrations can also decrease mass recovery due to agglomeration phenrat et al 2010 raychoudhury et al 2012 or attractive interactions e g electrostatic forces between the attached and suspended nps liu et al 1995 however in this work the pluronic np coating establishes a neutral charge and for the concentrations range investigated np agglomeration is hindered by steric interactions fig 5 compares representative btcs from sss packed columns e1 and bs packed columns e2 in contrast to the btcs from the other suction drained experiments with a lower injection volume or dose the btcs for both set e1 and set e2 reached a plateau peak concentration of c c 0 1 the fe np and br btcs from the bs column essentially overlap t c np t c br 1 00 while the fe np btc for the sss column was delayed with t c np t c br 1 09 table 2 leading to an average m r of 65 1 and 96 for sss and bs columns respectively the addition of 20 of the silty sand material in the sss compared to bs had a significant impact on np transport and retention behaviour the average c retained mb was 65 1 mg kg for the sss packed columns which is significantly higher than the average c retained mb of 6 4 mg kg for the bs columns and the estimated attachment capacity of fe nps to sss sediment in binding batch tests m attached 37 3 2 4 mg kg table sm 1 this increased np retention in the column system is likely due to the presence of awis that would not be encountered in the batch test previous work that evaluated the effect of porous medium texture on np transport has reported both a lower mass recovery and peak concentration with decreasing grain size fang et al 2009 kamrani et al 2018 liang et al 2013b in contrast for the fe nps used in this study the breakthrough front fig 5 a was essentially delayed until all attachment sites were saturated and then the concentration increased to c c 0 1 similar to observations reported by torkzaban et al 2010 and wang et al 2014 to evaluate the targeted binding capability and transport of the cofe nps under unsaturated conditions experimental parameters bs flowrate of 0 14 ml min np injection concentration of 500 mg l were selected based on the findings from the fe np transport experiments in addition an injection pulse of 20 ml table 1 high input dosage was used to ensure sufficient cofe np mass was observed in the effluent since the batch binding test results indicated a higher attachment capacity to clean and crude oil impacted bs as compared to fe nps table sm 1 representative br and cofe np btcs for the crude oil impacted set f1 and control set f2 columns are shown in fig 6 the br btcs shape was similar for both experimental sets with a slightly lower t c br for the crude oil impacted column likely due to minor packing variations and presence of the crude oil in both column sets the cofe np btcs were delayed relative to their respective br btcs and had lower peak concentrations both of these features were more pronounced in the crude oil impacted columns compared to the control columns the average t c np t c br was 1 22 0 04 with m r 26 3 for the oil impacted columns and 1 05 with m r 49 for the control column table 2 consistent with these values the retained mass of cofe nps per mass of solid c retained mb is twice as high in the oil impacted columns compared to the control column 33 0 2 0 vs 15 0 mg kg the increase in the mass of cofe nps retained and the delay in arrival of the btcs for the oil impacted columns reflects the ability of the cofe nps to preferentially bind to the crude oil under unsaturated conditions the distribution of cofe nps retained along the oil impacted columns using the solid digestion and icp oes method are presented in fig 7 for the two trials of set f1 these profiles clearly show a higher concentration of cofe nps retained in the crude oil zone 27 to 35 mg kg compared to the lower non impacted zone 0 to 0 05 m of the columns 8 to 18 mg kg in the non impacted zone adsorptive interactions between peo and the surface of the sand grains as well as capillary forces at awis contribute to np attachment np aggregation as a result of the lower pluronic coating concentration used on the cofe nps may have also contributed to np attachment especially near the column inlet additionally hydrophobic forces stronger due to the lower pluronic coating concentration on the cofe nps between the cofe np and the air phase may increase retention compared to fe nps which saw c retained mb between 4 and 6 mg kg in suction drained bs packed columns these hydrophobic interactions are also responsible for cofe np attachment to the crude oil impacted zone in the non impacted zone above the crude oil zone 0 10 to 0 15 m the concentration of cofe nps ranged from 19 to 32 mg kg for the first trial of set f1 and 15 to 28 mg kg for the second trial with a distribution suggestive of depth dependent straining these retention mechanisms decreased cofe np transport compared to the fe nps as demonstrated by the lower m r 49 vs 91 5 and c retained mb 15 0 vs 4 3 0 6 mg kg for sets f2 and b3 respectively under nearly identical conditions i e same flowrate input dosage aquifer material this is also manifested as a decreased peak concentration and delayed arrival of cofe nps with respect to fe nps fig sm 6 3 2 2 model simulations the asymmetrical shape of the br btcs indicative of physical non equilibrium transport was captured by the model eqs 1 and 2 without the attachment detachment and straining terms with r2 0 95 see figs 2 to 6 attempts to fit the br btcs from all the suction drained columns considering a single porosity system f s 1 were unable to replicate the significant observed tail in contrast since no tailing was observed in the br btcs from the saturated columns set a the model was able to produce a good fit r2 0 99 by considering a single porosity system fig 2 c see fig sm 4 for example residual plots a summary of the calibrated br transport parameters for each experimental set is provided in table 3 see sm 2 for explanations we assumed that the np transport and attachment detachment parameters were identical in both the mobile and immobile porosity regions because the sediments were homogenized prior to packing the columns a range of values for the ratio of the np diameter to the mean grain diameter d p d 50 has been suggested from 0 002 bradford et al 2002 to 0 154 herzig et al 1970 as the threshold when physical straining is dominant for the fe nps dp 7 6 10 6 mm and porous media d 50 bs 0 18 mm sss 0 14 mm employed in this study this ratio is 0 002 and thus the straining term was not used for simulations of the fe np transport experiments acceptable fits to the observed fe np btcs r2 0 92 were obtained and residuals were normally distributed p 0 05 selected simulated fe np btcs are shown on figs 2 to 5 attempts to fit the observed cofe np btcs from the impacted and control columns using the model components employed for the simulation of fe np btcs were unable to reproduce the peak concentrations as noted above the cofe np retention profiles for set f1 fig 7 above the crude oil zone 0 10 to 0 15 m appear to follow an exponential shape characteristic of depth dependant straining likely due to aggregation from the lower pluronic coating concentration on the cofe nps fig sm 1 the lower pluronic coating concentration used for the cofe nps 2 5 vs 10 g l p104 is thought to be insufficient to completely saturate the surface of individual particles fig sm 1 making them more susceptible to aggregation with the inclusion of depth dependent straining the model was able to reproduce the cofe np btcs fig 6 r2 0 95 residuals normally distributed p 0 05 and the retention profile fig 7 r2 0 83 residuals normally distributed p 0 05 the calibrated straining rate coefficient k str 3 0 0 6 10 4 s is similar to the value reported by linley et al 2021 for the same cofe nps and same coating formulation in saturated conditions see sm 3 table 3 lists the calibrated parameters while evidence of straining was observed in the np binding experiment and addressed by a depth dependent straining term in the model a mechanistic investigation into this retention behaviour was not within the scope of this research for all the suction drained and saturated column systems except for set e1 the optimal m a t t a c h m a x was within the 95 ci of the np attachment capacity as estimated from the batch binding tests in general the calibrated m a t t a c h m a x value was slightly higher than the average observed c r e t a i n e d m b values table 2 depending on the injected dose of the fe nps to achieve an acceptable calibration of the observed btcs from the suction drained columns packed with sss set e1 the upper bound of the calibration range for m a t t a c h m a x was increased the average calibrated value was 65 4 0 3 mg kg which was consistent with the observed mass of retained fe nps c r e t a i n e d m b 65 2 4 4 mg kg and almost twice the estimated attachment capacity from the batch binding tests table sm 1 the need for a higher m a t t a c h m a x value indicates that additional or enhanced np attachment mechanisms were occurring during the migration of fe nps through the sss packed systems that were not captured by the batch binding test treumann et al 2014 explored differences in np attachment mechanisms between batch and saturated column studies and speculated on the role of a variety of forces acting on the nps during their transport in column systems including hydrodynamic drag and lift electrical double layer repulsion or attraction and london van der waals interaction the calibrated first order mass transfer rate coefficient for the fe nps γ fe np varied slightly 1 10 5 to 4 10 5 s except for experimental set d where the calibrated value was an order of magnitude smaller 6 10 6 s due to the lower injection flowrate the calibrated γ fe np values are consistent with the observation noted above for γ br prédélus et al 2014 also found that the mass transfer rate coefficient for nps and tracer between mobile and immobile regions was on the same order of magnitude 2 10 4 to 9 10 4 s for np vs 3 4 10 4 s for tracer the calibrated attachment rate coefficient k a for all column systems packed with bs varied over a narrow range from 1 10 5 to 5 10 5 s the presence of additional retention sites i e awis in the suction drained columns set b2 compared to the saturated experimental set a did not have a statistically significant impact on k a 5 1 10 5 s for set b3 vs 1 6 10 5 s for set a p 0 05 conversely the calibrated detachment rate coefficient k d was found to be statistically different between the two sets for set b2 it was an order of magnitude larger than k d for set a 6 0 10 7 vs 7 5 10 6 s which manifests as a longer tail in the fe nps btcs this is attributed to the gradual release of nps from the additional retention sites i e awis in the drained columns set b2 due to the gradual decrease in the air water interfacial area during transient flow conditions sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 it has been reported that nps usually attach to awis irreversibly by capillary forces bradford et al 2003 flury and aramrak 2017 until the dissolution of trapped air behind the wetting front occurs sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 no significant difference in the calibrated k a was attained for the three experimental systems that were used to investigate the impact of dosing or concentration on fe np transport set b1 set b2 and set b3 fig 4 however k d slightly increased with higher dosing from 3 0 to 7 5 to 9 1 10 6 s for set b1 b2 and b3 respectively p 0 05 the increase in k d in response to the higher injection dosing is likely due to increased particle particle collision between those in the bulk solution and those attached and their subsequent remobilization collectively based on the observed btcs and the calibrated parameters it appears that for the range of input concentrations investigated 50 to 1000 mg l concentration had no significant impact on the transport behaviour of the fe nps used for set d lower flowrate k a was nearly identical to that determined for set b3 1 50 0 8 10 5 s compared to 1 91 0 43 10 5 s while the average k d was about 36 times smaller 2 5 0 8 10 7 s compared to 9 1 0 4 10 6 s suggesting a relative decrease in detachment the decreased connectivity between the mobile and immobile regions indicated by an order of magnitude lower γ fe np is also responsible it has been reported that the primary retention mechanism of nps at awis is capillary forces during steady or low flowrates wan and wilson 1994 where the remobilization of retained nps was found to be very slow or negligible and thus the attachment of nps at awis can be considered irreversible any changes in the flowrate may alter the retention of nps by affecting kinetics i e k a or k d torkzaban et al 2008 liang et al 2013b and makselon et al 2017 suggested that the rate of np attachment increased higher k a while k d decreased or became negligible with lower flowrates indicating irreversible attachment for the columns packed with the sss material set e1 the average calibrated k a was an order of magnitude larger than the column systems packed with bs 4 0 1 03 10 4 s vs 1 10 5 to 5 10 5 s while the calibrated k d was 8 times smaller than the bs packed systems table 3 suggesting a significant increase in attachment to and decrease in detachment from the sss material the increased k a in combination with a larger m attach max manifested the delayed arrival of the fe nps btc fig 5 as a result of the increased clay and silt content larger surface area and thus more np retention sites an increase in k a with decreasing grain size was reported by liang et al 2013b who observed a higher mass of silver nps retained in columns packed with smaller sized sand and concluded that the higher k a represented increased mass transfer to the grain surfaces driven by larger surface area it has been proposed that straining becomes the dominant retention mechanism as the average grain size decreases raychoudhury et al 2014 hoggan et al 2016 fang et al 2013b kamrani et al 2018 however in the case of the fe nps straining was unlikely as previously described the calibrated m attach max was 3 times higher for the crude oil zone in the oil impacted columns 26 4 1 2 mg kg compared to the control column 7 8 mg kg and the upper and lower clean zones within the impacted column 8 2 1 3 mg kg the calibrated attachment rate coefficient k a for the crude oil zone 2 8 0 15 10 2 s was two orders of magnitude greater than k a for the clean sand zones in the oil impacted and the control columns 2 4 10 4 and 2 7 1 2 10 4 s in contrast the calibrated detachment rate coefficient k d for the crude oil zone and the clean zones of the oil impacted columns set f1 as well as the control column set f2 were essentially the same values varied from 4 8 1 1 10 6 to 7 6 1 1 10 6 s the significantly larger attachment capacity m attach max and rate coefficient k a determined for the crude oil zone is a direct result of the hydrophobic forces between the amphiphilic np coating and crude oil compared to non impacted zones comparing the estimated parameters for the fe nps in set b3 with cofe nps in set f2 under nearly identical conditions the estimated k a for the cofe nps in control column was about an order of magnitude higher than k a for fe nps in set b3 24 10 5 vs 1 9 0 4 10 5 s while the estimated m attach max and k d were nearly equal for both sets the higher ratio of k a to k d for the cofe nps in unsaturated columns compared to fe nps in drained columns is consistent with the lower recovered mass of cofe nps from the control column f2 4 summary and implications a series of unsaturated column experiments were used to investigate the role of initial water saturation porous medium texture input dosage and flowrate on the transport of amphiphilic co polymer coated iron oxide nps fe nps while the focus was on the transport behaviour of the fe nps in unsaturated porous media experiments in saturated and initially dry systems provided endpoint controls to contextualize the results which showed fe np transport was affected by the initial water content under near identical fe np injection conditions 83 of the fe np mass injected was eluted from the saturated columns while 25 was eluted from initially dry columns and 76 from suction drained columns the fe np and br btcs co injected conservative tracer from the saturated columns were symmetric while for the suction drained columns both the fe np and br btcs had an asymmetrical shape with a noticeable tail indicative of physical non equilibrium transport the fe np btcs were also dampened relative to the br btcs with lower normalized peak concentrations compared to those from the saturated columns considerably more br btc tailing was observed for the initially dry columns indicative of a greater diversity of flow paths compared to the suction drained columns additionally the fe np btcs showed significantly lower peak concentrations a higher degree of tailing and delayed arrival of the center of mass relative to their respective br btcs compared to those from the suction drained columns the changes in fe nps transport behaviour from saturated to suction drained and then to initially dry conditions are reflective of an increase in fe np retention sites due to a decrease in water saturation with a concomitant increase in the magnitude of awis behind the wetting front the quantity of awis is expected to gradually decrease as the water saturation increases and some attached fe nps are slowly released which manifests as a long tail in np btcs the asymmetrical shape of the br and fe np btcs from the suction drained systems were successfully described using a model that considered br and fe np transport in mobile and immobile porosity regions in contrast a single porosity system was sufficient to characterize the observed btcs from the saturated columns a simple attachment detachment model with nonlinear langmuirian blocking was used to represent fe np retention and release the presence of additional retention sites i e awis in the suction drained columns compared to the saturated columns did not have a significant impact on the fe np attachment rate coefficient k a however the detachment rate coefficient k d was found to be an order of magnitude smaller for the saturated columns compared to the suction drained columns a combination of the mass transfer of fe nps between the immobile and mobile porosity as well as the gradual detachment from the retention sites swis and awis was responsible for a longer observed tail of the fe np btcs for the suction drained columns compared to the saturated columns the slow detachment of nps from awis is expected under transient flow conditions due to the gradual decrease in the air water interfacial area and the extent of immobile porosity regions a lower recovered mass of fe nps from the columns with a lower flowrate 76 vs 91 was attributed to an increase in the residence time and decrease in water saturation the estimated k a was nearly identical at both flowrates while the k d was 36 times smaller at the lower flowrate the significantly smaller k d compared to k a at the lower flowrate represents a relative lower rate of detachment and is consistent with the lower recovered mass of nps for the range of injection concentrations investigated 50 to 1000 mg l no substantial impact was observed on fe np transport behaviour it was also observed that for the columns packed with higher clay and silt content sediments more fe np retention larger m attach max and k a occurred resulting in a significantly delayed arrival of the fe np btc with respect to br which was attributed to the larger surface area the estimated m attach max for the sss packed columns was twice the value determined by the binding batch tests clearly indicating that additional np attachment mechanisms occurred during the transport of fe nps through these sediments that were not captured in the binding batch tests the capability of targeted binding of cofe nps coated with a lower concentration of a pluronic block co polymer to crude oil present in an unsaturated system was investigated under identical cofe np injection conditions 49 of the cofe np mass injected was recovered from the non impacted control column while only 26 was recovered from the oil impacted columns the cofe np btcs from the impacted columns exhibited lower peak concentrations and significantly delayed arrival of the center of mass relative to the respective br btcs and those from the control column both the simulated cofe np btcs and cofe np retention profile compared well with the observed data when a depth dependant straining term in the model was used this added model requirement is a result of a combination of increased retention of cofe nps capillary and or hydrophobic forces at the awis and aggregation due to the lower pluronic coating concentration and larger size compared to fe nps the m attach max for the crude oil zone was 3 times higher than that for the surrounding non impacted zones as well as the control column the estimated k a was about two orders of magnitude higher for the crude oil zone than the k a for the non impacted zones and control column however the estimated k d was nearly identical the significant higher ratio of k a to k d in the crude oil zone compared to non impacted zone is indicative of stronger attachment of cofe nps to the crude oil these findings extend our understanding of the transport and binding behaviour of pluronic coated nps from saturated to unsaturated systems where the presence of an air phase significantly impacts np transport specifically the additional retention processes in unsaturated porous media e g np attachment at the air water and air water solid interfaces increase the transport complexity of these nps relative to saturated porous media findings established the significant role of initial water content injection flowrate and porous medium texture on np transport and retention behaviour this study also confirmed targeted delivery of pluronic coated nps to a crude oil zone in unsaturated column systems which was previously only understood in saturated conditions broadening their potential utility finally our simulation efforts indicated that a model that considered np transport in both mobile and immobile porosity regions could better reproduce np physical and chemical non equilibrium transport than a conventional single porosity model this study has clarified the influence of porous medium and injection parameters on the transport of polymer coated engineered nps as well as a modeling approach that should be used to capture their transport behaviour hence these parameters and approaches should be considered when designing np delivery strategies in natural porous media enabling optimal np utilization for monitoring or

1281,ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of riverbank filtration rbf schemes due mainly to the complications it causes during post treatment e g during chlorination during rbf ammonium can be formed in the riverbed by mineralization of organic nitrogen column experiments with riverbed sediments and river water from the elbe were performed to evaluate the controls on ammonium concentrations during riverbed infiltration concentrations of ammonium went from 0 1 mgn l in the feed water up to 1 mgn l in the columns effluent higher temperatures and lower infiltration rates led to increased ammonium concentrations in the effluent this shows higher susceptibility to ammonium increases of rbf settings in warmer climates and points to potential threats of climate change to water quality at rbf sites in the later phases of the experiments after the columns have been flushed their pore volumes several times ammonium concentrations continually decreased this behavior was attributed to the partial consumption of easily degradable organic material in the sediments leading to lesser reducing conditions and lower mineralization rates based on operation with varied nitrate concentrations 0 11 mgn l and 15n isotopic measurements dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was not shown to be relevant in the formation of ammonium anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox however was hypothesized to be an important sink of ammonium inside the columns which indicates that rivers with high nitrate concentrations such as the elbe may have a buffer of protection against ammonium formation during rbf graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen pathways water quality hyporheic zone redox reactions anammox nitrogen isotopes 1 introduction river bank filtration rbf is a process by which surface water is subjected to subsurface flow prior to extraction around the world especially in europe this process is used as a pre treatment step for drinking water supply during infiltration and subsurface flow natural attenuation processes lead to partial removal of suspended solids biodegradable organic compounds and pathogens hiscock and grischek 2002 as the water infiltrates the riverbed reducing conditions usually set in this happens because the riverbed is typically a highly biologically active layer which contains high amounts of biologically available organic matter reducing conditions can cause the reduction of nitrate by denitrification but also the mobilization of manganese and iron and consequent increase of both in the abstracted water which impairs both water quality and well operation grischek and paufler 2017 additionally ammonium can be formed in the riverbed through mineralization of organic nitrogen as seen at the rbf sites described in doussan et al 1998 pan et al 2018 and de vet et al 2010 in turn inorganic nitrogen can be assimilated to organic nitrogen by microorganisms the difference between gross mineralization and gross assimilation is called net mineralization but in the following text mineralization will always refer to net mineralization ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of rbf schemes although not toxic for humans ammonium is a problematic compound during post treatment where for example it can compromise chlorination efficiency and cause failure of filters in the removal of manganese who 2011 furthermore 1 mg l of ammonium in water leads to the consumption of around 3 6 mg l of dissolved oxygen do during nitrification thus leading to stronger reducing conditions in the aquifer therefore the cost efficient operation of an rbf system can be affected by the concentration and behavior of ammonium ammonium sources and behavior during rbf have been previously investigated at different rbf sites doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 jacobs et al 1988 pan et al 2018 de vet et al 2010 and a review of ammonium behavior of 40 sites from 25 different literature sources is given by covatti and grischek 2021 there are four possible sources of ammonium at a given rbf site surface water reactions in the riverbed leaching from the vadose zone between river and wells and landside groundwater mineralization of organic nitrogen in the riverbed is the main process forming ammonium during rbf covatti and grischek 2021 and is the focal point of this article during riverbed infiltration while the riverbed is still oxic ammonium is attenuated by nitrification where ammonium is oxidized by the river s dissolved oxygen to form nitrate oxygen depletion often occurs within the first centimeters of infiltration where ammonium present in surface water is partially or completely nitrified while ammonium formed deeper in the riverbed is transported further to the aquifer as the aquifer usually remains anoxic during bank filtration ammonium formed in the riverbed can reach the wells and constitute a problem for post treatment the primary goal of this article is to investigate the main controls on ammonium formation and attenuation in the hyporheic zone during rbf column experiments with riverbed sediments from the river elbe germany are thereby utilized to simulate the processes occurring in the hyporheic zone and to analyze the impacts of river water quality temperature and infiltration rates in ammonium formation attenuation and exchange processes the behavior of other redox relevant parameters such as ph nitrate manganese iron and dissolved organic carbon doc were also analyzed due to their importance regarding the cost efficiency of rbf systems hiscock and grischek 2002 in addition to mineralization dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra eq 1 is another process occurring during reducing conditions which can theoretically contribute to ammonium formation during riverbed infiltration although dnra has never been reported at any rbf site the process has been described to occur at freshwater stream sediments in the past kelso et al 1997 storey et al 2004 many authors suggest that dnra is only relevant when a high oc no3 ratio is present e g oc no3 15 burgin and hamilton 2007 pandey et al 2019 tiedje 1982 therefore ammonium formation by dnra is dependent on the organic content of the riverbed 1 2 h no 3 2 c h 2 o nh 4 2 co 2 h 2 o in addition to nitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox eq 2 is also capable of attenuating ammonium by combining ammonium to nitrite and forming nitrogen gas anammox has rarely been recognized as an important ammonium sink in freshwater streams and rbf sites but it s known to play an important role in anoxic wastewater oxygen depleted zones of the ocean temperate shelf sediments sea ice arctic shelf sediments burgin and hamilton 2007 2 nh 4 no 2 n 2 h 2 o the roles of dnra and anammox in the hyporheic zone during riverbank filtration are not clear and their potential occurrence is therefore an additional goal of the current study by using 15n as a tracer it is possible to estimate the rates of mineralization dnra and denitrification christensen et al 2000 nielsen 1992 reinhardt et al 2006 in order to assess nitrogen species transformations occurring in the experiments 15n isotopic values were measured additionally the columns were operated with river water with artificially increased nitrate concentrations and with artificially removed nitrate to evaluate nitrate concentrations impact on ammonium behavior columns experiments are often used to study nitrogen processes in water and soil at different environments abel et al 2012 carrey et al 2014 groeschke et al 2016 liu et al 2017 silver et al 2018 storey et al 2004 especially relevant to this study are the column experiments made by liu et al 2017 which investigated nitrogen transformations in the hyporheic zone using riverbed sediments flushed with synthetic river water and synthetic groundwater ammonium concentrations increased from less 0 2 mgn l in the influent up to about 1 1 mgn l in the columns effluent with lower infiltration rates higher residence time leading to higher ammonium concentrations storey et al 2004 also investigated nitrogen transformations in different undisturbed riverbed sediment cores increase in ammonium concentrations from 0 1 mgn l in the influent to up to 0 5 mgn l in the columns effluent were observed and ammonium in the effluent showed a strong correlation with the amount of organic material in the columns sediments previous column experiment studies paufler et al 2018 rohr et al 2014 have also been done to assess the impact of climate variables to bank filtration however both used aquifer sediments which contain much less organic material than riverbed sediments and are less biologically active in those experiments only manganese reducing conditions were reached and thus displayed negligible iron release very low ammonium formation was observed by rohr et al 2014 with a maximum of 0 08 mgn l and ammonium was not measured by paufler et al 2018 2 methods 2 1 set up of column experiments six columns with riverbed sediments were set up in the laboratory fig 1 the columns are named from s1 to s6 each column is 50 cm long with an inner diameter of 7 5 cm and made of galvanized steel the sediments were taken from the riverbed about 10 to 20 cm below the water sediment interface at the left bank of the river elbe near the catchment of the rbf waterworks torgau ost in germany the riverbed near torgau is composed of medium to fine gravel and characterized by erosive conditions however the sediments were taken from the inside of river groynes thus containing finer sediments and more organic material then the regular river channel furthermore the sediments were wet sieved to a grain size 2 mm during the filling of the columns the sediment was compacted every 5 cm the compaction and filling of the columns were performed while the sediments were completely saturated to avoid any residual air within the sediments the mean travel time and effective porosity ne in the columns were determined from electrical conductivity nacl breakthrough curves from tracer experiments performed before start up the columns were stored in thermostatic cabinets and were operated at different temperatures s1 and s2 at 30 c s3 and s4 at 20 c and s5 and s6 at 10 c the flow through the columns was adjusted to different flow rates during the experiments using prominent beta diaphragm pumps prominent germany to represent different infiltration rates upon starting the operation of the columns there was a desorption of accumulated ions leading to increased concentrations of ammonium iron and high ec values therefore before the start of the analysis the columns were operated for 23 days with elbe river water until stable concentrations of ammonium and iron and stable electrical conductivity ec were reached 5 variation within two consecutive days columns were operated in cycles of 7 days with elbe river water elbe river water was collected weekly and on the seventh day of each cycle the input water was changed as well as operating parameters thus starting a new cycle in total 15 cycles were performed table 1 which can be divided in 4 distinct phases phase 1 cycles c1 4 phase 2 cycles c5 7 phase 3 cycles c8 10 and phase 4 5 cycles with distinct nitrate concentrations c11 c15 a more detailed description of the columns operation according to pore volumes pv flushed is displayed in fig a1 appendix in phases 1 3 the cycles were operated with different flow rates 0 6 1 ml min which represent different infiltration rates 0 2 0 33 m3 m2 d such infiltration rates have been estimated for the rbf scheme at torgau ost the same infiltration rates and conditions are repeated in phases 1 3 in order to evaluate differences according to long term operation during phase 4 c11 15 all columns were operated at 30 c twice with no nitrate in the input water 0 mgn l c11 and c12 twice with natural nitrate concentrations in the river water 2 and 3 mgn l c13 and c14 and once with artificially increased nitrate 11 mgn l c15 with the goal to observe the impact of nitrate on ammonium concentrations infiltration of river water having no nitrate 0 mgn l was simulated after treatment via an anion exchange resin which resulted in an increase in ec decrease in ph and almost complete removal of sulfate ph was then adjusted to previous levels by addition of sodium hydroxide naoh the addition of nitrate to reach 11 mgn l was made with potassium nitrate kno3 which increased the water ec by about 80 μs cm but with few other changes in between the operation phases a total of 3 desorption experiments were carried out to evaluate ammonium exchange processes once between phases 1 and 2 and twice between phases 2 and 3 during the desorption experiments column operation was stopped and the water was left stagnant inside the columns for an extended period of time afterwards the columns were restarted and all water quality parameters were measured daily between phases 1 and 2 the columns were stopped for 18 days at room temperature ca 20 c and were subsequently operated with elbe river water at 1 ml min flow rate for 10 days to wash out the accumulated ions such as ammonium and iron d1 phase 2 commenced once concentrations of ammonium and iron were stable during the wash out processes ammonium concentrations were measured to estimate the retardation factor rd of ammonium at each column the same experiment was performed between phase 2 and 3 d2 the third desorption experiment d3 was performed right after the washout process of d2 this time the columns were stopped for 22 days and maintained at their usual temperatures 10 20 and 30 c followed by another 10 day period of wash out before the start of phase 3 at the desorption experiments rd was estimated for ammonium in each column as the time in pore volumes pv in which the relative concentration c c0 was equal to 0 5 nunes delgado et al 1997 this however disregards possible ammonium consuming reactions such as nitrification and anammox which may occur once the columns restart operation the nitrogen isotopic footprint was measured in ammonium and nitrate of in and output water from cycles c1 to c7 for the columns at 30 c s1 and s2 as well as in the bulk nitrogen in the sediments 15n was not measured at the 10 c and 20 c columns because ammonium concentrations were too low for the employed method of ammonium isotope analysis in order to identify the reactions occurring in the column experiments 15n enriched nitrate was spiked in the feed water except for cycle 1 similar to what is done in the 15n isotope pairing technique developed by nielsen 1992 to measure denitrification rates in sediments and amended by christensen et al 2000 to measure dnra rates the spiking was done using potassium nitrate with 98 15n which required only very small quantities of nitrate addition 0 01 mgn l to enrich influent nitrate to the desired isotopic footprint ca 100 therefore the nitrate additions during spiking did not led to any detectable increase in nitrate concentration in the input water dnra and mineralization are the reactions which can potentially form ammonium inside the columns the substrate for mineralization is organic nitrogen which is present as solid organic nitrogen son in the column sediments and as dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen don and pon respectively in the feed water the isotopic footprint of bulk n in the sediment was measured and considered to be the isotopic footprint of all organic nitrogen the substrate for dnra is the 15n enriched nitrate in the feed water which was measured once per cycle because isotopic ratios of both substrates are markedly distinct dnra and mineralization rates can be discerned physio and biochemical reactions can lead to isotopic fractionation thus interfering in the resulting ammonium isotopic ratios usually lighter isotopes are consumed preferentially in such reactions thus leading to a 15n depleted product and 15n enriched substrate mariotti et al 1981 the degree of fractionation is expressed by the enrichment factor ε in parts per thousand mineralization is considered to have little to no fractionation effects to ammonium ca 1 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 since all nitrate was consumed at the measured samples potential fractionation due to dnra can be disregarded on the other hand the occurrence of nitrification and anammox are known to cause fractionation böhlke et al 2006 brunner et al 2013 nikolenko et al 2018 and thus can lead to the enrichment of remaining ammonium in the output water 2 2 sampling and analysis samples from the column effluent were collected directly at the outlet of each column and analyzed immediately the analysis started on the 4th day of each 7 day cycle so that many pore volumes had been flushed through the columns with the new of operating parameters before the start of the analysis the frequency of analysis was parameter dependent and varied according with the relevance of said parameter samples from the feed water were analyzed once for all parameters at the start of every cycle temperature dissolved oxygen do ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using wtw multi 3430 and appropriate electrodes wtw weilheim germany the measurements of temperature do ph and ec were made in a flow through cell that captured the effluent from each column n cycle 4 ammonium n cycle 4 nitrate n cycle 3 nitrite n cycle 1 manganese n cycle 1 total iron n cycle 2 and sulfate n cycle 1 were analyzed using the hach dr1900 spectrophotometer hach company usa doc and total nitrogen tn in water n cycle 1 and solid organic carbon soc in the riverbed sediments were analyzed using toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytic jena germany don was calculated by subtracting total inorganic nitrogen from tn major

water quality the sediments had a median grain size diameter d50 of 0 61 mm the average bulk density of the sediment inside the columns was 2057 kg m3 2042 2068 kg m3 the amount of fines silt and clay d 0 063 mm was around 1 of the dry mass while the amount of organic carbon was determined based on 3 soil samples to 2500 mg kg this is in agreement with former data from elbe river sediments at torgau with 2000 6000 mg kg determined in the upper 10 cm of the riverbed grischek et al 1993 the average effective porosity in the columns determined by nacl tracer tests was 0 30 0 29 0 31 each cycle was operated with fresh water from the river elbe thus the input water quality varied for each cycle table a1 appendix ec 411 50 μs cm ph 7 92 0 15 nitrate 3 0 4 mgn l ammonium 0 04 0 04 mgn l sulfate 55 6 mg l manganese 0 05 0 02 mg l iron 0 11 0 06 mg l doc 6 8 2 6 mg l and don 1 6 0 7 mg l were measured at room temperature ca 20 c before each cycle the dissolved oxygen do in the input water is dependent on the temperature of each column and was near 100 saturation about 11 mg l at 10 c 9 mg l at 20 c and 7 mg l at 30 c 3 2 columns output water quality c1 10 ammonium manganese and iron in the columns output water are displayed in fig 2 nitrate sulfate and doc in fig 3 and ph ec don in fig a2 appendix nitrite concentrations not shown ranged from 0 to 0 09 mgn l median of 0 01 mgn l detailed measurements for each column are shown in table a2 and a3 appendix median concentrations are given instead of mean concentrations as they are less affected by outliers in the measurements there is a distinct change in the output water quality between the first three phases ammonium iron and manganese concentrations became lower at each new phase and nitrate concentrations became higher the columns were flushed by 46 pore volumes pv before the start of phase 1 by 115 pv before phase 2 and by 184 pv before phase 3 fig a1 the hypothesized cause for the differences between phases is that the easily degradable soc and son in the column sediments is consumed at every cycle and has been partly depleted by the start of phase 2 and more so at the start of phase 3 the decreased availability of electron donors soc led to lesser reducing conditions in the columns and thus a lesser release of manganese and iron and lesser denitrification of nitrate the main sources of ammonium is mineralization of don from the river water and son from the riverbed sediments thus depletion of easily degradable son would also explain lower ammonium concentrations in phases 2 and 3 at equivalent temperatures and infiltration rates a simple mass balance approach was applied to review the likelihood of this hypothesis table a4 appendix initial soc in the sediments was determined as about 2500 mg kg with around 4 2 kg of riverbed sediments in the columns this amounts to 10 500 mg of soc in the columns according to grischek 2003 and schoenheinz 2004 only about 30 of the elbe river doc is biologically easily degradable assuming that freshly accumulated soc has a similar biodegradability as the doc this leaves 3150 mg of organic carbon available for microbiologically driven reactions bsoc the reactions assumed to consume bsoc are oxygen respiration denitrification and manganese iron and sulfate reduction desorption of soc is also expected to occur especially at 30 c additionally there is an influx of toc from the input water which also contains a particulate fraction known as particulate organic carbon poc poc corresponds to usually about 30 of doc in the elbe water e g 7 8 mg l toc 6 mg l doc 1 8 mg l poc taking this into account the estimated accumulated net depletion of bsoc column s1 was 163 mg before the start of phase 1 473 mg before phase 2 and 933 mg before phase 3 which still leaves about 2987 mg 95 2677 mg 85 and 2217 70 of bsoc in the columns respectively before each phase results are similar for the other columns not shown these values were calculated as if all reactions occurred exclusively by heterotrophic processes however it is possible that chemoautotrophic processes also occurred e g reduction of nitrate by reduced iron ions which would mean less bsoc consumption although only about 30 of bsoc in the columns was supposedly consumed according to this hypothesis it was enough to lead to significantly lesser reducing conditions in the columns this is possible because bsoc is not homogeneous and the more easily degradable fraction of bsoc is consumed first schoenheinz 2011 at the later phases the bsoc fraction which is degradable in the range of 0 to 18 h maximum retention time in the columns has been largely depleted even though most of bsoc with larger biodegradability times still remains this also explains why at the desorption experiments where the water is retained for much longer manganese and iron concentration still increase considerably and nitrate and sulfate are completely consumed a similar behavior can be observed for son and ammonium formation in the columns table a5 appendix the amount of son in the riverbed sediments was not measured however fischer et al 2005 measured the c n ratios between 11 5 and 13 5 from organic material of elbe riverbed sediments taken from the inside groynes about 70 km upstream to the sampling location of the present study thus considering a c n ratio of 12 5 the amount of son inside the columns is about 840 mg there is less research on the portion of biodegradable organic nitrogen bson but considering it the same as for organic carbon 30 there would be about 252 mg of bson in the columns there is an input of an average of 1 5 mg l of don from the river water and an average remaining don of 0 8 mg l in the output water finally consumption of son don occurs by mineralization to ammonium this results in an estimated consumption in column s1 of 32 mg at a temperature of 30 c before the start of phase 1 64 mg before the start of phase 2 and 89 mg before phase 3 which still leaves about 220 mg 88 188 mg 75 and 163 65 of bson in the column respectively before each phase it is also possible that ammonium mineralized in the columns can be nitrified while the column is still oxic or attenuated by anammox while nitrate is available in both cases a share of ammonium formation would not be detected which can lead to an underestimation of mineralization 3 3 impact of temperature and infiltration rates ammonium concentrations are about 3 to 7 times higher at 30 c compared with at 20 c while concentrations at 10 c are much lower ranging between 0 and 0 1 mgn l in both phases 1 and 2 lower infiltration rates higher residence times led to higher ammonium concentrations in phase 3 ammonium formation was low and infiltration rate was not a significant factor using spearman s rank correlation there is a strong correlation between ammonium and residence time at 30 c for both phase 1 r 0 71 p 0 01 and phase 2 r 0 76 p 0 01 at 20 c the correlation is strong in phase 2 r 0 72 p 0 01 and no significant correlation in phase 1 there is no significant correlation between ammonium concentrations and residence time at 10 c iron concentrations similarly to ammonium are about 3 to 11 times higher at 30 c compared with at 20 c while near 0 mg l at 10 c this is a result of stronger reducing conditions at warmer temperatures due to increased biological activity iron behavior according to infiltration rates is less predictable than ammonium and does not show any significant correlation manganese concentrations are similar at both 20 and 30 c being slightly higher at 20 c and about 4 to 10 times higher than at 10 c manganese concentrations like ammonium were also higher at lower infiltration rates due to test failures concentrations in cycles c1 and c2 for 20 c and 30 c could not be recorded ec remained very similar to the input water 5 difference ph was always higher in the input water median of 7 98 compared to the output water medians of 7 70 7 75 and 7 58 at 30 c 20 c and 10 c respectively decrease in ph is caused by the occurring redox reactions which are naturally acidifying sulfate remained mostly the same as the input water except at 30 c between cycles c1 to c5 where it decreased by up to 20 this indicates that at 30 c sulfate reduction occurred in those cycles potentially affecting iron concentrations by sulfide precipitation doc concentrations are slightly higher than the input water at 30 c for infiltration rates of 0 2 and 0 26 m3 m2 d for phases 1 and 2 between 13 and 37 increase but not for infiltration rates of 0 33 m3 m2 d and phase 3 while at 10 and 20 c doc concentrations were slightly lower than input concentrations schoenheinz 2004 has also observed higher release of organics at higher temperatures and low flow velocities in column experiments which was attributed to the increased dissolution of adsorbed soc from the sediments at such conditions higher do concentrations in the input water at 10 and 20 c also enhances doc oxidation consumption further explaining lower concentrations 3 4 impact of nitrate concentrations nitrate concentrations during the normal cycles c1 10 ranged between 2 and 3 4 mgn l in the input water in phase 4 additional five cycles c11 15 were operated for all columns at 30 c with river water with varying nitrate concentrations 0 2 3 and 11 mgn l the impacts to ammonium concentrations in the effluent are displayed in fig 4 even though all columns were operated with the same temperature 30 c and infiltration rate 1 ml min or 0 33 m3 m2 d ammonium concentrations in the effluent of columns s5 and s6 were considerably higher while concentrations of columns s1 and s2 were lower columns s1 and s2 have been operated so far c1 10 at 30 c thus expected to have mineralized more son while columns s5 and s6 have been operated at 10 c and columns s3 and s4 at 20 c thus having more available son remaining now that all columns are operated at 30 c columns s3 to s6 have more organic nitrogen available for mineralization especially columns s5 and s6 thus explaining higher ammonium concentrations when operated at 35 c c12 and c13 columns s1 and s2 showed ammonium concentrations in the effluent equivalent to columns s3 and s4 which continued to be operated at 30 c if dnra was an important contributing reaction to ammonium formation ammonium concentrations was expected to increase in the cycle with increased nitrate compared with the other cycles however concentrations remained equivalent or even slightly lower also if dnra played a role operation with no nitrate c11 and c12 is expected to result in lower ammonium concentrations however the opposite occurred and ammonium concentrations became higher the most likely explanation for this is that anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is occurring in the cycles with nitrate in the input water leading to higher ammonium attenuation in those cycles this would also explain why the lowest ammonium concentrations occurred in the operation with 11 mgn l nitrate c15 and why higher ammonium concentrations were observed in the cycle with 2 mgn l nitrate c13 compared with 3 mgn l c14 it s also possible that water quality differences which occurred during nitrate removal are responsible for the resulting ammonium concentrations but since ph has been restored to previous values the other changes are not expected to be significant to ammonium behavior for anammox to occur it is necessary that both ammonium and nitrite are present nitrite in both input and output water is negligible but since nitrite is an intermediate product of both nitrification and denitrification it is expected to be formed inside the columns nitrite is an unstable compound and is quickly transformed after both half reactions but according to dalsgaard et al 2005 nitrite availability does not limit anammox rates in marine sediments where the main source of nitrite is the reduction from nitrate the presence of oxygen is a strong inhibitor of the anammox process jetten et al 1998 therefore if anammox is occurring it is in the nitrate reduction zone in the column where after nitrate is reduced to nitrite part of the nitrite serves as electron acceptor for ammonium while the remaining follows the denitrification path if one assumes that the anammox process is the sole responsible for variations in ammonium concentration between the cycles with c13 15 and without nitrate c11 12 and that mineralization rates are the same anammox is responsible for the attenuation of 63 9 of ammonium in the situation with 2 mgn l nitrate in the input water of 72 7 in the situation with 3 mgn l and of 84 13 in the situation with 11 mgn l although this indicates that anammox is potentially a significant sink for ammonium estimated nitrate consumption by anammox is less significant in relation to total consumption the remaining being attributed to denitrification following the same assumptions made for ammonium anammox was responsible for 12 8 of the nitrate consumption the potential occurrence of anammox also implies that the estimated mineralization rates made previously are possibly underestimated and consequently the consumption of son in the columns made in section 3 3 could be underestimated as well nitrogen isotopes were measured for the nitrate in the input water and ammonium in the output water for cycles c1 7 for the columns at 30 c s1 and s2 for the cycles c2 7 the nitrate was spiked with enriched 15n while c1 had the natural nitrogen isotopic footprint of the river elbe as the isotopic footprint of the elbe varies week to week and new water was used at each cycle with the same spiked concentration the input nitrate 15n also varied for each cycle the results fig 5 show an increase of 15n in the ammonium in output water median 15 1 compared with the son of the sediments 8 4 according to literature the isotopic footprint of don in the river elbe also lies in a similar range as the sediments between 5 and 11 deutsch et al 2009 mineralization of organic nitrogen to ammonium usually leads to a small enrichment ε 1 therefore ammonium produced in the columns exclusively by mineralization would be expected to have an isotope ratio of about 9 4 dnra could be an explanation for the further enrichment of the ammonium in the columns as the artificially enriched nitrate 70 100 is the substrate for the reaction however a similar enrichment is found at cycle 1 where nitrate was not spiked with enriched 15n and had an isotopic ratio of 7 7 therefore the enrichment in cycle 1 to 17 in s1 and 14 in s2 cannot possibly be explained by dnra since the substrate nitrate would have lower 15n concentrations than the product ammonium a more likely explanation which also corroborates with the experiments with varying nitrate concentrations is that isotopic fractionation during anammox is the cause for the 15n enrichment in output ammonium comparing the cycles with natural nitrate concentrations 2 3 mgn l and operations without nitrate there is an average of about 0 3 mgn l difference between equivalent cycles assuming that anammox is responsible for the consumption of 0 3 mgn l of ammonium for the cycles where isotopic measurements were made the enrichment factor ε for ammonium during anammox based on the measured isotope ratios would be about 17 2 9 3 which lies in a similar range to previous studies of 23 to 29 brunner et al 2013 and 31 to 33 kobayashi et al 2019 using the range of ε for anammox found in the literature 23 and 33 ammonium biodegradation by anammox can be estimated for the cycles where isotopes ratios were measured fig 6 considering ε 23 a biodegradation of ammonium of 24 8 or 0 21 0 12 mgn l is calculated while considering ε 33 a biodegradation of 17 6 or 0 14 0 08 mgn l is reached biodegradation by anammox is likely higher in the columns of lower temperatures although total biodegradation is lower where ammonium concentrations are lower and nitrate concentrations are not limiting the above estimations assume that only anammox is causing ammonium enrichment however ammonium isotope enrichment also takes place due to nitrification which occurs while the columns are still oxic but since the oxic zone in the columns is assumed to be only a few centimeters fractionation due to nitrification was not considered 3 5 desorption experiments three times the columns were stopped and left stagnant for an extended period twice for 18 days at room temperature ca 20 c d1 and d2 and once for 22 days at different temperatures 10 20 and 30 c d3 d1 was done between phases 1 and 2 while d2 and d3 were done between phases 2 and 3 afterward columns were restarted and operated at 1 ml min 0 33 m3 m2 d for several days to wash out the ions which had accumulated ec ammonium manganese and iron concentrations substantially increased while the columns were not operated wash out of ammonium varied according to temperature being completed faster at lower temperatures in all cases ammonium reached stable values 5 variation within two consecutive days much later than ec after about 2 pv ec was mostly stable while ammonium concentrations required up to 13 pv fig 7 the retardation factor can be estimated by the pv when c c0 equals 0 5 retardation of ammonium ranged from 1 7 to 3 7 at 30 c from 1 4 to 2 8 at 20 c and from 1 to 2 4 at 10 c these values assume ammonium is not being consumed once operation restarts and only exchange processes are significant which is not the case as nitrification and likely anammox will ensue once fresh water is flushed to the columns making ammonium concentration decrease in a faster rate therefore the calculated retardation factors are assumed to be slightly underestimated doc concentrations and major cations were measured right after the start of the second desorption experiment and after the wash out was complete dissolution of soc hypothesized in section 3 4 is endorsed by an increase in doc concentrations 47 120 observed in all columns just after restarting despite the expected consumption of doc during the stagnant phase the increase in ec during stagnation is not only caused by an increase in manganese iron and ammonium concentrations but also due to an increase to major cations just after restarting the columns calcium 112 magnesium 97 potassium 68 and sodium 66 concentrations increased compared to input concentrations but during further operation they returned to values equal to input concentrations there is not a clear reason why major cations concentrations increased one hypothesis is that dissolution of soc from the columns also released the cations adsorbed to the organic material in the columns 3 6 practical implications and comparison with field data ammonium in drinking water has no immediate health relevance so there are no health based guideline value for it however since ammonium can compromise post treatment processes such as chlorination a limit of 0 5 mg l has been recommended in the past who 2006 this limit was only surpassed when the columns were operated at 30 c cycles c1 6 and c11 12 ammonium concentrations in the output water of the columns varied from 0 up to 1 mgn l depending on operating conditions pan et al 2018 observed 2 1 and 0 6 mgn l of ammonium in the riverbed pore water of the qingyang river china in summer and winter respectively ammonium in the qingyang river was ca 0 3 mgn l in summer and ca 0 4 mgn l in winter while doussan et al 1998 observed ammonium concentrations 25 mgn l in the riverbed pore water of the seine river france ammonium in the seine river was ca 3 mgn l at both sites the organic carbon content of the riverbed was higher than in the sediments used for the current experiments 0 25 in the riverbed sediments from qingyang river organic matter content was 1 2 while in the seine river sediments the organic content ranged from 3 to 15 other sites such as in lake tegel berlin germany pekdeger 2010 or in the elbe river torgau germany grischek et al 1998 have shown negligible ammonium concentrations in the riverbed pore water 0 1 mgn l this shows that ammonium formation potential is directly linked with riverbed composition especially organic content and can vary considerably in magnitude accordingly therefore riverbed composition should be part of the investigation for any large scale rbf site the main controls on ammonium concentrations during the column experiments were temperature water residence time infiltration rate nitrate concentrations in the input water and the amount of labile organic material in the columns lower infiltration rates increase the residence time which resulted in higher ammonium concentrations and more reduced conditions in the effluent water of the columns small variations in infiltration rates in the columns from 0 33 to 0 2 m3 m2 d were sufficient to cause an increase of about 50 in ammonium concentrations in phase 1 and 100 in phase 2 at all temperatures this means that lower infiltration rates in the riverbed of bank filtration sites can lead to increased mineralization stronger reducing conditions and consequently higher ammonium manganese and iron concentrations in the abstracted water of course other factors such as riverbed aquifer composition and mixing with landside groundwater will influence the final quality of the abstracted water the main factors affecting infiltration rate during rbf are the flow gradient between the river and the groundwater at the abstraction well caused by the water abstraction and composition clogging of the riverbed clogging of the riverbed can increase with long term rbf operation grischek and bartak 2016 riverbeds with high amounts of fine material have lower infiltration rates and are more susceptible to clogging effects during rbf furthermore such riverbeds also usually contain higher amounts of organic material which would mean stronger reducing conditions and more son available for mineralization thus sites with high amounts of fines in the riverbed are subjected to higher potential in ammonium formation on the other hand clay particle minerals increase the riverbed sorption capacity which can lead to ammonium retardation and accumulation in the riverbed doussan et al 1998 in the present study the estimated retardation factor rd for ammonium in the riverbed sediments was 2 1 0 77 rd values were comparable to other experiments with sandy ceazan et al 1989 and silty nunes delgado et al 1997 sediments in the literature the delay caused by retardation will lead to a delay for ammonium to reach the aquifer and abstraction wells but ammonium will eventually breakthrough providing no other reaction occurs therefore ammonium concentrations should be cautiously examined at rbf sites along rivers with fine sediments as commonly found e g in river deltas grischek and ray 2009 riverbanks with abundant vegetation e g in vietnam india or old branches and oxbow lakes sampling of the riverbed pore water in the pilot phase of an rbf site can give indications about the potential risk of ammonium contamination lower temperatures constrain biological reactions e g denitrification and mineralization hence output water in the columns with low temperature 10 c had low ammonium 0 1 mgn l manganese 1 mg l and iron 0 1 mg l concentrations and high nitrate concentrations 2 2 0 3 mgn l even at low infiltration rates furthermore water at low temperatures commonly has higher do concentrations thus enhancing doc oxidation and limiting the amount of electron donors for denitrification and manganese iron reduction high temperatures 30 c promote higher biological activity reducing nitrate 0 0 7 mgn l releasing manganese 1 65 0 91 mg l and iron 1 24 0 96 mg l and forming more ammonium 0 55 0 3 mgn l during riverbed infiltration this is in agreement with gross wittke et al 2010 and pan et al 2018 which showed that higher temperatures promoted higher mineralization rates in the riverbed medium temperatures 20 c allow for biological reactions to occur but with lower rate as compared to higher temperatures 0 09 0 08 mgn l ammonium these results show that rbf sites at warmer climates are more susceptible to ammonium formation in the riverbed and release of manganese and iron during water infiltration the results also highlight the possible effects which increasing temperatures due to climate change can pose to rbf water quality even in colder climates ammonium formation in the riverbed is expected to increase in the summer months however since travel times at rbf sites are often between 50 and 200 days grischek et al 2002 kruc et al 2020 water mixing will buffer this effect depletion of easily degradable soc son in the columns is the hypothesized cause for weaker reducing conditions and reduced ammonium formation in the later phases of the experiment this reinforces the hypothesis proposed by grischek et al 1998 that soc in the riverbed of the river elbe is an important additional supply of electron donors to river doc during rbf a mass balance estimation indicates that the consumption of only about 30 of the biodegradable organic material in the columns start of phase 3 already leads to drastic differences in redox conditions leading to minimal release of iron and ammonium formation this suggests that at sites where organic material is not frequently deposited in the riverbed weaker reducing conditions and lower ammonium formation might set in after a few weeks or months of rbf operation this was observed at an rbf site in the nile egypt where ammonium concentrations fell from 0 5 to 0 1 mg l after a few months of operation during the initial phase of rbf wahaab et al 2019 since doc is expected to be partially consumed during columns passage it is reasonable to assume that doc concentrations will decrease in the columns outlet compared to the input concentrations however output doc concentrations were higher than input concentrations at high temperatures and low infiltration rates this indicates a release of doc from the columns at these conditions as was observed by schoenheinz 2004 in practice this means that higher temperatures can lead to increased doc concentrations in the abstracted water at rbf sites during the cycles with no nitrate in the input water ammonium concentrations increased in the output water this means that either nitrate is hindering ammonium formation or nitrate increasing ammonium consumption the latter is the more likely alternative as ammonium can be oxidized by nitrite via anammox anammox has rarely been considered to play an important role during rbf or generally in the hyporheic zone with a few exceptions akbarzadeh et al 2018 groeschke et al 2016 however the results from the column experiments indicate that it may be a significant ammonium sink if sufficient nitrate is present in the river water the practical implication of anammox occurrence during rbf is that rivers with nitrate concentrations 2mgn l such as the rivers rhine or elbe may have a buffer of protection against ammonium formation during rbf at the rbf site near torgau from where the columns sediments were taken ammonium concentrations in the riverbed pore water are 0 02 mgn l grischek et al 1998 it appears that mineralization is not taking place at the riverbed however the results from the column experiments suggest that ammonium is formed by mineralization but it is subsequently attenuated via anammox more research is still necessary to confirm anammox as a significant sink of ammonium in the hyporheic zone the increase in ammonium concentration during operation with no nitrate and the slight decrease during operation with increased nitrate leads to the assumption that dnra is not a significant factor in either ammonium formation or nitrate attenuation this is in accordance with previous studies which emphasized that dnra does not play a significant role in situations with low oc no3 ratios burgin and hamilton 2007 pandey et al 2019 tiedje 1982 which is the case in these column experiments although the observed isotopic enrichment of ammonium nitrogen could point towards dnra occurrence it is more likely that isotopic fractionation caused by anammox led to the enrichment 4 conclusions the riverbed is a highly biologically active region where most biological reactions are expected to occur during riverbank filtration rbf including denitrification ammonium mineralization manganese and iron reduction release column experiments were utilized to evaluate the controls on these reactions the main findings include higher temperatures led to higher ammonium formation by mineralization denitrification of nitrate and release of manganese and iron higher column residence time lower infiltration rates also led to higher ammonium formation partial depletion of biodegradable organic material is hypothesized to cause considerably lower ammonium formation and weaker reducing conditions in the columns in the later phases of the experiments dnra does not appear be significant in ammonium formation however anammox does seem to play an important role in ammonium attenuation the main practical implications to rbf sites are sites located in regions with warmer climate e g egypt vietnam malaysia india are more susceptible to increased ammonium concentrations due to increased mineralization in the riverbed a decrease in the infiltration rate in the riverbed due to clogging or reduced gradient can lead to an increase in ammonium formation organic content of the riverbed plays an important role in the ammonium formation and redox conditions of the bank filtrate and therefore should be part of the investigation for any large scale rbf site sites where organic material is not frequently deposited in the riverbed may observe a reduction in ammonium formation and manganese iron release after the initial phase of operation rivers with nitrate concentrations 2 mgn l may have a buffer of protection against ammonium due to potential of anammox occurring in the riverbed aquifer authors contribution gustavo covatti conceptualization investigation formal analysis writing and editing thomas grischek

1281,ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of riverbank filtration rbf schemes due mainly to the complications it causes during post treatment e g during chlorination during rbf ammonium can be formed in the riverbed by mineralization of organic nitrogen column experiments with riverbed sediments and river water from the elbe were performed to evaluate the controls on ammonium concentrations during riverbed infiltration concentrations of ammonium went from 0 1 mgn l in the feed water up to 1 mgn l in the columns effluent higher temperatures and lower infiltration rates led to increased ammonium concentrations in the effluent this shows higher susceptibility to ammonium increases of rbf settings in warmer climates and points to potential threats of climate change to water quality at rbf sites in the later phases of the experiments after the columns have been flushed their pore volumes several times ammonium concentrations continually decreased this behavior was attributed to the partial consumption of easily degradable organic material in the sediments leading to lesser reducing conditions and lower mineralization rates based on operation with varied nitrate concentrations 0 11 mgn l and 15n isotopic measurements dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was not shown to be relevant in the formation of ammonium anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox however was hypothesized to be an important sink of ammonium inside the columns which indicates that rivers with high nitrate concentrations such as the elbe may have a buffer of protection against ammonium formation during rbf graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen pathways water quality hyporheic zone redox reactions anammox nitrogen isotopes 1 introduction river bank filtration rbf is a process by which surface water is subjected to subsurface flow prior to extraction around the world especially in europe this process is used as a pre treatment step for drinking water supply during infiltration and subsurface flow natural attenuation processes lead to partial removal of suspended solids biodegradable organic compounds and pathogens hiscock and grischek 2002 as the water infiltrates the riverbed reducing conditions usually set in this happens because the riverbed is typically a highly biologically active layer which contains high amounts of biologically available organic matter reducing conditions can cause the reduction of nitrate by denitrification but also the mobilization of manganese and iron and consequent increase of both in the abstracted water which impairs both water quality and well operation grischek and paufler 2017 additionally ammonium can be formed in the riverbed through mineralization of organic nitrogen as seen at the rbf sites described in doussan et al 1998 pan et al 2018 and de vet et al 2010 in turn inorganic nitrogen can be assimilated to organic nitrogen by microorganisms the difference between gross mineralization and gross assimilation is called net mineralization but in the following text mineralization will always refer to net mineralization ammonium is an undesirable substance in the abstracted water of rbf schemes although not toxic for humans ammonium is a problematic compound during post treatment where for example it can compromise chlorination efficiency and cause failure of filters in the removal of manganese who 2011 furthermore 1 mg l of ammonium in water leads to the consumption of around 3 6 mg l of dissolved oxygen do during nitrification thus leading to stronger reducing conditions in the aquifer therefore the cost efficient operation of an rbf system can be affected by the concentration and behavior of ammonium ammonium sources and behavior during rbf have been previously investigated at different rbf sites doussan et al 1998 groeschke et al 2017 jacobs et al 1988 pan et al 2018 de vet et al 2010 and a review of ammonium behavior of 40 sites from 25 different literature sources is given by covatti and grischek 2021 there are four possible sources of ammonium at a given rbf site surface water reactions in the riverbed leaching from the vadose zone between river and wells and landside groundwater mineralization of organic nitrogen in the riverbed is the main process forming ammonium during rbf covatti and grischek 2021 and is the focal point of this article during riverbed infiltration while the riverbed is still oxic ammonium is attenuated by nitrification where ammonium is oxidized by the river s dissolved oxygen to form nitrate oxygen depletion often occurs within the first centimeters of infiltration where ammonium present in surface water is partially or completely nitrified while ammonium formed deeper in the riverbed is transported further to the aquifer as the aquifer usually remains anoxic during bank filtration ammonium formed in the riverbed can reach the wells and constitute a problem for post treatment the primary goal of this article is to investigate the main controls on ammonium formation and attenuation in the hyporheic zone during rbf column experiments with riverbed sediments from the river elbe germany are thereby utilized to simulate the processes occurring in the hyporheic zone and to analyze the impacts of river water quality temperature and infiltration rates in ammonium formation attenuation and exchange processes the behavior of other redox relevant parameters such as ph nitrate manganese iron and dissolved organic carbon doc were also analyzed due to their importance regarding the cost efficiency of rbf systems hiscock and grischek 2002 in addition to mineralization dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra eq 1 is another process occurring during reducing conditions which can theoretically contribute to ammonium formation during riverbed infiltration although dnra has never been reported at any rbf site the process has been described to occur at freshwater stream sediments in the past kelso et al 1997 storey et al 2004 many authors suggest that dnra is only relevant when a high oc no3 ratio is present e g oc no3 15 burgin and hamilton 2007 pandey et al 2019 tiedje 1982 therefore ammonium formation by dnra is dependent on the organic content of the riverbed 1 2 h no 3 2 c h 2 o nh 4 2 co 2 h 2 o in addition to nitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox eq 2 is also capable of attenuating ammonium by combining ammonium to nitrite and forming nitrogen gas anammox has rarely been recognized as an important ammonium sink in freshwater streams and rbf sites but it s known to play an important role in anoxic wastewater oxygen depleted zones of the ocean temperate shelf sediments sea ice arctic shelf sediments burgin and hamilton 2007 2 nh 4 no 2 n 2 h 2 o the roles of dnra and anammox in the hyporheic zone during riverbank filtration are not clear and their potential occurrence is therefore an additional goal of the current study by using 15n as a tracer it is possible to estimate the rates of mineralization dnra and denitrification christensen et al 2000 nielsen 1992 reinhardt et al 2006 in order to assess nitrogen species transformations occurring in the experiments 15n isotopic values were measured additionally the columns were operated with river water with artificially increased nitrate concentrations and with artificially removed nitrate to evaluate nitrate concentrations impact on ammonium behavior columns experiments are often used to study nitrogen processes in water and soil at different environments abel et al 2012 carrey et al 2014 groeschke et al 2016 liu et al 2017 silver et al 2018 storey et al 2004 especially relevant to this study are the column experiments made by liu et al 2017 which investigated nitrogen transformations in the hyporheic zone using riverbed sediments flushed with synthetic river water and synthetic groundwater ammonium concentrations increased from less 0 2 mgn l in the influent up to about 1 1 mgn l in the columns effluent with lower infiltration rates higher residence time leading to higher ammonium concentrations storey et al 2004 also investigated nitrogen transformations in different undisturbed riverbed sediment cores increase in ammonium concentrations from 0 1 mgn l in the influent to up to 0 5 mgn l in the columns effluent were observed and ammonium in the effluent showed a strong correlation with the amount of organic material in the columns sediments previous column experiment studies paufler et al 2018 rohr et al 2014 have also been done to assess the impact of climate variables to bank filtration however both used aquifer sediments which contain much less organic material than riverbed sediments and are less biologically active in those experiments only manganese reducing conditions were reached and thus displayed negligible iron release very low ammonium formation was observed by rohr et al 2014 with a maximum of 0 08 mgn l and ammonium was not measured by paufler et al 2018 2 methods 2 1 set up of column experiments six columns with riverbed sediments were set up in the laboratory fig 1 the columns are named from s1 to s6 each column is 50 cm long with an inner diameter of 7 5 cm and made of galvanized steel the sediments were taken from the riverbed about 10 to 20 cm below the water sediment interface at the left bank of the river elbe near the catchment of the rbf waterworks torgau ost in germany the riverbed near torgau is composed of medium to fine gravel and characterized by erosive conditions however the sediments were taken from the inside of river groynes thus containing finer sediments and more organic material then the regular river channel furthermore the sediments were wet sieved to a grain size 2 mm during the filling of the columns the sediment was compacted every 5 cm the compaction and filling of the columns were performed while the sediments were completely saturated to avoid any residual air within the sediments the mean travel time and effective porosity ne in the columns were determined from electrical conductivity nacl breakthrough curves from tracer experiments performed before start up the columns were stored in thermostatic cabinets and were operated at different temperatures s1 and s2 at 30 c s3 and s4 at 20 c and s5 and s6 at 10 c the flow through the columns was adjusted to different flow rates during the experiments using prominent beta diaphragm pumps prominent germany to represent different infiltration rates upon starting the operation of the columns there was a desorption of accumulated ions leading to increased concentrations of ammonium iron and high ec values therefore before the start of the analysis the columns were operated for 23 days with elbe river water until stable concentrations of ammonium and iron and stable electrical conductivity ec were reached 5 variation within two consecutive days columns were operated in cycles of 7 days with elbe river water elbe river water was collected weekly and on the seventh day of each cycle the input water was changed as well as operating parameters thus starting a new cycle in total 15 cycles were performed table 1 which can be divided in 4 distinct phases phase 1 cycles c1 4 phase 2 cycles c5 7 phase 3 cycles c8 10 and phase 4 5 cycles with distinct nitrate concentrations c11 c15 a more detailed description of the columns operation according to pore volumes pv flushed is displayed in fig a1 appendix in phases 1 3 the cycles were operated with different flow rates 0 6 1 ml min which represent different infiltration rates 0 2 0 33 m3 m2 d such infiltration rates have been estimated for the rbf scheme at torgau ost the same infiltration rates and conditions are repeated in phases 1 3 in order to evaluate differences according to long term operation during phase 4 c11 15 all columns were operated at 30 c twice with no nitrate in the input water 0 mgn l c11 and c12 twice with natural nitrate concentrations in the river water 2 and 3 mgn l c13 and c14 and once with artificially increased nitrate 11 mgn l c15 with the goal to observe the impact of nitrate on ammonium concentrations infiltration of river water having no nitrate 0 mgn l was simulated after treatment via an anion exchange resin which resulted in an increase in ec decrease in ph and almost complete removal of sulfate ph was then adjusted to previous levels by addition of sodium hydroxide naoh the addition of nitrate to reach 11 mgn l was made with potassium nitrate kno3 which increased the water ec by about 80 μs cm but with few other changes in between the operation phases a total of 3 desorption experiments were carried out to evaluate ammonium exchange processes once between phases 1 and 2 and twice between phases 2 and 3 during the desorption experiments column operation was stopped and the water was left stagnant inside the columns for an extended period of time afterwards the columns were restarted and all water quality parameters were measured daily between phases 1 and 2 the columns were stopped for 18 days at room temperature ca 20 c and were subsequently operated with elbe river water at 1 ml min flow rate for 10 days to wash out the accumulated ions such as ammonium and iron d1 phase 2 commenced once concentrations of ammonium and iron were stable during the wash out processes ammonium concentrations were measured to estimate the retardation factor rd of ammonium at each column the same experiment was performed between phase 2 and 3 d2 the third desorption experiment d3 was performed right after the washout process of d2 this time the columns were stopped for 22 days and maintained at their usual temperatures 10 20 and 30 c followed by another 10 day period of wash out before the start of phase 3 at the desorption experiments rd was estimated for ammonium in each column as the time in pore volumes pv in which the relative concentration c c0 was equal to 0 5 nunes delgado et al 1997 this however disregards possible ammonium consuming reactions such as nitrification and anammox which may occur once the columns restart operation the nitrogen isotopic footprint was measured in ammonium and nitrate of in and output water from cycles c1 to c7 for the columns at 30 c s1 and s2 as well as in the bulk nitrogen in the sediments 15n was not measured at the 10 c and 20 c columns because ammonium concentrations were too low for the employed method of ammonium isotope analysis in order to identify the reactions occurring in the column experiments 15n enriched nitrate was spiked in the feed water except for cycle 1 similar to what is done in the 15n isotope pairing technique developed by nielsen 1992 to measure denitrification rates in sediments and amended by christensen et al 2000 to measure dnra rates the spiking was done using potassium nitrate with 98 15n which required only very small quantities of nitrate addition 0 01 mgn l to enrich influent nitrate to the desired isotopic footprint ca 100 therefore the nitrate additions during spiking did not led to any detectable increase in nitrate concentration in the input water dnra and mineralization are the reactions which can potentially form ammonium inside the columns the substrate for mineralization is organic nitrogen which is present as solid organic nitrogen son in the column sediments and as dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen don and pon respectively in the feed water the isotopic footprint of bulk n in the sediment was measured and considered to be the isotopic footprint of all organic nitrogen the substrate for dnra is the 15n enriched nitrate in the feed water which was measured once per cycle because isotopic ratios of both substrates are markedly distinct dnra and mineralization rates can be discerned physio and biochemical reactions can lead to isotopic fractionation thus interfering in the resulting ammonium isotopic ratios usually lighter isotopes are consumed preferentially in such reactions thus leading to a 15n depleted product and 15n enriched substrate mariotti et al 1981 the degree of fractionation is expressed by the enrichment factor ε in parts per thousand mineralization is considered to have little to no fractionation effects to ammonium ca 1 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 since all nitrate was consumed at the measured samples potential fractionation due to dnra can be disregarded on the other hand the occurrence of nitrification and anammox are known to cause fractionation böhlke et al 2006 brunner et al 2013 nikolenko et al 2018 and thus can lead to the enrichment of remaining ammonium in the output water 2 2 sampling and analysis samples from the column effluent were collected directly at the outlet of each column and analyzed immediately the analysis started on the 4th day of each 7 day cycle so that many pore volumes had been flushed through the columns with the new of operating parameters before the start of the analysis the frequency of analysis was parameter dependent and varied according with the relevance of said parameter samples from the feed water were analyzed once for all parameters at the start of every cycle temperature dissolved oxygen do ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using wtw multi 3430 and appropriate electrodes wtw weilheim germany the measurements of temperature do ph and ec were made in a flow through cell that captured the effluent from each column n cycle 4 ammonium n cycle 4 nitrate n cycle 3 nitrite n cycle 1 manganese n cycle 1 total iron n cycle 2 and sulfate n cycle 1 were analyzed using the hach dr1900 spectrophotometer hach company usa doc and total nitrogen tn in water n cycle 1 and

water quality the sediments had a median grain size diameter d50 of 0 61 mm the average bulk density of the sediment inside the columns was 2057 kg m3 2042 2068 kg m3 the amount of fines silt and clay d 0 063 mm was around 1 of the dry mass while the amount of organic carbon was determined based on 3 soil samples to 2500 mg kg this is in agreement with former data from elbe river sediments at torgau with 2000 6000 mg kg determined in the upper 10 cm of the riverbed grischek et al 1993 the average effective porosity in the columns determined by nacl tracer tests was 0 30 0 29 0 31 each cycle was operated with fresh water from the river elbe thus the input water quality varied for each cycle table a1 appendix ec 411 50 μs cm ph 7 92 0 15 nitrate 3 0 4 mgn l ammonium 0 04 0 04 mgn l sulfate 55 6 mg l manganese 0 05 0 02 mg l iron 0 11 0 06 mg l doc 6 8 2 6 mg l and don 1 6 0 7 mg l were measured at room temperature ca 20 c before each cycle the dissolved oxygen do in the input water is dependent on the temperature of each column and was near 100 saturation about 11 mg l at 10 c 9 mg l at 20 c and 7 mg l at 30 c 3 2 columns output water quality c1 10 ammonium manganese and iron in the columns output water are displayed in fig 2 nitrate sulfate and doc in fig 3 and ph ec don in fig a2 appendix nitrite concentrations not shown ranged from 0 to 0 09 mgn l median of 0 01 mgn l detailed measurements for each column are shown in table a2 and a3 appendix median concentrations are given instead of mean concentrations as they are less affected by outliers in the measurements there is a distinct change in the output water quality between the first three phases ammonium iron and manganese concentrations became lower at each new phase and nitrate concentrations became higher the columns were flushed by 46 pore volumes pv before the start of phase 1 by 115 pv before phase 2 and by 184 pv before phase 3 fig a1 the hypothesized cause for the differences between phases is that the easily degradable soc and son in the column sediments is consumed at every cycle and has been partly depleted by the start of phase 2 and more so at the start of phase 3 the decreased availability of electron donors soc led to lesser reducing conditions in the columns and thus a lesser release of manganese and iron and lesser denitrification of nitrate the main sources of ammonium is mineralization of don from the river water and son from the riverbed sediments thus depletion of easily degradable son would also explain lower ammonium concentrations in phases 2 and 3 at equivalent temperatures and infiltration rates a simple mass balance approach was applied to review the likelihood of this hypothesis table a4 appendix initial soc in the sediments was determined as about 2500 mg kg with around 4 2 kg of riverbed sediments in the columns this amounts to 10 500 mg of soc in the columns according to grischek 2003 and schoenheinz 2004 only about 30 of the elbe river doc is biologically easily degradable assuming that freshly accumulated soc has a similar biodegradability as the doc this leaves 3150 mg of organic carbon available for microbiologically driven reactions bsoc the reactions assumed to consume bsoc are oxygen respiration denitrification and manganese iron and sulfate reduction desorption of soc is also expected to occur especially at 30 c additionally there is an influx of toc from the input water which also contains a particulate fraction known as particulate organic carbon poc poc corresponds to usually about 30 of doc in the elbe water e g 7 8 mg l toc 6 mg l doc 1 8 mg l poc taking this into account the estimated accumulated net depletion of bsoc column s1 was 163 mg before the start of phase 1 473 mg before phase 2 and 933 mg before phase 3 which still leaves about 2987 mg 95 2677 mg 85 and 2217 70 of bsoc in the columns respectively before each phase results are similar for the other columns not shown these values were calculated as if all reactions occurred exclusively by heterotrophic processes however it is possible that chemoautotrophic processes also occurred e g reduction of nitrate by reduced iron ions which would mean less bsoc consumption although only about 30 of bsoc in the columns was supposedly consumed according to this hypothesis it was enough to lead to significantly lesser reducing conditions in the columns this is possible because bsoc is not homogeneous and the more easily degradable fraction of bsoc is consumed first schoenheinz 2011 at the later phases the bsoc fraction which is degradable in the range of 0 to 18 h maximum retention time in the columns has been largely depleted even though most of bsoc with larger biodegradability times still remains this also explains why at the desorption experiments where the water is retained for much longer manganese and iron concentration still increase considerably and nitrate and sulfate are completely consumed a similar behavior can be observed for son and ammonium formation in the columns table a5 appendix the amount of son in the riverbed sediments was not measured however fischer et al 2005 measured the c n ratios between 11 5 and 13 5 from organic material of elbe riverbed sediments taken from the inside groynes about 70 km upstream to the sampling location of the present study thus considering a c n ratio of 12 5 the amount of son inside the columns is about 840 mg there is less research on the portion of biodegradable organic nitrogen bson but considering it the same as for organic carbon 30 there would be about 252 mg of bson in the columns there is an input of an average of 1 5 mg l of don from the river water and an average remaining don of 0 8 mg l in the output water finally consumption of son don occurs by mineralization to ammonium this results in an estimated consumption in column s1 of 32 mg at a temperature of 30 c before the start of phase 1 64 mg before the start of phase 2 and 89 mg before phase 3 which still leaves about 220 mg 88 188 mg 75 and 163 65 of bson in the column respectively before each phase it is also possible that ammonium mineralized in the columns can be nitrified while the column is still oxic or attenuated by anammox while nitrate is available in both cases a share of ammonium formation would not be detected which can lead to an underestimation of mineralization 3 3 impact of temperature and infiltration rates ammonium concentrations are about 3 to 7 times higher at 30 c compared with at 20 c while concentrations at 10 c are much lower ranging between 0 and 0 1 mgn l in both phases 1 and 2 lower infiltration rates higher residence times led to higher ammonium concentrations in phase 3 ammonium formation was low and infiltration rate was not a significant factor using spearman s rank correlation there is a strong correlation between ammonium and residence time at 30 c for both phase 1 r 0 71 p 0 01 and phase 2 r 0 76 p 0 01 at 20 c the correlation is strong in phase 2 r 0 72 p 0 01 and no significant correlation in phase 1 there is no significant correlation between ammonium concentrations and residence time at 10 c iron concentrations similarly to ammonium are about 3 to 11 times higher at 30 c compared with at 20 c while near 0 mg l at 10 c this is a result of stronger reducing conditions at warmer temperatures due to increased biological activity iron behavior according to infiltration rates is less predictable than ammonium and does not show any significant correlation manganese concentrations are similar at both 20 and 30 c being slightly higher at 20 c and about 4 to 10 times higher than at 10 c manganese concentrations like ammonium were also higher at lower infiltration rates due to test failures concentrations in cycles c1 and c2 for 20 c and 30 c could not be recorded ec remained very similar to the input water 5 difference ph was always higher in the input water median of 7 98 compared to the output water medians of 7 70 7 75 and 7 58 at 30 c 20 c and 10 c respectively decrease in ph is caused by the occurring redox reactions which are naturally acidifying sulfate remained mostly the same as the input water except at 30 c between cycles c1 to c5 where it decreased by up to 20 this indicates that at 30 c sulfate reduction occurred in those cycles potentially affecting iron concentrations by sulfide precipitation doc concentrations are slightly higher than the input water at 30 c for infiltration rates of 0 2 and 0 26 m3 m2 d for phases 1 and 2 between 13 and 37 increase but not for infiltration rates of 0 33 m3 m2 d and phase 3 while at 10 and 20 c doc concentrations were slightly lower than input concentrations schoenheinz 2004 has also observed higher release of organics at higher temperatures and low flow velocities in column experiments which was attributed to the increased dissolution of adsorbed soc from the sediments at such conditions higher do concentrations in the input water at 10 and 20 c also enhances doc oxidation consumption further explaining lower concentrations 3 4 impact of nitrate concentrations nitrate concentrations during the normal cycles c1 10 ranged between 2 and 3 4 mgn l in the input water in phase 4 additional five cycles c11 15 were operated for all columns at 30 c with river water with varying nitrate concentrations 0 2 3 and 11 mgn l the impacts to ammonium concentrations in the effluent are displayed in fig 4 even though all columns were operated with the same temperature 30 c and infiltration rate 1 ml min or 0 33 m3 m2 d ammonium concentrations in the effluent of columns s5 and s6 were considerably higher while concentrations of columns s1 and s2 were lower columns s1 and s2 have been operated so far c1 10 at 30 c thus expected to have mineralized more son while columns s5 and s6 have been operated at 10 c and columns s3 and s4 at 20 c thus having more available son remaining now that all columns are operated at 30 c columns s3 to s6 have more organic nitrogen available for mineralization especially columns s5 and s6 thus explaining higher ammonium concentrations when operated at 35 c c12 and c13 columns s1 and s2 showed ammonium concentrations in the effluent equivalent to columns s3 and s4 which continued to be operated at 30 c if dnra was an important contributing reaction to ammonium formation ammonium concentrations was expected to increase in the cycle with increased nitrate compared with the other cycles however concentrations remained equivalent or even slightly lower also if dnra played a role operation with no nitrate c11 and c12 is expected to result in lower ammonium concentrations however the opposite occurred and ammonium concentrations became higher the most likely explanation for this is that anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is occurring in the cycles with nitrate in the input water leading to higher ammonium attenuation in those cycles this would also explain why the lowest ammonium concentrations occurred in the operation with 11 mgn l nitrate c15 and why higher ammonium concentrations were observed in the cycle with 2 mgn l nitrate c13 compared with 3 mgn l c14 it s also possible that water quality differences which occurred during nitrate removal are responsible for the resulting ammonium concentrations but since ph has been restored to previous values the other changes are not expected to be significant to ammonium behavior for anammox to occur it is necessary that both ammonium and nitrite are present nitrite in both input and output water is negligible but since nitrite is an intermediate product of both nitrification and denitrification it is expected to be formed inside the columns nitrite is an unstable compound and is quickly transformed after both half reactions but according to dalsgaard et al 2005 nitrite availability does not limit anammox rates in marine sediments where the main source of nitrite is the reduction from nitrate the presence of oxygen is a strong inhibitor of the anammox process jetten et al 1998 therefore if anammox is occurring it is in the nitrate reduction zone in the column where after nitrate is reduced to nitrite part of the nitrite serves as electron acceptor for ammonium while the remaining follows the denitrification path if one assumes that the anammox process is the sole responsible for variations in ammonium concentration between the cycles with c13 15 and without nitrate c11 12 and that mineralization rates are the same anammox is responsible for the attenuation of 63 9 of ammonium in the situation with 2 mgn l nitrate in the input water of 72 7 in the situation with 3 mgn l and of 84 13 in the situation with 11 mgn l although this indicates that anammox is potentially a significant sink for ammonium estimated nitrate consumption by anammox is less significant in relation to total consumption the remaining being attributed to denitrification following the same assumptions made for ammonium anammox was responsible for 12 8 of the nitrate consumption the potential occurrence of anammox also implies that the estimated mineralization rates made previously are possibly underestimated and consequently the consumption of son in the columns made in section 3 3 could be underestimated as well nitrogen isotopes were measured for the nitrate in the input water and ammonium in the output water for cycles c1 7 for the columns at 30 c s1 and s2 for the cycles c2 7 the nitrate was spiked with enriched 15n while c1 had the natural nitrogen isotopic footprint of the river elbe as the isotopic footprint of the elbe varies week to week and new water was used at each cycle with the same spiked concentration the input nitrate 15n also varied for each cycle the results fig 5 show an increase of 15n in the ammonium in output water median 15 1 compared with the son of the sediments 8 4 according to literature the isotopic footprint of don in the river elbe also lies in a similar range as the sediments between 5 and 11 deutsch et al 2009 mineralization of organic nitrogen to ammonium usually leads to a small enrichment ε 1 therefore ammonium produced in the columns exclusively by mineralization would be expected to have an isotope ratio of about 9 4 dnra could be an explanation for the further enrichment of the ammonium in the columns as the artificially enriched nitrate 70 100 is the substrate for the reaction however a similar enrichment is found at cycle 1 where nitrate was not spiked with enriched 15n and had an isotopic ratio of 7 7 therefore the enrichment in cycle 1 to 17 in s1 and 14 in s2 cannot possibly be explained by dnra since the substrate nitrate would have lower 15n concentrations than the product ammonium a more likely explanation which also corroborates with the experiments with varying nitrate concentrations is that isotopic fractionation during anammox is the cause for the 15n enrichment in output ammonium comparing the cycles with natural nitrate concentrations 2 3 mgn l and operations without nitrate there is an average of about 0 3 mgn l difference between equivalent cycles assuming that anammox is responsible for the consumption of 0 3 mgn l of ammonium for the cycles where isotopic measurements were made the enrichment factor ε for ammonium during anammox based on the measured isotope ratios would be about 17 2 9 3 which lies in a similar range to previous studies of 23 to 29 brunner et al 2013 and 31 to 33 kobayashi et al 2019 using the range of ε for anammox found in the literature 23 and 33 ammonium biodegradation by anammox can be estimated for the cycles where isotopes ratios were measured fig 6 considering ε 23 a biodegradation of ammonium of 24 8 or 0 21 0 12 mgn l is calculated while considering ε 33 a biodegradation of 17 6 or 0 14 0 08 mgn l is reached biodegradation by anammox is likely higher in the columns of lower temperatures although total biodegradation is lower where ammonium concentrations are lower and nitrate concentrations are not limiting the above estimations assume that only anammox is causing ammonium enrichment however ammonium isotope enrichment also takes place due to nitrification which occurs while the columns are still oxic but since the oxic zone in the columns is assumed to be only a few centimeters fractionation due to nitrification was not considered 3 5 desorption experiments three times the columns were stopped and left stagnant for an extended period twice for 18 days at room temperature ca 20 c d1 and d2 and once for 22 days at different temperatures 10 20 and 30 c d3 d1 was done between phases 1 and 2 while d2 and d3 were done between phases 2 and 3 afterward columns were restarted and operated at 1 ml min 0 33 m3 m2 d for several days to wash out the ions which had accumulated ec ammonium manganese and iron concentrations substantially increased while the columns were not operated wash out of ammonium varied according to temperature being completed faster at lower temperatures in all cases ammonium reached stable values 5 variation within two consecutive days much later than ec after about 2 pv ec was mostly stable while ammonium concentrations required up to 13 pv fig 7 the retardation factor can be estimated by the pv when c c0 equals 0 5 retardation of ammonium ranged from 1 7 to 3 7 at 30 c from 1 4 to 2 8 at 20 c and from 1 to 2 4 at 10 c these values assume ammonium is not being consumed once operation restarts and only exchange processes are significant which is not the case as nitrification and likely anammox will ensue once fresh water is flushed to the columns making ammonium concentration decrease in a faster rate therefore the calculated retardation factors are assumed to be slightly underestimated doc concentrations and major cations were measured right after the start of the second desorption experiment and after the wash out was complete dissolution of soc hypothesized in section 3 4 is endorsed by an increase in doc concentrations 47 120 observed in all columns just after restarting despite the expected consumption of doc during the stagnant phase the increase in ec during stagnation is not only caused by an increase in manganese iron and ammonium concentrations but also due to an increase to major cations just after restarting the columns calcium 112 magnesium 97 potassium 68 and sodium 66 concentrations increased compared to input concentrations but during further operation they returned to values equal to input concentrations there is not a clear reason why major cations concentrations increased one hypothesis is that dissolution of soc from the columns also released the cations adsorbed to the organic material in the columns 3 6 practical implications and comparison with field data ammonium in drinking water has no immediate health relevance so there are no health based guideline value for it however since ammonium can compromise post treatment processes such as chlorination a limit of 0 5 mg l has been recommended in the past who 2006 this limit was only surpassed when the columns were operated at 30 c cycles c1 6 and c11 12 ammonium concentrations in the output water of the columns varied from 0 up to 1 mgn l depending on operating conditions pan et al 2018 observed 2 1 and 0 6 mgn l of ammonium in the riverbed pore water of the qingyang river china in summer and winter respectively ammonium in the qingyang river was ca 0 3 mgn l in summer and ca 0 4 mgn l in winter while doussan et al 1998 observed ammonium concentrations 25 mgn l in the riverbed pore water of the seine river france ammonium in the seine river was ca 3 mgn l at both sites the organic carbon content of the riverbed was higher than in the sediments used for the current experiments 0 25 in the riverbed sediments from qingyang river organic matter content was 1 2 while in the seine river sediments the organic content ranged from 3 to 15 other sites such as in lake tegel berlin germany pekdeger 2010 or in the elbe river torgau germany grischek et al 1998 have shown negligible ammonium concentrations in the riverbed pore water 0 1 mgn l this shows that ammonium formation potential is directly linked with riverbed composition especially organic content and can vary considerably in magnitude accordingly therefore riverbed composition should be part of the investigation for any large scale rbf site the main controls on ammonium concentrations during the column experiments were temperature water residence time infiltration rate nitrate concentrations in the input water and the amount of labile organic material in the columns lower infiltration rates increase the residence time which resulted in higher ammonium concentrations and more reduced conditions in the effluent water of the columns small variations in infiltration rates in the columns from 0 33 to 0 2 m3 m2 d were sufficient to cause an increase of about 50 in ammonium concentrations in phase 1 and 100 in phase 2 at all temperatures this means that lower infiltration rates in the riverbed of bank filtration sites can lead to increased mineralization stronger reducing conditions and consequently higher ammonium manganese and iron concentrations in the abstracted water of course other factors such as riverbed aquifer composition and mixing with landside groundwater will influence the final quality of the abstracted water the main factors affecting infiltration rate during rbf are the flow gradient between the river and the groundwater at the abstraction well caused by the water abstraction and composition clogging of the riverbed clogging of the riverbed can increase with long term rbf operation grischek and bartak 2016 riverbeds with high amounts of fine material have lower infiltration rates and are more susceptible to clogging effects during rbf furthermore such riverbeds also usually contain higher amounts of organic material which would mean stronger reducing conditions and more son available for mineralization thus sites with high amounts of fines in the riverbed are subjected to higher potential in ammonium formation on the other hand clay particle minerals increase the riverbed sorption capacity which can lead to ammonium retardation and accumulation in the riverbed doussan et al 1998 in the present study the estimated retardation factor rd for ammonium in the riverbed sediments was 2 1 0 77 rd values were comparable to other experiments with sandy ceazan et al 1989 and silty nunes delgado et al 1997 sediments in the literature the delay caused by retardation will lead to a delay for ammonium to reach the aquifer and abstraction wells but ammonium will eventually breakthrough providing no other reaction occurs therefore ammonium concentrations should be cautiously examined at rbf sites along rivers with fine sediments as commonly found e g in river deltas grischek and ray 2009 riverbanks with abundant vegetation e g in vietnam india or old branches and oxbow lakes sampling of the riverbed pore water in the pilot phase of an rbf site can give indications about the potential risk of ammonium contamination lower temperatures constrain biological reactions e g denitrification and mineralization hence output water in the columns with low temperature 10 c had low ammonium 0 1 mgn l manganese 1 mg l and iron 0 1 mg l concentrations and high nitrate concentrations 2 2 0 3 mgn l even at low infiltration rates furthermore water at low temperatures commonly has higher do concentrations thus enhancing doc oxidation and limiting the amount of electron donors for denitrification and manganese iron reduction high temperatures 30 c promote higher biological activity reducing nitrate 0 0 7 mgn l releasing manganese 1 65 0 91 mg l and iron 1 24 0 96 mg l and forming more ammonium 0 55 0 3 mgn l during riverbed infiltration this is in agreement with gross wittke et al 2010 and pan et al 2018 which showed that higher temperatures promoted higher mineralization rates in the riverbed medium temperatures 20 c allow for biological reactions to occur but with lower rate as compared to higher temperatures 0 09 0 08 mgn l ammonium these results show that rbf sites at warmer climates are more susceptible to ammonium formation in the riverbed and release of manganese and iron during water infiltration the results also highlight the possible effects which increasing temperatures due to climate change can pose to rbf water quality even in colder climates ammonium formation in the riverbed is expected to increase in the summer months however since travel times at rbf sites are often between 50 and 200 days grischek et al 2002 kruc et al 2020 water mixing will buffer this effect depletion of easily degradable soc son in the columns is the hypothesized cause for weaker reducing conditions and reduced ammonium formation in the later phases of the experiment this reinforces the hypothesis proposed by grischek et al 1998 that soc in the riverbed of the river elbe is an important additional supply of electron donors to river doc during rbf a mass balance estimation indicates that the consumption of only about 30 of the biodegradable organic material in the columns start of phase 3 already leads to drastic differences in redox conditions leading to minimal release of iron and ammonium formation this suggests that at sites where organic material is not frequently deposited in the riverbed weaker reducing conditions and lower ammonium formation might set in after a few weeks or months of rbf operation this was observed at an rbf site in the nile egypt where ammonium concentrations fell from 0 5 to 0 1 mg l after a few months of operation during the initial phase of rbf wahaab et al 2019 since doc is expected to be partially consumed during columns passage it is reasonable to assume that doc concentrations will decrease in the columns outlet compared to the input concentrations however output doc concentrations were higher than input concentrations at high temperatures and low infiltration rates this indicates a release of doc from the columns at these conditions as was observed by schoenheinz 2004 in practice this means that higher temperatures can lead to increased doc concentrations in the abstracted water at rbf sites during the cycles with no nitrate in the input water ammonium concentrations increased in the output water this means that either nitrate is hindering ammonium formation or nitrate increasing ammonium consumption the latter is the more likely alternative as ammonium can be oxidized by nitrite via anammox anammox has rarely been considered to play an important role during rbf or generally in the hyporheic zone with a few exceptions akbarzadeh et al 2018 groeschke et al 2016 however the results from the column experiments indicate that it may be a significant ammonium sink if sufficient nitrate is present in the river water the practical implication of anammox occurrence during rbf is that rivers with nitrate concentrations 2mgn l such as the rivers rhine or elbe may have a buffer of protection against ammonium formation during rbf at the rbf site near torgau from where the columns sediments were taken ammonium concentrations in the riverbed pore water are 0 02 mgn l grischek et al 1998 it appears that mineralization is not taking place at the riverbed however the results from the column experiments suggest that ammonium is formed by mineralization but it is subsequently attenuated via anammox more research is still necessary to confirm anammox as a significant sink of ammonium in the hyporheic zone the increase in ammonium concentration during operation with no nitrate and the slight decrease during operation with increased nitrate leads to the assumption that dnra is not a significant factor in either ammonium formation or nitrate attenuation this is in accordance with previous studies which emphasized that dnra does not play a significant role in situations with low oc no3 ratios burgin and hamilton 2007 pandey et al 2019 tiedje 1982 which is the case in these column experiments although the observed isotopic enrichment of ammonium nitrogen could point towards dnra occurrence it is more likely that isotopic fractionation caused by anammox led to the enrichment 4 conclusions the riverbed is a highly biologically active region where most biological reactions are expected to occur during riverbank filtration rbf including denitrification ammonium mineralization manganese and iron reduction release column experiments were utilized to evaluate the controls on these reactions the main findings include higher temperatures led to higher ammonium formation by mineralization denitrification of nitrate and release of manganese and iron higher column residence time lower infiltration rates also led to higher ammonium formation partial depletion of biodegradable organic material is hypothesized to cause considerably lower ammonium formation and weaker reducing conditions in the columns in the later phases of the experiments dnra does not appear be significant in ammonium formation however anammox does seem to play an important role in ammonium attenuation the main practical implications to rbf sites are sites located in regions with warmer climate e g egypt vietnam malaysia india are more susceptible to increased ammonium concentrations due to increased mineralization in the riverbed a decrease in the infiltration rate in the riverbed due to clogging or reduced gradient can lead to an increase in ammonium formation organic content of the riverbed plays an important role in the ammonium formation and redox conditions of the bank filtrate and therefore should be part of the investigation for any large scale rbf site sites where organic material is not frequently deposited in the riverbed may observe a reduction in ammonium formation and manganese iron release after the initial phase of operation rivers with nitrate concentrations 2 mgn l may have a buffer of protection against ammonium due to potential of anammox occurring in the riverbed aquifer authors contribution gustavo covatti conceptualization investigation formal analysis writing and editing thomas grischek

1282,in this study the adsorption of benzoic acid and phenols in the aqueous phase by mof cu adsorbent was investigated a high performance liquid chromatography hplc device was used to analyze the concentration of contaminants in the solution three isotherms freundlich langmuir and temkin were performed for adsorption of benzoic acid ba and phenol contaminants correlation factor for adsorption isotherms were fitted into langmuir aqueous ba and phenol would be 99 89 and 99 98 respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacity mof cu of ba and phenol is 636 73 and 524 42 mg g respectively in this study high contaminant adsorption with π π interaction and hydrogen bonding leads to the high capacity of mofcu in addition the increase in adsorption capacity of benzoic acid is due to the electronegative property of oxygen in the carbonyl group and the similarity of the carboxylic acid functional group with the adsorbent the result shows that at initial time adsorption has been a non linear trend in addition the first order kinetic model is not a suitable option for fitting the experimental data of adsorption kinetics and the adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol is very well compatible with the semi second order with the correlation factor being 99 7 and 99 78 respectively also the equilibrium adsorption capacity in pseudo second order kinetic for ba and phenol is 613 5

kinetics of contaminate on active sites of adsorbent can lead to a better understanding of the adsorbent behavior shiva et al 2015 the initial concentration of contaminant has been considered 3500 ppm due determine equilibrium parameter of pseudo first order and pseudo second order defined in kinetics adsorption 3 4 1 first order adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol the pseudo first order adsorption kinetics model can be expressed as in eq 1 1 dq dt k 1 q e q t ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k1 the rate constant 1 min qe capacity in equilibrium mg g and qt is adsorption capacity at time t if the adsorption data do not correspond to the first order equation another kinetic model should be used peng et al 2008 fig 5 a and b illustrate the kinetics order of adsorption of ba and phenol pollutants the pseudo first order kinetics for ba and phenol contaminant the correlation factor have more deviation in the initial times with 95 38 and 96 63 respectively this deviation was greater for ba indicating that ba uptake was nonlinear at initial time in previous studies the deviation in contaminant uptake in adoption at the initial time for the first order equation has been reported in table 1 ayranci and duman 2006 the equilibrium adsorption capacity for ba and phenol contaminant is 323 35 and 279 3 mg g respectively which indicates the better performance of the adsorbent in the adsorption of ba and this can be attributed to better interaction of ba relative to phenol with mof cu adsorbent 3 4 2 second order adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol the second order adsorption kinetics model can be expressed as in eq 2 el yazeed and ahmed 2019 2 dq dt k 2 q e q t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t in the eq 2 k2 and qe are obtained from t qt in terms of t fig 5c and d are shown comparison kinetic molder for ba and phenol contaminant the fit of the experimental data on the second order equation goodness with the correlation coefficient is 99 7 and 99 78 respectively and its deviation is low in previous studies better performance of the second order equation has been mentioned behvandi et al 2017 aldawsari et al 2020 the suitability of pseudo second order can be attributed to the high rate of contaminant adsorption due the high adsorption capacity of mofcu which will be led to nonlinear adsorption kinetics as shown result the first order kinetic model is not a suitable option for fitting the experimental data of adsorption kinetics table 1 shown the pseudo second order of kinetic constants in terms of fitting the the equilibrium adsorption capacity in pseudo second order kinetic for ba and phenol is 613 5 and 523 56 mg g respectively as shown in fig 5c the diagram can be divided into three regions the first region is from zero equilibrium concentration up to 505 ppm in which the adsorbent amount of 10 mg is capable of high adsorption capacity up to the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 485 mg of pollutant per gram of adsorbent in this case it shows that the small amount of adsorbent has the ability to significantly remove the contaminant in the second region which continues until the equilibrium concentration of 1760 ppm the process of pollutant adsorption decreases with increasing concentration so that at a concentration of 1760 ppm the equilibrium adsorption capacity will reach about 596 mg of pollutant per gram of adsorbent in this area changes in adsorption capacity are reduced which means that the increase in the concentration of contaminants is greater than the adsorbent capacity dosing so the difference will not be much difference in concentration in the third area where the graph is smooth the decrease in pollutant concentration and increase in pollutant adsorption capacity will be not seen so that the final adsorption capacity at the equilibrium concentration of 3250 ppm is equal to 636 mg of pollutant per gram of adsorbent which indicates higher contaminant concentration is the amount of adsorbent weight ability to reduce concentration as observed in fig 5d phenol pollutants from concentrations of 0 25 100 200 300 700 1400 2000 2500 3000 and 3500 ppm to equilibrium concentrations of 0 12 51 108 160 525 1214 1802 2292 2790 3290 ppm has been reached these tests results are used to investigate the adsorption isotherm as shown in this figure the equilibrium concentration curve can be divided into three regions according to the equilibrium adsorption capacity the first region is from zero equilibrium concentration up to 525 ppm this case considered that the changes in concentration and percentage of adsorption are extremely high and indicate a high adsorbent capacity at low weight 10 mg the concentration of 525 ppm equilibrium adsorption capacity is about 438 mg per gram of adsorbent however this amount was less than the adsorption capacity of ba but was significant compared to other mofs and conventional adsorbents and indicates the high performance of the adsorbent in removing contaminants in the second region the equilibrium concentration continues up to 1811 ppm as the equilibrium adsorption capacity decreases and the adsorption capacity will reach 492 mg g of adsorbent in the third region changes in equilibrium concentration are not noticeable and eventually the equilibrium adsorption capacity will reach 524 mg g of adsorbent the reason for this is the inability of the adsorbent weight to remove high concentrations because according to langmuir model the adsorption of the contaminant was limited to a single layer and with the saturation of the adsorbent the change in the concentration of the contaminant will be negligible 3 4 3 adsorption isotherms of benzoic acid and phenol the study of the adsorption isotherms of freundlich langmuir and temkin is performed by equilibrium data equilibrium time the adsorption capacity can be expressed as in eq 3 3 q e c e v m where m is the amount weight of adsorbent v is the volume of pollutant ce is the equilibrium concentration and qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity as shown fig 6 with increase the concentration of the contaminant the ability of the mof adsorbent to remove the ba contaminant decreases and it can be said that the adsorbent is saturated with the contaminant and therefore cannot absorb more in previous studies it has been observed that the trend of decreasing adsorption with increased concentrations of contaminant patil et al 2011 as shown fig 6 the equilibrium adsorption capacity vs various equilibrium concentration of phenol in previous studies and in this work similar trend has been observed in the process of adsorption of phenol and ba contaminates with mof cu adsorbent tian et al 2015 attributed to the inability of the adsorbent to remove high concentrations since the adsorption of the contaminant was limited to a single layer according to the langmuir model therefore the change in the contaminant concentration will be negligible through the saturation of the adsorbent 3 4 4 the adsorption isotherm of freundlich ba and phenol fig 7 obtained by fitting the experimental data on the liner freundlich isotherm for the ba and phenol contaminate the freundlich adsorption isotherm assuming non uniform surface energy and non ideal adsorption in the high concentration range fits better on the experimental data the freundlich adsorption isotherm is goodness result for the specified range of contaminate concentration and it is not suitable to investigated low concentrations zango et al 2020 lin et al 2014 result shown not goodness fitting phenol and ba adsorption in low concentrations with freundlich isotherm adsorption of ba contaminant with a correlation factor r2 of 92 73 reveals a better fit on the experimental data in comparison with adsorption of phenol contaminant with a correlation coefficient of 83 76 since the values of 1 n are less than one in both equations it can be concluded the adsorption is a monolayer and langmuir isotherm zango et al 2020 as shown table 2 the freundlich isotherm constants for ba and phenol contaminates where kf is the constant of adsorption capacity and n is overall adsorption intensity adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity of ba contaminant are slightly higher than phenol contaminant the reason for this difference can be considered in the stronger interaction of ba with mof cu adsorbent because of the presence of carbonyl group in ba hydrogen bond and the benzene ring in it can lead to an increase in this interaction behvandi et al 2017 3 4 5 the adsorption isotherm of langmuir ba and phenol fig 8 a and b used to determine the langmuir constants for ba and phenol contaminants in the assumption of langmuir isotherm adsorption is limited monolayer moreover the chemical adsorption occurred at monolayer so it is assumed in langmuir isotherm is good agreement with that the experimental data the correlation factor for the phenol and ba was close to 99 98 which indicates the compatibility of the experimental data with the langmuir adsorption isotherm as shown table 2 the results of fitting the experimental data on the langmuir adsorption equation the langmuir qmax equation constant is the saturation adsorption capacity meaning that all adsorption sites are saturated with contaminate the qmax are 662 25 and 549 45 for ba and phenol respectively which indicates that the adsorption capacity of ba is higher than phenol the higher adsorption capacity of ba related of the interactions with adsorbent the π π interaction with the benzene rings existed in both of contaminate on the other hand another type of interaction seems to be considered as an increase in adsorption capacity in the ba structure the presence of carbonyl groups in addition to the benzene ring will enhance the ability to interact from the oxygen side in this group and create an interaction with the copper metal to the enhance of adsorption behvandi et al 2017 in langmuir isotherm the separation coefficient parameter which indicates the type of adsorption is defined as below 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 and kl are langmuir initial and constant concentrations respectively so if rl 1 is undesirable adsorption 0 rl 1 is optimal adsorption rl 0 is irreversible adsorption and rl 1 expresses linear adsorption langmuir separation coefficient phenol and ba are in the optimal adsorption range which indicates the correct choice of adsorbent in the process morever this has been reported in previous studies el yazeed and ahmed 2019 rostamnia et al 2016 3 4 6 the adsorption isotherm of temkin ba and phenol in the temkin isotherm assumed that there is an indirect relationship between the adsorbent molecule and the adsorbent and heat of adsorption is decreased after the adsorbent is covered by the adsorbate zango et al 2020 in fig 8c and d the variable qe is plotted in terms of log ce for ba and phenol the fit of experimental data of ba and phenol with correlation factor of 97 17 and 95 91 respectively indicates better adaptation of ba to phenol in this isotherm at high concentrations good agreement was observed with the experimental data while at low concentrations have more deviation therefore at the initial time with high concentration of contaminant using temkin isotherm has been is preferred in the temkin isotherm no direct interaction is made between the adsorbent and the adsorbent and the model will create a better fit for the high concentrations however at low concentrations it will not provide conditions for indirect interaction due to the unsaturation of the adsorbent surface as a result shown the deviation in this area will be more zango et al 2020 the results of fitting the experimental data on the temkin isotherm are given in table 3 among the isotherms investigated above the langmuir model is more accurate assuming single layer adsorption 3 5 comparison of ba and ph pollutant adsorption kinetics with other works table 4 compares the adsorption kinetics of this work with various other adsorbents in ba and ph pollutants as observed the equilibrium adsorption capacity of mof cu is higher and much higher than that of other conventional adsorbents adsorption quadratic kinetics with a correlation coefficient much higher than the first degree will be a more appropriate option in contrast the use of very low capacity adsorbents due to the low adsorption rate shows the first order kinetics of a better fit of the experimental data 4 conclusions mof as a porous material with unique properties such as high specific surface area and suitable adjustable structure with the needs of the adsorption process is a suitable option for being used in the adsorption process of aromatic in aqueous solution in this work the uptake of ba and phenol contaminants on mof cu was investigated in the among the adsorption isotherms investigated in these studies only langmuir isotherms was able to predict the adsorption behavior with a very good due the assuming single layer adsorption which is compatible with chemically adsorption mof cu with hydrogen bonding π π interaction with the benzene rings lead to much higher adsorption than some conventional adsorbents the results shown difference adsorption capacity between ba and phenol which is due to the ability of copper to interact with oxygen in the carbonyl group because oxygen with high electronegative properties could create a negative partial charge and copper s tendency to accept electrons and increase the interaction and better adsorption of ba contaminate the equilibrium adsorption capacity for ba and phenol contaminant is 323 35 and 279 3 mg g respectively which indicates the better performance of the adsorbent in the adsorption of ba and this can be attributed to better interaction of ba relative to phenol with mof cu adsorbent the adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol are very much in linear with the pseudo second order while this deviation is much higher pseudo first order due to the high adsorption capacity of the mof cu adsorbent and lead more deviation at the initial adsorption time the langmuir qmax equation constant is the saturation adsorption capacity meaning that all adsorption sites are saturated with contaminate the qmax are 662 25 and 549 45 for ba and phenol respectively which indicates that the adsorption capacity of ba is higher than phenol the higher adsorption capacity of ba related of the interactions with adsorbent the fit of experimental data of ba and phenol with correlation factor of 97 17 and 95 91 respectively indicates better adaptation of ba to phenol in this isotherm at high concentrations good agreement was observed with the experimental data while at low concentrations have more deviation declaration of competing interest there is no funding for this work 
1282,in this study the adsorption of benzoic acid and phenols in the aqueous phase by mof cu adsorbent was investigated a high performance liquid chromatography hplc device was used to analyze the concentration of contaminants in the solution three isotherms freundlich langmuir and temkin were performed for adsorption of benzoic acid ba and phenol contaminants correlation factor for adsorption isotherms were fitted into langmuir aqueous ba and phenol would be 99 89 and 99 98 respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacity mof cu of ba and phenol is 636 73 and 524 42 mg g respectively in this study high contaminant adsorption with π π interaction and hydrogen bonding leads to the high capacity of mofcu in addition the increase in adsorption capacity of benzoic acid is due to the electronegative property of oxygen in the carbonyl group and the similarity of the carboxylic acid functional group with the adsorbent the result shows that at initial time adsorption has been a non linear trend in addition the first order kinetic model is not a suitable option for fitting the experimental data of adsorption kinetics and the adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol is very well compatible with the semi second order with the correlation factor being 99 7 and 99 78 respectively also the equilibrium adsorption capacity in pseudo second order kinetic for ba and phenol is 613 5

kinetics of contaminate on active sites of adsorbent can lead to a better understanding of the adsorbent behavior shiva et al 2015 the initial concentration of contaminant has been considered 3500 ppm due determine equilibrium parameter of pseudo first order and pseudo second order defined in kinetics adsorption 3 4 1 first order adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol the pseudo first order adsorption kinetics model can be expressed as in eq 1 1 dq dt k 1 q e q t ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k1 the rate constant 1 min qe capacity in equilibrium mg g and qt is adsorption capacity at time t if the adsorption data do not correspond to the first order equation another kinetic model should be used peng et al 2008 fig 5 a and b illustrate the kinetics order of adsorption of ba and phenol pollutants the pseudo first order kinetics for ba and phenol contaminant the correlation factor have more deviation in the initial times with 95 38 and 96 63 respectively this deviation was greater for ba indicating that ba uptake was nonlinear at initial time in previous studies the deviation in contaminant uptake in adoption at the initial time for the first order equation has been reported in table 1 ayranci and duman 2006 the equilibrium adsorption capacity for ba and phenol contaminant is 323 35 and 279 3 mg g respectively which indicates the better performance of the adsorbent in the adsorption of ba and this can be attributed to better interaction of ba relative to phenol with mof cu adsorbent 3 4 2 second order adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol the second order adsorption kinetics model can be expressed as in eq 2 el yazeed and ahmed 2019 2 dq dt k 2 q e q t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t in the eq 2 k2 and qe are obtained from t qt in terms of t fig 5c and d are shown comparison kinetic molder for ba and phenol contaminant the fit of the experimental data on the second order equation goodness with the correlation coefficient is 99 7 and 99 78 respectively and its deviation is low in previous studies better performance of the second order equation has been mentioned behvandi et al 2017 aldawsari et al 2020 the suitability of pseudo second order can be attributed to the high rate of contaminant adsorption due the high adsorption capacity of mofcu which will be led to nonlinear adsorption kinetics as shown result the first order kinetic model is not a suitable option for fitting the experimental data of adsorption kinetics table 1 shown the pseudo second order of kinetic constants in terms of fitting the the equilibrium adsorption capacity in pseudo second order kinetic for ba and phenol is 613 5 and 523 56 mg g respectively as shown in fig 5c the diagram can be divided into three regions the first region is from zero equilibrium concentration up to 505 ppm in which the adsorbent amount of 10 mg is capable of high adsorption capacity up to the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 485 mg of pollutant per gram of adsorbent in this case it shows that the small amount of adsorbent has the ability to significantly remove the contaminant in the second region which continues until the equilibrium concentration of 1760 ppm the process of pollutant adsorption decreases with increasing concentration so that at a concentration of 1760 ppm the equilibrium adsorption capacity will reach about 596 mg of pollutant per gram of adsorbent in this area changes in adsorption capacity are reduced which means that the increase in the concentration of contaminants is greater than the adsorbent capacity dosing so the difference will not be much difference in concentration in the third area where the graph is smooth the decrease in pollutant concentration and increase in pollutant adsorption capacity will be not seen so that the final adsorption capacity at the equilibrium concentration of 3250 ppm is equal to 636 mg of pollutant per gram of adsorbent which indicates higher contaminant concentration is the amount of adsorbent weight ability to reduce concentration as observed in fig 5d phenol pollutants from concentrations of 0 25 100 200 300 700 1400 2000 2500 3000 and 3500 ppm to equilibrium concentrations of 0 12 51 108 160 525 1214 1802 2292 2790 3290 ppm has been reached these tests results are used to investigate the adsorption isotherm as shown in this figure the equilibrium concentration curve can be divided into three regions according to the equilibrium adsorption capacity the first region is from zero equilibrium concentration up to 525 ppm this case considered that the changes in concentration and percentage of adsorption are extremely high and indicate a high adsorbent capacity at low weight 10 mg the concentration of 525 ppm equilibrium adsorption capacity is about 438 mg per gram of adsorbent however this amount was less than the adsorption capacity of ba but was significant compared to other mofs and conventional adsorbents and indicates the high performance of the adsorbent in removing contaminants in the second region the equilibrium concentration continues up to 1811 ppm as the equilibrium adsorption capacity decreases and the adsorption capacity will reach 492 mg g of adsorbent in the third region changes in equilibrium concentration are not noticeable and eventually the equilibrium adsorption capacity will reach 524 mg g of adsorbent the reason for this is the inability of the adsorbent weight to remove high concentrations because according to langmuir model the adsorption of the contaminant was limited to a single layer and with the saturation of the adsorbent the change in the concentration of the contaminant will be negligible 3 4 3 adsorption isotherms of benzoic acid and phenol the study of the adsorption isotherms of freundlich langmuir and temkin is performed by equilibrium data equilibrium time the adsorption capacity can be expressed as in eq 3 3 q e c e v m where m is the amount weight of adsorbent v is the volume of pollutant ce is the equilibrium concentration and qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity as shown fig 6 with increase the concentration of the contaminant the ability of the mof adsorbent to remove the ba contaminant decreases and it can be said that the adsorbent is saturated with the contaminant and therefore cannot absorb more in previous studies it has been observed that the trend of decreasing adsorption with increased concentrations of contaminant patil et al 2011 as shown fig 6 the equilibrium adsorption capacity vs various equilibrium concentration of phenol in previous studies and in this work similar trend has been observed in the process of adsorption of phenol and ba contaminates with mof cu adsorbent tian et al 2015 attributed to the inability of the adsorbent to remove high concentrations since the adsorption of the contaminant was limited to a single layer according to the langmuir model therefore the change in the contaminant concentration will be negligible through the saturation of the adsorbent 3 4 4 the adsorption isotherm of freundlich ba and phenol fig 7 obtained by fitting the experimental data on the liner freundlich isotherm for the ba and phenol contaminate the freundlich adsorption isotherm assuming non uniform surface energy and non ideal adsorption in the high concentration range fits better on the experimental data the freundlich adsorption isotherm is goodness result for the specified range of contaminate concentration and it is not suitable to investigated low concentrations zango et al 2020 lin et al 2014 result shown not goodness fitting phenol and ba adsorption in low concentrations with freundlich isotherm adsorption of ba contaminant with a correlation factor r2 of 92 73 reveals a better fit on the experimental data in comparison with adsorption of phenol contaminant with a correlation coefficient of 83 76 since the values of 1 n are less than one in both equations it can be concluded the adsorption is a monolayer and langmuir isotherm zango et al 2020 as shown table 2 the freundlich isotherm constants for ba and phenol contaminates where kf is the constant of adsorption capacity and n is overall adsorption intensity adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity of ba contaminant are slightly higher than phenol contaminant the reason for this difference can be considered in the stronger interaction of ba with mof cu adsorbent because of the presence of carbonyl group in ba hydrogen bond and the benzene ring in it can lead to an increase in this interaction behvandi et al 2017 3 4 5 the adsorption isotherm of langmuir ba and phenol fig 8 a and b used to determine the langmuir constants for ba and phenol contaminants in the assumption of langmuir isotherm adsorption is limited monolayer moreover the chemical adsorption occurred at monolayer so it is assumed in langmuir isotherm is good agreement with that the experimental data the correlation factor for the phenol and ba was close to 99 98 which indicates the compatibility of the experimental data with the langmuir adsorption isotherm as shown table 2 the results of fitting the experimental data on the langmuir adsorption equation the langmuir qmax equation constant is the saturation adsorption capacity meaning that all adsorption sites are saturated with contaminate the qmax are 662 25 and 549 45 for ba and phenol respectively which indicates that the adsorption capacity of ba is higher than phenol the higher adsorption capacity of ba related of the interactions with adsorbent the π π interaction with the benzene rings existed in both of contaminate on the other hand another type of interaction seems to be considered as an increase in adsorption capacity in the ba structure the presence of carbonyl groups in addition to the benzene ring will enhance the ability to interact from the oxygen side in this group and create an interaction with the copper metal to the enhance of adsorption behvandi et al 2017 in langmuir isotherm the separation coefficient parameter which indicates the type of adsorption is defined as below 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 and kl are langmuir initial and constant concentrations respectively so if rl 1 is undesirable adsorption 0 rl 1 is optimal adsorption rl 0 is irreversible adsorption and rl 1 expresses linear adsorption langmuir separation coefficient phenol and ba are in the optimal adsorption range which indicates the correct choice of adsorbent in the process morever this has been reported in previous studies el yazeed and ahmed 2019 rostamnia et al 2016 3 4 6 the adsorption isotherm of temkin ba and phenol in the temkin isotherm assumed that there is an indirect relationship between the adsorbent molecule and the adsorbent and heat of adsorption is decreased after the adsorbent is covered by the adsorbate zango et al 2020 in fig 8c and d the variable qe is plotted in terms of log ce for ba and phenol the fit of experimental data of ba and phenol with correlation factor of 97 17 and 95 91 respectively indicates better adaptation of ba to phenol in this isotherm at high concentrations good agreement was observed with the experimental data while at low concentrations have more deviation therefore at the initial time with high concentration of contaminant using temkin isotherm has been is preferred in the temkin isotherm no direct interaction is made between the adsorbent and the adsorbent and the model will create a better fit for the high concentrations however at low concentrations it will not provide conditions for indirect interaction due to the unsaturation of the adsorbent surface as a result shown the deviation in this area will be more zango et al 2020 the results of fitting the experimental data on the temkin isotherm are given in table 3 among the isotherms investigated above the langmuir model is more accurate assuming single layer adsorption 3 5 comparison of ba and ph pollutant adsorption kinetics with other works table 4 compares the adsorption kinetics of this work with various other adsorbents in ba and ph pollutants as observed the equilibrium adsorption capacity of mof cu is higher and much higher than that of other conventional adsorbents adsorption quadratic kinetics with a correlation coefficient much higher than the first degree will be a more appropriate option in contrast the use of very low capacity adsorbents due to the low adsorption rate shows the first order kinetics of a better fit of the experimental data 4 conclusions mof as a porous material with unique properties such as high specific surface area and suitable adjustable structure with the needs of the adsorption process is a suitable option for being used in the adsorption process of aromatic in aqueous solution in this work the uptake of ba and phenol contaminants on mof cu was investigated in the among the adsorption isotherms investigated in these studies only langmuir isotherms was able to predict the adsorption behavior with a very good due the assuming single layer adsorption which is compatible with chemically adsorption mof cu with hydrogen bonding π π interaction with the benzene rings lead to much higher adsorption than some conventional adsorbents the results shown difference adsorption capacity between ba and phenol which is due to the ability of copper to interact with oxygen in the carbonyl group because oxygen with high electronegative properties could create a negative partial charge and copper s tendency to accept electrons and increase the interaction and better adsorption of ba contaminate the equilibrium adsorption capacity for ba and phenol contaminant is 323 35 and 279 3 mg g respectively which indicates the better performance of the adsorbent in the adsorption of ba and this can be attributed to better interaction of ba relative to phenol with mof cu adsorbent the adsorption kinetics of ba and phenol are very much in linear with the pseudo second order while this deviation is much higher pseudo first order due to the high adsorption capacity of the mof cu adsorbent and lead more deviation at the initial adsorption time the langmuir qmax equation constant is the saturation adsorption capacity meaning that all adsorption sites are saturated with contaminate the qmax are 662 25 and 549 45 for ba and phenol respectively which indicates that the adsorption capacity of ba is higher than phenol the higher adsorption capacity of ba related of the interactions with adsorbent the fit of experimental data of ba and phenol with correlation factor of 97 17 and 95 91 respectively indicates better adaptation of ba to phenol in this isotherm at high concentrations good agreement was observed with the experimental data while at low concentrations have more deviation declaration of competing interest there is no funding for this work 
1283,millions of tonnes of coarse tailings sand are produced every year as a byproduct of the bitumen extraction process in the athabasca oil sands region these tailings materials contain residual quantities of mobile solutes which can be transported through groundwater to downgradient terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems the anticipated ubiquity of coarse tailings sand on the post mined landscape necessitates the characterization of its hydraulic and transport properties hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity was evaluated at multiple scales and included the first field scale tracer test conducted in a tailings sand aquifer average hydraulic conductivity derived using laboratory cores single well response tests and the tracer test were 3 2 m d 1 2 9 m d 1 and 3 4 m d 1 respectively these measurements demonstrated close agreement and were consistent with expectations of a material that experiences some grain size segregation and homogenization due to the oil sands process and the nature of deposition the field scale tracer test appeared to obtain the asymptotic dispersivity of the coarse tailings sand aquifer reaching a maximum value of 0 5 m after 18 m of displacement coarse tailings in the oil sands that experience similar processes of segregation settling and deposition on the reclamation landscape could be expected to have similar hydraulic properties keywords reclamation soil hydraulic properties mine tailings oil sands tracer test 1 introduction coarse tailings sand is generated as a waste product from the extraction and processing of bitumen in the athabasca oil sands region aosr and has been used to construct reclamation systems on the post mined landscape however little research has been conducted to characterize the hydraulic properties of coarse tailings sand which will be vital to assess the transport of solutes within and from this material on an annual basis 8 63 1011 kg of bitumen ore is processed from surface mining in the aosr aer 2021 of which coarse sand comprises approximately 60 mikula 2012 forming the largest constituent of the oil sands waste stream majid et al 1996 furthermore the volume of tailings materials produced by the bitumen extraction process exceeds the original pre mined volume of oil sands by a factor of 1 4 mikula 2012 which is anticipated to contribute to a reclaimed landscape with greater topographic variability than the pre disturbance landscape rooney et al 2012 in addition to elevated salinity in the connate porewater due to the marine depositional environment purdy et al 2005 the processing of oil sands previously involved the addition of solutes to enhance separation and flocculation of the bitumen primarily sodium hydroxide masliyah et al 2004 and sodium citrate xiang et al 2019 while the majority of process water is recycled through centrifugation or gravitational settling a portion remains in the pore space of the tailings kasperski and mikula 2011 leaving residual quantities of salts and hydrocarbons in the pore water simhayov et al 2017 despite the presence of high salt concentrations coarse tailings sand has been used as a construction material in embankments slopes and reclaimed systems due to its favourable hydraulic and geotechnical properties and relative abundance on the mine landscape among these systems include two experimental watersheds sandhill fen watershed and nikanotee fen watershed designed and built to test the viability of fen peatland reclamation ketcheson et al 2016 the nikanotee fen watershed incorporates an upland tailings sand aquifer that supplies groundwater to the downgradient fen peatland recent studies demonstrate that residual sodium contained in the tailings sand which averages 400 mg l 1 but could be as high as 680 mg l 1 kessel et al 2018 has been transported by groundwater towards the fen peatland kessel et al 2018 elevating salt concentrations in the rooting zone of the fen this has the potential to negatively impact the establishment and growth of targeted vegetation species pouliot et al 2013 rezanezhad et al 2012 along with hydraulic conductivity one of the most important parameters used to characterize the transport of solutes through porous media is the dispersivity of the material which accounts for unresolved velocity variations smaller than the scale of observation sudicky 1986 while it has been shown that dispersivity tends to exhibit a scale dependency gelhar et al 1992 increasing with volume of aquifer material sampled it will theoretically reach a maximum value when the distribution of velocity variations is statistically stationary this apparent scale dependent relationship between dispersivity and the dimensions of the media through which groundwater flows is generally interpreted as a consequence of the introduction of new heterogeneities that are encountered within the flow field over larger displacement distances causing meaningful deviations to the distribution of porewater velocity dagan 1987 neuman et al 1987 contemporary analysis of dispersivity data supports the notion that asymptotic dispersivity is dependent on the geology of the aquifer zech et al 2015 and thus is controlled by the spatial arrangement and hydrophysical characteristics of the media given that these properties generally vary between natural formations the rate of growth in dispersivity with displacement and the asymptotic level it approaches are not transferrable between aquifers zech et al 2015 given the volume of coarse tailings material that will need to be included in reclamation design of the post mined landscape characterizing its hydraulic and transport properties is a priority several studies have investigated the hydrophysical properties of coarse tailings sand including estimating or measuring the van genuchten mualem parameters associated with soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ketcheson et al 2017 sutton and price 2020a weber et al 2019 however these studies were conducted in a laboratory setting as in the case of weber et al 2019 or based on small scale field measurements these scales have limited applicability when inferring the transport behaviour of solutes over distances relevant to landforms and watersheds thus contributing to uncertainty informing researchers and mine reclamation managers of the characteristics governing solute transport through coarse tailings materials will aid in the design of the reclamation landscape furthermore modelling the transport and fate of solutes issuing from process affected coarse tailings sand will require an understanding of the transport characteristics of the porous media therefore the goal of this study is to characterize the hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity of coarse tailings sand at the laboratory and field scales 2 study site the nikanotee fen watershed fig 1 a 32 ha research site was constructed on a post mined area of an oil sands lease approximately 25 km north of fort mcmurray alberta 56 55 59 n 111 25 00 w the watershed which became operational in early 2013 consists of a fen peatland 2 2 ha upland tailings sand aquifer 7 7 ha reclaimed hillslopes 18 7 ha and an undisturbed natural slope 2 8 ha the design of the system was informed by a conceptual understanding of undisturbed fen upland systems in the aosr and refined with hydrological modelling which identified the requisite material properties and layering to maintain a relatively stable and shallow water table in the peatland price et al 2010 consistently maintaining a water table close to the surface required the inclusion of an upland aquifer to act as both a water storage and conveyance feature which would supply the fen with groundwater thereby offsetting evaporative losses the aquifer was constructed with mechanically deposited coarse tailings sand obtained and transported from a tailings dyke coarse tailings sand was placed in approximately 0 5 m lifts by haul trucks and redistributed with bulldozers and underlain by a low permeability geosynthetic clay liner gcl that established a hydraulic gradient towards the fen and minimized percolation losses to the regional groundwater flow system particle size distribution measurements of the coarse tailings sand classified the majority of samples as sand 68 of samples with the remaining samples classified as loamy sand 32 of samples see ketcheson 2015 for details the median particle size averaged across 26 samples was 215 μm thus despite the name the material used to construct the aquifer largely consists of fine sand as a means of promoting predominantly upward vertical flow through the peat a thin layer 0 5 m of high hydraulic conductivity petroleum coke was placed under the fen and projected back into the upland approximately 100 m the tailings sand aquifer was capped with a 30 cm layer of lfh mineral mix a common reclamation cover soil to act as a substrate more amenable to vegetation growth several raised landforms termed hummocks were constructed across the upland upslope of these hummocks the lfh was excavated to expose the coarse tailings sand at the surface creating basins that detained surface overland flow and enhanced groundwater recharge basins adjacent to the east and south east slopes received the largest volumes of surface runoff and supplied a disproportionate volume of total groundwater recharge to the upland aquifer kessel et al 2021 as a consequence the highest hydraulic gradients in the watershed were consistently located downslope of the east recharge basin and southeast corner 3 methods the hydraulic properties of coarse tailings sand were examined at a range of spatial scales commonly used to evaluate transport behaviour this involved determining hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity using laboratory column experiments single well response tests and a field scale natural gradient tracer test 3 1 laboratory column experiments three columns of coarse tailings sand taken from the upland in 2015 were reconstituted and packed in 10 cm inner diameter by 35 cm tall pvc tubes specific core lengths were 0 32 0 34 0 37 m to approximately the same bulk density as the field tailings sand 1 55 g cm 3 although the tailings sand cores were not collected in situ the reconstitution and packing of the columns represented a similar level of disturbance as the original placement in the site aquifer the cores were packed in lifts of 1 2 cm and were saturated from the bottom up to reduce the potential for air entrapment lewis and sjöstrom 2010 and connected to a constant head apparatus to measure hydraulic conductivity k under a variety of hydraulic gradients these hydraulic gradients included a value similar in magnitude to what is typically observed in the field within the vicinity of the east recharge basin 0 05 and gradients that are closer to what would be established by a peristaltic pump 0 15 0 33 subsequently the columns were connected to a multichannel peristaltic pump which had a volumetric flow rate of approximately 0 064 ml s 1 the pumps were attached to a reservoir of deionized water and allowed to flush through the core for several days 10 pore volumes which also purged the experimental apparatus of entrapped gas the deionized water was then swapped for a reservoir of solute containing 1400 mg l 1 of bromide br tracer in the form of lithium bromide libr to characterize the solute breakthrough as it advanced

strength adjuster added 3 2 single well response tests between 2013 and 2019 hydraulic conductivity bail tests were conducted at groundwater monitoring nests installed across the fen and upland see fig 1 monitoring nests in the upland typically consisted of a fully slotted well and piezometers installed with a 0 2 m screened interval centred at 2 25 and 2 75 m below ground surface bgs typically only a single piezometer in each fen monitoring nest was screened in tailings sand at 2 75 m bgs wells and piezometers within the fen were constructed from 2 54 cm inner diameter id pvc conduit installed with a 2 54 cm diameter hand auger or 5 1 cm diameter power auger and wrapped with a nonwoven polypropylene filter screen nilex nonwoven 4545 to prevent infilling of sediments boreholes were backfilled using the drill cuttings to an approximate in situ density in the upland stainless steel drive point piezometers with 10 or 20 cm screen lengths solinst canada ltd were installed with a percussion rock hammer and lined with 1 27 cm id hdpe tube waterra canada no backfilling was necessary for drive point piezometers single well response tests were conducted annually in triplicate for most locations and a subset of the data tests conducted between 2017 and 2019 were analyzed using the dagan 1978 and bouwer and rice 1976 semi analytical solutions the majority of hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted manually however the response of monitoring locations with particularly fast recovery was measured using a pressure transducer some monitoring locations were excluded if they were adjacent to the lateral boundary of the geosynthetic clay liner if they were inferred to be screened across multiple aquifer materials or were inferred to have clogged screens from peat smearing during installation in total the hydraulic conductivity measured at 35 wells and 22 piezometers screened in tailings sand was included in the analysis 3 3 field scale tracer test a field scale tracer test was conducted to characterize the large scale hydraulic and transport properties of the tailings sand aquifer the upland area chosen for the tracer test was approximately 20 m downslope of the east recharge basin and selected because of the steep hydraulic gradients and access to relatively fresh water that collected in the basin five injection wells of 3 8 cm id were installed in a line perpendicular to the average groundwater flow direction with 1 m lateral spacing to a depth of approximately 3 8 m bgs this resulted in the injection wells being screened across the entire saturated thickness of the tailings sand aquifer fig 1 forty two fully slotted 0 64 cm id observation wells were installed downgradient of the injection wells and diverged with distance from the injection wells this spacing pattern was intended to account for the transverse horizontal spreading of the plume due to both mechanical dispersion and potential transient groundwater flow conditions caused by infiltrated surface water along the east slope during installation care had to be taken to avoid puncturing the gcl therefore the monitoring wells were installed to a conservative depth of approximately 3 5 m bgs boreholes were backfilled and compacted to approximately the same bulk density as the original material the experiment involved the injection of 1500 l of tracer at a br concentration of 1400 mg l 1 resulting in a total tracer mass of 2100 g tracer was stored in two 1 m3 containers each with a continuously operating bilge pump to prevent stratification of the tracer solution tracer in the two containers was thoroughly mixed in a manifold before being pumped into the 5 injection wells to reduce the potential for a groundwater mound to form around the injection wells thereby increasing the width of the plume perpendicular to the predominant groundwater flow direction tracer was injected slowly over the course of approximately 36 h the test commenced on the afternoon of july 22 2017 injection ceased early july 24 2017 and the tracer moved under ambient groundwater flow conditions for 1 week before the first sampling event on july 31 2017 day 7 subsequently water sampling was conducted on august 7 day 14 august 14 day 21 august 20 day 27 september 15 day 53 and september 21 day 59 prior to water sampling monitoring wells were completely purged which removed between 150 and 200 ml of water allowed to recover and then samples were collected in 60 ml hdpe bottles water samples were typically analyzed within several days of collection using a br ion selective electrode following the same methodology as the column experiments 3 4 spatial moment calculations spatial moments aris 1956 of the spatially interpolated concentration distribution were used to analyze and characterize the transport of the br tracer as it flowed under natural gradient conditions through the tailings sand aquifer since the tracer was injected over the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer the moment analysis was only conducted with respect to the x and y spatial coordinates the ijth moment mij t of the two dimensional concentration distribution is defined as 3 m ij t n e c x y t x i y j dx dy where c x y t is the vertically integrated spatiotemporal concentration distribution the zeroth mij m00 first mij m11 and second mij m22 moments were used to calculate the tracer mass in solution geographical location of the tracer centre of mass and spread of the tracer about the centre of mass respectively the zeroth moment mass in solution is calculated as 4 m 00 t n e a b c where a is 25 cm2 the area of the cell size of the interpolated concentration distribution and b is the aquifer thickness the installation of fully penetrating injection wells provides a justification for the assumption of vertically uniform tracer concentrations across the entire aquifer thickness however based on this assumption variations in the saturated thickness of the aquifer within the tracer plume and over the duration of the experiment needed to be accounted for in the estimation of the tracer mass therefore the saturated thickness of the aquifer was calculated independently for each sampling event the location of the plume centre of mass perpendicular x c and parallel y c to the velocity vector of the plume centre of mass is calculated as follows 5 x c m 10 m 00 y c m 01 m 00 the spatial concentration distribution of each sampling event for which moments were calculated was transformed to local spatial coordinates and rotated to align the longitudinal axis of the spatial covariance tensor σyy with the velocity vector of the plume centre of mass the rotation aligned the y axis parallel to flow direction the magnitude of the velocity vector v is calculated as the change in displacement of the plume centre of mass relative to time 6 v d x c 2 d y c 2 0 5 dt plume centre of mass velocity was used to derive a large scale estimate of tailings sand hydraulic conductivity by calculating specific discharge with a tailings sand effective porosity of 0 41 sutton and price 2020a and determining the spatially averaged hydraulic gradient within the bounds of the plume for each sampling event the angle θ of the velocity vector relative to geographic north is calculated as 7 θ tan 1 dx c dy c the second moment m22 characterizing the spread of the solute about the centre of mass can be used to calculate the two dimensional covariance parallel and perpendicular to the movement of the centre of mass 8 σ xx m 20 m 00 x c 2 σ yy m 02 m 00 y c 2 where σxx is the covariance perpendicular to the velocity vector and σyy is the covariance parallel to the velocity vector assuming a negligible molecular diffusion coefficient the estimates of covariance can be used to approximate the transverse αt and longitudinal dispersivities αl using güven et al 1984 9 α t 1 2 v d dt σ xx α l 1 2 v d dt σ yy 4 results 4 1 laboratory column experiments hydraulic conductivities of the packed tailings sand columns ranged within an order of magnitude k 4 3 m d 1 with minor variation under different hydraulic gradients the average hydraulic conductivity across the three gradients was 6 1 4 1 and 2 7 m d 1 for core 1 2 and 3 respectively once adjusted from laboratory 20 c to field temperatures 8 c to account for temperature dependence of fluid viscosity and density these hydraulic conductivity measurements become 4 5 3 0 and 2 0 m d 1 k 3 2 m d 1 during saturation of the cores approximately 2 cm of consolidation occurred resulting in bulk densities between 1 57 and 1 60 g cm 3 within the range previously measured ketcheson 2015 the peristaltic pumps maintained a constant outflow of approximately 0 06 ml s 1 in each core throughout the duration of the breakthrough experiment calibration of eq 1 resulted in n e values of 0 42 0 37 and 0 43 for core 1 2 and 3 respectively these values compare favourably with the previously measured average total porosity for the aquifer coarse tailings sand of 0 45 ketcheson 2015 core 2 and 3 demonstrated similar hydrodynamic dispersion fig 2 with an abrupt increase in outflow concentration after 0 8 pore volumes in contrast core 1 exhibited a more gentle and steady increase in outflow concentration after 0 6 pore volumes this difference in transport behaviour is reflected in the calibrated αl values which were 1 3 10 2 1 5 10 3 and 1 1 10 3 m for cores 1 2 and 3 respectively 4 2 single well response tests in situ hydraulic conductivity measured in the field with bail tests varied between 0 58 and 29 m d 1 the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity was 2 9 m d 1 ln k 1 1 with a ln k variance of 0 9 although the histogram of ln k vaguely resembles a right skewed gaussian distribution fig 3 the log transformed data did not satisfy the shapiro wilk normality test the hypothesis that the data conform to a normal distribution was rejected large samples of log transformed hydraulic conductivity data from weak or mildly heterogeneous aquifers are typically assumed to conform to a normal distribution rehfeldt et al 1992 it is conceivable that the right skew in the ln k distribution is a consequence of certain piezometer screens partially intersecting a layer of petroleum coke a construction material with substantially higher hydraulic conductivity ketcheson et al 2017 since the highest hydraulic conductivity measurements were generally associated with monitoring locations under the petroleum coke efforts were made to exclude such locations from the analysis by comparing the screened interval with detailed stratigraphic information collected during site construction however if all sixteen of these potentially impacted locations are removed from the analysis the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity becomes 2 6 m d 1 ln k 0 9 with a ln k variance of 0 4 it should be noted that hydraulic conductivity tests could not be performed on the observation wells installed for the purpose of monitoring the tracer experiment as their quick recovery prevented manual measurement techniques and the narrow internal diameter precluded the deployment of pressure transducers to record recovery 4 3 field scale tracer test the water table in the vicinity of the tracer test was influenced by its proximity to the east recharge basin which periodically filled with surface runoff during which a transient groundwater mound would develop beneath the basin see kessel et al 2021 for details prior to the experiment commencing a series of runoff events resulted in a local water table rise over the course of the experiment the groundwater mound moved downgradient and slowly dissipated resulting in the average water table declining by approximately 30 cm 8 mm d 1 this was accompanied by a slight decrease in the slope of the water table the horizontal hydraulic gradient steadily decreased from 0 044 on day 21 to 0 034 on day 59 during the experimental period 2 3 cm of rainfall was measured however based on soil moisture modelling sutton and price 2020b this corresponded to 1 mm of groundwater recharge six rounds of water sampling were conducted at the observation wells however only the latter four sampling events t 21 27 53 59 d allowed for full delineation of the tracer plume the small internal volume of the monitoring wells meant that purging and sampling removed 0 1 of the tracer mass the dimensions of the plume on day 21 were 8 m 5 m and by day 59 had increased to 20 m 9 m fig 4 by the end of the experiment the plume encompassed approximately 270 m3 of aquifer material water level monitoring demonstrated that negligible groundwater mounding developed around the injection wells the narrow plume dimensions on day 21 provided further confirmation of this background br concentrations at the observation wells prior to the experiment commencing were all non detect 0 7 mg l 1 average br concentrations for the day 21 27 53 and 59 sampling events were 165 108 43 and 21 mg l 1 respectively the plume did not exhibit any clear evidence of preferential flow pathways 4 4 analysis of spatial moments the results of the spatial moment analysis are summarized in table 1 the zeroth spatial moment which provides an estimate of the total tracer mass in solution is shown in fig 5a bromide is considered a conservative or non reactive tracer and therefore deviations in estimated mass from the injected mass reflect inadequacies in the monitoring network and uncertainty associated with the analytical method the mass in solution was generally approximated adequately by the zeroth moment and varied between 74 and 110 of the known injected mass 2100 g the largest discrepancy in estimated mass on day 59 is likely a reflection of the plume moving to an area of lower sampling network density the first spatial moment which estimates the spatial coordinates of the plume centre of mass is shown in fig 5b the plume centre of mass moved at an average rate of 0 31 m d 1 although varied between 0 26 m d 1 and 0 42 m d 1 and travelled at a bearing of approximately n20 w fig 4 this deviated slightly from the average slope aspect of the water table within the boundaries of the plume n25 w at the conclusion of the experiment the plume centre of mass had a maximum displacement of 18 2 m from the central injection well the average hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer that the plume intersected was 3 4 m d 1 but when calculated for each individual sampling event estimated k varied between 2 9 and 3 7 m d 1 the second spatial moment or spatial covariance tensor characterizes the concentration distribution about the centre of mass in directions parallel and perpendicular to the velocity vector fig 5c the longitudinal and transverse horizontal spatial covariance tensors grew approximately linearly with displacement distance from the injection wells these spatial covariance tensors corresponded to longitudinal dispersivities that remained approximately constant and varied between 0 37 m and 0 49 m and transverse horizontal dispersivities that increased with displacement distance from 0 02 m to 0 10 m 5 discussion considerable attention within solute transport literature has been given to the issue of asymptotic conditions in field tracer experiments zech et al 2015 asymptotic dispersivity can be defined in practical terms as the dispersivity associated with sufficient travel through a porous media such that the probability distribution of pore water velocity changes negligibly with further downgradient displacement the transport can then be reasonably approximated as a fickian process whereby the assumption that the dispersive flux is proportional to the concentration gradient is adequately satisfied and therefore fulfills a requirement of eq 9 once the asymptotic dispersivity has been reached dispersivity will not continue to grow unless a systematic deviation in geology is encountered evidence suggests that the plume needs to transit multiple dozens of correlation scale lengths of the aquifer to reach this state dagan 1987 a correlation scale length is a property of the covariance structure of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity field put simply it can be thought of as summarizing the decay in predictive power of a hydraulic conductivity measurement for estimating the hydraulic conductivity at successively larger separation distances at what separation do two k measurements become uncorrelated the approximately linear relationship between the longitudinal spatial covariance σyy and displacement of the plume centre of mass fig 5c suggests but does not definitively confirm that the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity was obtained during the field tracer experiment this is consistent with expectations regarding the transport characteristics of the coarse tailings sand aquifer specifically the segregation of particle sizes due to the industrial process from which tailings sand issues and the mechanical placement of the sand during construction using haul trucks wiggle wagons and bulldozers this was anticipated to result in an aquifer with a small variance in hydraulic conductivity and a correlation structure of the hydraulic conductivity field with notably small spatial autocorrelation lengths that lacked the stratigraphic features associated with natural deposition e g lamination and stratification furthermore the short distance associated with the development of the plume to this apparent asymptotic state 9 m is a similar indication of the minimally heterogeneous nature of the aquifer however this study was not complemented by a thorough characterization of aquifer permeability that would allow for the identification of the correlation scale of tailings sand k therefore evidence to support the adequacy of presumptions on statistical stationarity and small correlation scale of the hydraulic conductivity field is largely speculative however by fitting the equation of dagan 1984 to the estimated longitudinal spatial covariance tensor σyy derived from the tracer test an approximation of the correlation scale can be identified this equation takes the form 10 σ yy t σ ln k 2 l ln k 2 2 t t 3 2 3 ei t t ln t t γ 3 e t t 1 t t 1 t t 2 where σln k 2 is the variance of the natural logarithm ln of hydraulic conductivity lln k is the correlation length of the ln k covariance function t is a characteristic time equal to lln k v ei is the exponential integral and γ is the euler mascheroni constant this equation was used in a similar manner by freyberg 1986 and sudicky 1986 however these studies had estimates of lln k to contextualize the results which this present study lacks assuming a velocity of 0 31 m d 1 and ln k variance of 0 91 the calibrated value of lln k that minimized the error between estimated and observed σyy was 0 36 m fig 6 thus providing some evidence to suggest that the correlation length of tailings sand hydraulic conductivity is quite small in comparison to a natural sand aquifer that exhibited minimal heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field σln k 2 0 24 the correlation scale length llnk identified using eq 9 was 2 7 m freyberg 1986 sudicky 1986 assuming the correlation length of 0 36 m is indeed representative of the length in the vicinity of the tracer test the plume centre of mass will have transited over 50 correlation scale lengths at its maximum displacement of 18 2 m while it may be coincidental this estimated correlation length lies between the short tailings sand columns 0 32 and 0 34 m which had dispersivities on the order of 1 10 3 m and the longer column 0 37 m which had a markedly larger dispersivity on the order of 1 10 2 m fig 2 2 however determining if this reflects a meaningful threshold would require additional replicates of tailings columns in conjunction with a detailed characterization of aquifer hydraulic conductivity autocorrelation 5 1 contextualizing this study gelhar et al 1992 performed a comprehensive review of field tracer tests which involved the classification of dispersivities into a hierarchy of reliability in brief their criteria for high reliability experiments included 1 test conducted under natural gradient ambient groundwater flow conditions 2 tracer input concentration mass and temporal distribution should be known 3 the tracer should be conservative non reactive 4 monitoring of test should occur in three dimensions or two dimensions if the tracer was injected across the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer and 5 concentration data were analyzed using the method of spatial moments gelhar et al 1992 based on these criteria this tracer test conducted in the coarse tailings aquifer would be classified as high reliability more recently the work of gelhar et al 1992 was refined and updated by zech et al 2015 this tracer test remains consistent with their definition of a high reliability experiment comparing the field estimated asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity 0 49 m and associated scale 18 2 m with a selection of tracer tests from zech et al 2015 shows the relatively short displacement distance and moderate longitudinal dispersivity of this experiment fig 7 the dispersivities obtained from the nikanotee tailings sand fall among other weak or mildly heterogeneous aquifers including borden cape cod and chalk river zech et al 2015 the ratio of transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity of 1 5 is larger than the 1 10 ratio frequently assumed when not directly measured however as discussed in zech et al 2019 this is a convention without empirical or theoretical justification however given the transient water table conditions that occurred throughout the experiment it seems reasonable to conclude that the relatively large apparent transverse dispersivity is at least partly due to unresolved groundwater flow variations that occurred temporally between sampling periods and spatially within the lateral extent of the plume this phenomenon was illustrated theoretically by goode and konikow 1990 whereby deviations from the assumed dominant groundwater flow direction resulted in erroneous attribution of longitudinal dispersion to apparent transverse dispersivity field corroboration of this principle was provided at a contaminant plume that exhibited notably small transverse dispersivity which was ascribed to atypically steady groundwater velocity and flow direction van der kamp et al 1994 the dearth of studies that characterize the transport properties of anthropogenically deposited materials presents a challenge for evaluating the representativeness of the dispersivity and correlation length estimates uncertainty in these estimates is compounded by the relatively infrequent sampling and short displacement distance of the plume nonetheless the relationship between dispersivity and displacement is consistent with empirical and anecdotal evidence regarding the nature of the material and the aquifer this includes the congruence with experiments conducted in other mildly heterogeneous albeit naturally deposited aquifers fig 7 the homogeneity of the particle size distribution ketcheson 2015 consistency of k at multiple scales and field observations of tailings uniformity in contrast the estimated correlation length is largely conjecture but does conform to our expectations about aquifer permeability the excavation transportation and placement of tailings sand during aquifer construction inevitably involves a disturbance to the initial permeability correlation structure that arises from hydraulic deposition of a tailings waste slurry in a dyke while the degree to which this original correlation structure is altered is not known it seems reasonable to propose that the disturbance would generally act to decrease lln k of the anthropogenically deposited aquifer explicitly investigating this matter would be a valuable contribution to both reclamation and solute transport literature 5 2 implications for landscape scale reclamation planning the hydraulic conductivity of coarse tailings sand identified by the laboratory column experiments 3 2 m d 1 single well response tests 2 9 m d 1 and field tracer test 3 4 m d 1 is close to the targeted hydraulic conductivity 8 6 m d 1 specified in the original conceptual aquifer design conducted by price et al 2010 a high aquifer conductivity was recognized as a necessary design feature to ensure a sufficient supply of groundwater to the fen while it is advantageous that coarse tailings sand appears to have the appropriate hydraulic conductivity to perform the function of a water conveyance feature in the reclamation landscape the presence of residual solutes requires characterization of transport properties to predict the timing and extent of solute redistribution to that end dispersive mixing will ameliorate the considerable initial geochemical heterogeneity kessel et al 2018 with further downgradient transport resulting in a more spatially and temporally uniform input of salinity from a tailings sand aquifer to a wetland or other downgradient receptor however the hydrophysical properties of an aquifer are not the sole determinants governing the patterns of solute movement and mass export to downgradient ecosystems of particular relevance to mine tailings is the depositional history and flushing that has occurred prior to and following deposition huang et al 2021 the depositional history will largely be regulated by the needs of mine operators however in contrast the degree of flushing could be influenced by the design of the reclamation landscape by enhancing recharge kessel et al 2021 altering cover soil thickness sutton and price 2020a or delaying vegetation growth sutton and price 2020b whether the industrial processes that generate and segregate coarse tailings sand and mechanically deposit the material for use in reclamation will result in aquifers with common transport properties is a matter that will require further investigation while tailings sand in the aosr has generally been shown to be a minimally heterogeneous material in a large multi scale evaluation of hydraulic conductivity conducted in the context of landscape reclamation mckenna 2002 there was spatial variability that manifest at a variety of scales however in spite of any differences in the physical characteristics of the parent material the macroscopic structure field scale heterogeneities of the hydraulic conductivity field will have a larger impact on field scale dispersivity macrodispersivity dagan 1987 at a reclamation site this structure or lack thereof is expected to be predominantly influenced by the manner of its deposition specifically mechanically placed using heavy earth moving equipment based on this assumption it would be reasonable to anticipate other coarse tailings sand aquifers in the aosr have asymptotic dispersivities of similar magnitude to this study incorporating a material with consistent hydraulic properties into reclamation design on the mine closure landscape has clear advantages allowing practitioners to reliably predict hydrologic behaviour 6 conclusion hydraulic conductivity of coarse tailings sand was estimated and measured using a variety of techniques and across a range of spatial scales from 2 9 10 3 m3 to 2 7 102 m3 of aquifer material sampled this evaluation demonstrated close agreement between laboratory 3 2 m d 1 in situ field 2 9 m d 1 and tracer test derived 3 4 m d 1 values of average k yet despite the grain size segregation that occurred as part of the tailings waste stream and the assumed homogenization that occurred due to mechanical placement the coarse tailings sand exhibited a non trivial spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity σln k 2 0 91 demonstrating once again the notoriously heterogeneous nature of field soils dispersivity values estimated from breakthrough in the tailings sand cores reflective of pore scale mechanical dispersion were expectedly small the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity derived from the tracer test reached a maximum of 0 49 m and 0 10 m respectively after 59 days of transport and 18 2 m of displacement the approximately linear growth of the longitudinal spatial covariance tensor indicated that the asymptotic value of dispersivity may have been obtained by conducting further hydraulic conductivity measurements to obtain estimates of spatial autocorrelation this claim could be more rigorously evaluated given the anticipated expansion of coarse tailings sand landscapes in the post mined aosr the detailed characterization of hydraulic and transport properties is warranted this study will contribute to a small but growing and increasingly necessary body of literature on the transport of solutes through formerly mined and reclaimed materials in forthcoming work the tailings sand dispersivity and large scale effective hydraulic conductivity identified in this study will be used to parameterize a fate and transport model of solutes from the upland to peatland at the nikanotee fen watershed characterizing tailings sand hydraulic conductivity with a high degree of confidence will help to reduce the compensatory behaviour between hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge that could lead to non uniqueness in the model

1283,millions of tonnes of coarse tailings sand are produced every year as a byproduct of the bitumen extraction process in the athabasca oil sands region these tailings materials contain residual quantities of mobile solutes which can be transported through groundwater to downgradient terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems the anticipated ubiquity of coarse tailings sand on the post mined landscape necessitates the characterization of its hydraulic and transport properties hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity was evaluated at multiple scales and included the first field scale tracer test conducted in a tailings sand aquifer average hydraulic conductivity derived using laboratory cores single well response tests and the tracer test were 3 2 m d 1 2 9 m d 1 and 3 4 m d 1 respectively these measurements demonstrated close agreement and were consistent with expectations of a material that experiences some grain size segregation and homogenization due to the oil sands process and the nature of deposition the field scale tracer test appeared to obtain the asymptotic dispersivity of the coarse tailings sand aquifer reaching a maximum value of 0 5 m after 18 m of displacement coarse tailings in the oil sands that experience similar processes of segregation settling and deposition on the reclamation landscape could be expected to have similar hydraulic properties keywords reclamation soil hydraulic properties mine tailings oil sands tracer test 1 introduction coarse tailings sand is generated as a waste product from the extraction and processing of bitumen in the athabasca oil sands region aosr and has been used to construct reclamation systems on the post mined landscape however little research has been conducted to characterize the hydraulic properties of coarse tailings sand which will be vital to assess the transport of solutes within and from this material on an annual basis 8 63 1011 kg of bitumen ore is processed from surface mining in the aosr aer 2021 of which coarse sand comprises approximately 60 mikula 2012 forming the largest constituent of the oil sands waste stream majid et al 1996 furthermore the volume of tailings materials produced by the bitumen extraction process exceeds the original pre mined volume of oil sands by a factor of 1 4 mikula 2012 which is anticipated to contribute to a reclaimed landscape with greater topographic variability than the pre disturbance landscape rooney et al 2012 in addition to elevated salinity in the connate porewater due to the marine depositional environment purdy et al 2005 the processing of oil sands previously involved the addition of solutes to enhance separation and flocculation of the bitumen primarily sodium hydroxide masliyah et al 2004 and sodium citrate xiang et al 2019 while the majority of process water is recycled through centrifugation or gravitational settling a portion remains in the pore space of the tailings kasperski and mikula 2011 leaving residual quantities of salts and hydrocarbons in the pore water simhayov et al 2017 despite the presence of high salt concentrations coarse tailings sand has been used as a construction material in embankments slopes and reclaimed systems due to its favourable hydraulic and geotechnical properties and relative abundance on the mine landscape among these systems include two experimental watersheds sandhill fen watershed and nikanotee fen watershed designed and built to test the viability of fen peatland reclamation ketcheson et al 2016 the nikanotee fen watershed incorporates an upland tailings sand aquifer that supplies groundwater to the downgradient fen peatland recent studies demonstrate that residual sodium contained in the tailings sand which averages 400 mg l 1 but could be as high as 680 mg l 1 kessel et al 2018 has been transported by groundwater towards the fen peatland kessel et al 2018 elevating salt concentrations in the rooting zone of the fen this has the potential to negatively impact the establishment and growth of targeted vegetation species pouliot et al 2013 rezanezhad et al 2012 along with hydraulic conductivity one of the most important parameters used to characterize the transport of solutes through porous media is the dispersivity of the material which accounts for unresolved velocity variations smaller than the scale of observation sudicky 1986 while it has been shown that dispersivity tends to exhibit a scale dependency gelhar et al 1992 increasing with volume of aquifer material sampled it will theoretically reach a maximum value when the distribution of velocity variations is statistically stationary this apparent scale dependent relationship between dispersivity and the dimensions of the media through which groundwater flows is generally interpreted as a consequence of the introduction of new heterogeneities that are encountered within the flow field over larger displacement distances causing meaningful deviations to the distribution of porewater velocity dagan 1987 neuman et al 1987 contemporary analysis of dispersivity data supports the notion that asymptotic dispersivity is dependent on the geology of the aquifer zech et al 2015 and thus is controlled by the spatial arrangement and hydrophysical characteristics of the media given that these properties generally vary between natural formations the rate of growth in dispersivity with displacement and the asymptotic level it approaches are not transferrable between aquifers zech et al 2015 given the volume of coarse tailings material that will need to be included in reclamation design of the post mined landscape characterizing its hydraulic and transport properties is a priority several studies have investigated the hydrophysical properties of coarse tailings sand including estimating or measuring the van genuchten mualem parameters associated with soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ketcheson et al 2017 sutton and price 2020a weber et al 2019 however these studies were conducted in a laboratory setting as in the case of weber et al 2019 or based on small scale field measurements these scales have limited applicability when inferring the transport behaviour of solutes over distances relevant to landforms and watersheds thus contributing to uncertainty informing researchers and mine reclamation managers of the characteristics governing solute transport through coarse tailings materials will aid in the design of the reclamation landscape furthermore modelling the transport and fate of solutes issuing from process affected coarse tailings sand will require an understanding of the transport characteristics of the porous media therefore the goal of this study is to characterize the hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity of coarse tailings sand at the laboratory and field scales 2 study site the nikanotee fen watershed fig 1 a 32 ha research site was constructed on a post mined area of an oil sands lease approximately 25 km north of fort mcmurray alberta 56 55 59 n 111 25 00 w the watershed which became operational in early 2013 consists of a fen peatland 2 2 ha upland tailings sand aquifer 7 7 ha reclaimed hillslopes 18 7 ha and an undisturbed natural slope 2 8 ha the design of the system was informed by a conceptual understanding of undisturbed fen upland systems in the aosr and refined with hydrological modelling which identified the requisite material properties and layering to maintain a relatively stable and shallow water table in the peatland price et al 2010 consistently maintaining a water table close to the surface required the inclusion of an upland aquifer to act as both a water storage and conveyance feature which would supply the fen with groundwater thereby offsetting evaporative losses the aquifer was constructed with mechanically deposited coarse tailings sand obtained and transported from a tailings dyke coarse tailings sand was placed in approximately 0 5 m lifts by haul trucks and redistributed with bulldozers and underlain by a low permeability geosynthetic clay liner gcl that established a hydraulic gradient towards the fen and minimized percolation losses to the regional groundwater flow system particle size distribution measurements of the coarse tailings sand classified the majority of samples as sand 68 of samples with the remaining samples classified as loamy sand 32 of samples see ketcheson 2015 for details the median particle size averaged across 26 samples was 215 μm thus despite the name the material used to construct the aquifer largely consists of fine sand as a means of promoting predominantly upward vertical flow through the peat a thin layer 0 5 m of high hydraulic conductivity petroleum coke was placed under the fen and projected back into the upland approximately 100 m the tailings sand aquifer was capped with a 30 cm layer of lfh mineral mix a common reclamation cover soil to act as a substrate more amenable to vegetation growth several raised landforms termed hummocks were constructed across the upland upslope of these hummocks the lfh was excavated to expose the coarse tailings sand at the surface creating basins that detained surface overland flow and enhanced groundwater recharge basins adjacent to the east and south east slopes received the largest volumes of surface runoff and supplied a disproportionate volume of total groundwater recharge to the upland aquifer kessel et al 2021 as a consequence the highest hydraulic gradients in the watershed were consistently located downslope of the east recharge basin and southeast corner 3 methods the hydraulic properties of coarse tailings sand were examined at a range of spatial scales commonly used to evaluate transport behaviour this involved determining hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity using laboratory column experiments single well response tests and a field scale natural gradient tracer test 3 1 laboratory column experiments three columns of coarse tailings sand taken from the upland in 2015 were reconstituted and packed in 10 cm inner diameter by 35 cm tall pvc tubes specific core lengths were 0 32 0 34 0 37 m to approximately the same bulk density as the field tailings sand 1 55 g cm 3 although the tailings sand cores were not collected in situ the reconstitution and packing of the columns represented a similar level of disturbance as the original placement in the site aquifer the cores were packed in lifts of 1 2 cm and were saturated from the bottom up to reduce the potential for air entrapment lewis and sjöstrom 2010 and connected to a constant head apparatus to measure hydraulic conductivity k under a variety of hydraulic gradients these hydraulic gradients included a value similar in magnitude to what is typically observed in the field within the vicinity of the east recharge basin 0 05 and gradients that are closer to what would be established by a peristaltic pump 0 15 0 33 subsequently the columns were connected to a multichannel peristaltic pump which had a volumetric flow rate of approximately 0 064 ml s 1 the pumps were attached to a reservoir of deionized water and allowed to flush through the core for several days 10 pore volumes which also purged the experimental apparatus of entrapped gas the deionized water was then swapped for a reservoir of solute containing 1400 mg l 1 of bromide br tracer in the form of lithium bromide libr to characterize the solute breakthrough as it advanced through the column volumetric discharge q from each core was measured throughout the experiment and water samples were taken at regular time intervals the analytical expression of ogata and banks 1961

of ogata and banks 1961 the spread of normalized concentration c c 0 about the median is characterized by the longitudinal dispersivity while the arrival of the median normalized concentration is controlled by the average linear pore water velocity all components of velocity were measured except effective porosity thus the parameters n e and αl were fit during the calibration procedure water samples were analyzed for br concentration using an ion selective electrode thermo scientific 9635bnwp bromide combination probe analysis followed recommended manufacturer procedure which involved 5 point calibration from calibration standards that bounded the expected concentration range 1 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 1000 mg l 1 7990 mg l 1 all samples and standards had a 2 solution of ionic strength adjuster added 3 2 single well response tests between 2013 and 2019 hydraulic conductivity bail tests were conducted at groundwater monitoring nests installed across the fen and upland see fig 1 monitoring nests in the upland typically consisted of a fully slotted well and piezometers installed with a 0 2 m screened interval centred at 2 25 and 2 75 m below ground surface bgs typically only a single piezometer in each fen monitoring nest was screened in tailings sand at 2 75 m bgs wells and piezometers within the fen were constructed from 2 54 cm inner diameter id pvc conduit installed with a 2 54 cm diameter hand auger or 5 1 cm diameter power auger and wrapped with a nonwoven polypropylene filter screen nilex nonwoven 4545 to prevent infilling of sediments boreholes were backfilled using the drill cuttings to an approximate in situ density in the upland stainless steel drive point piezometers with 10 or 20 cm screen lengths solinst canada ltd were installed with a percussion rock hammer and lined with 1 27 cm id hdpe tube waterra canada no backfilling was necessary for drive point piezometers single well response tests were conducted annually in triplicate for most locations and a subset of the data tests conducted between 2017 and 2019 were analyzed using the dagan 1978 and bouwer and rice 1976 semi analytical solutions the majority of hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted manually however the response of monitoring locations with particularly fast recovery was measured using a pressure transducer some monitoring locations were excluded if they were adjacent to the lateral boundary of the geosynthetic clay liner if they were inferred to be screened across multiple aquifer materials or were inferred to have clogged screens from peat smearing during installation in total the hydraulic conductivity measured at 35 wells and 22 piezometers screened in tailings sand was included in the analysis 3 3 field scale tracer test a field scale tracer test was conducted to characterize the large scale hydraulic and transport properties of the tailings sand aquifer the upland area chosen for the tracer test was approximately 20 m downslope of the east recharge basin and selected because of the steep hydraulic gradients and access to relatively fresh water that collected in the basin five injection wells of 3 8 cm id were installed in a line perpendicular to the average groundwater flow direction with 1 m lateral spacing to a depth of approximately 3 8 m bgs this resulted in the injection wells being screened across the entire saturated thickness of the tailings sand aquifer fig 1 forty two fully slotted 0 64 cm id observation wells were installed downgradient of the injection wells and diverged with distance from the injection wells this spacing pattern was intended to account for the transverse horizontal spreading of the plume due to both mechanical dispersion and potential transient groundwater flow conditions caused by infiltrated surface water along the east slope during installation care had to be taken to avoid puncturing the gcl therefore the monitoring wells were installed to a conservative depth of approximately 3 5 m bgs boreholes were backfilled and compacted to approximately the same bulk density as the original material the experiment involved the injection of 1500 l of tracer at a br concentration of 1400 mg l 1 resulting in a total tracer mass of 2100 g tracer was stored in two 1 m3 containers each with a continuously operating bilge pump to prevent stratification of the tracer solution tracer in the two containers was thoroughly mixed in a manifold before being pumped into the 5 injection wells to reduce the potential for a groundwater mound to form around the injection wells thereby increasing the width of the plume perpendicular to the predominant groundwater flow direction tracer was injected slowly over the course of approximately 36 h the test commenced on the afternoon of july 22 2017 injection ceased early july 24 2017 and the tracer moved under ambient groundwater flow conditions for 1 week before the first sampling event on july 31 2017 day 7 subsequently water sampling was conducted on august 7 day 14 august 14 day 21 august 20 day 27 september 15 day 53 and september 21 day 59 prior to water sampling monitoring wells were completely purged which removed between 150 and 200 ml of water allowed to recover and then samples were collected in 60 ml hdpe bottles water samples were typically analyzed within several days of collection using a br ion selective electrode following the same methodology as the column experiments 3 4 spatial moment calculations spatial moments aris 1956 of the spatially interpolated concentration distribution were used to analyze and characterize the transport of the br tracer as it flowed under natural gradient conditions through the tailings sand aquifer since the tracer was injected over the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer the moment analysis was only conducted with respect to the x and y spatial coordinates the ijth moment mij t of the two dimensional concentration distribution is defined as 3 m ij t n e c x y t x i y j dx dy where c x y t is the vertically integrated spatiotemporal concentration distribution the zeroth mij m00 first mij m11 and second mij m22 moments were used to calculate the tracer mass in solution geographical location of the tracer centre of mass and spread of the tracer about the centre of mass respectively the zeroth moment mass in solution is calculated as 4 m 00 t n e a b c where a is 25 cm2 the area of the cell size of the interpolated concentration distribution and b is the aquifer thickness the installation of fully penetrating injection wells provides a justification for the assumption of vertically uniform tracer concentrations across the entire aquifer thickness however based on this assumption variations in the saturated thickness of the aquifer within the tracer plume and over the duration of the experiment needed to be accounted for in the estimation of the tracer mass therefore the saturated thickness of the aquifer was calculated independently for each sampling event the location of the plume centre of mass perpendicular x c and parallel y c to the velocity vector of the plume centre of mass is calculated as follows 5 x c m 10 m 00 y c m 01 m 00 the spatial concentration distribution of each sampling event for which moments were calculated was transformed to local spatial coordinates and rotated to align the longitudinal axis of the spatial covariance tensor σyy with the velocity vector of the plume centre of mass the rotation aligned the y axis parallel to flow direction the magnitude of the velocity vector v is calculated as the change in displacement of the plume centre of mass relative to time 6 v d x c 2 d y c 2 0 5 dt plume centre of mass velocity was used to derive a large scale estimate of tailings sand hydraulic conductivity by calculating specific discharge with a tailings sand effective porosity of 0 41 sutton and price 2020a and determining the spatially averaged hydraulic gradient within the bounds of the plume for each sampling event the angle θ of the velocity vector relative to geographic north is calculated as 7 θ tan 1 dx c dy c the second moment m22 characterizing the spread of the solute about the centre of mass can be used to calculate the two dimensional covariance parallel and perpendicular to the movement of the centre of mass 8 σ xx m 20 m 00 x c 2 σ yy m 02 m 00 y c 2 where σxx is the covariance perpendicular to the velocity vector and σyy is the covariance parallel to the velocity vector assuming a negligible molecular diffusion coefficient the estimates of covariance can be used to approximate the transverse αt and longitudinal dispersivities αl using güven et al 1984 9 α t 1 2 v d dt σ xx α l 1 2 v d dt σ yy 4 results 4 1 laboratory column experiments hydraulic conductivities of the packed tailings sand columns ranged within an order of magnitude k 4 3 m d 1 with minor variation under different hydraulic gradients the average hydraulic conductivity across the three gradients was 6 1 4 1 and 2 7 m d 1 for core 1 2 and 3 respectively once adjusted from laboratory 20 c to field temperatures 8 c to account for temperature dependence of fluid viscosity and density these hydraulic conductivity measurements become 4 5 3 0 and 2 0 m d 1 k 3 2 m d 1 during saturation of the cores approximately 2 cm of consolidation occurred resulting in bulk densities between 1 57 and 1 60 g cm 3 within the range previously measured ketcheson 2015 the peristaltic pumps maintained a constant outflow of approximately 0 06 ml s 1 in each core throughout the duration of the breakthrough experiment calibration of eq 1 resulted in n e values of 0 42 0 37 and 0 43 for core 1 2 and 3 respectively these values compare favourably with the previously measured average total porosity for the aquifer coarse tailings sand of 0 45 ketcheson 2015 core 2 and 3 demonstrated similar hydrodynamic dispersion fig 2 with an abrupt increase in outflow concentration after 0 8 pore volumes in contrast core 1 exhibited a more gentle and steady increase in outflow concentration after 0 6 pore volumes this difference in transport behaviour is reflected in the calibrated αl values which were 1 3 10 2 1 5 10 3 and 1 1 10 3 m for cores 1 2 and 3 respectively 4 2 single well response tests in situ hydraulic conductivity measured in the field with bail tests varied between 0 58 and 29 m d 1 the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity was 2 9 m d 1 ln k 1 1 with a ln k variance of 0 9 although the histogram of ln k vaguely resembles a right skewed gaussian distribution fig 3 the log transformed data did not satisfy the shapiro wilk normality test the hypothesis that the data conform to a normal distribution was rejected large samples of log transformed hydraulic conductivity data from weak or mildly heterogeneous aquifers are typically assumed to conform to a normal distribution rehfeldt et al 1992 it is conceivable that the right skew in the ln k distribution is a consequence of certain piezometer screens partially intersecting a layer of petroleum coke a construction material with substantially higher hydraulic conductivity ketcheson et al 2017 since the highest hydraulic conductivity measurements were generally associated with monitoring locations under the petroleum coke efforts were made to exclude such locations from the analysis by comparing the screened interval with detailed stratigraphic information collected during site construction however if all sixteen of these potentially impacted locations are removed from the analysis the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity becomes 2 6 m d 1 ln k 0 9 with a ln k variance of 0 4 it should be noted that hydraulic conductivity tests could not be performed on the observation wells installed for the purpose of monitoring the tracer experiment as their quick recovery prevented manual measurement techniques and the narrow internal diameter precluded the deployment of pressure transducers to record recovery 4 3 field scale tracer test the water table in the vicinity of the tracer test was influenced by its proximity to the east recharge basin which periodically filled with surface runoff during which a transient groundwater mound would develop beneath the basin see kessel et al 2021 for details prior to the experiment commencing a series of runoff events resulted in a local water table rise over the course of the experiment the groundwater mound moved downgradient and slowly dissipated resulting in the average water table declining by approximately 30 cm 8 mm d 1 this was accompanied by a slight decrease in the slope of the water table the horizontal hydraulic gradient steadily decreased from 0 044 on day 21 to 0 034 on day 59 during the experimental period 2 3 cm of rainfall was measured however based on soil moisture modelling sutton and price 2020b this corresponded to 1 mm of groundwater recharge six rounds of water sampling were conducted at the observation wells however only the latter four sampling events t 21 27 53 59 d allowed for full delineation of the tracer plume the small internal volume of the monitoring wells meant that purging and sampling removed 0 1 of the tracer mass the dimensions of the plume on day 21 were 8 m 5 m and by day 59 had increased to 20 m 9 m fig 4 by the end of the experiment the plume encompassed approximately 270 m3 of aquifer material water level monitoring demonstrated that negligible groundwater mounding developed around the injection wells the narrow plume dimensions on day 21 provided further confirmation of this background br concentrations at the observation wells prior to the experiment commencing were all non detect 0 7 mg l 1 average br concentrations for the day 21 27 53 and 59 sampling events were 165 108 43 and 21 mg l 1 respectively the plume did not exhibit any clear evidence of preferential flow pathways 4 4 analysis of spatial moments the results of the spatial moment analysis are summarized in table 1 the zeroth spatial moment which provides an estimate of the total tracer mass in solution is shown in fig 5a bromide is considered a conservative or non reactive tracer and therefore deviations in estimated mass from the injected mass reflect inadequacies in the monitoring network and uncertainty associated with the analytical method the mass in solution was generally approximated adequately by the zeroth moment and varied between 74 and 110 of the known injected mass 2100 g the largest discrepancy in estimated mass on day 59 is likely a reflection of the plume moving to an area of lower sampling network density the first spatial moment which estimates the spatial coordinates of the plume centre of mass is shown in fig 5b the plume centre of mass moved at an average rate of 0 31 m d 1 although varied between 0 26 m d 1 and 0 42 m d 1 and travelled at a bearing of approximately n20 w fig 4 this deviated slightly from the average slope aspect of the water table within the boundaries of the plume n25 w at the conclusion of the experiment the plume centre of mass had a maximum displacement of 18 2 m from the central injection well the average hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer that the plume intersected was 3 4 m d 1 but when calculated for each individual sampling event estimated k varied between 2 9 and 3 7 m d 1 the second spatial moment or spatial covariance tensor characterizes the concentration distribution about the centre of mass in directions parallel and perpendicular to the velocity vector fig 5c the longitudinal and transverse horizontal spatial covariance tensors grew approximately linearly with displacement distance from the injection wells these spatial covariance tensors corresponded to longitudinal dispersivities that remained approximately constant and varied between 0 37 m and 0 49 m and transverse horizontal dispersivities that increased with displacement distance from 0 02 m to 0 10 m 5 discussion considerable attention within solute transport literature has been given to the issue of asymptotic conditions in field tracer experiments zech et al 2015 asymptotic dispersivity can be defined in practical terms as the dispersivity associated with sufficient travel through a porous media such that the probability distribution of pore water velocity changes negligibly with further downgradient displacement the transport can then be reasonably approximated as a fickian process whereby the assumption that the dispersive flux is proportional to the concentration gradient is adequately satisfied and therefore fulfills a requirement of eq 9 once the asymptotic dispersivity has been reached dispersivity will not continue to grow unless a systematic deviation in geology is encountered evidence suggests that the plume needs to transit multiple dozens of correlation scale lengths of the aquifer to reach this state dagan 1987 a correlation scale length is a property of the covariance structure of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity field put simply it can be thought of as summarizing the decay in predictive power of a hydraulic conductivity measurement for estimating the hydraulic conductivity at successively larger separation distances at what separation do two k measurements become uncorrelated the approximately linear relationship between the longitudinal spatial covariance σyy and displacement of the plume centre of mass fig 5c suggests but does not definitively confirm that the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity was obtained during the field tracer experiment this is consistent with expectations regarding the transport characteristics of the coarse tailings sand aquifer specifically the segregation of particle sizes due to the industrial process from which tailings sand issues and the mechanical placement of the sand during construction using haul trucks wiggle wagons and bulldozers this was anticipated to result in an aquifer with a small variance in hydraulic conductivity and a correlation structure of the hydraulic conductivity field with notably small spatial autocorrelation lengths that lacked the stratigraphic features associated with natural deposition e g lamination and stratification furthermore the short distance associated with the development of the plume to this apparent asymptotic state 9 m is a similar indication of the minimally heterogeneous nature of the aquifer however this study was not complemented by a thorough characterization of aquifer permeability that would allow for the identification of the correlation scale of tailings sand k therefore evidence to support the adequacy of presumptions on statistical stationarity and small correlation scale of the hydraulic conductivity field is largely speculative however by fitting the equation of dagan 1984 to the estimated longitudinal spatial covariance tensor σyy derived from the tracer test an approximation of the correlation scale can be identified this equation takes the form 10 σ yy t σ ln k 2 l ln k 2 2 t t 3 2 3 ei t t ln t t γ 3 e t t 1 t t 1 t t 2 where σln k 2 is the variance of the natural logarithm ln of hydraulic conductivity lln k is the correlation length of the ln k covariance function t is a characteristic time equal to lln k v ei is the exponential integral and γ is the euler mascheroni constant this equation was used in a similar manner by freyberg 1986 and sudicky 1986 however these studies had estimates of lln k to contextualize the results which this present study lacks assuming a velocity of 0 31 m d 1 and ln k variance of 0 91 the calibrated value of lln k that minimized the error between estimated and observed σyy was 0 36 m fig 6 thus providing some evidence to suggest that the correlation length of tailings sand hydraulic conductivity is quite small in comparison to a natural sand aquifer that exhibited minimal heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field σln k 2 0 24 the correlation scale length llnk identified using eq 9 was 2 7 m freyberg 1986 sudicky 1986 assuming the correlation length of 0 36 m is indeed representative of the length in the vicinity of the tracer test the plume centre of mass will have transited over 50 correlation scale lengths at its maximum displacement of 18 2 m while it may be coincidental this estimated correlation length lies between the short tailings sand columns 0 32 and 0 34 m which had dispersivities on the order of 1 10 3 m and the longer column 0 37 m which had a markedly larger dispersivity on the order of 1 10 2 m fig 2 2 however determining if this reflects a meaningful threshold would require additional replicates of tailings columns in conjunction with a detailed characterization of aquifer hydraulic conductivity autocorrelation 5 1 contextualizing this study gelhar et al 1992 performed a comprehensive review of field tracer tests which involved the classification of dispersivities into a hierarchy of reliability in brief their criteria for high reliability experiments included 1 test conducted under natural gradient ambient groundwater flow conditions 2 tracer input concentration mass and temporal distribution should be known 3 the tracer should be conservative non reactive 4 monitoring of test should occur in three dimensions or two dimensions if the tracer was injected across the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer and 5 concentration data were analyzed using the method of spatial moments gelhar et al 1992 based on these criteria this tracer test conducted in the coarse tailings aquifer would be classified as high reliability more recently the work of gelhar et al 1992 was refined and updated by zech et al 2015 this tracer test remains consistent with their definition of a high reliability experiment comparing the field estimated asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity 0 49 m and associated scale 18 2 m with a selection of tracer tests from zech et al 2015 shows the relatively short displacement distance and moderate longitudinal dispersivity of this experiment fig 7 the dispersivities obtained from the nikanotee tailings sand fall among other weak or mildly heterogeneous aquifers including borden cape cod and chalk river zech et al 2015 the ratio of transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity of 1 5 is larger than the 1 10 ratio frequently assumed when not directly measured however as discussed in zech et al 2019 this is a convention without empirical or theoretical justification however given the transient water table conditions that occurred throughout the experiment it seems reasonable to conclude that the relatively large apparent transverse dispersivity is at least partly due to unresolved groundwater flow variations that occurred temporally between sampling periods and spatially within the lateral extent of the plume this phenomenon was illustrated theoretically by goode and konikow 1990 whereby deviations from the assumed dominant groundwater flow direction resulted in erroneous attribution of longitudinal dispersion to apparent transverse dispersivity field corroboration of this principle was provided at a contaminant plume that exhibited notably small transverse dispersivity which was ascribed to atypically steady groundwater velocity and flow direction van der kamp et al 1994 the dearth of studies that characterize the transport properties of anthropogenically deposited materials presents a challenge for evaluating the representativeness of the dispersivity and correlation length estimates uncertainty in these estimates is compounded by the relatively infrequent sampling and short displacement distance of the plume nonetheless the relationship between dispersivity and displacement is consistent with empirical and anecdotal evidence regarding the nature of the material and the aquifer this includes the congruence with experiments conducted in other mildly heterogeneous albeit naturally deposited aquifers fig 7 the homogeneity of the particle size distribution ketcheson 2015 consistency of k at multiple scales and field observations of tailings uniformity in contrast the estimated correlation length is largely conjecture but does conform to our expectations about aquifer permeability the excavation transportation and placement of tailings sand during aquifer construction inevitably involves a disturbance to the initial permeability correlation structure that arises from hydraulic deposition of a tailings waste slurry in a dyke while the degree to which this original correlation structure is altered is not known it seems reasonable to propose that the disturbance would generally act to decrease lln k of the anthropogenically deposited aquifer explicitly investigating this matter would be a valuable contribution to both reclamation and solute transport literature 5 2 implications for landscape scale reclamation planning the hydraulic conductivity of coarse tailings sand identified by the laboratory column experiments 3 2 m d 1 single well response tests 2 9 m d 1 and field tracer test 3 4 m d 1 is close to the targeted hydraulic conductivity 8 6 m d 1 specified in the original conceptual aquifer design conducted by price et al 2010 a high aquifer conductivity was recognized as a necessary design feature to ensure a sufficient supply of groundwater to the fen while it is advantageous that coarse tailings sand appears to have the appropriate hydraulic conductivity to perform the function of a water conveyance feature in the reclamation landscape the presence of residual solutes requires characterization of transport properties to predict the timing and extent of solute redistribution to that end dispersive mixing will ameliorate the considerable initial geochemical heterogeneity kessel et al 2018 with further downgradient transport resulting in a more spatially and temporally uniform input of salinity from a tailings sand aquifer to a wetland or other downgradient receptor however the hydrophysical properties of an aquifer are not the sole determinants governing the patterns of solute movement and mass export to downgradient ecosystems of particular relevance to mine tailings is the depositional history and flushing that has occurred prior to and following deposition huang et al 2021 the depositional history will largely be regulated by the needs of mine operators however in contrast the degree of flushing could be influenced by the design of the reclamation landscape by enhancing recharge kessel et al 2021 altering cover soil thickness sutton and price 2020a or delaying vegetation growth sutton and price 2020b whether the industrial processes that generate and segregate coarse tailings sand and mechanically deposit the material for use in reclamation will result in aquifers with common transport properties is a matter that will require further investigation while tailings sand in the aosr has generally been shown to be a minimally heterogeneous material in a large multi scale evaluation of hydraulic conductivity conducted in the context of landscape reclamation mckenna 2002 there was spatial variability that manifest at a variety of scales however in spite of any differences in the physical characteristics of the parent material the macroscopic structure field scale heterogeneities of the hydraulic conductivity field will have a larger impact on field scale dispersivity macrodispersivity dagan 1987 at a reclamation site this structure or lack thereof is expected to be predominantly influenced by the manner of its deposition specifically mechanically placed using heavy earth moving equipment based on this assumption it would be reasonable to anticipate other coarse tailings sand aquifers in the aosr have asymptotic dispersivities of similar magnitude to this study incorporating a material with consistent hydraulic properties into reclamation design on the mine closure landscape has clear advantages allowing practitioners to reliably predict hydrologic behaviour 6 conclusion hydraulic conductivity of coarse tailings sand was estimated and measured using a variety of techniques and across a range of spatial scales from 2 9 10 3 m3 to 2 7 102 m3 of aquifer material sampled this evaluation demonstrated close agreement between laboratory 3 2 m d 1 in situ field 2 9 m d 1 and tracer test derived 3 4 m d 1 values of average k yet despite the grain size segregation that occurred as part of the tailings waste stream and the assumed homogenization that occurred due to mechanical placement the coarse tailings sand exhibited a non trivial spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity σln k 2 0 91 demonstrating once again the notoriously heterogeneous nature of field soils dispersivity values estimated from breakthrough in the tailings sand cores reflective of pore scale mechanical dispersion were expectedly small the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity derived from the tracer test reached a maximum of 0 49 m and 0 10 m respectively after 59 days of transport and 18 2 m of displacement the approximately linear growth of the longitudinal spatial covariance tensor indicated that the asymptotic value of dispersivity may have been obtained by conducting further hydraulic conductivity measurements to obtain estimates of spatial autocorrelation this claim could be more rigorously evaluated given the anticipated expansion of coarse tailings sand landscapes in the post mined aosr the detailed characterization of hydraulic and transport properties is warranted this study will contribute to a small but growing and increasingly necessary body of literature on the transport of solutes through formerly mined and reclaimed materials in forthcoming work the tailings sand dispersivity and large scale effective hydraulic conductivity identified in this study will be used to parameterize a fate and transport model of solutes from the upland to peatland at the nikanotee fen watershed characterizing tailings sand hydraulic conductivity with a high degree of confidence will help to reduce the compensatory behaviour between hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge that could lead to non uniqueness in the model

1284,techniques for predicting the contaminant cloud propagation along a stream are necessary for swift action against contaminant spill accidents in fluvial systems due to their low computational cost one dimensional solute transport models have conventionally been employed in which the complex channel characteristics are considered using model parameters however the determination of such

transport models 1d stms are often employed to provide such prompt predictions of in stream contaminant transport hart 1995 due to their low computational costs among the 1d stms the 1d advection dispersion equation ade is a classical model and was first introduced by taylor 1953 based on the fickian interpretation for solute transport in a channel its governing equation is as follows 1 c t u c x 1 a x a d l c x where c g m 3 is the cross sectional averaged concentration a m 2 is the cross sectional area of the surface flow d l m 2 s 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient x m is the streamwise coordinate and t s is the time however taylor s analysis is only applicable to channels with relatively low variabilities chatwin and allen 1985 to improve the accuracy of prediction for streams with irregular topographies and flow conditions models incorporating the effects of storage zones in rivers have been proposed as illustrated in fig 1a the role of storage zones in a river system is to transiently trap contaminant particles and then release them back to the surface flow after some residence time the transient storage model tsm is most widely used model for this process due to its simplicity and vast verification by field studies thackston and schnelle 1970 bencala 1983 bencala and walters 1983 rowiński et al 2003 guymer and dutton 2005 the tsm interprets a fluvial transport system by coupling two different domains the flow zone and the storage zone fig 1b the tsm simulation predicts the solute concentrations in the two domains denoted by c f and c s respectively the coupled governing equations are as follows 2a c f t u f c f x 1 a x a f d lf c f x α c f c s 2b c s t α a f a s c f c s where u f m s 1 is the mean velocity of the flow zone a f m 2 is the cross sectional area of the flow zone d lf m 2 s 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of the flow zone a s m 2 is the cross sectional area of the storage zone and α s 1 is the mass exchange rate the tsm is a fundamentally advanced version of the ade that adds the sink source term α c f c s that is if α is close to zero eq 2 becomes equivalent to the ade of eq 1 the structure of the 1d stm is advantageous in terms of its simplicity and adaptability but it is accompanied by high uncertainties as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the 1d stms roughly characterize complex streamflows and channel geometries using several constant parameters although various approaches for providing theoretical and empirical estimates of these parameters have been proposed in recent decades cheong et al 2007 cheong and seo 2003 femeena et al 2019 noh et al 2021 pederson 1977 rowiński et al 2005 rowiński and piotrowski 2008 sahay 2012 thackston and schnelle 1970 accurate predictions of the storage related parameters remain challenging this is due to the assumptions and simplifications used inthe tsm which cannot incorporate all the complexities of the fluvial system e g those shown in fig 1a accordingly the present parameter determinations rely predominantly on optimization techniques however the selection of optimal parameters is hampered by various uncertainties e g those from over simplifications for dimensional reduction numerical settings for optimization such as those for the grid size or objective function noh et al 2021 2019 wallis and manson 2019 the equifinality problem choi et al 2020 and those in the measured data itself consequently due to the difficulty in determining representable parameters 1d stms generally have limited applicability to the prediction of contaminant transport in natural waterways this difficulty has yet to be clearly resolved to overcome the uncertainties associated with simple models such as the ade and tsm more complicated 1d stms have been proposed aiming to pursue more realistic models by including additional processes bottacin busolin et al 2021 femeena et al 2020 kim et al 2021a knapp and kelleher 2020 or multiple storage zones bottacin busolin et al 2011 briggs et al 2009 choi et al 2000 gooseff et al 2004 marion et al 2008 marion and zaramella 2005 zaramella et al 2016 although such attempts are valuable in identifying how to parameterize the complexity of a river system it is evident that pursuing only high accuracy based on unobservable parameters does not represent a practical use of 1d stms moreover as long as it remains difficult to determine the parameters of complicated 1d stms any increase in the model complexity will adversely affect the model applicability in practice when a contaminant spill accident occurs in a river system managers of water intake facilities do not necessarily immediately require a well fitted breakthrough curve btc rather they require predictions of the arrival time of a contaminant cloud to an intake station and of any concentrations in excess of water quality standards consequently for a swift response to contaminant spill accidents a simple and accurate prediction method needs to be developed to avoid difficulties in determining the proper parameters for 1d stms with these concerns regarding the applicability of existing 1d stms for btc prediction this study aimed to evaluate the prediction accuracies of the ade and tsm and to devise an alternative method based on a regressive relationship between the features of btcs and the travel distance for these purposes the objectives of this study were to 1 conduct reach scale tracer experiments with efficient preprocessing techniques for noisy tracer data which is yet to be thoroughly addressed in previous studies 2 quantitatively relate the statistical features of btcs to flow properties and establish a regressive prediction rp method based on the correlations between btc features and the reach length and 3 validate the rp by comparison to ade and tsm simulations in a reach where no flow information is provided the development process of the proposed rp method is depicted as a flowchart in fig 2 2 tracer experiments 2 1 site description we acquired btcs from four reach scale tracer experiments in medium sized rivers in south korea cheongmi creek in 2015 and 2019 and gam creek in 2019 and 2020 see fig 3 these are hereafter referred to tests a b c and d respectively both rivers contain structural components that can transiently trap solute particles including sand bars dunes bridge piers and partially braided or meandering reaches kim et al 2021a 2021b kwon et al 2021a noh et al 2021 2019 we conducted two experiments for each river under different streamflow conditions cheongmi creek is located in yeoju city and is one of the first order tributaries of the han river the largest river in south korea the test reaches of the two tracer studies here test a and test b were 3 550 km and 4 363 km long with average discharges of q 2 3 m3 s and 3 1 m3 s respectively gam creek traverses the gimcheon city and is a tributary of the nakdong river the test reaches of tests c and d were 4 850 km and 4 542 km long respectively these reaches also closely overlapped as shown in fig 3b despite the apparent similarity of the two testbeds the flow conditions were significantly different the average discharges for tests c and d were 12 86 m3 s and 2 17 m3 s respectively and the channel morphology changed considerably throughout the one year gap in gam creek the hydraulic and geometric properties representing each sub reach were estimated by averaging the measurements at the upstream and downstream boundaries a sontek flowtracker acoustic doppler velocimeter was used to survey the mean discharge q mean flow velocity u and mean water depth h a real time kinematic gps device sokkia grx1 was used to survey the bed slope water depth top width locations of stations reach length and sinuosity 2 2 tracer measurement to investigate the solute behaviors in the rivers rhodamine wt rwt was used as a tracer material in the experiments generally a 1d solute transport analysis is considered valid after guaranteeing the underlying premise i e that the solute spreads out only in the longitudinal direction in this respect the tracer was injected at multiple points in a transverse row to accelerate the lateral and vertical mixing moreover we set the first measuring station s1 to be sufficiently far from the injection for cross sectional complete mixing over the required distance suggested by kilpatrick and wilson 1989 as follows 3 l 0 0 1 1 n 2 u w 2 e z where l 0 m is the required distance from the injection point n is the number of injection sources and e z m 2 s 1 is the lateral mixing coefficient estimated by e z hu 0 15 where u m s 1 is the shear velocity fischer 1979 the concentrations of rwt were measured using 14 ysi 600oms sensors before the in situ measurements we calibrated these sensors using a standard solution with a known concentration of rwt in the range of 0 to 200 ppb the sampling rate was set to 0 05 hz for test a and 0 25 hz for tests b c and d the sampling duration was set to 24 h after injection the error range of the sensor is 5 of the measured concentration values or 1 ppb baek et al 2019 at each measuring station three or four sensors were equally spaced in the transverse direction so that the cross sectional average btc could be obtained by averaging the single sensor measurements 3 methods for btc analysis 3 1 preprocessing for noisy btcs tracer test has long been used as a technique to indirectly identify streamflow dynamics early tracer tests were able to provide only a small amount of concentration data by sampling to form a btc due to a lack of appropriate measurement techniques measuring once in minutes hours or even days cox et al 2003 de smedt et al 2005 drummond et al 2017 2014 gooseff et al 2013 kwon et al 2021b piotrowski et al 2007 runkel 1998 as the tracer measurement techniques have recently advanced it is possible to acquire high resolution data for a single btc measuring once in seconds baek et al 2019 bottacin busolin et al 2011 kim et al 2021b lemke et al 2013 shin et al 2020 this advancement has enabled the investigation of the smaller time scale behavior of a tracer transport along a river but unfortunately it is also accompanied by undesired noise due to the irregularity and randomness in natural streams such as in regards to turbulence or morphological irregularities the scale of such noise is substantial therefore the tracer btcs from rivers require more elaborate denoising techniques to clarify their mean behaviors however the denoising process always distorts the original information of the primary data thus additional care must be taken before btc denoising the background concentration must be truncated from the raw data it is challenging to separate the btc range from the background concentration without information loss particularly in the tail part due to the error range of the fluorometer improper tail truncation can negatively affect mass related or storage zone related analyses drummond et al 2012 in addition several statistical features of the btc including its higher order moments are incredibly sensitive to tail truncations several experimental studies have found that the late time behavior of btcs has a power law residence time distribution rtd in the storage zone gooseff et al 2005 haggerty et al 2002 schumer et al 2003 therefore the tailing part has often been truncated at the point where the power law relationship ends the total mass of the truncated btcs is then recovered using the known injected mass of the rwt to supplement the conservative tracer assumption as argued in previous studies the mass recovery rate of rwt is relatively low due to its sorbability runkel 2015 however aubeneau et al 2015 reported that the sorption process does not significantly change the fundamental shape of the btc because it commonly occurs only in benthic and hyporheic regions and not in water column in this study the average mass recovery rate of all experiments was estimated as 84 i e a relatively higher rate than those that were summarized in runkel 2015 the truncated and mass recovered data of the tracer concentrations are provided in kim et al 2022 the most basic and pragmatic method for denoising truncated btcs is the conventional moving average method durbin 1959 sonnenwald et al 2015 sun et al 2014 this method averages the data within a configured window size and move the window to the next timestep accordingly it cannot always clearly distinguish between the mean value and noise nevertheless this differentiation is the key to minimizing the primary data distortion in the denoising process in this context a median filter could show better performance than the simple moving average method but it still has considerable dependence on the noise residual accordingly in this study network synthesis filters were used to selectively eliminate the small time scale high frequency variability of the data in the btcs in the fourier domain the purpose of network synthesis filters such as the gaussian filter or butterworth filter is to pass the contributions of certain frequencies while rejecting the contributions of the remaining frequencies the filter response functions frfs of the gaussian and the butterworth filters are as given below 4 h g iω e ω 2 2 σ ω 2 5 h b iω 1 1 ω ω c 2 n where h g and h b are the frfs of the gaussian filter and the butterworth filter respectively σ ω hz is the standard deviation and is a parameter of the gaussian filter and ω c hz and n are the cutoff frequency and filtering order respectively and these are parameters of the butterworth filter the key difference between these two frfs is in the range of the transition as shown in fig 4 the transition steepness of the butterworth filter can be configured with the filtering order n whereas that of the gaussian filter cannot the wide range of transition around the cutoff frequency interrupts the decomposition of high frequency noise from the low frequency mean motion due to the gradually attenuated transition of the frf of the gaussian filter it cannot completely pass the low band contributions indicating poor preservation of the mean motion in the btcs 3 2 btc feature extraction when rwt is instantaneously injected into a river the btc measured by an in situ sensor in the downstream section contains a significant amount of information regarding the flow hydraulics and channel morphology this is because the rwt behaves almost passively according to the flow characteristics thus the btc implies inherent features regarding river mixing processes thus the btc has been commonly utilized to provide key information to understand both the flow dynamics and contaminant transport in the fluvial domain field 2020 haggerty et al 2000 kim et al 2020 kwon et al 2021a luo et al 2006 several studies have proposed the featurization of the btcs to extract relevant information according to each analysis object kwon et al 2021a 2021b used 21 statistical features of the btc to construct a machine learning model for predicting the contaminant source in this study we selected 14 features corresponding to advection diffusion and storage effect as described in table 1 and fig 5 among the selected features the temporal moments of the btc can be significant features for analyzing the travel and spread of a contaminant cloud haggerty et al 2000 yu et al 2001 the kth temporal moment m k was computed by m k 0 t k c x t dt from the first moment the median arrival time t med could be calculated using t med m 1 0 c x t dt which represents the mean travel time of the entire contaminant cloud however it does not indicate the mean current velocity that includes any additional delaying effects due to storage zones along the stream channels harvey and gorelick 1995 similarly the front arrival time t f and peak arrival time t p can also represent the advective characteristics of the cloud higher order moments can also be used to characterize btc shape related features the temporal variance of the btc is highly related to the degree of diffusion in this study it was estimated based on the second moment calculated as σ m 2 m 0 t med the duration over a certain concentration in the btc indicating how long the contaminant concentration exceeded a reference value was used as a value corresponding to the diffusion values of 75 50 and 10 of c max were used as reference concentrations following kwon et al 2021a 2021b the third moment related feature i e the skewness skns m 3 m 2 1 5 was used to represent the anomalous transport of contaminants as induced by the storage zone effect in that it elongates the btc tail the kurtosis kurt m 4 m 2 2 3 a fourth moment related feature represents the btc peak shape as a high kurtosis indicates a drastic concentration change at the peak and such a change can be spatiotemporally loosened by diffusion the kurt could provide an indirect indicator of diffusion the concentration features such as its mean and maximum values were also selected for analysis because they decrease with contaminant propagation thus such concentration related features are dependent on the travel distance as are other diffusion related features the slopes were used to evaluate the concentration variation rate in the btc segments such as the rising limb falling limb and tail the slopes of the rising and falling limbs represent the ratios of the maximum concentration to the time interval of each segment following the work of kim and kang 2020 and kim et al 2020 the power law slope of the btc tail was also used to investigate the magnitude of the storage zone effect however the tail slope is often difficult to characterize duo to the sensitivity regarding the tail truncation and resulting errors drummond et al 2012 4 development of regressive prediction method 4 1 residuals by denoising in this study we compared the performance of two different filters the gaussian filter and butterworth filter the latter with an order of five in denoising the btc data measured from the rivers notably either filtering process requires the degree of distortion of the primary data to be acceptable given that the most vulnerable part of btcs to distortion is the peak concentration we evaluated the amount of noise could be removed with each filtering method under the same restriction on the acceptable peak concentration collapse rate defined as follows 6 ϵ cp max c ini max c filt max c ini where ϵ cp is the peak concentration collapse rate c ini g m 3 is the initial btc and c filt g m 3 is the filtered btc in this study the acceptable ϵ cp was restricted to 0 001 meaning that 99 9 of the initial concentration information could be preserved at the peak with this underlying restriction the two filters were applied to the btcs fig 6 plots the initial btcs and resulting filtered residuals the residuals are mostly distributed in the tail part nevertheless some residuals are generated in the front part and may represent outliers to quantitatively compare the denoising performances the mean absolute percentage error mape of each method was estimated and the results are summarized in table 2 the degree of the mape from the low pass filtering directly represents the amount of eliminated noise the comparison results reveal that the butterworth filter exhibit better performance with larger mapes in denoising than the gaussian filter the moving average and median filter could not be subject to this comparison because they were not able to yield the results with ϵ cp values less than 0 001 even with their respective minimum window size although denoising did not bring massive changes to the btcs of this study it is notable in addition to how much the btcs have changed that the butterworth filter shows the least risk of artificially distorting the information of the original btcs 4 2 correlation analysis the rp has an underlying hypothesis the btc variation along a channel with a streamwise monotonous morphology is more dependent on the distance through which the tracer travels than on the flow dynamics if this hypothesis is true it is possible to predict the downstream btcs using the sectional tracer test data to demonstrate this the correlations between btc features and given flow conditions were analyzed for all test cases as shown in table a 1 five measurable properties were subjected to the correlation analysis the sub reach length l flow velocity u cross sectional area a top width w and mean flow depth h along with the variations in 14 btc features the variations of the btc features were calculated based on the btc feature values at the upstream and downstream ends of each sub reach for example s1 s2 s1 s3 s1 s4 s2 s3 s2 s4 and s3 s4 for test a the variations of t med t f and t p represent the absolute changes of those in btcs at both ends of each sub reach the variations of c max c mean t 75 t 50 and t 10 represent ratios to the initial values and those of the rest represent relative changes as normalized by value at the upstream boundary of the sub reach the average values of u a w and h for each sub reach were estimated by averaging the values measured at all of stations included in each sub reach such averaging methods might not represent true values of the reach averaged properties but are most viable alternative for estimating the reach averages fig 7 shows the resulting correlations between five flow variables and the variations of 14 btc features for 28 different sub reaches of tests a d as shown in table a 1 the correlation was calculated using the pearson correlation coefficient equation as follows 7 correlation xy cov x y σ x σ y where cov is the covariance and σ x and σ x are the standard deviations of x and y respectively the reach length cases including the combined reaches of the individual sub reaches were justified according to the results from gooseff et al 2013 in which it was argued that the btc simulations across individual sub reaches and combined reaches lead to varying interpretations the results imply that most of the btc features are more highly correlated with the reach length than with other individual flow variables although the flow depth also has a relatively strong correlation with most of the btc features among the btc features five features c max t f t p t 75 and t 50 show a strong correlation with the reach length and these features can be used to roughly illustrate the btc this key result indicates that the btc variation along the stream can be predicted once the relationships between the features and reach length are investigated 4 3 development of regression equations based on the high correlation between the reach length and variation of c max t f t p t 75 and t 50 we investigated the reach length dependence of the features using btc measurements from the four tracer tests as plotted in fig 8 fig 8a shows an evident positive relationship indicating that the further the tracer cloud propagates the more the peak concentration is diluted figs 8b and c also reveal the linear relationships between the travel time of the peak and front of the tracer cloud to the reach length this indirectly indicates that the average velocity transporting the forepart of the tracer cloud was relatively homogenous in reach scale despite the irregular cross sections along the river as shown in fig 3 figs 8d and e show the reach length dependence of t 75 and t 50 with similarly distributed data and are fitted to the same exponential function with minimum root mean square errors hence it is acceptable to predict the t 75 variation from the t 50 variation and vice versa compared with the data from the gam creek tracer test the cheongmi creek tracer test data were likely to show a weaker relationship this could be attributed to the morphological variability of the testbed as the cheongmi creek testbed is highly braided and irregular especially in the scenario for test b in this study the regression equations for the four btc features were derived as follows 8 1 max c dbc max c ubc log 1 θ cp x 9 t p θ tp x 10 t f θ tf x 11 w 50 dbc w 50 ubc exp θ w x where x m is the length of the sub reaches and θ cp θ tp θ tf and θ w are the regression coefficients corresponding to c max t p t f and t 50 respectively although the feature variations tended to increase with increasing reach length travel distance we cannot assert that the overall regression shows clear relationship considering the determination coefficient r2 as summarized in table 3 however tests c and d revealed a considerably high accuracy in the regression of the four features as mentioned above this is a key result because in gam creek the distance traveled by the contaminant was the dominant factor over the individual flow properties likewise test a of cheongmi creek also showed high regression accuracy with r2 values of 0 999 and 0 995 for travel time related features t p and t f respectively this result implies that the average travel velocity of the cloud in test a was similar reach by reach along the stream channel from such a high accuracy we can conclude that the regression equations with the corresponding parameters are sufficiently representative of the measured data and such feature variation can be predicted based on the reach length however test b showed a relatively low regressive relationship this is because the flow conditions were not similar reach by reach in test b in contrast to the assumptions introduced in the derivation of the regression equations as shown in fig 3 the entire reach of test b consists of sub reaches containing very complex and braided flow structures in such cases the rp proposed in this study may have considerable uncertainty and low regression accuracy using the four feature variations considered in the above regression analysis we can roughly generate a btc as follows pointing at the btc peak using eqs 8 and 9 indicating the btc front using eq 10 plotting the rising limb by interpolating the peak and front and estimating the values of t 75 t 50 and t 10 starting from the rising limb by eq 11 with an identical parameter and then plotting the falling limb by interpolating t 75 t 50 and t 10 although this regressive method cannot signify sophisticated high frequency behaviors or the late time behaviors of the btc it represents an alternative means for predicting the main tracer cloud propagation especially for an unmeasured river reach 4 4 ade and tsm simulation to evaluate the relative prediction accuracy of the regression approach proposed in this study the results were compared with those from ade and tsm simulations in practice the implicit governing equations for the ade and tsm are often resolved by numerical analysis by applying a btc measured at the upstream boundary for example qual2e brown and barnwell 1987 and qual2k chapra and pelletier 2003 are popular water quality models that adopt the ade similarly based on the tsm governing equation runkel and broshears 1991 developed an efficient numerical model of the one dimensional transport with inflow and storage otis to construct the numerical model we employed the finite difference method as a numerical scheme for benchmarking the otis the numerical solutions were developed using the second order central difference and crank nicolson method for the spatial and temporal derivatives respectively a detailed derivation of the numerical model can be found in runkel and broshears 1991 the identity of eq 4 enables the numerical solution of the ade to be inferred by eliminating the sink source term within the tsm solution as previously stressed inverse modeling optimizes the minimum error between the observed and the numerically simulated btcs it is a classic method for estimating model parameters of the tsm otis p runkel 1998 the otis parameter estimator is the most widely used parameter estimation method due to its efficiency however it easily returns local optimum solutions this negatively affects the parameter reliability hence we adopted the parameter estimation framework established by noh et al 2021 2019 this framework employed a meta heuristic optimization technique shuffled complex self adaptive hybrid evolution sc sahel naeini et al 2018 the framework includes a mesh independence test to avoid numerical dispersion as the grid size and time step in the numerical simulation influence the resulting parameter values in the numerical computation of the optimization wallis and manson 2019 5 validation of regressive prediction method in most cases of contaminant spill accidents in the unmeasured reaches of a river the hydraulic and dispersion properties of the river along which the contaminant is likely to propagate are difficult to obtain due to the unpredictability of such accidents in other words in most cases the model parameters for the ade and tsm are unknown thus in this study we checked the applicability of the new method rp by evaluating its performance along with conventional methods ade and tsm in cases where the model parameters were pre calibrated using the tracer data available from measured reaches however the models were applied to predict btc changes along unmeasured reaches we set up a scenario as follows in all tracer tests conducted in this study we assumed that the btcs at the farthest stations from the injection were unmeasured thus using the btcs measured at the remaining stations we predicted those at the last station with three different methods ade tsm and rp table 4 and fig 9 summarize the calibration cases and table 5 summarizes the resulting calibrated parameters corresponding to each case the optimal values of d l and d lf showed different values because only the d l of the ade is responsible for the temporal variance change of the curve whereas the d lf a s and α of the tsm contribute to the dispersion processes resulting in higher values of d l than those of d lf however when a s or α is small which can be interpreted as representing fickian transport without significant contribution from storage processes d l and d lf could have similar values see m1 and m3 of test b and m1 of test d likewise the relatively high a s values of m1 of tests b and d relative to the neighboring values arise from the corresponding α values which were nearly zero and the tracer cloud separation along these reach cases can be reproduced using gaussian approximation fig 10 shows a comparison of the prediction results at the unmeasured points due to the limiting condition in the prediction without knowing any information of the unmeasured reaches the results cannot be accurately fitted to the observation in particular the simulation results from the ade and tsm show worsening peak concentration accuracies in the order of tests c d b and a the coefficient of determination r2 for the predictions decreases as the reach length increases this is because the model parameters calibrated through the measured reaches cannot accurately represent the mixing characteristics of the unmeasured reaches i e s3 s4 for tests a c and d and s4 s5 for test b this discrepancy intensifies as the tracer propagates over longer distances as a result the predictions for test c with the ade and tsm yield the poorest accuracy as shown in fig 10 in this context the application of the calibrated ade or tsm is inappropriate for predicting the btc for the unmeasured reach especially for long distance predictions as shown in fig 11 the rp yields a better r2 than the ade and tsm simulations in for tests a c and d the lower r2 in test b is likely to have led to the poor regression accuracy as shown in table 4 even so fig 10b shows that the rp result still has acceptable accuracy for example while it presents poor fitness in the falling limb causing low r2 its peak concentration is more accurate than those of ade and tsm for the prediction for test c of the longest distance the accuracies of ade and tsm are very low relative to the rp although the r2 values from the ade and tsm simulations indicate failures in prediction that from the rp indicates relative superiority for long distance btc predictions in contrast to physics or phenomenon based models the rp lacks sophistication in generating btcs it cannot be utilized for physical or statistical interpretations of btcs such as for the tailing effect however given its performance in long distance prediction for the unmeasured reach and low nearly zero computational cost the rp can be advantageous for the prediction of contaminant cloud propagation as it allows for swift action to be taken in response to contaminant spill accidents 6 conclusions in this study we investigated how btcs of a tracer change along rivers and proposed an alternative regressive method for predicting the btcs at unmeasured downstream sections four key conclusions were made first the denoising performance can be improved by configuring the transition steepness of the frfs in this respect it was demonstrated that the butterworth filter exhibited better performance for high frequency noise reduction than gaussian filter under the same distortion condition in other words the butterworth filter distorts the primary information less than the gaussian filter at the same level of denoising even with the minimum window size the moving average and median filter approaches violate the acceptable distortion condition indicating that they can easily distort the primary information of the original data second through a correlation analysis it was revealed that the significant features of the btc are correlated more strongly with the reach length than with the measured flow properties this can be discussed in two ways the averages of the directly measured flow variables may not represent their reach averages or the reach length has a greater effect on the change in tracer concentration than the measured flow variables both can demonstrate the validity of predicting btc variation using only the reach length third based on the second conclusion a regression analysis was performed according to btc variations and the flow distance although it was difficult to find clear and globally representative regression equations for all tracer test cases well fitted regression equations were found for the data from case to case in particular data from gam creek demonstrated the validity of this regressive approach with features showing r2 values of over 0 9 in the regression equations likewise the results from test a also show a clear linear relationship between the peak and front travel times of the tracer cloud and reach length however the results from test b yield relatively low regression accuracy suggesting that this reach is subject to effects other than the reach length due to the complexity of the testbed in particular we attribute this result to the influences of a highly braided flow structure as shown in fig 3a and submerged structures in test b these are different from the other testbeds fourth based on the conclusions regarding the high regression accuracy the rp was used to predict btcs across unmeasured reaches the rp with only four regression equations for peak concentration arrival time to peak concentration front arrival time and duration above 50 of peak concentration produces comparable or superior accuracies of the results to the ade and tsm the proposed model provide reasonable results for long distance prediction whereas the ade and tsm show significantly low accuracy therefore considering its relative accuracy and computational cost the rp can be an efficient alternative for predicting the btcs of unmeasured river reaches so as to provide swift action in response to contaminant spill accidents in the fluvial systems this study demonstrated the advantages of the new approach in predicting btc variations relative to the conventional ade and tsm methods we expect poor rp accuracy in rivers with irregular and heterogeneous flow conditions this is because such variability along the river reach alters the relationship between the btc change and travel distance in other words if there are drastic differences in channel geometries and flow conditions such as in the velocity cross sectional area material properties and storage zone shapes along the reaches the regression equations will have different regression coefficients reach by reach even in the same river that is the rp can be applicable in a channel where the flow dynamics is longitudinally homogeneous to some extent future studies with an expansion of the study cases and sensitivity analysis would enhance the reliability of the rp application credit author statement byunguk kim conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft visualization siyoon kwon

1284,techniques for predicting the contaminant cloud propagation along a stream are necessary for swift action against contaminant spill accidents in fluvial systems due to their low computational cost one dimensional solute transport models have conventionally been employed in which the complex channel characteristics are considered using model parameters however the determination of such parameters relies predominantly on optimization techniques based on pre measured tracer data which are usually unavailable for unexpected accidents the present paper suggests an alternative method for predicting a breakthrough curve btc variation along an unmeasured stream reach where no flow information is provided in this study we investigated the relationship between directly measured flow properties and btc characteristics based on field tracer experiments using statistical features of the tracer btcs we devised a regressive prediction method for estimating the btc features as a function of travel distance and validated the method by comparison with simulations using both a one dimensional advection dispersion equation ade and transient storage model tsm whose parameters were calibrated at upstream reaches the proposed regressive predictions were relatively accurate than those from parameter calibrated models and this advantage was more apparent for long distance predictions for the unmeasured river reach keywords contaminant transport prediction unmeasured river reach breakthrough curve features tracer test regression analysis reach length 1 introduction with accelerated industrialization and increases in chemical use the potential risk of contaminant spill accidents in fluvial systems has been soaring and such accidents inflict severe damage to the fluvial ecosystem and water quality rivord et al 2014 in many cases these accidents arise from human negligence thus it is difficult to predict where and when they are likely to occur accordingly the best way to minimize damage remains providing swift actions as such there is a need for a technique for predicting the propagation of spilt contaminants along a river reach one dimensional solute transport models 1d stms are often employed to provide such prompt predictions of in stream contaminant transport hart 1995 due to their low computational costs among the 1d stms the 1d advection dispersion equation ade is a classical model and was first introduced by taylor 1953 based on the fickian interpretation for solute transport in a channel its governing equation is as follows 1 c t u c x 1 a x a d l c x where c g m 3 is the cross sectional averaged concentration a m 2 is the cross sectional area of the surface flow d l m 2 s 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient x m is the streamwise coordinate and t s is the time however taylor s analysis is only applicable to channels with relatively low variabilities chatwin and allen 1985 to improve the accuracy of prediction for streams with irregular topographies and flow conditions models incorporating the effects of storage zones in rivers have been proposed as illustrated in fig 1a the role of storage zones in a river system is to transiently trap contaminant particles and then release them back to the surface flow after some residence time the transient storage model tsm is most widely used model for this process due to its simplicity and vast verification by field studies thackston and schnelle 1970 bencala 1983 bencala and walters 1983 rowiński et al 2003 guymer and dutton 2005 the tsm interprets a fluvial transport system by coupling two different domains the flow zone and the storage zone fig 1b the tsm simulation predicts the solute concentrations in the two domains denoted by c f and c s respectively the coupled governing equations are as follows 2a c f t u f c f x 1 a x a f d lf c f x α c f c s 2b c s t α a f a s c f c s where u f m s 1 is the mean velocity of the flow zone a f m 2 is the cross sectional area of the flow zone d lf m 2 s 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of the flow zone a s m 2 is the cross sectional area of the storage zone and α s 1 is the mass exchange rate the tsm is a fundamentally advanced version of the ade that adds the sink source term α c f c s that is if α is close to zero eq 2 becomes equivalent to the ade of eq 1 the structure of the 1d stm is advantageous in terms of its simplicity and adaptability but it is accompanied by high uncertainties as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the 1d stms roughly characterize complex streamflows and channel geometries using several constant parameters although various approaches for providing theoretical and empirical estimates of these parameters have been proposed in recent decades cheong et al 2007 cheong and seo 2003 femeena et al 2019 noh et al 2021 pederson 1977 rowiński et al 2005 rowiński and piotrowski 2008 sahay 2012 thackston and schnelle 1970 accurate predictions of the storage related parameters remain challenging this is due to the assumptions and simplifications used inthe tsm which cannot incorporate all the complexities of the fluvial system e g those shown in fig 1a accordingly the present parameter determinations rely predominantly on optimization techniques however the selection of optimal parameters is hampered by various uncertainties e g those from over simplifications for dimensional reduction numerical settings for optimization such as those for the grid size or objective function noh et al 2021 2019 wallis and manson 2019 the equifinality problem choi et al 2020 and those in the measured data itself consequently due to the difficulty in determining representable parameters 1d stms generally have limited applicability to the prediction of contaminant transport in natural waterways this difficulty has yet to be clearly resolved to overcome the uncertainties associated with simple models such as the ade and tsm more complicated 1d stms have been proposed aiming to pursue more realistic models by including additional processes bottacin busolin et al 2021 femeena et al 2020 kim et al 2021a knapp and kelleher 2020 or multiple storage zones bottacin busolin et al 2011 briggs et al 2009 choi et al 2000 gooseff et al 2004 marion et al 2008 marion and zaramella 2005 zaramella et al 2016 although such attempts are valuable in identifying how to parameterize the complexity of a river system it is evident that pursuing only high accuracy based on unobservable parameters does not represent a practical use of 1d stms moreover as long as it remains difficult to determine the parameters of complicated 1d stms any increase in the model complexity will adversely affect the model applicability in practice when a contaminant spill accident occurs in a river system managers of water intake facilities do not necessarily immediately require a well fitted breakthrough curve btc rather they require predictions of the arrival time of a contaminant cloud to an intake station and of any concentrations in excess of water quality standards consequently for a swift response to contaminant spill accidents a simple and accurate prediction method needs to be developed to avoid difficulties in determining the proper parameters for 1d stms with these concerns regarding the applicability of existing 1d stms for btc prediction this study aimed to evaluate the prediction accuracies of the ade and tsm and to devise an alternative method based on a regressive relationship between the features of btcs and the travel distance for these purposes the objectives of this study were to 1 conduct reach scale tracer experiments with efficient preprocessing techniques for noisy tracer data which is yet to be thoroughly addressed in previous studies 2 quantitatively relate the statistical features of btcs to flow properties and establish a regressive prediction rp method based on the correlations between btc features and the reach length and 3 validate the rp by comparison to ade and tsm simulations in a reach where no flow information is provided the development process of the proposed rp method is depicted as a flowchart in fig 2 2 tracer experiments 2 1 site description we acquired btcs from four reach scale tracer experiments in medium sized rivers in south korea cheongmi creek in 2015 and 2019 and gam creek in 2019 and 2020 see fig 3 these are hereafter referred to tests a b c and d respectively both rivers contain structural components that can transiently trap solute particles including sand bars dunes bridge piers and partially braided or meandering reaches kim et al 2021a 2021b kwon et al 2021a noh et al 2021 2019 we conducted two experiments for each river under different streamflow conditions cheongmi creek is located in yeoju city and is one of the first order tributaries of the han river the largest river in south korea the test reaches of the two tracer studies here test a and test b were 3 550 km and 4 363 km long with average discharges of q 2 3 m3 s and 3 1 m3 s respectively gam creek traverses the gimcheon city and is a tributary of the nakdong river the test reaches of tests c and d were 4 850 km and 4 542 km long respectively these reaches also closely overlapped as shown in fig 3b despite the apparent similarity of the two testbeds the flow conditions were significantly different the average discharges for tests c and d were 12 86 m3 s and 2 17 m3 s respectively and the channel morphology changed considerably throughout the one year gap in gam creek the hydraulic and geometric properties representing each sub reach were estimated by averaging the measurements at the upstream and downstream boundaries a sontek flowtracker acoustic doppler velocimeter was used to survey the mean discharge q mean flow velocity u and mean water depth h a real time kinematic gps device sokkia grx1 was used to survey the bed slope water depth top width locations of stations reach length and sinuosity 2 2 tracer measurement to investigate the solute behaviors in the rivers rhodamine wt rwt was used as a tracer material in the experiments generally a 1d solute transport analysis is considered valid after guaranteeing the underlying premise i e that the solute spreads out only in the longitudinal direction in this respect the tracer was injected at multiple points in a transverse row to accelerate the lateral and vertical mixing moreover we set the first measuring station s1 to be sufficiently far from the injection for cross sectional complete mixing over the required distance suggested by kilpatrick and wilson 1989 as follows 3 l 0 0 1 1 n 2 u w 2 e z where l 0 m is the required distance from the injection point n is the number of injection sources and e z m 2 s 1 is the lateral mixing coefficient estimated by e z hu 0 15 where u m s 1 is the shear velocity fischer 1979 the concentrations of rwt were measured using 14 ysi 600oms sensors before the in situ measurements we calibrated these sensors using a standard solution with a known concentration of rwt in the range of 0 to 200 ppb the sampling rate was set to 0 05 hz for test a and 0 25 hz for tests b c and d the sampling duration was set to 24 h after injection the error range of the sensor is 5 of the measured concentration values or 1 ppb baek et al 2019 at each measuring station three or four sensors were equally spaced in the transverse direction so that the cross sectional average btc could be obtained by averaging the single sensor measurements 3 methods for btc analysis 3 1 preprocessing for noisy btcs tracer test has long been used as a technique to indirectly identify streamflow dynamics early tracer tests were able to provide only a small amount of concentration data by sampling to form a btc due to a lack of appropriate measurement techniques measuring once in minutes hours or even days cox et al 2003 de smedt et al 2005 drummond et al 2017 2014 gooseff et al 2013 kwon et al 2021b piotrowski et al 2007 runkel 1998 as the tracer measurement techniques have recently advanced it is possible to acquire high resolution data for a single btc measuring once in seconds baek et al 2019 bottacin busolin et al 2011 kim et al 2021b lemke et al 2013 shin et al 2020 this advancement has enabled the investigation of the smaller time scale behavior of a tracer transport along a river but unfortunately it is also accompanied by undesired noise due to the irregularity and randomness in natural streams such as in regards to turbulence or morphological irregularities the scale of such noise is substantial therefore the tracer btcs from rivers require more elaborate denoising techniques to clarify their mean behaviors however the denoising process always distorts the original information of the primary data thus additional care must be taken before btc denoising the background concentration must be truncated from the raw data it is challenging to separate the btc range from the background concentration without information loss particularly in the tail part due to the error range of the fluorometer improper tail truncation can negatively affect mass related or storage zone related analyses drummond et al 2012 in addition several statistical features of the btc including its higher order moments are incredibly sensitive to tail truncations several experimental studies have found that the late time behavior of btcs has a power law residence time distribution rtd in the storage zone gooseff et al 2005 haggerty et al 2002 schumer et al 2003 therefore the tailing part has often been truncated at the point where the power law relationship ends the total mass of the truncated btcs is then recovered using the known injected mass of the rwt to supplement the conservative tracer assumption as argued in previous studies the mass recovery rate of rwt is relatively low due to its sorbability runkel 2015 however aubeneau et al 2015 reported that the sorption process does not significantly change the fundamental shape of the btc because it commonly occurs only in benthic and hyporheic regions and not in water column in this study the average mass recovery rate of all experiments was estimated as 84 i e a relatively higher rate than those that were summarized in runkel 2015 the truncated and mass recovered data of the tracer concentrations are provided in kim et al 2022 the most basic and pragmatic method for denoising truncated btcs is the conventional moving average method durbin 1959 sonnenwald et al 2015 sun et al 2014 this method averages the data within a configured window size and move the window to the next timestep accordingly it cannot always clearly distinguish between the mean value and noise nevertheless this differentiation is the key to minimizing the primary data distortion in the denoising process in this context a median filter could show better performance than the simple moving average method but it still has considerable dependence on the noise residual accordingly in this study network synthesis filters were used to selectively eliminate the small time scale high frequency variability of the data in the btcs in the fourier domain the purpose of network synthesis filters such as the gaussian filter or butterworth filter is to pass the contributions of certain frequencies while rejecting the contributions of the remaining frequencies the filter response functions frfs of the gaussian and the butterworth filters are as given below 4 h g iω e ω 2 2 σ ω 2 5 h b iω 1 1 ω ω c 2 n where h g and h b are the frfs of the gaussian filter and the butterworth filter respectively σ ω hz is the standard deviation and is a parameter of the gaussian filter and ω c hz and n are the cutoff frequency and filtering order respectively and these are parameters of the butterworth filter the key difference between these two frfs is in the range of the transition as shown in fig 4 the transition steepness of the butterworth filter can be configured with the filtering order n whereas that of the gaussian filter cannot the wide range of transition around the cutoff frequency interrupts the decomposition of high frequency noise from the low frequency mean motion due to the gradually attenuated transition of the frf of the gaussian filter it cannot completely pass the low band contributions indicating poor preservation of the mean motion in the btcs 3 2 btc feature extraction when rwt is instantaneously injected into a river the btc measured by an in situ sensor in the downstream section contains a significant amount of information regarding the flow hydraulics and channel morphology this is because the rwt behaves almost passively according to the flow characteristics thus the btc implies inherent features regarding river mixing processes thus the btc has been commonly utilized to provide key information to understand both the flow dynamics and contaminant transport in the fluvial domain field 2020 haggerty et al 2000 kim et al 2020 kwon et al 2021a luo et al 2006 several studies have proposed the featurization of the btcs to extract relevant information according to each analysis object kwon et al 2021a 2021b used 21 statistical features of the btc to construct a machine learning model for predicting the contaminant source in this study we selected 14 features corresponding to advection diffusion and storage effect as described in table 1 and fig 5 among the selected features the temporal moments of the btc can be significant features for analyzing the travel and spread of a contaminant cloud haggerty et al 2000 yu et al 2001 the kth temporal moment m k was computed by m k 0 t k c x t dt from the first moment the median arrival time t med could be calculated using t med m 1 0 c x t dt which represents the mean travel time of the entire contaminant cloud however it does not indicate the mean current velocity that includes any additional delaying effects due to storage zones along the stream channels harvey and gorelick 1995 similarly the front arrival time t f and peak arrival time t p can also represent the advective characteristics of the cloud higher order moments can also be used to characterize btc shape related features the temporal variance of the btc is highly related to the degree of diffusion in this study it was estimated based on the second moment calculated as σ m 2 m 0 t med the duration over a certain concentration in the btc indicating how long the contaminant concentration exceeded a reference value was used as a value corresponding to the diffusion values of 75 50 and 10 of c max were used as reference concentrations following kwon et al 2021a 2021b the third moment related feature i e the skewness skns m 3 m 2 1 5 was used to represent the anomalous transport of contaminants as induced by the storage zone effect in that it elongates the btc tail the kurtosis kurt m 4 m 2 2 3 a fourth moment related feature represents the btc peak shape as a high kurtosis indicates a drastic concentration change at the peak and such a change can be spatiotemporally loosened by diffusion the kurt could provide an indirect indicator of diffusion the concentration features such as its mean and maximum values were also selected for analysis because they decrease with contaminant propagation thus such concentration related features are dependent on the travel distance as are other diffusion related features the slopes were used to evaluate the concentration variation rate in the btc segments such as the rising limb falling limb and tail the slopes of the rising and falling limbs represent the ratios of the maximum concentration to the time interval of each segment following the work of kim and kang 2020 and kim et al 2020 the power law slope of the btc tail was also used to investigate the magnitude of the storage zone effect however the tail slope is often difficult to characterize duo to the sensitivity regarding the tail truncation and resulting errors drummond et al 2012 4 development of regressive prediction method 4 1 residuals by denoising in this study we compared the performance of two different filters the gaussian filter and butterworth filter the latter with an order of five in denoising the btc data measured from the rivers notably either filtering process requires the degree of distortion of the primary data to be acceptable given that the most vulnerable part of btcs to distortion is the peak concentration we evaluated the amount of noise could be removed with each filtering method under the same restriction on the acceptable peak concentration collapse rate defined as follows 6 ϵ cp max c ini max c filt max c ini where ϵ cp is the peak concentration collapse rate c ini g m 3 is the initial btc and c filt g m 3 is the filtered btc in this study the acceptable ϵ cp was restricted to 0 001 meaning that 99 9 of the initial concentration information could be preserved at the peak with this underlying restriction the two filters were applied to the btcs fig 6 plots the initial btcs and resulting filtered residuals the residuals are mostly distributed in the tail part nevertheless some residuals are generated in the front part and may represent outliers to quantitatively compare the denoising performances the mean absolute percentage error mape of each method was estimated and the results are summarized in table 2 the degree of the mape from the low pass filtering directly represents the amount of eliminated noise the comparison results reveal that the butterworth filter exhibit better performance with larger mapes in denoising than the gaussian filter the moving average and median filter could not be subject to this comparison because they were not able to yield the results with ϵ cp values less than 0 001 even with their respective minimum window size although denoising did not bring massive changes to the btcs of this study it is notable in addition to how much the btcs have changed that the butterworth filter shows the least risk of artificially distorting the information of the original btcs 4 2 correlation analysis the rp has an underlying hypothesis the btc variation along a channel with a streamwise monotonous morphology is more dependent on the distance through which the tracer travels than on the flow dynamics if this hypothesis is true it is possible to predict the downstream btcs using the sectional tracer test data to demonstrate this the correlations between btc features and given flow conditions were analyzed for all test cases as shown in table a 1 five measurable properties were subjected to the correlation analysis the sub reach length l flow velocity u cross sectional area a top width w and mean flow depth h along with the variations in 14 btc features the variations of the btc features were calculated based on the btc feature values at the upstream and downstream ends of each sub reach for example s1 s2 s1 s3 s1 s4 s2 s3 s2 s4 and s3 s4 for test a the variations of t med t f and t p represent the absolute changes of those in btcs at both ends of each sub reach the variations of c max c mean t 75 t 50 and t 10 represent ratios to the initial values and those of the rest represent relative changes as normalized by value at the upstream boundary of the sub reach the average values of u a w and h for each sub reach were estimated by averaging the values measured at all of stations included in each sub reach such averaging methods might not represent true values of the reach averaged properties but are most viable alternative for estimating the reach averages fig 7 shows the resulting correlations between five flow variables and the variations of 14 btc features for 28 different sub reaches of tests a d as shown in table a 1 the correlation was calculated using the pearson correlation coefficient equation as follows 7 correlation xy cov x y σ x σ y where cov is the covariance and σ x and σ x are the standard deviations of x and y respectively the reach length cases including the combined reaches of the individual sub reaches were justified according to the results from gooseff et al 2013 in which it was argued that the btc simulations across individual sub reaches and combined reaches lead to varying interpretations the results imply that most of the btc features are more highly correlated with the reach length than with other individual flow variables although the flow depth also has a relatively strong correlation with most of the btc features among the btc features five features c max t f t p t 75 and t 50 show a strong correlation with the reach length and these features can be used to roughly illustrate the btc this key result indicates that the btc variation along the stream can be predicted once the relationships between the features and reach length are investigated 4 3 development of regression equations based on the high correlation between the reach length and variation of c max t f t p t 75 and t 50 we investigated the reach length dependence of the features using btc measurements from the four tracer tests as plotted in fig 8 fig 8a shows an evident positive relationship indicating that the further the tracer cloud propagates the more the peak concentration is diluted figs 8b and c also reveal the linear relationships between the travel time of the peak and front of the tracer cloud to the reach length this indirectly indicates that the average velocity transporting the forepart of the tracer cloud was relatively homogenous in reach scale despite the irregular cross sections along the river as shown in fig 3 figs 8d and e show the reach length dependence of t 75 and t 50 with similarly distributed data and are fitted to the same exponential function with minimum root mean square errors hence it is acceptable to predict the t 75 variation from the t 50 variation and vice versa compared with the data from the gam creek tracer test the cheongmi creek tracer test data were likely to show a weaker relationship this could be attributed to the morphological variability of the testbed as the cheongmi creek testbed is highly braided and irregular especially in the scenario for test b in this study the regression equations for the four btc features were derived as follows 8 1 max c dbc max c ubc log 1 θ cp x 9 t p θ tp x 10 t f θ tf x 11 w 50 dbc w 50 ubc exp θ w x where x m is the length of the sub reaches and θ cp θ tp θ tf and θ w are the regression coefficients corresponding to c max t p t f and t 50 respectively although the feature variations tended to increase with increasing reach length travel distance we cannot assert that the overall regression shows clear relationship considering the determination coefficient r2 as summarized in table 3 however tests c and d revealed a considerably high accuracy in the regression of the four features as mentioned above this is a key result because in gam creek the distance traveled by the contaminant was the dominant factor over the individual flow properties likewise test a of cheongmi creek also showed high regression accuracy with r2 values of 0 999 and 0 995 for travel time related features t p and t f respectively this result implies that the average travel velocity of the cloud in test a was similar reach by reach along the stream channel from such a high accuracy we can conclude that the regression equations with the corresponding parameters are sufficiently representative of the measured data and such feature variation can be predicted based on the reach length however test b showed a relatively low regressive relationship this is because the flow conditions were not similar reach by reach in test b in contrast to the assumptions introduced in the derivation of the regression equations as shown in fig 3 the entire reach of test b consists of sub reaches containing very complex and braided flow structures in such cases the rp proposed in this study may have considerable uncertainty and low regression accuracy using the four feature variations considered in the above regression analysis we can roughly generate a btc as follows pointing at the btc peak using eqs 8 and 9 indicating the btc front using eq 10 plotting the rising limb by interpolating the peak and front and estimating the values of t 75 t 50 and t 10 starting from the rising limb by eq 11 with an identical parameter and then plotting the falling limb by interpolating t 75 t 50 and t 10 although this regressive method cannot signify sophisticated high frequency behaviors or the late time behaviors of the btc it represents an alternative means for predicting the main tracer cloud propagation especially for an unmeasured river reach 4 4 ade and tsm simulation to evaluate the relative prediction accuracy of the regression approach proposed in this study the results were compared with those from ade and tsm simulations in practice the implicit governing equations for the ade and tsm are often resolved by numerical analysis by applying a btc measured at the upstream boundary for example qual2e brown and barnwell 1987 and qual2k chapra and pelletier 2003 are popular water quality models that adopt the ade similarly based on the tsm governing equation runkel and broshears 1991 developed an efficient numerical model of the one dimensional transport with inflow and storage otis to construct the numerical model we employed the finite difference method as a numerical scheme for benchmarking the otis the numerical solutions were developed using the second order central difference and crank nicolson method for the spatial and temporal derivatives respectively a detailed derivation of the numerical model can be found in runkel and broshears 1991 the identity of eq 4 enables the numerical solution of the ade to be inferred by eliminating the sink source term within the tsm solution as previously stressed inverse modeling optimizes the minimum error between the observed and the numerically simulated btcs it is a classic method for estimating model parameters of the tsm otis p runkel 1998 the otis parameter estimator is the most widely used parameter estimation method due to its efficiency however it easily returns local optimum solutions this negatively affects the parameter reliability hence we adopted the parameter estimation framework established by noh et al 2021 2019 this framework employed a meta heuristic optimization technique shuffled complex self adaptive hybrid evolution sc sahel naeini et al 2018 the framework includes a mesh independence test to avoid numerical dispersion as the grid size and time step in the numerical simulation influence the resulting parameter values in the numerical computation of the optimization wallis and manson 2019 5 validation of regressive prediction method in most cases of contaminant spill accidents in the unmeasured reaches of a river the hydraulic and dispersion properties of the river along which the contaminant is likely to propagate are difficult to obtain due to the unpredictability of such accidents in other words in most cases the model parameters for the ade and tsm are unknown thus in this study we checked the applicability of the new method rp by evaluating its performance along with conventional methods ade and tsm in cases where the model parameters were pre calibrated using the tracer data available from measured reaches however the models were applied to predict btc changes along unmeasured reaches we set up a scenario as follows in all tracer tests conducted in this study we assumed that the btcs at the farthest stations from the injection were unmeasured thus using the btcs measured at the remaining stations we predicted those at the last station with three different methods ade tsm and rp table 4 and fig 9 summarize the calibration cases and table 5 summarizes the resulting calibrated parameters corresponding to each case the optimal values of d l and d lf showed different values because only the d l of the ade is responsible for the temporal variance change of the curve whereas the d lf a s and α of the tsm contribute to the dispersion processes resulting in higher values of d l than those of d lf however when a s or α is small which can be interpreted as representing fickian transport without significant contribution from storage processes d l and d lf could have similar values see m1 and m3 of test b and m1 of test d likewise the relatively high a s values of m1 of tests b and d relative to the neighboring values arise from the corresponding α values which were nearly zero and the tracer cloud separation along these reach cases can be reproduced using gaussian approximation fig 10 shows a comparison of the prediction results at the unmeasured points due to the limiting condition in the prediction without knowing any information of the unmeasured reaches the results cannot be accurately fitted to the observation in particular the simulation results from the ade and tsm show worsening peak concentration accuracies in the order of tests c d b and a the coefficient of determination r2 for the predictions decreases as the reach length increases this is because the model parameters calibrated through the measured reaches cannot accurately represent the mixing characteristics of the unmeasured reaches i e s3 s4 for tests a c and d and s4 s5 for test b this discrepancy intensifies as the tracer propagates over longer distances as a result the predictions for test c with the ade and tsm yield the poorest accuracy as shown in fig 10 in this context the application of the calibrated ade or tsm is inappropriate for predicting the btc for the unmeasured reach especially for long distance predictions as shown in fig 11 the rp yields a better r2 than the ade and tsm simulations in for tests a c and d the lower r2 in test b is likely to have led to the poor regression accuracy as shown in table 4 even so fig 10b shows that the rp result still has acceptable accuracy for example while it presents poor fitness in the falling limb causing low r2 its peak concentration is more accurate than those of ade and tsm for the prediction for test c of the longest distance the accuracies of ade and tsm are very low relative to the rp although the r2 values from the ade and tsm simulations indicate failures in prediction that from the rp indicates relative superiority for long distance btc predictions in contrast to physics or phenomenon based models the rp lacks sophistication in generating btcs it cannot be utilized for physical or statistical interpretations of btcs such as for the tailing effect however given its performance in long distance prediction for the unmeasured reach and low nearly zero computational cost the rp can be advantageous for the prediction of contaminant cloud propagation as it allows for swift action to be taken in response to contaminant spill accidents 6 conclusions in this study we investigated how btcs of a tracer change along rivers and proposed an alternative regressive method for predicting the btcs at unmeasured downstream sections four key conclusions were made first the denoising performance can be improved by configuring the transition steepness of the frfs in this respect it was demonstrated that the butterworth filter exhibited better performance for high frequency noise reduction than gaussian filter under the same distortion condition in other words the butterworth filter distorts the primary information less than the gaussian filter at the same level of denoising even with the minimum window size the moving average and median filter approaches violate the acceptable distortion condition indicating that they can easily distort the primary information of the original data second through a correlation analysis it was revealed that the significant features of the btc are correlated more strongly with the reach length than with the measured flow properties this can be discussed in two ways the averages of the directly measured flow variables may not represent their reach averages or the reach length has a greater effect on the change in tracer concentration than the measured flow variables both can demonstrate the validity of predicting btc variation using only the reach length third based on the second conclusion a regression analysis was performed according to btc variations and the flow distance although it was difficult to find clear and globally representative regression equations for all tracer test cases well fitted regression equations were found for the data from case to case in particular data from gam creek demonstrated the validity of this regressive approach with features showing r2 values of over 0 9 in the regression equations likewise the results from test a also show a clear linear relationship between the peak and front travel times of the tracer cloud and reach length however the results from test b yield relatively low regression accuracy suggesting that this reach is subject to effects other than the reach length due to the complexity of the testbed in particular we attribute this result to the influences of a highly braided flow structure as shown in fig 3a and submerged structures in test b these are different from the other testbeds fourth based on the conclusions regarding the high regression accuracy the rp was used to predict btcs across unmeasured reaches the rp with only four regression equations for peak concentration arrival time to peak concentration front arrival time and duration above 50 of peak concentration produces comparable or superior accuracies of the results to the ade and tsm the proposed model provide reasonable results for long distance prediction whereas the ade and tsm show significantly low accuracy therefore considering its relative accuracy and computational cost the rp can be an efficient alternative for predicting the btcs of unmeasured river reaches so as to provide swift action in response to contaminant spill accidents in the fluvial systems this study demonstrated the advantages of the new approach in predicting btc variations relative to the conventional ade and tsm methods we expect poor rp accuracy in rivers with irregular and heterogeneous flow conditions this is because such variability along the river reach alters the relationship between the btc change and travel distance in other words if there are drastic differences in channel geometries and flow conditions such as in the velocity cross sectional area material properties and storage zone shapes along the reaches the regression equations will have different regression coefficients reach by reach even in the same river that is the rp can be applicable in a channel where the flow dynamics is longitudinally homogeneous to some extent future studies with an expansion of the study cases and sensitivity analysis would enhance the reliability of the rp application credit author statement byunguk kim conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft visualization siyoon kwon
