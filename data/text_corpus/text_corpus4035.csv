20175,unbonded flexible risers are widely applied in the field of ocean engineering due to their unique mechanical properties and composite materials have been introduced to reduce riser s weight in this paper the behavior of a typical 2 5 inch 8 layer unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers under coupling axisymmetric loads and bending moment is studied by theoretical and numerical methods firstly considered the material and geometric properties the bending model of composite armor layers is present according to its slipping stages and a mathematical model that explains the effect of axisymmetric loads on the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser is proposed then a numerical model with detailed geometric properties of unbonded flexible riser is established within abaqus software after verified through experimental results by witz 1996 the bending behavior and hysteresis phenomenon of the unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is conducted furthermore several characteristics related to the bending properties including external and internal pressures axial tension friction coefficient are discussed and the axial and radial stress of composite tendon at different angle location is also present the comparison results show that the effective tension would enhance the ability of unbonded flexible risers to resist bending moment keywords unbonded flexible riser composite armor layer orthotropy bending stiffness hysteresis behavior characteristics analysis 1 introduction recent years with the development of ocean engineering stepping into ultra deep waters higher requirements are put forward on the offshore engineering equipments the unbonded flexible risers have been widely applied to transport oil and gas resources from sea bed to the offshore platform due to its advantages like large axial stiffness small bending stiffness easy installation corrosion resistance and recyclability and its unique geometric properties contribute to complicated mechanical properties which has been a hot research issue especially for its nonlinear bending property with the advancement of technology composite materials are gradually introduced into the production of unbonded flexible riser to replace the original steel tensile armor layers for their merits such as light weight high strength corrosion resistance and low installation cost however there are still limited studies on the characteristics of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers an unbonded flexible riser typically consists of multiple layers with different geometric properties see fig 1 and the special configuration makes the riser has great axial tensile stiffness as well as low full slipping bending stiffness which can undergo large bending deformation tensile armor layers play significant part in riser s cross sectional properties and the application of the composite material can effectively reduce the overall gravity of the riser thereby expanding the working depth of the unbonded flexible riser some institutions rytter 2004 lambert et al 2012 kalman et al 2012 have made some attempts of composite armor layers and fig 2 a b are the sketch of an unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers by different pipe manufacturers since there is no bond between component layers of unbonded flexible riser the adjacent layers can be separated and slip freely under external loads especially when subjected to bending moment the tensile armor layers can overcome friction and slip along its axial direction resulting in the nonlinear bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser based on the mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser analytical numerical and experimental methods are used to study the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser recent years the bending characteristic of helical structure is the key to solving the bending issue of unbonded flexible riser and regarding the slippage of helical layers an understanding of theoretical model from simple to complex has been experienced early analytical studies mainly force on the non slipping and full slipping stage and neglect the partial slipping stage of helical layers for instance lanteigne 1985 present the axial deformation of helical tendon based on catenary theory but he didnot further give the bending moment curvature relationship of helical layer féret and bournazel 1987 first present the bending moment curvature hysteresis curve of unbonded flexible riser but they neglected the partial slipping stage witz and tan 1992 proposed to consider the bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser in layers and summarized the component layers as helical and cylindrical layers based on the geometric relationship but they also did not reasonably consider the partial slipping phase afterwards scholars have given the bending moment curvature expression of partial slipping stage and taken into account the effect of local bending and torsion of helical tendon kebadze and kraincanic 1999 2000 2001 defined the bending process of unbonded flexible riser as non slipping partial slipping and full slipping stages and present the calculation formulas of critical bending curvature and partial slipping bending stiffness based on kebadze and kraincanic s model dong et al 2013 recalculated the effect of local curvature and torsion of the helical wires under bending moment and derived the explicit expression of the bending stiffness in the partial slipping state based on general finite element software the numerical methods have seen the development from simplified numerical models to numerical models with detailed geometric properties the carcass layer and pressure armor layer in unbonded flexible riser have both high laying angle and complex cross sectional shape which is difficult to model the actual geometry thus these two layers are usually simplified to the orthotropic cylindrical shell element for simulation see bahtui 2008 wang and chen 2011 sousa et al 2012 vaz and rizzo 2011 however ren et al 2014 2016 established a 3 dimensional numerical model of 8 layer unbonded flexible riser based on actual cross sectional shape of carcass layer and pressure armor layer which can effectively calculate the mechanical properties of riser under arbitrary loads and boundary conditions then zhang et al 2015 simplified the carcass layer and pressure armor layer as regular helical model and studied the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser there are also some experimental studies witz 1996 present an experiment of unbonded flexible riser under cycling bending moment in which detailed geometric properties and test loading process were present and pointed the hysteresis behavior some flexible pipe manufacturers such as wsllstream international ltd and technip also provided some tests of unbonded flexible riser under bending moment zhang et al 2008 tan et al 2009 péronne et al 2015 but the experimental data obtained and published is very limited and typically no detailed riser parameters are available since the experimental method are usually expensive and require specialized test equipment theoretical and numerical methods are common methods for analyzing the cross sectional mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser the cross sectional properties of unbonded flexible riser are acquired during the riser s design phase before practical application among whom the bending hysteresis is a significant feature of unbonded flexible riser which can ensure the large deflection of unbonded flexible riser regardless of theoretical numerical or experimental method when studying the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser segment there is always initial pre stress between adjacent layers which is typically given by applying axisymmetric loads external pressure acting on the outmost layer of unbonded flexible riser for instance kraincanic and kebadze 2001 zhang et al 2008 2015 thus in most cases the model of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads which can predict interlayer s contact pressure and critical curvature for bending analysis is the basis of the model of unbonded flexible riser under bending moment besides some scholars have proved the effect of axisymmetric loads on the bending performance of unbonded flexible riser by experimental or numerical methods e g zhang et al 2008 proposed a concept of effective bending stiffness for unbonded flexible riser which accounted for the effect of internal external pressure and axial tension on bending properties of unbonded flexible riser but they did not present an exact expression ren 2015 studied the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible risers under different external pressure and found changes in bending stiffness but he did not give an explanation in the paper however existing theoretical models typically neglect the effect of axisymmetric load after applying bending moment on unbonded flexible riser model contributing to the difference from numerical and test results in addition to proposing a mathematical model to explain the effect of axisymmetric load on the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser a time consuming numerical method taking into account detailed geometric properties of unbonded flexible riser is also used for comparison and verification and a series of loading cases are conducted in this paper to explore the factors affecting the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser based on a typical 8 layer 2 5 inch unbonded flexible riser model with high modulus carbon fibre composite armor layers several related factors on bending characteristics are discussed on the basis of same axial tensile stiffness with unbonded flexible riser model with steel tensile armor layers this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the corresponding theoretical formulations in this paper are introduced the analytical model of composite armor layer is derived by functional principle in consideration of the material properties of composite material and the coupling effect of external internal pressures and bending moment is also derived in section 3 based on abaqus software the details of numerical method in consideration of the geometric properties of unbonded flexible riser and the characteristics of composite material is present and the effectiveness of proposed models is verified though experimental results by witz 1996 in section 4 based on the equivalent axial tensile stiffness with the original unbonded flexible riser model the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers and the corresponding hysteresis effect is studied in section 5 several characteristics in term of contact pressure between adjacent layers and bending properties of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers including external and internal pressures axial tension friction coefficient are further investigated in section 6 the mechanical properties of composite armor layers are compared with steel tensile armor layers in section 7 the axial and radial stress of helical tendon under complex loads is present 2 theoretical formulations for analytical model the bending stiffness of an unbonded flexible riser is considered to be the sum of the bending stiffness of all constituent layers for cylindrical layers the relationship between bending moment and curvature can be calculated by m e i κ where m is the bending moment ei is the bending stiffness κ is the bending curvature while for helical wires the bending process can be divided into three states according to the contact pressure between adjacent layers and the critical bending curvature in consideration of the properties of composite material this paper provides an analytical model of composite armor layer under coupling axisymmetric loads and bending moment several assumptions are also made in this paper 1 the static and dynamic friction coefficients are assumed to be equal 2 tendon can only slide along its axial direction 3 the interlayer contact pressure is only assumed to be caused axisymmetric loads and the contact pressure caused by external bending moment is neglected 4 the effect of the bending stiffener is also neglected in this paper i e the researched segment is far from the top end region of unbonded flexible riser 5 all material are homogeneous and in their linear state 2 1 calculation of composite elastic constants the composite material consists of matrix and reinforced fibre and the macroscopic mechanical properties can be regarded as the average performance of the two constituent materials based on equivalent stress assumption the related elastic constants can be calculated jones 2014 bai et al 2014 2015 liu et al 2020 2 2 analytical model subjected to axisymmetric loads the overall forced and deformation sketch of unbonded flexible riser under complex loads is illustrated in fig 3 assuming that the complex loads acting on unbonded flexible riser model can be decoupled first the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads can then be analyzed resulting in the interlayer s contact pressure which can further derive the critical curvature of helical layers for helical layers the axisymmetric loads can be divided into the axial force f torsion t about the axial direction of tensile armor layer stand for internal pressure and external pressure p i p o lanteigne 1985 kebadze 2000 ren et al 2014 then taking the axial and radial deformations of tensile armor layers into account kebadze 2000 and the relationship between strain and displacement can be present féret and bournazel 1987 kebadze 2000 ramos et al 2014 ramos and kawano 2015 finally according to the functional principle and the material properties of composite the final equilibrium equation of the composite armor layer under axisymmetric loads yields liu et al 2020 the derivation of the other layers balance equations can refer to scholars such as kebadze 2000 ren et al 2014 and ramos and kawano 2015 et al apart from balance equations the geometric relationship between adjacent layers should also be included to solve all the unknowns 1 r m j δ r j t j δ t j 2 r m j 1 δ r j 1 t j 1 δ t j 1 2 j 1 m 1 where j stands for the layer number and m is the total number of layers r m is the average radius of layer t is the layer thickness 2 3 analytical model subjected to bending moment the analytical model of the tensile armor layer under bending moment can be divided into three phases non slipping phase partial slipping phase and full slipping phase according to the contact pressure between adjacent layers and critical bending curvature in the non slipping phase assuming that the tendons still obey plane assumption the axial strain of tendon ε a can be defined by kebadze 2000 kebadze and kraincanic 1999 2001 dong et al 2013 2 ε a r m cos 2 α sin θ κ where κ is the curvature α stands for the laying angle of helical tendon θ is a position dependent angle of tendon as shown in fig 4 which can be expressed as the sum of the angle of spatial geometry and the angle of the sectional geometry 3 θ θ j 1 θ j 2 2 π j n z tan α r m where z is the distance from the end point according to the functional principle kebadze 2000 and in consideration of the material direction of composite the bending moment curvature and bending stiffness of composite armor layer in the non slipping phase can be obtained 4 m n e 1 a r m 2 cos 3 α κ 2 e i n s n e 1 a r m 2 cos 3 α 2 where e 1 is the axial young s modulus of composite tendon the critical curvature related to friction can be expressed by 5 κ c r p i μ i p o μ o e 1 t sin α cos 2 α cos θ where μ i μ o are the friction coefficient of the inner and outer surface respectively as the tendon begins to overcome the friction i e when the critical curvature of tendon meats its minimum value the slipping occurs and the minimum curvature κ c r min with the corresponding angle θ 0 π 2 π can be expressed by 6 κ c r min p i μ i p o μ o e 1 t sin α cos 2 α in the partial slipping phase it is assumed that the tendon on one side is in a slipping state and on the other side has not slipped by static equilibrium the curvature can be given by 7 κ c r κ c r min θ sin θ when θ π 2 3 π 2 5 π 2 the curvature can reach its maximum value π κ c r min 2 then the bending stiffness in the partial slipping state can be given by 8 m 4 e i n s κ c r m i n sin θ c r θ c

κ when κ π κ c r min 2 the tendons go into the full slipping state and the strain of tendon is determined by friction thus bending stiffness in this state is zero and the corresponding relationship of moment curvature describes 9 m 4 e i n s κ c r m i n π the effect of local bending and torsion is also considered in the theoretical model when no deformation occurs the torsion τ and curvature about the bi normal direction κ b are calculated by the following formula kebadze 2000 dong et al 2013 10 τ sin α cos α r m κ b sin 2 α r m κ n 0 the corresponding increments of torsion and curvature in the normal and bi normal direction are given by dong et al 2013 11 δ τ sin α cos 3 α sin θ a κ δ κ b cos 4 α sin θ a κ δ κ n 1 sin 2 α cos α cos θ a κ where κ n is the curvature about the normal direction in consideration of the symmetry and material direction of the tendon the internal energy generated by local bending and torsion can be described by 12 u n l π cos α 0 π 2 e 1 i n δ κ n 2 e 1 i b δ κ b 2 g 12 j δ τ 2 d θ where i n i b are the inertia moment about normal and bi normal direction respectively also according to the functional principle 13 u κ w κ m b t l κ κ therefore yielding the bending curvature moment relationship under local bending and torsion of tendon 14 m b t n κ 2 e 1 i n 1 sin 2 α cos α e 1 i b cos 7 α g 12 j sin 2 α cos 5 α e i b t n 2 e 1 i n 1 sin 2 α cos α e 1 i b cos 7 α g 12 j sin 2 α cos 5 α finally by adding eq 14 to eqs 4 8 and 9 the bending stiffness of the tensile armor layers subjected to bending moment can be obtained thus the bending characteristics of the unbonded flexible riser can be obtained by combined consideration of the bending moment bending curvature relationship of the cylindrical layers and the helical layers 2 4 effect of internal external pressure on curved layer taking the external pressure for example for a cylindrical layer a small incremental area da o as illustrated in fig 5 where the external pressure acts can be expressed by 15 d a o r o r r o cos ϕ d ϕ d β where ϕ is the angle around the circumference of the layer β is the angle of a position on the layer surface from center of curvature in consideration of cases in this paper by neglecting the effect of internal and external fluid and assuming that the pressure is consistent throughout the layer the differential force on the area can be defined by d f o c p o d a o where the superscript c represents cylindrical layer according to chakrabarti and frampton 1982 and seyed and patel 1992 the component of the force in each direction can be given by 16 d f x o c d f o cos ϕ cos β d f f y o c d f o cos ϕ sin β d f f z o c d f o sin ϕ and the total force in each direction yield by integrating df o with respect to ϕ and β 17 f x o c β θ d β 2 β θ d β 2 ϕ 0

center of element from center of curvature a o π r o 2 is the outer cross sectional area of the layer according to a similar derivation method the effect of the internal pressure can be expressed by 18 f x i c β θ d β 2 β θ d β 2 ϕ 0 ϕ 2 π d f f x i c 2 a i p i sin d θ 2 cos θ f f y i c β θ d β 2 β θ d β 2 ϕ 0 ϕ 2 π d f f y i c 2 a i p i sin d θ 2 sin θ f f z i c β θ d β 2 β θ d β 2 ϕ 0 ϕ 2 π d f f z i c 0 where a i π r i 2 is the inner cross sectional area of the layer assuming that the length of the segment is sufficiently small the following simplification can be obtained 19 sin d θ 2 d θ 2 comprehensive consideration of the effect of internal and external pressures the force in each direction can be given by plusing eqs 17 and 18 20 f x c a o p o a i p i cos θ d θ f f y c a o p o a i p i sin θ d θ f f z c 0 for the cases in this paper assuming that the layer presents the same curvature along the riser length a cartesian coordinate system is established with the center of the riser model see fig 6 for an unbonded flexible riser model with two end points at the cross sectional area the dash line in fig 6 represents the original position and the solid line stands for the present configuration assuming that the length of the riser is l and in consideration the symmetry of riser model the final bending moment due to external and internal pressure can be given by 21 m p c l 2 0 d m p c 0 l 2 d m p c l κ 2 0 r f x p c r cos l κ 2 rcos θ f y p c r sin θ d θ 0 l κ 2 r f x p c r cos l κ 2 rcos θ f y p c r sin θ sin l κ 2 d θ a o p o a i p i κ 2 2 sin l κ 2 sin l κ where r 1 κ is the curvature radius for helical layer assuming that the tendons are evenly distributed with equal spacing according to eq 15 the corresponding infinitesimal element area where the external pressure acting on can be expressed by 22 d a o n b 2 π cos α r r o cos ϕ d ϕ d β where n is the number of tensons b is the cross sectional width of tendon α is the laying angle of tendon the bending moment due to external and internal pressure can be derived by a similar way thus the corresponding force in each directions can be expressed by 23 f x h n b p o n b p i cos α cos θ d θ f f y h n b p i n b p

κ in summary the effect of internal external pressure on the bending characteristics when the unbonded flexible riser model is complicated loaded can be concluded 2 5 theoretical solution method for unbonded flexible riser under coupling loads to analyze the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under coupling bending moment and external internal pressures the riser is assumed to have an initial state with straight central line see fig 7 a then the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under external internal pressures acting on the corresponding surface is studied by the proposed theoretical method and the corresponding contact pressure is calculated see fig 7 b afterwards the critical bending curvature of helical layers can be obtained through the contact pressure between adjacent layers additionally the external bending moment is applied on the two cross sectional ends of unbonded flexible riser see fig 7 c and the component effect due to external internal pressures is also added besides the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under combined loads is conducted by three states according to the slipping state of tensile armor layer finally fig 8 presents the solution flowchart of unbonded flexible riser under coupling bending moment and pressure 3 numerical simulation model witz 1996 present an experiment of an 8 layer 2 5 inch unbonded flexible riser model with detailed structural properties boundary conditions and experimental measurements which is discussed as the researched model in this paper the geometric and material properties of the riser are shown in table 1 and the 3 dimensional finite element model present in fig 9 is established within abaqus software which takes full consideration of geometrical characteristics and the sketch of non uniform cross sectional geometry of the two helical wires of carcass layer and pressure armor layer is also present in fig 9 together with introduction of the details of numerical model an experimental case and the corresponding theoretical model are also present in this section for contrastive reason and the bending behavior of the original unbonded flexible riser with steel tensile armor layers is studied 3 1 methodology to avoid the effect of boundary condition the numerical model needs to have sufficient length bahtui 2008 according to the recommendation of pipe manufacturers the length of the numerical model is typically modeled twice the tensile armor pitches bahtui 2008 which 1 0 m in this paper to simulate the complex interlayer s contact and friction all eight layers are meshed into 8 node linear brick elements with incompatible modes c3d8i element in the abaqus software two reference points rp1 and rp2 see fig 9 are set at the geometric center of both cross sectional ends and all the cross sectional end points are kinematic bounded rigidly onto the two points two local cylindrical coordinate systems with additional rotation agreed with the laying angle of tensile armor layers are established within the corresponding part thus the material orientation of composite can be defined the settings of boundary condition also play significant part in the simulation of bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser for top end point rp1 all degree of freedoms are limited except the axial direction and the rotational degree about x axis see fig 9 for the bottom end of rp2 only the rotational degree of freedom about x axis see fig 9 is freed the explicit solution method is applied to avoid non convergence due to the complex contact and high geometric non linearity within the numerical model as the inertial effect must be taken into consideration when applied explicit algorithm the ratio of kinetic energy allke to internal energy allie must be kept under 5 ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and the inertial effect can be reduced by increasing simulation time and applying a smooth step loading method the general contact algorithm is applied to capture the complex contact within the unbonded flexible riser model including contact between adjacent layers and possible contact within self locked helical layers meanwhile the tangential behavior due to contact is calculated by coulomb friction model and the friction coefficient is set to 0 1 sævik and berge 1995 ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 to speed up the calculating time due to the increasing simulation time a target time increment is scaled and a minimum time increment of 5 10 7 s has been proved to be efficient by ensuring the stability of explicit analysis while improving the computational efficiency 3 2 model verification based on witz s experiment the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser is discussed in this section since there is always initial contact pressure between adjacent layers due to the manufacturing process kraincanic and kebadze 2001 zhang et al 2015 thus a sufficiently small initial pressure 0 2 mpa is applied to the outermost layer outer surface of outer sheath layer first before applying bending moment on the two reference points for the numerical results the kinetic energy has been proved small enough to maintain the calculation accuracy under 5 compared to the internal energy fig 10 presents the bending moment bending curvature curves of different methods from fig 10 all the experimental data numerical and analytical results show highly nonlinear due to the slipping phenomenon of tensile armor layers among which the numerical results in consideration of detailed complex contact between adjacent layers present obvious three stages under bending moment red line in fig 10 for the numerical method when the bending moment is small the curvature increase smoothly and as the bending moment increases larger the curve shows a certain instability which is contributed by the non uniform displacement of helical layers and complex contact two theoretical models are present in this section the settings of the first theoretical model dash blue line in fig 10 are consistent with the experiment i e neglecting the initial contact pressure between layers thus resulting in the freely sliding of the tendons and the corresponding bending stiffness of the first analytical model equals to the full slipping stiffness of unbonded flexible riser then by setting an initial contact pressure consistent with numerical model solid blue line in fig 10 the second theoretical model is established which shows proper agreement with the experimental and numerical data the corresponding full slipping bending stiffness can be found in table 2 where the theoretical result shows good agreement with the numerical result 3 40 relative deviation the relevant bending stiffness shows the positive effect of external pressure on resisting bending moment indirectly reflecting the true full slipping bending stiffness of the unbonded flexible riser model by numerical method is close to that calculated by the theoretical method when without external pressure while for the experimental results there is no obvious partial slipping stage since the curvature interval of the test results is great and the overall average bending stiffness is closer to the full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser and from fig 10 there is still a big difference for the critical bending curvatures calculated by the proposed theoretical and numerical methods since the contact pressure between adjacent layers due to the bending moment is neglected in the theoretical method but for the full slipping state of unbonded flexible riser the contact pressure is no longer a significant factor in determining the bending behavior resulting in the same increasing trend for both methods 3 3 comparison of calculating efficiency between analytical and numerical methods to be pointed out that compared with the numerical method the proposed theoretical method has higher computational efficiency and can obtain the proper calculation results with the numerical and experimental method since the numerical method in this paper is carried out on a workstation with 48 cores the loading time of 1 8 s for a single loading case would cost about 72 h cpu time while the analytical calculation method in this paper is programmed by matlab software and the corresponding calculation time is only about 15 s for one loading case 4 bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers the tensile armor layers of the original model are replaced by composite material composed of high modulus carbon fibre and epoxy resin carbon fibre is one of the most widely used reinforced materials of composite materials for its advantages like low density excellent mechanical properties simple processing and low cost based on liu et al 2020 the high modulus carbon fibre is chosen as the objective reinforced material in this paper for its highest strength among the three types of carbon fibre and greater stiffness of composite can be obtained at a smaller fibre proportion composite material exhibits different mechanical properties with different fibre proportions which would contribute to different mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser is a primary mechanical property since the riser needs to have sufficient axial stiffness to ensure long term operation under the combined effect of pipe weight and complex marine environmental loads thus this section first calculates the fibre proportion of the composite armor layer model when achieving the axial tensile stiffness of the original riser model with steel tensile armor layers then the corresponding bending response of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is discussed finally bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser under cycling bending moment is conducted and the corresponding hysteresis effect is conducted 4 1 composite armor layer model of equivalent axial tensile stiffness based on the theoretical model of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads the fibre proportion of composite armor layer when achieving the axial tensile stiffness of the original riser model can be obtained then the theoretical result is verified through the proposed numerical method and the corresponding results can be found in table 3 the analytical and numerical results of the composite armor layers model are in good agreement with the original unbonded flexible riser model proving that the replaced model can better maintain the axial tensile stiffness noting that there would be crack damage residual stress and initial defect in the composite material and also the fibre distribution cannot be strictly distributed in the axial direction of composite armor layers thus the actual fibre proportion to achieve the ideal axial tensile stiffness should be slightly greater than the fibre proportion calculated in this paper 4 2 bending behavior of composite armor layer model under bending moment as mentioned the bending response of the composite armor layer model is conducted based on the equivalent axial tensile stiffness of the original riser model also an initial external pressure of 0 2 mpa is applied on the outermost layer of theoretical and numerical model and the corresponding bending moment curvature relationship is present in fig 11 by neglecting the instability of numerical method the full slipping bending stiffness of the two proposed methods shows good agreement both analytical and numerical curve illustrate three obvious stages but the macroscopic overlook of the partial slipping bending stage for the analytical curve shows less apparently due to neglecting the contact pressure by bending moment unlike the theoretical method a wider range of the partial slipping phase is present for the numerical method also reflecting the effect of increasing contact pressure due to bending moment and the critical bending curvature by the analytical method is also much smaller than that by the numerical method table 4 presents the corresponding full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers by different methods noting that the magnitude of full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser is far less than the axial tensile stiffness table 3 ensuing that the riser can undergo large bending deformation while having enough axial tensile stiffness compared with the original steel tensile armor layer model table 2 the full slipping bending stiffness is slightly smaller for numerical method under the same initial external pressure causing the elastic modulus of the composite armor layers in the circumferential and thickness directions is much smaller than that of the original steel armor layer thus the circumferential and thickness deformations become larger under coupling effect of initial contact pressure and bending moment resulting in more complicated contact between adjacent layers and making the full slipping bending stiffness smaller than the original model and the theoretical method ignores the circumferential deformation of the composite tensile armor layer resulting in a relatively small deviation between the two different models meanwhile for the analytical method the riser is assumed to present the same bending curvature along the length of riser model on the other hand for the numerical method the bending curvature is only valid at the two coupling ends of rp1 and rp2 which also contributes the relative deviation between theoretical and numerical results however the theoretical method can maintain proper full slipping bending stiffness and proper behavior trends under coupling loads with high calculating efficiency also the external pressure has positive effect on the bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser model then by neglecting the effect of external pressure the bending moment curvature curves are illustrated in fig 12 and the corresponding bending stiffness is calculated in table 4 and by neglecting the instability of numerical results the bending moment curvature curves of both methods directly enter full slipping stages the analytical bending stiffness is a little greater 8 11 than the numerical bending stiffness 4 3 hysteresis effect of unbonded flexible riser under cycling bending moment the hysteresis effect of unbonded flexible riser has always been a research hotspot and difficulty in academic and industrial fields in this paper the bending response of the unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers under cycling bending moment is also studied by the proposed two methods and the corresponding hysteresis properties are discussed according to section 4 2 initial axisymmetric loads must be applied first for hysteresis phenomenon then a bending moment of 5 4 cycles is applied the initial external pressure is 1 5 mpa in this section and the bending moment is finally returned to the first loading peak additionally coulomb friction model is applied for both methods the corresponding bending moment curvature curve is present in fig 13 and the unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers exhibits notable non slipping oa segment partial slipping ab segment and full slipping phases during the whole loading cycle the mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser show hysteresis effect close to parallelogram according to the coulomb friction model the helical layer has to overcome twice static friction force when the bending moment is loaded in reverse which is clearly present in the analytical results though there is difference between numerical and analytical results since the bending moment when enter full slipping stage predicted by theoretical method is larger the full slipping bending stiffness shows good agreement also the numerical results show some instability especially for the zone with the smallest bending moment where large bending deformation rate of the riser model occurred at the end of loading the curvature of the unbonded flexible riser finally returns to the value of first peak 5 characteristics study unbonded flexible risers are always exposed to marine environment and support the effect of internal and external fluid which would exert internal and external pressure on the unbonded flexible riser and influence the contact pressure between adjacent layers indirectly affecting the bending properties of riser thus based on the equivalent axial tensile stiffness of original unbonded flexible riser model with steel tensile armor layers the effect of external and internal pressures on the unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers are discussed according to the proposed analytical and numerical methods in this section additionally axial tension also can contribute to the contact pressure between adjacent layers and the corresponding effect is studies in this section meanwhile the friction coefficient would directly influence the interlayer friction between adjacent layers and further affect the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser which would be also analyzed in this section 5 1 effect of external pressure unbonded flexible risers are always exposed to the marine environment during operation and are inevitably subjected to external pressure by acting an initial external pressure from 0 5 to 2 mpa with 0 5 mpa spacing on the outermost layer of unbonded flexible riser the bending response of the riser with composite armor layers is studied also the friction coefficient is 0 1 in this section fig 14 presents the bending moment curvature curves by theoretical and numerical methods under different external pressures all the numerical loading cases show some instability due to the complex geometric contact and as the interlayer s friction increases when the external pressure is getting larger the critical bending curvature has an in conspicuous uptrend since partial contact pressure between adjacent layers is also attributed by the bending moment while for the theoretical results the contact pressure between adjacent layers is only calculated by the external pressure and thus the critical curvature is proportional to the external pressure fig 15 shows the corresponding effective bending stiffness in full slipping stage under different external pressure and the effective bending stiffness calculated by both methods shows almost linearly increase with the increasing of external pressure the relative deviation is stable about 20 25 in the proposed loading cases additionally the effective bending stiffness is very sensitive to the external pressure which is nearly doubled as the external pressure is increased by 3 times 5 2 effect of internal pressure unbonded flexible risers are also applied to transport gas and oil resources supporting internal pressure since the innermost layer of unbonded flexible riser carcass layer is not a watertight structure the internal pressure is then acted on the inner surface of pressure sheath layer similar loading cases are set with internal pressing ranging from 0 5 to 2 mpa and also the friction coefficient is consistent with the external pressure loading cases the analytical and numerical results subjected to different internal pressures are present in fig 16 and though both methods illustrate that the full slipping bending stiffness has an obvious decrease with the increasing of internal pressure a more significant effect is present for the theoretical method the corresponding effective bending stiffness is present in fig 17 where the theoretical results have a more rapid reduction compared with the numerical ones and results by both methods exhibits near linear change since a pressure armor layer zeta layer can resist radial load and is located inside the unbonded flexible riser next to the pressure sheath therefore when the internal pressure is applied the zeta layer is assumed to support most of the internal pressure and little pressure can be transmitted to the tensile armor layer thus the bending moment relationship of numerical results which takes full consideration of geometric properties of internal layers shows less sensitivity to internal pressure than theoretical results taking the unbonded flexible riser model under 0 5 mpa internal pressure for example the pressure contours of internal layers are present in fig 18 from fig 18 a the internal sheath illustrate regular distributed pressure after loading the initial internal pressure however the tensile armor layers which mainly bears axial force hardly bear the effect of pressure especially from fig 18 c the pressure on the outer tensile armor layer is close to 0 5 3 effect of axial tension axial tension also can provide contact pressure between adjacent layers in unbonded flexible riser model by extending the concept of internal and external pressure to the concept of effective tension t e which can be expressed by sparks 1984 25 t e t w p o a o p i a i where t w stands for the true wall force by applying axial tension ranging from 10 to 50 kn with 10 kn spacing on the reference point of unbonded flexible riser model the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers are studied by the proposed analytical and numerical method and also the friction coefficient is 0 1 the bending moment curvature curves under different axial tension by analytical and numerical methods are present in fig 19 and the increasing trend of numerical results is consistent with that of analytical results according to the unbonded flexible riser model in this paper the effect of 10 kn axial tension and 1 mpa external pressure is about equivalent in terms of bending moment referred to eq 25 however as to the interlayer pressure the axial tension has no obvious effect when compared with the external pressure for the theoretical method the bending moment that enters the full slipping stage when axial tension is applied is much smaller than the case of corresponding external pressure also with a lower critical curvature taking the critical curvature of the internal tensile armor layer for example the critical curvature is 1 89 10 4 when 10 kn axial tension is applied compared with 9 90 10 4 when 1 mpa external pressure is applied by neglecting the inherent instability of the numerical method the bending stiffness of the unboned flexible riser under different axial tension is present in fig 20 which shows that the effective bending stiffness calculated by theoretical and numerical methods are proportional to the axial tension and the theoretical method has a more obvious change for the numerical method the sensitivity of the effective bending stiffness to the axial tension is between the external pressure and internal pressure for the reason that the axial tension comprehensively considers the effect of each layer of the structure contributing to weakening the effect of pressure armor layer in unbonded flexible riser 5 4 effect of friction coefficient the interlayer friction is the main cause of nonlinear bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser zhang et al 2015 kraincanic and kebadze 2001 in order to directly reflect the influence of friction on the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser the effect of different friction coefficients on the bending characteristics is discussed under the same external pressure in this section by applying an initial external pressure of 0 2 mpa the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser under different friction coefficients ranges from 0 05 to 0 20 with 0 05 spacing is present since the frictional coefficient directly affect the contact pressure under same loading the bending moment bending curvature curves are present in fig 21 based on the proposed numerical and analytical methods no significant change in effective bending stiffness is observed and bending moment curvature curves are almost parallel in the full slipping stage but the critical curvature has an obvious promotion which verifies the assumption in section 2 i e the contact pressure between adjacent layers defines the nonlinear bending properties of unbonded flexible riser fig 22 shows the corresponding critical curvatures of different friction coefficients by theoretical method and the critical curvature is proportional to the friction coefficient 6 stress of helical tendon under coupling loads the stress of a helical tendon under coupling loads can be divided into three parts stress caused by axisymmetric loads σ a stress caused by global bending moment σ g b and stress caused by partial bending and torsion effect of helical tendon σ b t wang and ji 2017 in consideration the material properties of composite the corresponding stress can be separately defined by 26 σ a 1 1 μ 12 μ 21 e 1 ε a μ 12 e 2 ε r 27 σ g b e r cos 2 α sin θ κ κ κ c r e r cos 2 α sin θ κ c r κ κ c r 28 σ b t e cos 4 α sin θ κ y e 1 sin 2 α cos α cos θ κ x where x and y represent the distance from the center of tendon cross section to both ends respectively thus fielding the stress for tendon under coupling loads 29 σ σ a σ g b σ b t according to eqs 27 and 28 the axial stress of helical tendon is not only about the spatial angle but also about the position of tendon cross section an initial external pressure 1 mpa and equivalent axial tension load according to effective tension concept are applied respectively and considering the tendon at different spatial positions θ 0 π 4 π 2 and corresponding center and endpoint positions of tendon cross section the stress variation under cyclic curvature 0 02 0 02 is present by theoretical method which is present in figs 23 and 24 from figs 23 and 24 tendon at different spatial angle has different critical curvature which increases with the angular position when subjected to axisymmetric load the initial axial stress is 2 29 mpa and 9 33 mpa respectively for external pressure and axial tension and corresponding radial stress is 1 44 mpa and 0 29 mpa and for the unbonded flexible riser model in this paper the radial stress of composite tendon is about 62 88 of the axial stress under external pressure while for composite material the failure stress for radial direction is typically much lower than that of axial direction by taking the composite in this paper as example the composite material consists of high modulus carbon fibre and epoxy resin would have a failure stress about 1100 mpa in the axial direction and about 75 mpa in the radial direction dattoma et al 2018 and under external pressure about 60 mpa the unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers would be damaged in the radial direction before the axial direction thus unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers should be alert to external pressure for causing great radial stress ability under cycling curvature the stress change rate and range at endpoint are always greater than that at center position the stress change rate at different angle positions is also different which decreases with the increase of angle position and based on the above special variation trend when the curvature is large enough the maximum axial stress would be obtained at endpoint of θ 0 see fig 24 7 conclusions the bending response of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is studied in this paper by theoretical and numerical methods firstly the theoretical model of composite armor layer under coupling axisymmetric loads and bending moment in consideration of the composite material properties is derived by function principle and the coupling effect of combined pressure and bending moment is also proposed through configuration of curved layer then based on a typical 2 5 inch 8 layer unbonded flexible riser model the corresponding numerical model in full consideration of the geometric properties and complex contact is established within the abaqus software and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by witz s experimental case secondly based on equivalent axial tensile stiffness with the original steel unbonded flexible riser model the fibre proportion of high modulus carbon fibre composite is calculated by theoretical method and verified by numerical method and then the bending behavior and hysteresis phenomenon of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is present additionally characteristics analysis related to the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser is discussed finally the axial and radial stress of composite tendon under coupling loads is discussed the results show that the bending behavior issue of unbonded flexible riser is of great complexity due to its complex contact between and within interlayers and multiple factors related to the bending behavior should be included to simulate the actual response of unbonded flexible riser and the proposed theoretical method can be a fast calculation method for casting the full slipping bending stiffness when the unbonded flexible riser is simply stressed the proposed methods in this paper can be applied to predict the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser and furthermore provide parameters for dynamic analysis and fatigue analysis of tensile armor layer some conclusions are drawn in the end of this paper 1 the nonlinear bending properties of unbounded flexible riser model are related to the axisymmetric loads which provide initial contact pressure between adjacent layers and the riser model exhibits obvious hysteresis properties under combined cycling bending moment and initial external pressure under equal axial tensile stiffness the full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is less than that of the original model with steel tensile armor layers 2 the effective tension of unbonded flexible riser affect the bending properties which exhibits reinforcing the contact pressure between adjacent layers contributing to increasing the critical bending curvature of unbonded flexible riser and the effective tension would linearly enhance the effective bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser and bending behavior of unbounded flexible riser is of great sensitive to initial external pressure but less sensitive to axial tension and internal pressure 3 the friction coefficient would increase the critical curvature under bending moment but has limited effect on the full slipping bending stiffness 4 the axial tension mainly causes the axial stress in tensile armor layer and great radial stress would be caused by external pressure and unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layer should avoid large external pressure which is recommended to arrange in shallow waters 5 when subjected to combined initial axisymmetric loads and cycling bending moment the axial stress of helical tendon presents a parallelogram change axial stress at endpoint of tendon cross section with small spatial angle has the maximum change rate which would achieve the maximum axial stress when the bending curvature of

20175,unbonded flexible risers are widely applied in the field of ocean engineering due to their unique mechanical properties and composite materials have been introduced to reduce riser s weight in this paper the behavior of a typical 2 5 inch 8 layer unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers under coupling axisymmetric loads and bending moment is studied by theoretical and numerical methods firstly considered the material and geometric properties the bending model of composite armor layers is present according to its slipping stages and a mathematical model that explains the effect of axisymmetric loads on the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser is proposed then a numerical model with detailed geometric properties of unbonded flexible riser is established within abaqus software after verified through experimental results by witz 1996 the bending behavior and hysteresis phenomenon of the unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is conducted furthermore several characteristics related to the bending properties including external and internal pressures axial tension friction coefficient are discussed and the axial and radial stress of composite tendon at different angle location is also present the comparison results show that the effective tension would enhance the ability of unbonded flexible risers to resist bending moment keywords unbonded flexible riser composite armor layer orthotropy bending stiffness hysteresis behavior characteristics analysis 1 introduction recent years with the development of ocean engineering stepping into ultra deep waters higher requirements are put forward on the offshore engineering equipments the unbonded flexible risers have been widely applied to transport oil and gas resources from sea bed to the offshore platform due to its advantages like large axial stiffness small bending stiffness easy installation corrosion resistance and recyclability and its unique geometric properties contribute to complicated mechanical properties which has been a hot research issue especially for its nonlinear bending property with the advancement of technology composite materials are gradually introduced into the production of unbonded flexible riser to replace the original steel tensile armor layers for their merits such as light weight high strength corrosion resistance and low installation cost however there are still limited studies on the characteristics of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers an unbonded flexible riser typically consists of multiple layers with different geometric properties see fig 1 and the special configuration makes the riser has great axial tensile stiffness as well as low full slipping bending stiffness which can undergo large bending deformation tensile armor layers play significant part in riser s cross sectional properties and the application of the composite material can effectively reduce the overall gravity of the riser thereby expanding the working depth of the unbonded flexible riser some institutions rytter 2004 lambert et al 2012 kalman et al 2012 have made some attempts of composite armor layers and fig 2 a b are the sketch of an unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers by different pipe manufacturers since there is no bond between component layers of unbonded flexible riser the adjacent layers can be separated and slip freely under external loads especially when subjected to bending moment the tensile armor layers can overcome friction and slip along its axial direction resulting in the nonlinear bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser based on the mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser analytical numerical and experimental methods are used to study the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser recent years the bending characteristic of helical structure is the key to solving the bending issue of unbonded flexible riser and regarding the slippage of helical layers an understanding of theoretical model from simple to complex has been experienced early analytical studies mainly force on the non slipping and full slipping stage and neglect the partial slipping stage of helical layers for instance lanteigne 1985 present the axial deformation of helical tendon based on catenary theory but he didnot further give the bending moment curvature relationship of helical layer féret and bournazel 1987 first present the bending moment curvature hysteresis curve of unbonded flexible riser but they neglected the partial slipping stage witz and tan 1992 proposed to consider the bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser in layers and summarized the component layers as helical and cylindrical layers based on the geometric relationship but they also did not reasonably consider the partial slipping phase afterwards scholars have given the bending moment curvature expression of partial slipping stage and taken into account the effect of local bending and torsion of helical tendon kebadze and kraincanic 1999 2000 2001 defined the bending process of unbonded flexible riser as non slipping partial slipping and full slipping stages and present the calculation formulas of critical bending curvature and partial slipping bending stiffness based on kebadze and kraincanic s model dong et al 2013 recalculated the effect of local curvature and torsion of the helical wires under bending moment and derived the explicit expression of the bending stiffness in the partial slipping state based on general finite element software the numerical methods have seen the development from simplified numerical models to numerical models with detailed geometric properties the carcass layer and pressure armor layer in unbonded flexible riser have both high laying angle and complex cross sectional shape which is difficult to model the actual geometry thus these two layers are usually simplified to the orthotropic cylindrical shell element for simulation see bahtui 2008 wang and chen 2011 sousa et al 2012 vaz and rizzo 2011 however ren et al 2014 2016 established a 3 dimensional numerical model of 8 layer unbonded flexible riser based on actual cross sectional shape of carcass layer and pressure armor layer which can effectively calculate the mechanical properties of riser under arbitrary loads and boundary conditions then zhang et al 2015 simplified the carcass layer and pressure armor layer as regular helical model and studied the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser there are also some experimental studies witz 1996 present an experiment of unbonded flexible riser under cycling bending moment in which detailed geometric properties and test loading process were present and pointed the hysteresis behavior some flexible pipe manufacturers such as wsllstream international ltd and technip also provided some tests of unbonded flexible riser under bending moment zhang et al 2008 tan et al 2009 péronne et al 2015 but the experimental data obtained and published is very limited and typically no detailed riser parameters are available since the experimental method are usually expensive and require specialized test equipment theoretical and numerical methods are common methods for analyzing the cross sectional mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser the cross sectional properties of unbonded flexible riser are acquired during the riser s design phase before practical application among whom the bending hysteresis is a significant feature of unbonded flexible riser which can ensure the large deflection of unbonded flexible riser regardless of theoretical numerical or experimental method when studying the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser segment there is always initial pre stress between adjacent layers which is typically given by applying axisymmetric loads external pressure acting on the outmost layer of unbonded flexible riser for instance kraincanic and kebadze 2001 zhang et al 2008 2015 thus in most cases the model of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads which can predict interlayer s contact pressure and critical curvature for bending analysis is the basis of the model of unbonded flexible riser under bending moment besides some scholars have proved the effect of axisymmetric loads on the bending performance of unbonded flexible riser by experimental or numerical methods e g zhang et al 2008 proposed a concept of effective bending stiffness for unbonded flexible riser which accounted for the effect of internal external pressure and axial tension on bending properties of unbonded flexible riser but they did not present an exact expression ren 2015 studied the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible risers under different external pressure and found changes in bending stiffness but he did not give an explanation in the paper however existing theoretical models typically neglect the effect of axisymmetric load after applying bending moment on unbonded flexible riser model contributing to the difference from numerical and test results in addition to proposing a mathematical model to explain the effect of axisymmetric load on the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser a time consuming numerical method taking into account detailed geometric properties of unbonded flexible riser is also used for comparison and verification and a series of loading cases are conducted in this paper to explore the factors affecting the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser based on a typical 8 layer 2 5 inch unbonded flexible riser model with high modulus carbon fibre composite armor layers several related factors on bending characteristics are discussed on the basis of same axial tensile stiffness with unbonded flexible riser model with steel tensile armor layers this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the corresponding theoretical formulations in this paper are introduced the analytical model of composite armor layer is derived by functional principle in consideration of the material properties of composite material and the coupling effect of external internal pressures and bending moment is also derived in section 3 based on abaqus software the details of numerical method in consideration of the geometric properties of unbonded flexible riser and the characteristics of composite material is present and the effectiveness of proposed models is verified though experimental results by witz 1996 in section 4 based on the equivalent axial tensile stiffness with the original unbonded flexible riser model the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers and the corresponding hysteresis effect is studied in section 5 several characteristics in term of contact pressure between adjacent layers and bending properties of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers including external and internal pressures axial tension friction coefficient are further investigated in section 6 the mechanical properties of composite armor layers are compared with steel tensile armor layers in section 7 the axial and radial stress of helical tendon under complex loads is present 2 theoretical formulations for analytical model the bending stiffness of an unbonded flexible riser is considered to be the sum of the bending stiffness of all constituent layers for cylindrical layers the relationship between bending moment and curvature can be calculated by m e i κ where m is the bending moment ei is the bending stiffness κ is the bending curvature while for helical wires the bending process can be divided into three states according to the contact pressure between adjacent layers and the critical bending curvature in consideration of the properties of composite material this paper provides an analytical model of composite armor layer under coupling axisymmetric loads and bending moment several assumptions are also made in this paper 1 the static and dynamic friction coefficients are assumed to be equal 2 tendon can only slide along its axial direction 3 the interlayer contact pressure is only assumed to be caused axisymmetric loads and the contact pressure caused by external bending moment is neglected 4 the effect of the bending stiffener is also neglected in this paper i e the researched segment is far from the top end region of unbonded flexible riser 5 all material are homogeneous and in their linear state 2 1 calculation of composite elastic constants the composite material consists of matrix and reinforced fibre and the macroscopic mechanical properties can be regarded as the average performance of the two constituent materials based on equivalent stress assumption the related elastic constants can be calculated jones 2014 bai et al 2014 2015 liu et al 2020 2 2 analytical model subjected to axisymmetric loads the overall forced and deformation sketch of unbonded flexible riser under complex loads is illustrated in fig 3 assuming that the complex loads acting on unbonded flexible riser model can be decoupled first the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads can then be analyzed resulting in the interlayer s contact pressure which can further derive the critical curvature of helical layers for helical layers the axisymmetric loads can be divided into the axial force f torsion t about the axial direction of tensile armor layer stand for internal pressure and external pressure p i p o lanteigne 1985 kebadze 2000 ren et al 2014 then taking the axial and radial deformations of tensile armor layers into account kebadze 2000 and the relationship between strain and displacement can be present féret and bournazel 1987 kebadze 2000 ramos et al 2014 ramos and kawano 2015 finally according to the functional principle and the material properties of composite the final equilibrium equation of the composite armor layer under axisymmetric loads yields liu et al 2020 the derivation of the other layers balance equations can refer to scholars such as kebadze 2000 ren et al 2014 and ramos and kawano 2015 et al apart from balance equations the geometric relationship between adjacent layers should also be included to solve all the unknowns 1 r m j δ r j t j δ t j 2 r m j 1 δ r j 1 t j 1 δ t j 1 2 j 1 m 1 where j stands for the layer number and m is the total number of layers r m is the average radius of layer t is the layer thickness 2 3 analytical model subjected to bending moment the analytical model of the tensile armor layer under bending moment can be divided into three phases non slipping phase partial slipping phase and full slipping phase according to the contact pressure between adjacent layers and critical bending curvature in the non slipping phase assuming that the tendons still obey plane assumption the axial strain of tendon ε a can be defined by kebadze 2000 kebadze and kraincanic 1999 2001 dong et al 2013 2 ε a r m cos 2 α sin θ κ where κ is the curvature α stands for the laying angle of helical tendon θ is a position dependent angle of tendon as shown in fig 4 which can be expressed as the sum of the angle of spatial geometry and the angle of the sectional geometry 3 θ θ j 1 θ j 2 2 π j n z tan α r m where z is the distance from the end point according to the functional principle kebadze 2000 and in consideration of the material direction of composite the bending moment curvature and bending stiffness of composite armor layer in the non slipping phase can be obtained 4 m n e 1 a r m 2 cos 3 α κ 2 e i n s n e 1 a r m 2 cos 3 α 2 where e 1 is the axial young s modulus of composite tendon the critical curvature related to friction can be expressed by 5 κ c r p i μ i p o μ o e 1 t sin α cos 2 α cos θ where μ i μ o are the friction coefficient of the inner and outer surface respectively as the tendon begins to overcome the friction i e when the critical curvature of tendon meats its minimum value the slipping occurs and the minimum curvature κ c r min with the corresponding angle θ 0 π 2 π can be expressed by 6 κ c r min p i μ i p o μ o e 1 t sin α cos 2 α in the partial slipping phase it is assumed that the tendon on one side is in a slipping state and on the other side has not slipped by static equilibrium the curvature can be given by 7 κ c r κ c r min θ sin θ when θ π 2 3 π 2 5 π 2 the curvature can reach its maximum value π κ c r min 2 then the bending stiffness in the partial slipping state can be given by 8 m 4 e i n s κ c r m i n sin θ c r θ c

κ when κ π κ c r min 2 the tendons go into the full slipping state and the strain of tendon is determined by friction thus bending stiffness in this state is zero and the corresponding relationship of moment curvature describes 9 m 4 e i n s κ c r m i n π the effect of local bending and torsion is also considered in the theoretical model when no deformation occurs the torsion τ and curvature about the bi normal direction κ b are calculated by the following formula kebadze 2000 dong et al 2013 10 τ sin α cos α r m κ b sin 2 α r m κ n 0 the corresponding increments of torsion and curvature in the normal and bi normal direction are given by dong et al 2013 11 δ τ sin α cos 3 α sin θ a κ δ κ b cos 4 α sin θ a κ δ κ n 1 sin 2 α cos α cos θ a κ where κ n is the curvature about the normal direction in consideration of the symmetry and material direction of the tendon the internal energy generated by local bending and torsion can be described by 12 u n l π cos α 0 π 2 e 1 i n δ κ n 2 e 1 i b δ κ b 2 g 12 j δ τ 2 d θ where i n i b are the inertia moment about normal and bi normal direction respectively also according to the functional principle 13 u κ w κ m b t l κ κ therefore yielding the bending curvature moment relationship under local bending and torsion of tendon 14 m b t n κ 2 e 1 i n 1 sin 2 α cos α e 1 i b cos 7 α g 12 j sin 2 α cos 5 α e i b t n 2 e 1 i n 1 sin 2 α cos α e 1 i b cos 7 α g 12 j sin 2 α cos 5 α finally by adding eq 14 to eqs 4 8 and 9 the bending stiffness of the tensile armor layers subjected to bending moment can be obtained thus the bending characteristics of the unbonded flexible riser can be obtained by combined consideration of the bending moment bending curvature relationship of the cylindrical layers and the helical layers 2 4 effect of internal external pressure on curved layer taking the external pressure for example for a cylindrical layer a small incremental area da o as illustrated in fig 5 where the external pressure acts can be expressed by 15 d a o r o r r o cos ϕ d ϕ d β where ϕ is the angle around the circumference of the layer β is the angle of a position on the layer surface from center of curvature in consideration of cases in this paper by neglecting the effect of internal and external fluid and assuming that the pressure is consistent throughout the layer the differential force on the area can be defined by d f o c p o d a o where the superscript c represents cylindrical layer according to chakrabarti and frampton 1982 and seyed and patel 1992 the component of the force in each direction can be given by 16 d f

comprehensive consideration of the effect of internal and external pressures the force in each direction can be given by plusing eqs 17 and 18 20 f x c a o p o a i p i cos θ d θ f f y c a o p o a i p

model see fig 6 for an unbonded flexible riser model with two end points at the cross sectional area the dash line in fig 6 represents the original position and the solid line stands for the present configuration assuming that the length of the riser is l and in consideration the symmetry of riser model the final bending moment due to external and internal pressure can be given by 21 m p c l 2 0

the curvature radius for helical layer assuming that the tendons are evenly distributed with equal spacing according to eq 15 the corresponding infinitesimal element area where the external pressure acting on can be expressed by 22 d a o n b 2 π cos α r r o cos ϕ d ϕ d β where n is the number of tensons b is the cross sectional width of tendon α is the laying angle of tendon the bending moment due to external and internal pressure can be derived by a similar way thus the corresponding force in each directions can be expressed by 23 f x h n b p o n b p i cos α cos θ d θ f f y h n b p i n b p

κ in summary the effect of internal external pressure on the bending characteristics when the unbonded flexible riser model is complicated loaded can be concluded 2 5 theoretical solution method for unbonded flexible riser under coupling loads to analyze the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under coupling bending moment and external internal pressures the riser is assumed to have an initial state with straight central line see fig 7 a then the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under external internal pressures acting on the corresponding surface is studied by the proposed theoretical method and the corresponding contact pressure is calculated see fig 7 b afterwards the critical bending curvature of helical layers can be obtained through the contact pressure between adjacent layers additionally the external bending moment is applied on the two cross sectional ends of unbonded flexible riser see fig 7 c and the component effect due to external internal pressures is also added besides the behavior of unbonded flexible riser under combined loads is conducted by three states according to the slipping state of tensile armor layer finally fig 8 presents the solution flowchart of unbonded flexible riser under coupling bending moment and pressure 3 numerical simulation model witz 1996 present an experiment of an 8 layer 2 5 inch unbonded flexible riser model with detailed structural properties boundary conditions and experimental measurements which is discussed as the researched model in this paper the geometric and material properties of the riser are shown in table 1 and the 3 dimensional finite element model present in fig 9 is established within abaqus software which takes full consideration of geometrical characteristics and the sketch of non uniform cross sectional geometry of the two helical wires of carcass layer and pressure armor layer is also present in fig 9 together with introduction of the details of numerical model an experimental case and the corresponding theoretical model are also present in this section for contrastive reason and the bending behavior of the original unbonded flexible riser with steel tensile armor layers is studied 3 1 methodology to avoid the effect of boundary condition the numerical model needs to have sufficient length bahtui 2008 according to the recommendation of pipe manufacturers the length of the numerical model is typically modeled twice the tensile armor pitches bahtui 2008 which 1 0 m in this paper to simulate the complex interlayer s contact and friction all eight layers are meshed into 8 node linear brick elements with incompatible modes c3d8i element in the abaqus software two reference points rp1 and rp2 see fig 9 are set at the geometric center of both cross sectional ends and all the cross sectional end points are kinematic bounded rigidly onto the two points two local cylindrical coordinate systems with additional rotation agreed with the laying angle of tensile armor layers are established within the corresponding part thus the material orientation of composite can be defined the settings of boundary condition also play significant part in the simulation of bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser for top end point rp1 all degree of freedoms are limited except the axial direction and the rotational degree about x axis see fig 9 for the bottom end of rp2 only the rotational degree of freedom about x axis see fig 9 is freed the explicit solution method is applied to avoid non convergence due to the complex contact and high geometric non linearity within the numerical model as the inertial effect must be taken into consideration when applied explicit algorithm the ratio of kinetic energy allke to internal energy allie must be kept under 5 ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and the inertial effect can be reduced by increasing simulation time and applying a smooth step loading method the general contact algorithm is applied to capture the complex contact within the unbonded flexible riser model including contact between adjacent layers and possible contact within self locked helical layers meanwhile the tangential behavior due to contact is calculated by coulomb friction model and the friction coefficient is set to 0 1 sævik and berge 1995 ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 to speed up the calculating time due to the increasing simulation time a target time increment is scaled and a minimum time increment of 5 10 7 s has been proved to be efficient by ensuring the stability of explicit analysis while improving the computational efficiency 3 2 model verification based on witz s experiment the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser is discussed in this section since there is always initial contact pressure between adjacent layers due to the manufacturing process kraincanic and kebadze 2001 zhang et al 2015 thus a sufficiently small initial pressure 0 2 mpa is applied to the outermost layer outer surface of outer sheath layer first before applying bending moment on the two reference points for the numerical results the kinetic energy has been proved small enough to maintain the calculation accuracy under 5 compared to the internal energy fig 10 presents the bending moment bending curvature curves of different methods from fig 10 all the experimental data numerical and analytical results show highly nonlinear due to the slipping phenomenon of tensile armor layers among which the numerical results in consideration of detailed complex contact between adjacent layers present obvious three stages under bending moment red line in fig 10 for the numerical method when the bending moment is small the curvature increase smoothly and as the bending moment increases larger the curve shows a certain instability which is contributed by the non uniform displacement of helical layers and complex contact two theoretical models are present in this section the settings of the first theoretical model dash blue line in fig 10 are consistent with the experiment i e neglecting the initial contact pressure between layers thus resulting in the freely sliding of the tendons and the corresponding bending stiffness of the first analytical model equals to the full slipping stiffness of unbonded flexible riser then by setting an initial contact pressure consistent with numerical model solid blue line in fig 10 the second theoretical model is established which shows proper agreement with the experimental and numerical data the corresponding full slipping bending stiffness can be found in table 2 where the theoretical result shows good agreement with the numerical result 3 40 relative deviation the relevant bending stiffness shows the positive effect of external pressure on resisting bending moment indirectly reflecting the true full slipping bending stiffness of the unbonded flexible riser model by numerical method is close to that calculated by the theoretical method when without external pressure while for the experimental results there is no obvious partial slipping stage since the curvature interval of the test results is great and the overall average bending stiffness is closer to the full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser and from fig 10 there is still a big difference for the critical bending curvatures calculated by the proposed theoretical and numerical methods since the contact pressure between adjacent layers due to the bending moment is neglected in the theoretical method but for the full slipping state of unbonded flexible riser the contact pressure is no longer a significant factor in determining the bending behavior resulting in the same increasing trend for both methods 3 3 comparison of calculating efficiency between analytical and numerical methods to be pointed out that compared with the numerical method the proposed theoretical method has higher computational efficiency and can obtain the proper calculation results with the numerical and experimental method since the numerical method in this paper is carried out on a workstation with 48 cores the loading time of 1 8 s for a single loading case would cost about 72 h cpu time while the analytical calculation method in this paper is programmed by matlab software and the corresponding calculation time is only about 15 s for one loading case 4 bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers the tensile armor layers of the original model are replaced by composite material composed of high modulus carbon fibre and epoxy resin carbon fibre is one of the most widely used reinforced materials of composite materials for its advantages like low density excellent mechanical properties simple processing and low cost based on liu et al 2020 the high modulus carbon fibre is chosen as the objective reinforced material in this paper for its highest strength among the three types of carbon fibre and greater stiffness of composite can be obtained at a smaller fibre proportion composite material exhibits different mechanical properties with different fibre proportions which would contribute to different mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser is a primary mechanical property since the riser needs to have sufficient axial stiffness to ensure long term operation under the combined effect of pipe weight and complex marine environmental loads thus this section first calculates the fibre proportion of the composite armor layer model when achieving the axial tensile stiffness of the original riser model with steel tensile armor layers then the corresponding bending response of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is discussed finally bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser under cycling bending moment is conducted and the corresponding hysteresis effect is conducted 4 1 composite armor layer model of equivalent axial tensile stiffness based on the theoretical model of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads the fibre proportion of composite armor layer when achieving the axial tensile stiffness of the original riser model can be obtained then the theoretical result is verified through the proposed numerical method and the corresponding results can be found in table 3 the analytical and numerical results of the composite armor layers model are in good agreement with the original unbonded flexible riser model proving that the replaced model can better maintain the axial tensile stiffness noting that there would be crack damage residual stress and initial defect in the composite material and also the fibre distribution cannot be strictly distributed in the axial direction of composite armor layers thus the actual fibre proportion to achieve the ideal axial tensile stiffness should be slightly greater than the fibre proportion calculated in this paper 4 2 bending behavior of composite armor layer model under bending moment as mentioned the bending response of the composite armor layer model is conducted based on the equivalent axial tensile stiffness of the original riser model also an initial external pressure of 0 2 mpa is applied on the outermost layer of theoretical and numerical model and the corresponding bending moment curvature relationship is present in fig 11 by neglecting the instability of numerical method the full slipping bending stiffness of the two proposed methods shows good agreement both analytical and numerical curve illustrate three obvious stages but the macroscopic overlook of the partial slipping bending stage for the analytical curve shows less apparently due to neglecting the contact pressure by bending moment unlike the theoretical method a wider range of the partial slipping phase is present for the numerical method also reflecting the effect of increasing contact pressure due to bending moment and the critical bending curvature by the analytical method is also much smaller than that by the numerical method table 4 presents the corresponding full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers by different methods noting that the magnitude of full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser is far less than the axial tensile stiffness table 3 ensuing that the riser can undergo large bending deformation while having enough axial tensile stiffness compared with the original steel tensile armor layer model table 2 the full slipping bending stiffness is slightly smaller for numerical method under the same initial external pressure causing the elastic modulus of the composite armor layers in the circumferential and thickness directions is much smaller than that of the original steel armor layer thus the circumferential and thickness deformations become larger under coupling effect of initial contact pressure and bending moment resulting in more complicated contact between adjacent layers and making the full slipping bending stiffness smaller than the original model and the theoretical method ignores the circumferential deformation of the composite tensile armor layer resulting in a relatively small deviation between the two different models meanwhile for the analytical method the riser is assumed to present the same bending curvature along the length of riser model on the other hand for the numerical method the bending curvature is only valid at the two coupling ends of rp1 and rp2 which also contributes the relative deviation between theoretical and numerical results however the theoretical method can maintain proper full slipping bending stiffness and proper behavior trends under coupling loads with high calculating efficiency also the external pressure has positive effect on the bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser model then by neglecting the effect of external pressure the bending moment curvature curves are illustrated in fig 12 and the corresponding bending stiffness is calculated in table 4 and by neglecting the instability of numerical results the bending moment curvature curves of both methods directly enter full slipping stages the analytical bending stiffness is a little greater 8 11 than the numerical bending stiffness 4 3 hysteresis effect of unbonded flexible riser under cycling bending moment the hysteresis effect of unbonded flexible riser has always been a research hotspot and difficulty in academic and industrial fields in this paper the bending response of the unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers under cycling bending moment is also studied by the proposed two methods and the corresponding hysteresis properties are discussed according to section 4 2 initial axisymmetric loads must be applied first for hysteresis phenomenon then a bending moment of 5 4 cycles is applied the initial external pressure is 1 5 mpa in this section and the bending moment is finally returned to the first loading peak additionally coulomb friction model is applied for both methods the corresponding bending moment curvature curve is present in fig 13 and the unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers exhibits notable non slipping oa segment partial slipping ab segment and full slipping phases during the whole loading cycle the mechanical properties of unbonded flexible riser show hysteresis effect close to parallelogram according to the coulomb friction model the helical layer has to overcome twice static friction force when the bending moment is loaded in reverse which is clearly present in the analytical results though there is difference between numerical and analytical results since the bending moment when enter full slipping stage predicted by theoretical method is larger the full slipping bending stiffness shows good agreement also the numerical results show some instability especially for the zone with the smallest bending moment where large bending deformation rate of the riser model occurred at the end of loading the curvature of the unbonded flexible riser finally returns to the value of first peak 5 characteristics study unbonded flexible risers are always exposed to marine environment and support the effect of internal and external fluid which would exert internal and external pressure on the unbonded flexible riser and influence the contact pressure between adjacent layers indirectly affecting the bending properties of riser thus based on the equivalent axial tensile stiffness of original unbonded flexible riser model with steel tensile armor layers the effect of external and internal pressures on the unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers are discussed according to the proposed analytical and numerical methods in this section additionally axial tension also can contribute to the contact pressure between adjacent layers and the corresponding effect is studies in this section meanwhile the friction coefficient would directly influence the interlayer friction between adjacent layers and further affect the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser which would be also analyzed in this section 5 1 effect of external pressure unbonded flexible risers are always exposed to the marine environment during operation and are inevitably subjected to external pressure by acting an initial external pressure from 0 5 to 2 mpa with 0 5 mpa spacing on the outermost layer of unbonded flexible riser the bending response of the riser with composite armor layers is studied also the friction coefficient is 0 1 in this section fig 14 presents the bending moment curvature curves by theoretical and numerical methods under different external pressures all the numerical loading cases show some instability due to the complex geometric contact and as the interlayer s friction increases when the external pressure is getting larger the critical bending curvature has an in conspicuous uptrend since partial contact pressure between adjacent layers is also attributed by the bending moment while for the theoretical results the contact pressure between adjacent layers is only calculated by the external pressure and thus the critical curvature is proportional to the external pressure fig 15 shows the corresponding effective bending stiffness in full slipping stage under different external pressure and the effective bending stiffness calculated by both methods shows almost linearly increase with the increasing of external pressure the relative deviation is stable about 20 25 in the proposed loading cases additionally the effective bending stiffness is very sensitive to the external pressure which is nearly doubled as the external pressure is increased by 3 times 5 2 effect of internal pressure unbonded flexible risers are also applied to transport gas and oil resources supporting internal pressure since the innermost layer of unbonded flexible riser carcass layer is not a watertight structure the internal pressure is then acted on the inner surface of pressure sheath layer similar loading cases are set with internal pressing ranging from 0 5 to 2 mpa and also the friction coefficient is consistent with the external pressure loading cases the analytical and numerical results subjected to different internal pressures are present in fig 16 and though both methods illustrate that the full slipping bending stiffness has an obvious decrease with the increasing of internal pressure a more significant effect is present for the theoretical method the corresponding effective bending stiffness is present in fig 17 where the theoretical results have a more rapid reduction compared with the numerical ones and results by both methods exhibits near linear change since a pressure armor layer zeta layer can resist radial load and is located inside the unbonded flexible riser next to the pressure sheath therefore when the internal pressure is applied the zeta layer is assumed to support most of the internal pressure and little pressure can be transmitted to the tensile armor layer thus the bending moment relationship of numerical results which takes full consideration of geometric properties of internal layers shows less sensitivity to internal pressure than theoretical results taking the unbonded flexible riser model under 0 5 mpa internal pressure for example the pressure contours of internal layers are present in fig 18 from fig 18 a the internal sheath illustrate regular distributed pressure after loading the initial internal pressure however the tensile armor layers which mainly bears axial force hardly bear the effect of pressure especially from fig 18 c the pressure on the outer tensile armor layer is close to 0 5 3 effect of axial tension axial tension also can provide contact pressure between adjacent layers in unbonded flexible riser model by extending the concept of internal and external pressure to the concept of effective tension t e which can be expressed by sparks 1984 25 t e t w p o a o p i a i where t w stands for the true wall force by applying axial tension ranging from 10 to 50 kn with 10 kn spacing on the reference point of unbonded flexible riser model the bending properties of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers are studied by the proposed analytical and numerical method and also the friction coefficient is 0 1 the bending moment curvature curves under different axial tension by analytical and numerical methods are present in fig 19 and the increasing trend of numerical results is consistent with that of analytical results according to the unbonded flexible riser model in this paper the effect of 10 kn axial tension and 1 mpa external pressure is about equivalent in terms of bending moment referred to eq 25 however as to the interlayer pressure the axial tension has no obvious effect when compared with the external pressure for the theoretical method the bending moment that enters the full slipping stage when axial tension is applied is much smaller than the case of corresponding external pressure also with a lower critical curvature taking the critical curvature of the internal tensile armor layer for example the critical curvature is 1 89 10 4 when 10 kn axial tension is applied compared with 9 90 10 4 when 1 mpa external pressure is applied by neglecting the inherent instability of the numerical method the bending stiffness of the unboned flexible riser under different axial tension is present in fig 20 which shows that the effective bending stiffness calculated by theoretical and numerical methods are proportional to the axial tension and the theoretical method has a more obvious change for the numerical method the sensitivity of the effective bending stiffness to the axial tension is between the external pressure and internal pressure for the reason that the axial tension comprehensively considers the effect of each layer of the structure contributing to weakening the effect of pressure armor layer in unbonded flexible riser 5 4 effect of friction coefficient the interlayer friction is the main cause of nonlinear bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser zhang et al 2015 kraincanic and kebadze 2001 in order to directly reflect the influence of friction on the bending characteristics of unbonded flexible riser the effect of different friction coefficients on the bending characteristics is discussed under the same external pressure in this section by applying an initial external pressure of 0 2 mpa the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser under different friction coefficients ranges from 0 05 to 0 20 with 0 05 spacing is present since the frictional coefficient directly affect the contact pressure under same loading the bending moment bending curvature curves are present in fig 21 based on the proposed numerical and analytical methods no significant change in effective bending stiffness is observed and bending moment curvature curves are almost parallel in the full slipping stage but the critical curvature has an obvious promotion which verifies the assumption in section 2 i e the contact pressure between adjacent layers defines the nonlinear bending properties of unbonded flexible riser fig 22 shows the corresponding critical curvatures of different friction coefficients by theoretical method and the critical curvature is proportional to the friction coefficient 6 stress of helical tendon under coupling loads the stress of a helical tendon under coupling loads can be divided into three parts stress caused by axisymmetric loads σ a stress caused by global bending moment σ g b and stress caused by partial bending and torsion effect of helical tendon σ b t wang and ji 2017 in consideration the material properties of composite the corresponding stress can be separately defined by 26 σ a 1 1 μ 12 μ 21 e 1 ε a μ 12 e 2 ε r 27 σ g b e r cos 2 α sin θ κ κ κ c r e r cos 2 α sin θ κ c r κ κ c r 28 σ b t e cos 4 α sin θ κ y e 1 sin 2 α cos α cos θ κ x where x and y represent the distance from the center of tendon cross section to both ends respectively thus fielding the stress for tendon under coupling loads 29 σ σ a σ g b σ b t according to eqs 27 and 28 the axial stress of helical tendon is not only about the spatial angle but also about the position of tendon cross section an initial external pressure 1 mpa and equivalent axial tension load according to effective tension concept are applied respectively and considering the tendon at different spatial positions θ 0 π 4 π 2 and corresponding center and endpoint positions of tendon cross section the stress variation under cyclic curvature 0 02 0 02 is present by theoretical method which is present in figs 23 and 24 from figs 23 and 24 tendon at different spatial angle has different critical curvature which increases with the angular position when subjected to axisymmetric load the initial axial stress is 2 29 mpa and 9 33 mpa respectively for external pressure and axial tension and corresponding radial stress is 1 44 mpa and 0 29 mpa and for the unbonded flexible riser model in this paper the radial stress of composite tendon is about 62 88 of the axial stress under external pressure while for composite material the failure stress for radial direction is typically much lower than that of axial direction by taking the composite in this paper as example the composite material consists of high modulus carbon fibre and epoxy resin would have a failure stress about 1100 mpa in the axial direction and about 75 mpa in the radial direction dattoma et al 2018 and under external pressure about 60 mpa the unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layers would be damaged in the radial direction before the axial direction thus unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers should be alert to external pressure for causing great radial stress ability under cycling curvature the stress change rate and range at endpoint are always greater than that at center position the stress change rate at different angle positions is also different which decreases with the increase of angle position and based on the above special variation trend when the curvature is large enough the maximum axial stress would be obtained at endpoint of θ 0 see fig 24 7 conclusions the bending response of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is studied in this paper by theoretical and numerical methods firstly the theoretical model of composite armor layer under coupling axisymmetric loads and bending moment in consideration of the composite material properties is derived by function principle and the coupling effect of combined pressure and bending moment is also proposed through configuration of curved layer then based on a typical 2 5 inch 8 layer unbonded flexible riser model the corresponding numerical model in full consideration of the geometric properties and complex contact is established within the abaqus software and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by witz s experimental case secondly based on equivalent axial tensile stiffness with the original steel unbonded flexible riser model the fibre proportion of high modulus carbon fibre composite is calculated by theoretical method and verified by numerical method and then the bending behavior and hysteresis phenomenon of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is present additionally characteristics analysis related to the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser is discussed finally the axial and radial stress of composite tendon under coupling loads is discussed the results show that the bending behavior issue of unbonded flexible riser is of great complexity due to its complex contact between and within interlayers and multiple factors related to the bending behavior should be included to simulate the actual response of unbonded flexible riser and the proposed theoretical method can be a fast calculation method for casting the full slipping bending stiffness when the unbonded flexible riser is simply stressed the proposed methods in this paper can be applied to predict the bending behavior of unbonded flexible riser and furthermore provide parameters for dynamic analysis and fatigue analysis of tensile armor layer some conclusions are drawn in the end of this paper 1 the nonlinear bending properties of unbounded flexible riser model are related to the axisymmetric loads which provide initial contact pressure between adjacent layers and the riser model exhibits obvious hysteresis properties under combined cycling bending moment and initial external pressure under equal axial tensile stiffness the full slipping bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser with composite armor layers is less than that of the original model with steel tensile armor layers 2 the effective tension of unbonded flexible riser affect the bending properties which exhibits reinforcing the contact pressure between adjacent layers contributing to increasing the critical bending curvature of unbonded flexible riser and the effective tension would linearly enhance the effective bending stiffness of unbonded flexible riser and bending behavior of unbounded flexible riser is of great sensitive to initial external pressure but less sensitive to axial tension and internal pressure 3 the friction coefficient would increase the critical curvature under bending moment but has limited effect on the full slipping bending stiffness 4 the axial tension mainly causes the axial stress in tensile armor layer and great radial stress would be caused by external pressure and unbonded flexible riser model with composite armor layer should avoid large external pressure which is recommended to arrange in shallow waters 5 when subjected to combined initial axisymmetric loads and cycling bending moment the axial stress of helical tendon presents a parallelogram change axial stress at endpoint of tendon cross section with small spatial angle has the maximum change rate which would achieve the maximum axial stress when the bending curvature of unbonded flexible riser is large enough credit authorship contribution statement qingsheng liu conceptualization methodology writing original and revised drafts hongxiang xue software resources

keywords ship recycling dismantling operation management hazardous materials personal safety structural equation modeling 1 introduction the ship owners usually send end of life vessels to ship recycling companies for dismantling and recycling which is considered to be a sustainable way choi et al 2016 however the world community has put their attentions on the pollutants and occupational health and safety during ship dismantling including the international maritime organization imo recycling of ships 2009 the international labor organization ilo the european union eu ship recycling

includes the design construction operation and recycling of vessels to ensure any unnecessary risks to surrounding environment and human safety meanwhile the functionality of the eu srr also enhanced the protection of environment and human safety in europe alcaide et al 2017 solakivi et al 2021 during ship dismantling the workers are responsible for conducting multiple dangerous operations such as cutting and moving metal sheets dismantling engine and so on which might result in crushing explosions etc rousmaniere and raj 2007 deshpande et al 2012 ozturkoglu et al 2019 ship recycling is one of the most dangerous industries with regard to occupational health and safety mishra 2018 a number of existing studies for instance those by hasan et al 2013 garmer et al 2015 hiremath et al 2015 kurt et al 2017 du et al 2018 ozturkoglu et al 2019 solakivi et al 2021 etc have been conducted in the literature to examine the various pollutants and risks to the environment and human health however there are few studies focusing on evaluating the factors affecting human safety during ship recycling therefore the objective of this study is to propose the factors affecting human safety during ship dismantling process as well as to reveal the interrelationships among those factors according to structural equation modeling sem by investigating the main steps hazardous materials and potential risk

literature review ship recycling refers to the dismantling of old and nonfunctional ships for re using and recycling the constituent materials which is considered to be environmentally friendly way for ship owners barua et al 2018 du et al 2017 soner et al 2021 during ship dismantling the workers are responsible for conducting different kinds of hazardous operations it is important to find out the potential hse health safety and environment risks especially the human related risks to ensure the occupational health and safety of the workers du et al 2018 garmer et al 2015 one of the most significant concerns in ship recycling is hse violations hadi 2019 there are further standards and studies focusing on hse issues of ship recycling in different countries osha occupational safety and health administration u s department of labor 2010 had recommended mandatory safety and health standards for both employers and employees there is a general hse policy in shipping industry but no

interpretation of the hkc regarding hse issues hiremath et al 2016 applied what if analysis to find out the hse issues of six selected ships during ship recycling in alang as well as recommended measures for improving hse quality jain and hiremath 2017 pointed out that almost half of the active yards in alang had made tremendous changes in hse standards to fulfill the hkc such as improving infrastructure and waste management enhancing training implementing standard operating procedures and so on one of the main tasks during ship dismantling is dealing with the metals heavy metal pollution will affect the workers health and safety as well as the surrounding environment and the sea lives around 70 of the workers were involved in cutting and scrapping of plates and painted metals in alang ship recycling yards in india the typical plate cutting operation will result in air pollution and affect workers safety deshpande et al 2012 2013 gunbeyaz et al 2020 explored different cutting technologies in a ship recycling yard and suggested plasma cutting to be a good alternative to traditional oxyfuel cutting after the cutting of the metals trace metals would be potentially accumulated in the groundwater and sea hasan et al 2013 devault et al 2017 soner et al 2021 kakar et al 2020 studied the heavy metals accumulated in water and fish around ship dismantling areas and evaluated their potential risk to human health due to the ingestion of fish alam et al 2019 evaluated the concentrations of potentially toxic elements in soil as well as the seasonal variations in ship breaking and recycling industries in bangladesh the results can be used to plan better occupational safety yan et al 2018 pointed out that although the beaching method for shipbreaking is of low cost the environmental pollution and workers safety during dismantling process are worrisome many studies have been conducted by scholars to evaluate and control the risk during

officers and production managers to evaluate the risk and human safety at ship dismantling yards the results showed the consistent findings in different validated scenarios kurt et al 2017 revealed that ship dismantling workers are usually at risk of experiencing occupational noise due to no appropriate hearing protection measures being applied du et al 2018 analyzed the removal and disposal methods for hazardous materials during ship dismantling and proposed suggestions for green ship recycling although there are different ways to deal with variety of hazardous materials during ship recycling advanced techniques still need to be developed to enhance the protection of human health and safety ozturkoglu et al 2019 employed triple bottom line approach to assist in sustainable and comprehensive framework for risk management during ship dismantling the risk areas and preventative action were also suggested although the existing literatures have discussed different factors affecting the workers health and safety during ship dismantling such as the hazardous materials the working procedures the dismantling equipment it can be seen that there are few studies in the literature evaluating both those factors and their interrelationships together herein structural equation modelling sem will be applied to evaluate the interrelationships among those factors sem is broadly used in behavior science it is a statistical analysis method which can be used to test the hypotheses among the observed and latent variables hoyle 1995 sem has been applied in different fields such as project management port industry shipping industry transportation industry financial industry and so on luo et al 2017 yuen et al 2018 2020 tournois and djeric 2019 zhou et al 2021 therefore sem is applied in this study to analyze the interrelationships among the factors affecting the human safety during ship recycling 3 methodology 3 1 factors affecting human safety during ship recycling identifying the factors affecting human safety during ship recycling is an essential process a field study was carried out in changjiang ship breaking yard in china to examine the main steps during ship recycling changjiang ship breaking yard is one of the largest ship recycling yards in china it has a waterfront line of 5100 m along the yangtze river owns four docks with 600 m 900 m 1100 m and 1200 m in length respectively the yard had obtained the certifications of iso14001 environmental management standard ohsms18001 occupational health and safety management system and iso9001 quality management system based on the field study and observation as well as referring to the ship recycling procedures hazardous materials presented by hiremath et al 2015 and du et al 2018 the main steps and hazardous materials as well as their potential risks to human safety are shown in table 1 the main steps include pre cleaning of the vessel cutting steel plates sorting materials waste treatment and storage of reusable and hazardous materials the hazardous materials during ship dismantling may result in cancer neurological and immune system damage the residual oil and gas may result in fire and explosion the aloft work may result in high fall injury risk neşer et al 2012 du et al 2018 therefore the workers safety during ship dismantling activities are influenced by the hazardous materials the cutting and scrapping activities the dismantling equipment as well as their safety awareness according to table 1 based on the face to face interviews with the scholars in china national shiprecycling association and the managers workers in changjiang ship breaking yard in china the factors constructs affecting human safety during ship dismantling are proposed as shown in table 2 in this study the disposal of hazardous materials dhm factor refers to the disposal of asbestos pcbs glass fiber solid waste ballast water and oil etc the dismantling operation safety dos factor refers

collection in order to evaluate the constructs and measurements affecting personal safety during ship dismantling a questionnaire survey in line with the constructs and measurements in table 2 was designed there are three parts in the survey 1 the background objectives and significance of this study 2 the demographic of the respondents including the gender age occupation etc 3 the main part of the survey including a series of questions regarding to the perceptions of personal safety during ship dismantling a 5 point likert scale was applied 1 denotes strongly disagree and 5 denotes strongly agree the questionnaire survey was carried out online using a webpage link and a qr code the targeted participants are the people who are familiar with ship recycling industry in china i e the scholars in the field of ship recycling the managers and workers related to ship dismantling yads therefore the researchers and staffs in belong to china national shiprecycling association are invited to participate in the survey as well as the managers and workers in changjiang ship breaking yard in china the survey was carried out from january to april in 2021 the webpage link and qr code were sent to the respondents randomly by emails and or messages firstly the participants were asked to fill in select their personal information such as their age gender education working experience and so on the working experience of an academic or a practical yard manager worker would not be the same for a ship recycling yard secondly they were asked to rate their perceptions on the 28 measurements in table 2 from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree 3 3 conceptual model and research hypotheses according to the factors affecting human safety during ship dismantling proposed in this study research hypotheses are discussed and proposed the dismantling operation management dom mainly refers to the control of hazardous materials oil and gas leakage fire and explosions the contingency plan and so on according to ozturkoglu et al 2019 a systematic management guideline is needed to improve occupational health and safety and optimize preventative actions towards accidents a material flow analysis tool can be used to plan the ship recycling procedure and to better manage waste and resources to reduce the costs and risks jain et al 2017 obviously good ship dismantling operation management can improve the disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of equipment and safety enhance the environmental protection and save the consumption of resources therefore the following hypotheses are proposed h1 dismantling operation management factor has a positive effect on the disposal of hazardous materials h2 dismantling operation management factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation equipment h3 dismantling operation management factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation safety different hazardous materials usually require different dismantling skills and methods for asbestos contained material enclosed area is required with sprayed water and ppe for solid pcbs cold mechanical method is required for glass fiber no floating dust and keeping materials wet are required and so on du et al 2018 the hazardous materials shall be disposed appropriately to prevent hse issues jain et al 2017 the ship dismantling facilities especially the lifting and cutting equipment are essential during ship recycling many workers are involved in cutting and scrapping of metal plates which require high level of awareness to ensure workers safety deshpande et al 2012 abrasive water cutting technology can improve hse and economic issues yan et al 2018 herein the disposal of hazardous materials will affect the workers safety during ship dismantling obviously high tech and better equipment will improve the safety awareness of the workers therefore h4 disposal of hazardous materials factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation safety h5 dismantling operation equipment factor has a positive effect on the safety awareness obviously the safety awareness of the workers will affect the dismantling operation safety during ship recycling the workers need to conduct safe ship recycling behaviors follow the safe ship recycling process and pay attention to colleagues safety behaviors during shipbreaking to ensure operation safety moreover the dismantling operation safety will affect the workers personal safety therefore the following hypotheses are proposed h6 safety awareness factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation safety h7 dismantling operation safety factor has a positive effect on the personal safety according to the above mentioned hypotheses the theoretical model and the hypotheses are shown in fig 1 3 4 model fit evaluation in order to evaluate the overall model fit of the proposed model and scales mode fit indices can be used as shown in table 3 meanwhile the average variance extracted ave can be used to measure the amount of variance and composite reliability cr can be used to measure the scale reliability hair et al 2010 according to zhou et al 2021 ave and cr can be calculated based on equations 1 and 2 the cut off values for ave and cr are 0 50 and 0 70 respectively hair et al 2010 where λ i denotes the factor loading of measurement i n denotes the number of the measurements in each construct based on the survey data the proposed model and hypotheses can be tested and evaluated to find out the relationships among the proposed factors affecting workers safety during ship recycling activities 4 sem evaluation results and discussions 4 1 statistics of respondent as mentioned above the respondents of the survey are the scholars managers and workers related to ship

are the workers or the managers in ship recycling companies yards 4 2 model measurement before doing sem analysis confirmatory factor analysis cfa was applied to evaluate the overall model fit of the scales if the model fit is good the above mentioned hypotheses can be tested by using the survey data according to cfa model the standardized factor loadings of the measurements can be obtained as shown in table 5 the values of the model fit indices fulfil the cut off values in table 3 herein the measurement model has a good fit meanwhile the ave and cr values are larger than 0 50 and 0 70 accordingly which means that the constructs scales have better variance explanation 50 explanation comparing to their errors hair et al 2010 table 6 shows the correlations of the constructs values below the main diagonal and the square root of aves the main diagonal values which can be applied to assess the discriminant validity of the proposed model we can see that the values below the main diagonal are smaller than the main diagonal values which denotes the proposed model has good discriminant validity gefen et al 2000 4 3 structural model results and discussions based on the survey

recycling activities the findings suggest that the workers safety is directly decided by dismantling operation safety and indirectly decided by ship recycling management ship recycling equipment and hazardous materials as well as the safety awareness of the workers so ship recycling companies and policy makers can encourage a strong safety culture organize regular safety trainings improve the requirements and rules with regard to ship recycling industry and so on to ensure the workers safety during ship recycling activities although this study was carried out in the context of china the findings can also be adapted or used in the ship recycling industry in other countries regions since the workers safety is the common concern by the governments ship recycling companies and policy makers around the world this study used the survey data to evaluate the proposed theoretical model due to the survey was conducted by scholars managers and workers in the field of ship recycling industry the findings may not fully reflect the real parameters however the findings are reliable and in consistent with the real situations in addition more factors affecting human safety during ship

20176,more and more ships are coming to the economic end of life nowadays it is a sustainable way to send end of life ships for recycling considering the material circulation by the ship owners due to the hazardous materials and dangerous working process it is important for the ship recycling companies to ensure the workers safety herein the objective of this study is to find out the factors affecting personal safety during ship recycling activities and to evaluate their interrelationships by exploring the main steps hazardous materials and potential risks during ship recycling customized factors affecting workers safety were proposed a questionnaire survey about the proposed factors was designed and conducted by scholars managers and workers in ship recycling industry meanwhile a theoretical model with hypotheses was developed and evaluated based on structural equation modeling by using the survey data the findings showed that all the proposed factors i e disposal of hazardous materials dismantling operation safety dismantling operation management dismantling operation equipment and safety awareness directly or indirectly affect personal safety during ship dismantling especially the dismantling operation management factor the implications and limitations of this study were also discussed which could be beneficial to ship recycling companies and policy makers keywords ship recycling dismantling operation management hazardous materials personal safety structural equation modeling 1 introduction the ship owners usually send end of life vessels to ship recycling companies for dismantling and recycling which is considered to be a sustainable way choi et al 2016 however the world community has put their attentions on the pollutants and occupational health and safety during ship dismantling including the international maritime organization imo recycling of ships 2009 the international labor organization ilo the european union eu ship recycling regulation eu srr 2013 and so on especially the imo had drafted the hong kong convention hkc in 2009 to make sure the vessels are recycled in a safe and environmentally sound way the convention includes the design construction operation and recycling of vessels to ensure any unnecessary risks to surrounding environment and human safety meanwhile the functionality of the eu srr also enhanced the protection of environment and human safety in europe alcaide et al 2017 solakivi et al 2021 during ship dismantling the workers are responsible for conducting multiple dangerous operations such as cutting and moving metal sheets dismantling engine and so on which might result in crushing explosions etc rousmaniere and raj 2007 deshpande et al 2012 ozturkoglu et al 2019 ship recycling is one of the most dangerous industries with regard to occupational health and safety mishra 2018 a number of existing studies for instance those by hasan et al 2013 garmer et al 2015 hiremath et al 2015 kurt et al 2017 du et al 2018 ozturkoglu et al 2019 solakivi et al 2021 etc have been conducted in the literature to examine the various pollutants and risks to the environment and human health however there are few studies focusing on evaluating the factors affecting human safety during ship recycling therefore the objective of this study is to propose the factors affecting human safety during ship dismantling process as well as to reveal the interrelationships among those factors according to structural equation modeling sem by investigating the main steps hazardous materials and potential risk during ship recycling the factors affecting workers safety are proposed a conceptual framework is also developed to study the proposed factors herein there are five sections in this study following the introduction section the second section reviews the existing literatures on human safety during ship recycling section 3 describes the methodologies used in this study including the conceptual model data collection and the model fit evaluation section 4 presents the results of this study and discusses the findings section 5 presents the summary implications and limitations of this study 2 literature review ship recycling refers to the dismantling of old and nonfunctional ships for re using and recycling the constituent materials which is considered to be environmentally friendly way for ship owners barua et al 2018 du et al 2017 soner et al 2021 during ship dismantling the workers are responsible for conducting different kinds of hazardous operations it is important to find out the potential hse health safety and environment risks especially the human related risks to ensure the occupational health and safety of the workers du et al 2018 garmer et al 2015 one of the most significant concerns in ship recycling is hse violations hadi 2019 there are further standards and studies focusing on hse issues of ship recycling in different countries osha occupational safety and health administration u s department of labor 2010 had recommended mandatory safety and health standards for both employers and employees there is a general hse policy in shipping industry but no specific hse policy in ship recycling industry in indonesia ministry of manpower of indonesia 2015 a p moller maersk 2018 published a responsible ship recycling standard rsrs based on a strict interpretation of the hkc regarding hse issues hiremath et al 2016 applied what if analysis to find out the hse issues of six selected ships during ship recycling in alang as well as recommended measures for improving hse quality jain and hiremath 2017 pointed out that almost half of the active yards in alang had made tremendous changes in hse standards to fulfill the hkc such as improving infrastructure and waste management enhancing training implementing standard operating procedures and so on one of the main tasks during ship dismantling is dealing with the metals heavy metal pollution will affect the workers health and safety as well as the surrounding environment and the sea lives around 70 of the workers were involved in cutting and scrapping of plates and painted metals in alang ship recycling yards in india the typical plate cutting operation will result in air pollution and affect workers safety deshpande et al 2012 2013 gunbeyaz et al 2020 explored different cutting technologies in a ship recycling yard and suggested plasma cutting to be a good alternative to traditional oxyfuel cutting after the cutting of the metals trace metals would be potentially accumulated in the groundwater and sea hasan et al 2013 devault et al 2017 soner et al 2021 kakar et al 2020 studied the heavy metals accumulated in water and fish around ship dismantling areas and evaluated their potential risk to human health due to the ingestion of fish alam et al 2019 evaluated the concentrations of potentially toxic elements in soil as well as the seasonal variations in ship breaking and recycling industries in bangladesh the results can be used to plan better occupational safety yan et al 2018 pointed out that although the beaching method for shipbreaking is of low cost the environmental pollution and workers safety during dismantling process are worrisome many studies have been conducted by scholars to evaluate and control the risk during ship dismantling activities hiremath et al 2015 pointed out that essential technologies infrastructures and procedures had been embedded and provided in the ship recycling industry in pakistan to protect human health in gadani ship dismantling yards garmer et al 2015 proposed a three step risk evaluation method to generate a systematic approach for designated expert safety supervisors safety officers and production managers to evaluate the risk and human safety at ship dismantling yards the results showed the consistent findings in different validated scenarios kurt et al 2017 revealed that ship dismantling workers are usually at risk of experiencing occupational noise due to no appropriate hearing protection measures being applied du et al 2018 analyzed the removal and disposal methods for hazardous materials during ship dismantling and proposed suggestions for green ship recycling although there are different ways to deal with variety of hazardous materials during ship recycling advanced techniques still need to be developed to enhance the protection of human health and safety ozturkoglu et al 2019 employed triple bottom line approach to assist in sustainable and comprehensive framework for risk management during ship dismantling the risk areas and preventative action were also suggested although the existing literatures have discussed different factors affecting the workers health and safety during ship dismantling such as the hazardous materials the working procedures the dismantling equipment it can be seen that there are few studies in the literature evaluating both those factors and their interrelationships together herein structural equation modelling sem will be applied to evaluate the interrelationships among those factors sem is broadly used in behavior science it is a statistical analysis method which can be used to test the hypotheses among the observed and latent variables hoyle 1995 sem has been applied in different fields such as project management port industry shipping industry transportation industry financial industry and so on luo et al 2017 yuen et al 2018 2020 tournois and djeric 2019 zhou et al 2021 therefore sem is applied in this study to analyze the interrelationships among the factors affecting the human safety during ship recycling 3 methodology 3 1 factors affecting human safety during ship recycling identifying the factors affecting human safety during ship recycling is an essential process a field study was carried out in changjiang ship breaking yard in china to examine the main steps during ship recycling changjiang ship breaking yard is one of the largest ship recycling yards in china it has a waterfront line of 5100 m along the yangtze river owns four docks with 600 m 900 m 1100 m and 1200 m in length respectively the yard had obtained the certifications of iso14001 environmental management standard ohsms18001 occupational health and safety management system and iso9001 quality management system based on the field study and observation as well as referring to the ship recycling procedures hazardous materials presented by hiremath et al 2015 and du et al 2018 the main steps and hazardous materials as well as their potential risks to human safety are shown in table 1 the main steps include pre cleaning of the vessel cutting steel plates sorting materials waste treatment and storage of reusable and hazardous materials the hazardous materials during ship dismantling may result in cancer neurological and immune system damage the residual oil and gas may result in fire and explosion the aloft work may result in high fall injury risk neşer et al 2012 du et al 2018 therefore the workers safety during ship dismantling activities are influenced by the hazardous materials the cutting and scrapping activities the dismantling equipment as well as their safety awareness according to table 1 based on the face to face interviews with the scholars in china national shiprecycling association and the managers workers in changjiang ship breaking yard in china the factors constructs affecting human safety during ship dismantling are proposed as shown in table 2 in this study the disposal of hazardous materials dhm factor refers to the disposal of asbestos pcbs glass fiber solid waste ballast water and oil etc the dismantling operation safety dos factor refers to the workers skills the electric shock risk during cutting operation the high fall injury risk the mechanical injury risk etc the dismantling operation management dom factor refers to the control of fire and explosion risk the control of hazardous materials the oil and gas leakage the contingency plan etc the dismantling operation equipment doe factor includes the cutting tools the inspection and maintenance of the dismantling equipment the integrity of the equipment etc the safety awareness saw factor refers to the workers safety behaviors during ship dismantling activities the personal safety pes factor refers to the personal protect equipment ppe the training etc herein the measurements for the factors affecting human safety are shown in table 2 3 2 survey design and data collection in order to evaluate the constructs and measurements affecting personal safety during ship dismantling a questionnaire survey in line with the constructs and measurements in table 2 was designed there are three parts in the survey 1 the background objectives and significance of this study 2 the demographic of the respondents including the gender age occupation etc 3 the main part of the survey including a series of questions regarding to the perceptions of personal safety during ship dismantling a 5 point likert scale was applied 1 denotes strongly disagree and 5 denotes strongly agree the questionnaire survey was carried out online using a webpage link and a qr code the targeted participants are the people who are familiar with ship recycling industry in china i e the scholars in the field of ship recycling the managers and workers related to ship dismantling yads therefore the researchers and staffs in belong to china national shiprecycling association are invited to participate in the survey as well as the managers and workers in changjiang ship breaking yard in china the survey was carried out from january to april in 2021 the webpage link and qr code were sent to the respondents randomly by emails and or messages firstly the participants were asked to fill in select their personal information such as their age gender education working experience and so on the working experience of an academic or a practical yard manager worker would not be the same for a ship recycling yard secondly they were asked to rate their perceptions on the 28 measurements in table 2 from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree 3 3 conceptual model and research hypotheses according to the factors affecting human safety during ship dismantling proposed in this study research hypotheses are discussed and proposed the dismantling operation management dom mainly refers to the control of hazardous materials oil and gas leakage fire and explosions the contingency plan and so on according to ozturkoglu et al 2019 a systematic management guideline is needed to improve occupational health and safety and optimize preventative actions towards accidents a material flow analysis tool can be used to plan the ship recycling procedure and to better manage waste and resources to reduce the costs and risks jain et al 2017 obviously good ship dismantling operation management can improve the disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of equipment and safety enhance the environmental protection and save the consumption of resources therefore the following hypotheses are proposed h1 dismantling operation management factor has a positive effect on the disposal of hazardous materials h2 dismantling operation management factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation equipment h3 dismantling operation management factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation safety different hazardous materials usually require different dismantling skills and methods for asbestos contained material enclosed area is required with sprayed water and ppe for solid pcbs cold mechanical method is required for glass fiber no floating dust and keeping materials wet are required and so on du et al 2018 the hazardous materials shall be disposed appropriately to prevent hse issues jain et al 2017 the ship dismantling facilities especially the lifting and cutting equipment are essential during ship recycling many workers are involved in cutting and scrapping of metal plates which require high level of awareness to ensure workers safety deshpande et al 2012 abrasive water cutting technology can improve hse and economic issues yan et al 2018 herein the disposal of hazardous materials will affect the workers safety during ship dismantling obviously high tech and better equipment will improve the safety awareness of the workers therefore h4 disposal of hazardous materials factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation safety h5 dismantling operation equipment factor has a positive effect on the safety awareness obviously the safety awareness of the workers will affect the dismantling operation safety during ship recycling the workers need to conduct safe ship recycling behaviors follow the safe ship recycling process and pay attention to colleagues safety behaviors during shipbreaking to ensure operation safety moreover the dismantling operation safety will affect the workers personal safety therefore the following hypotheses are proposed h6 safety awareness factor has a positive effect on the dismantling operation safety h7 dismantling operation safety factor has a positive effect on the personal safety according to the above mentioned hypotheses the theoretical model and the hypotheses are shown in fig 1 3 4 model fit evaluation in order to evaluate the overall model fit of the proposed model and scales mode fit indices can be used as shown in table 3 meanwhile the average variance extracted ave can be used to measure the amount of variance and composite reliability cr can be used to measure the scale reliability hair et al 2010 according to zhou et al 2021 ave and cr can be calculated based on equations 1 and 2 the cut off values for ave and cr are 0 50 and 0 70 respectively hair et al 2010 where λ i denotes the factor loading of measurement i n denotes the number of the measurements in each construct based on the survey data the proposed model and hypotheses can be tested and evaluated to find out the relationships among the proposed factors affecting workers safety during ship recycling activities 4 sem evaluation results and discussions 4 1 statistics of respondent as mentioned above the respondents of the survey are the scholars managers and workers related to ship

scales if the model fit is good the above mentioned hypotheses can be tested by using the survey data according to cfa model the standardized factor loadings of the measurements can be obtained as shown in table 5 the values of the model fit indices fulfil the cut off values in table 3 herein the measurement model has a good fit meanwhile the ave and cr values are larger than 0 50 and 0 70 accordingly which means that the constructs scales have better variance explanation 50 explanation comparing to their errors hair et al 2010 table 6 shows the correlations of the constructs values below the main diagonal and the square root of aves the main diagonal values which can be applied to assess the discriminant validity of the proposed model we can see that the values below the main diagonal are smaller than the main diagonal values which denotes the proposed model has good discriminant validity gefen et al 2000 4 3 structural model results and discussions based on the survey

20177,harvesting energy from ocean waves has attracted increasing attention due to the depletion of fossil fuels water motion under ocean waves can be modelled as oscillatory flow when its impact on small scale structures are studied in this paper energy harvesting from inline vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in oscillatory flow is studied numerically at a low reynolds number of 150 two keulegan carpenter kc numbers of 5 and 10 and three mass ratios of 1 2 and 3 the energy harvesting device is an electromagnetic device comprising of electric coils and a magnet for specific kc number mass ratio and electromagnetic damping ratio the maximum power occurs when the natural frequency of the cylinder measured in water is the same as the oscillatory flow frequency and is defined as lock in power for a fixed flow condition the lock in power is affected by the electromagnetic damping ratio and there exists a best electromagnetic damping ratio where the lock in power reaches its maximum value which is defined as the best power the best power is found to be independent of the mass ratio and decreases with the increase of kc number the best electromagnetic damping ratio decreases with the increase of mass ratio and increase with the increase of kc number the irregular vibration of the cylinder at kc 10 causes significant reduction in the power the power is dominated by the first harmonic vibration and is closely correlated to the phase between the force and vibration velocity keywords flow induced vibration oscillatory flow circular cylinder 1 introduction electrical power is predominantly generated through the combustion of natural resources gas coal etc in addition to depleting rapidly natural resources also release large amounts of emissions that cause environmental damage sims 2004 research into utilising renewable energy sources solar wind hydropower etc has become increasingly important to meeting the increasing demand of energy harvesting energy from fluid flow is of particular interest as it is commonly found around the world the most common devices for harvesting energy from water flows are marine turbines which require large flow velocities to operate efficiently huynh et al 2017 another new method of harvesting energy from fluid flow is through flow induced vibrations fiv of structures elastically mounted and submerged in fluid the vibration of a structure allows the fluid energy to be converted to mechanical energy and then into electrical energy through an electricity generator the common electricity generators are comprised of magnet and coil or a piezoelectric element in contrast to the traditional concept of ensuring structural safety by reducing fiv the goal of harvesting energy is to enhance structural vibration soti et al 2017 shao et al 2020a b if a circular cylinder is placed in a steady fluid flow vortex shedding occurs if the reynolds number is greater than 47 williamson 1996 the vibration of structures due to vortex shedding is referred as vortex induced vibration viv the reynolds number re is defined as re ud ν where u d and ν are the fluid velocity the diameter of the cylinder and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively if a cylinder is elastically mounted in a fluid flow and if the frequency of the vortex shedding matches with the natural frequency large amplitude vibration occurs this phenomenon is referred to as lock in or synchronization govardhan and williamson 2000 bishop and hassan 1964 hsieh et al 2017 zang and gao 2014 lock in is found to occur within a range of reduced velocities the reduced velocity is defined as u r u f n d where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder it has also been demonstrated that increasing the damping ratio leads to a reduction in the vibration amplitude and also an increase in the phase angle between the amplitude and force of a circular cylinder shiels et al 2001 silva et al 2016 chen et al 2019 harvesting energy from fiv of a cylinder in steady flow has been investigated in a number of studies lefebure et al 2020 developed an analytical model to estimate the power harvested by viv in their analytical model the power was extracted by an equivalent damping constant in the experimental study of harvesting energy using viv by gu et al 2020 the effects of the submergence depth of the cylinder is studied jadidi and zeinoddini 2020 investigated the effect of marine fouling on the energy harvesting efficiency from viv of a cylinder jiang et al 2019 2020 conducted numerical simulations to use combined pitching and swing motion of a foil in steady flow to harvesting energy they found that tip leakage flow causes a reduction of the harvested power sun et al 2020 used an adaptive damper to improve the energy harnessing of two cylinders in tandem in steady flow they reported that the adaptive damper could increase overall harnessed power of the downstream cylinder by up to 94 arionfard and nishi 2019 used the fiv of a double cylinder device that can rotate around a pivot in steady current and achieved significant improvement of energy harvesting efficiency soti and de 2020 studied energy harvesting from viv of a cylinder between two parallel plates and found that a reduction of the distance between the two walls from 4 diameters to 2 diameters increased the harvested power by 2 8 times the studies mentioned above used a constant damping coefficient to harvesting energy which are different from the real energy harvesting devices one practical method of harvesting energy through viv is using a piezoelectric element which is able to convert mechanical vibrations into electrical energy hamlehdar et al 2019 by conducting numerical simulations pan et al 2017 calculated energy harvesting through a 0 03 m diameter d vibrating piezoelectric cantilever beam in a steady water flow with a velocity of u 0 4 m s producing a peak to peak voltage of 0 35 v mehmood et al 2013 numerically simulated vibration of a circular cylinder d 0 1 1 6 mm that vibrated in the transverse direction to a steady water flow with a reduced velocity range u r 5 35 to 6 57 a piezoelectric transducer attached to the cylinder generated a maximum average power of 10 5 watts at a re of 105 the amount of electrical energy generated from fiv through piezoelectric generators is generally aimed at powering small electronics such as wearable electronic devices and gps systems howells 2009 electromagnet coils are the devices used to generate powers in large power plants soti et al 2017 proved the potential of harnessing electrical power from a vibrating cylinder equipped with a coil magnet generator through numerical simulations the cylinder was elastically mounted in a fluid flow and allowed to vibrate in the transverse direction of the flow the maximum non dimensional power of 0 13 also called efficiency was harnessed when the reynolds number was 150 with a reduced velocity of 5 2 the maximum power was found to be nearly independent on the mass ratio m which is defined as the ratio of the system mass to the displaced fluid mass however a lower mass ratio maintains a wider range of reduced velocity that can generate high power zhang et al 2017 used a coil magnet generator attached to two bluff bodies in tandem arrangements spacing from 2d to 50d with varying cross sections the results showed the maximum power extracted 26 5 efficiency was when the bluff body was upstream and occurred with the largest displacement amplitude 1 17d showing the power is correlated to its vibration majority of research towards generating energy from viv s has been focused on steady flows huge amounts of potential energy are available in ocean waves research on capturing ocean energy using large scale buoys on the ocean surface has been investigated by zhang et al 2016 and chen et al 2019 further investigations into low wave energy convertors using the sea surface have been shown by xie and zuo 2013 and viet and wang 2018 harvesting energy from viv of small scale submerged structures under waves has rarely been studied the fluid motion under waves can be generally modelled as oscillatory flow when fluid structure interaction problems are studied kazeminezhad 2013 sumer et al 1991 the acceleration of the wave motion has great potential to generate large inertia force on structures and energy vibration of cylindrical structures in oscillatory flow were studied for investigating fatigue damage wang et al 2015 but not for energy harvesting zhao et al 2012 showed that the maximum vibration amplitude of a cylinder in oscillatory flow is much larger than the vibration produced in a purely steady flow oscillatory flows introduce a new parameter that affects flow induced vibrations the keulegan carpenter k c number which is defined as kc u m t d where u m and t are the amplitude and period of the oscillatory flow velocity respectively the formation of vortices from a cylinder in oscillatory flow requires the kc number to be greater than 1 1 sarpkaya 1986 the number of vortices generated from a cylinder in every period of oscillation flow is dependent on kc sarpkaya 1986 tatsuno and bearman 1990 conducted an experimental study to study vortex flow around a circular cylinder in oscillatory flow and identified eight different regimes depending on re and kc vortex flow patterns of a cylinder in oscillatory flow can also be categorized based on the number and pattern of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in each flow period williamson and roshko 1988 taheri et al 2020 conducted a numerical study on vibration of a circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow in the streamline direction referred to as inline direction thereafter at a low reynolds number of 150 kc 5 and 10 mass ratios m 1 2 and 3 and zero damping the most interesting conclusions is that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder could be greater than the amplitude of the oscillatory flow this conclusion shows the potential of harvesting energy from oscillatory flow induced vibration in this study numerical calculations are conducted to investigate the capability of harvesting energy from the vibration of an elastically mounted circular in streamwise direction subjected to oscillatory flow numerical simulations are conducted with a reynolds number of 150 kc numbers of 5 and 10 electromagnetic damping values of 0 001 0 013 three mass ratio values of 1 2 and 3 and a wide range of frequency ratios the frequency ratio is defined as the frequency of the oscillatory flow to the natural frequency of the cylinder anagnostopoulos and iliadis 1998 2 numerical method 2 1 flow simulation fig 1 shows the device for harvesting energy from the vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow the vibration of the cylinder is confined to the inline direction streamwise direction the electricity generator comprises of a magnet oscillating inside a coil a cartesian coordinate system is defined with its origin at the static balance position of the cylinder centre and x direction pointing towards the flow direction to find out the maximum possible harvested energy the mechanical damping coefficient is set to zero however the electromagnetic force behaves as a damping force which is a function of the oscillatory velocity of the magnet the velocity of the undisturbed oscillatory flow is modelled as a sinusoidal function of time 1 u t u m sin 2 π t t where t is time and u u m and t are the velocity amplitude and the period of the oscillatory flow respectively in this paper variables with and without a prime are dimensional and non dimensional parameters respectively except for the properties of the fluid and the magnet coil system the energy harvesting system shown in fig 1 is driven by an oscillatory flow in the x direciton to calculate fluid forces the flow around the cylinder is simulated by solving the imcompressible two dimensional navier stokes ns equations when simulating the flow the motion of the cylinder makes the computational domain deform continuously to account for the deformation of the computational domain the arbitrary langrangian eurlerian ale scheme is used zhao and cheng 2010 when solving ns equations the ale scheme ensures that the computational mesh is not overly distorted by moving the computational mesh nodes by an arbitrary way that ensures the quality of the mesh as a result the effects of the mesh moving should be included in the convection terms of the ns equations the fluid velocity u v the time t and the pressure p are non dimensionalized as u v u v u m t t u m d and p p ρ u m 2 respectively where u and v are the fluid velocity components in the x and y directions respectively based on the above non dimensionalisation method the non dimensional period t is the same as the keulegan carpenter kc number i e t k c u m t d the non dimensional ns equations in the ale scheme are expressed as 2 u x v y 0 3 u t u u ˆ u x v v ˆ u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 4 v t u u ˆ v x v v ˆ v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where u ˆ and v ˆ are the non dimensional velocity of the mesh movement in the x and y directions respectively and the reynolds number is defined using the amplitude of the oscillatory flow as r e u m d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem developed by zhao et al 2007 is used to solve the ns equations a square computational domain with a non dimensional size of 110 shown in fig 1 is used and the static balance position of the cylinder is located at its centre the blockage ratio cylinders diameter to computational domain size in the cross flow direction of 0 0091 is much smaller than the recommended maximum blockage ratio of 0 2 by anagnostopoulos and minear 2004 the boundary conditions for simulating the fluid flow are specified as follows if there is no cylinder the velocity is spatially constant and the solution of eq 3 is p xωcos ωt where ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the flow in the numerical simulations the velocity and pressure on the left and right boundary are given as u sin 2πt t and p xωcos ωt respectively the velocity and pressure boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries does not have effects on the results if the computational domain is sufficiently large the cylinder surface is smooth and therefore the no slip boundary condition is applied i e the velocity of the fluid on the cylinders surface is the same as the cylinders vibration velocity the top and bottom boundaries are symmetric boundaries where v 0 u y 0 and p y 0 after each computational time step the mesh is deformed due to the updated position of the cylinder and the equation for calculating the displacement of the mesh is zhao and cheng 2010 5 γ s i 0 where s i is the displacement of the nodal points of the computational mesh in the x i direction γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation which is calculated as γ 1 a and a is the area of the element eq 5 is solved by the conventional galerkin fem and its boundary condition is that s i is the same as the displacement of the cylinder on the cylinder surface and zero on rest boundaries the computational domain is descritized into 37040 four node quadrilateral finite elements and fig 2 shows the mesh near the cylinder the surface of the cylinder is divided into 160 finite elements with a size of 0 0008 in the radial direction of the cylinder the computational time step is δ t 0 0025 the computational domain the mesh and the comptuational time step used in this study are the same as those used by taheri et al 2020 who conducted detailed domain size dependency mesh dependency and time step dependency studies for oscillatory flow induced vibration of a cylinder without an energy harvesting device at re 150 and m 1 and converged results were achieved as adding an electricity generater in the system reduces the vibration ampltude of the cylinder the domain size mesh density and time step should be satisfactory for obtaining converged results for energy harvesting 2 2 power generation within each computational time step the fluid forces on the cylinder can be calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress over the surface of the cylinder after the ns equations are solved then the motion of the cylinder can be predicted by solving the equation of motion in addition to the forces from the fluid spring and mechanical damper the cylinder also experiences the resistence force from the magnet coil device also called electromagnetic device the coil of the electromagnetic device shown in fig 1 has non dimensional radius a non dimensional length l and number of turns n the dimensional force on the cylinder from the electromagnetic device f em is calculated by a single magnetic dipole g approximated by donoso et al 2010 and simulated by soti et al 2017 6 f em c m 0 g 2 x where 7 c m 0 u m 2 n 2 r d 4 and g is a non dimensional parameter defined as 8 g 2 π a 2 l 1 a 2 x cm l 2 2 3 2 1 a 2 x cm l 2 2 3 2 where r is electrical load resistance in eq 8 all the length dimensions are non dimensional so is the parameter g consider the force from the electromagnetic device the dimensional equation of the motion of the cylinder is 9 m x c c m 0 g 2 x k x f x where x and x are the acceleration and velocity of the cylinder respectively m is the mass of the system c is the mechancial damping constant k is the spring constant and f x is the fluid force in the x direction from eq 9 it can be seen the energy absorption by the electromagnetic device is equivalent to energy dissipation of a damper with a damping coefficient of c m 0 g 2 which is a function of time the non dimensional format of eq 9 is 10 x 4 π u r ζ ζ m 0 g 2 x 4 π 2 u r 2 x 2 c f x π m where ζ c 4 π f n is the mechanical damping ratio u r u m f n d is the reduced velocity and ζ m 0 c m 0 4 π m f n is defined as electromagnetic damping ratio and c fx f x ρ d u m 2 2 is the non dimensional force in the x direction the non dimensional electromagnetic force is 11 c fe c m 0 g 2 x ρ d u m 2 2 eq 10 is solved by the fourth order runge kutta method after the velocity of the cylinder is obtained the non dimensional power received by the generator is defined as 12 p e t f em x 1 2 ρ u m 3 d 2 π 2 m ζ m 0 g 2 x 2 u r the averaged power of the generator is obtained by averaging the power over time as 13 p e 1 n t 0 n t p e t d t if the motion of the cylinder is perfectly periodic the averaged power can be found using only one period of data n 1 in eq 12 otherwise the averaged power should be obtained by performing temporal averaging over many periods of flow 3 numerical results 3 1 numeircal validation taheri et al 2020 conducted validation of the numerical model for simulating oscillatory flow induced vibration of a cylinder without an energy harvesting device at re 150 ζ 0 kc 5 and a wide range of natural freqeuncy ratios the results agreed well with the results calculated by the open source spectral hp element code nektar developed by cantwell et al 2015 no available experimenal or numerical data has been found in literature regarding energy haversing from oscillatory flow induced vibrations to validate the numerical model energy harvesting through the electromagnetic device driven by flow induced vibration in steady current is simulated under exactly the same condition as used by soti et al 2017 the cylinder is allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction only the reynolds number is 150 mass ratio is 2 and the reduced velocity measured in the fluid is 5 2 the reduced velocity measured in the fluid is defined as u rw u f nw d where f nw is the natural frequency measured in fluid and its relationship with f n is f nw f n 1 1 c a m where c a is the added mass coefficient the value of added mass coefficient is c a 1 same as the value used by soti et al 2017 throuth experiments khalak and williamson 1999 also reported that c a 1 based on the relationship between f nw and f n the reduced velocity measured in vacuum corresponding to u rw 5 2 is u r 4 25 which was used in the simulations fig 3 shows the comparison of the average power acquired as a function of the electromagnetic damping co efficient soti et al 2017 the calculated p e values in the whole range of ζ m0 are very close to the numerical results by soti et al 2017 3 2 power this study investigates the amount of harvested energy through the vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in oscillating flow which is confined to vibrate in the streamwise direction only a 2d numerical investigation is performed with a low reynolds number of 150 to avoid any uncertainties caused by turbulence and to increase the reliability of results simulations are conducted for two k c values of 5 and 10 three mass ratios m 1 2 and 3 and six electromagnetic damping coefficients 0 001 0 003 0 007 0 008 0 009 and 0 13 each simulation is conducted for reduced velocities in the range of 1 20 which corresponds to a frequency ratio f of 1 2 for kc 10 and 1 4 for kc 5 the frequency ratio f f w f n ur kc where f w 1 t is the frequency of the oscillatory flow each numerical simulation was conducted for at least t 100 where t t t is the period number majority of simulations reaching equilibrium when t 20 fig 4 shows variations of the time averaged power p e with the frequency ratio f it is worth noting that the maximum power is generated at a frequency ratio less than 1 for all the cases the ratio of oscillatory flow frequency to the natural frequency measured in the fluid f is defined as f f w f nw and f 1 is marked in fig 4 it can be seen that the maximum energy occurs when the oscillatory flow frequency and the natural frequency measured in fluid synchronize in all the simulated cases it is also observed that kc 5 generated more maximum power when f 1 than kc 10 this is because a smaller period has greater flow acceleration to create inertia force on the cylinder at the maximum simulated frequency ratio f 4 and 2 for kc 5 and 10 respectively the averaged power increases with the increase of ζ m0 the averaged power peaks at f 1 for all the cases with kc 5 however for kc 10 the averaged power oscillates near f 1 at m 2 and 3 and a distinct peak cannot be identified the reason why the averaged power oscillates near f 1 can be explained by fig 5 where time histories of the instantaneous power and lift coefficient and the instaneous flow patterns for kc 10 m 3 ζ m 0 0 008 and f 0 8 are shown to facilitate the discussion the time from t n to t n 1 is referred to as n th period of the flow because the power is generated by the inline force the lift force does not have any contribution to it the lift force is shown in fig 5 b to demonstrate the degree of symmetry of the flow the lift force is zero if the flow is symmetric with respect to the x axis defined in fig 1 and non zero if flow is asymmetric the overall observation from fig 5 is that the power increases whenever the lift coefficient is small and decreases whenever the lift coefficient is increased initially the lift coefficient is zero and the power oscillates periodically with a large amplitude between t 30 and 42 the lift coefficient is increased but the power is decreased between t 42 and 50 the lift coefficient is reduced and the power is increased taheri et al 2020 found that due to the vibration of the cylinder the flow is very different from that of a stationary cylinder the irregular oscillation of the power and lift coefficient is because the flow pattern changes between a nearly symmetric pattern to an asymmetric pattern as shown in fig 5 c f where the power is small and lift coefficient is large in fig 5 c and f the roughly symmetric flow pattern resembles the symmetric flow pattern s reported by taheri et al 2020 in fig 5 d and e where the power is large and lift coefficient is small the flow pattern is in a typical regime d flow tatsuno and bearman 1990 where one pair of vortices labelled as a and b respectively in the figure are shed from the cylinder in one period of flow if the flow is aperiodic the power generated from different flow periods are different the maximum drag and lift coefficients a cfx a cfy the maximum amplitude of the velocity in the inline direction a vx and the power averaged over each individual period defined as p e to differentiate it form p e that is averaged over many periods for an exemplary case with aperiodic vibration are calculated and fig 6 shows their variation with time it can be seen that the inline force a cfx and inline velocity a vx increase simultaneously and their variation trend is opposite with that of cross flow force a cfy increases of a cfx and a vx in the same time cause increase of and vice versa the average power p e varies between about 0 4 and 0 55 fig 7 shows time histories of the non dimensional power and non dimensional lift force c fx of some exemplary cases with irregular vibration for kc 10 m 3 ζ m 0 0 008 the power extracted by the electromagnetic damper is always positive based on eq 12 the periodicity of the flow can be clearly identified through the time histories of the lift force in fig 7 b the oscillation of the lift force is perfectly periodic as f 0 2 0 3 and 0 7 the power changes periodically between peak values and zero in all the cases in the case of f 0 85 the time history of the lift coefficient is very irregular and as a result the peak value of the power changes from period to period when calculating time averaged power p e data within sufficient number of flow periods at least 50 periods are used for irregular vibration case such as f 0 85 in fig 7 b to clearly see how the power p e varies with time fig 8 shows the time histories of p e x 2 and g 2 with time within three flow periods for kc 10 m 3 ζ m 0 0 008 and f 0 8 based on eq 12 p e is the product of g 2 x 2 and a constant instead of following sinusoidal function of time p e reaches zero at four times during each period twice when x 2 0 and twice when g 2 0 it can be seen that g 2 and x 2 are roughly out of phase with each other as a result the power p e and x 2 do not reach their maximum velues at the same time the variation of p e within each period for other simulated cases for both kc 5 and 10 are very similar to that shown in fig 8 because the velocity is nearly a sinusoidal funciton of time as discussed later on fig 4 demonstrates that the maximum power generally occurs at f 1 for all the electromagnetic damping ratios in some exceptional cases where the vibration is irregular the power at f 1 is slightly reduced simulations for a constant f 1 and a wide range of ζ m0 are conducted and the computed mean power is shown in fig 9 a the peak value of power for a specific kc and m in fig 9 a is the maximum possible power that can be harvested from the device the following observation can be found from fig 9 a 1 for a constant kc the maximum power for different m values are nearly the same but the ζ m0 where the maximum power occurs defined as the best ζ m0 hereafter decreases with the increase of m 2 the maximum power decreases with the increase of the kc number in practical engineering the flow condition for a specific location should be fixed fig 9 a indicates that to increase the harvested power the diameter of the cylinder should increase corresponding to a reduction of kc 3 if the mass ratio is fixed the value of ζ m0 where the mean power reaches its maximum increases fig 9 b represents the variation of mean power with the mass damping parameter m ζ m0 which is defined as the product of the mass ratio and damping ratio at f 1 it is interesting to see that both the maximum power and the mass damping parameter where the maximum power occurs defined as the best m ζ m0 hereafter are nearly independent on the mass ratio however the maximum power decreases and the value of where m ζ m0 reaches its maximum increases with the increase of kc number 3 3 correlation between force and vibration amplitude due to the non linear interaction between the fluid and the cylinder the inline force and the vibration velocity are not monochromatic and include higher order harmonics to understand the contribution of power generation of each harmonic vibration harmonic decomposition is applied to the force and velocity of the cylinder as 14 ϕ t k 1 ϕ k sin k ω t θ k where epsilon represents the sum of all the harmonics subscript k stands for the k th harmonic ϕ represents velocity or force and ε k is the phase of the k th harmonic the non dimensional power transferred from the fluid to the cylinder can be calculated by 15 p f x x 1 2 ρ u m 3 d c fx x if the mechanical damping factor ζ 0 time averaged power p and p e are the same i e all the fluid power is transferred to the generator the contribution of the k th harmonic to the power is calculated by 16 p k 1 t 0 t c fx k sin k ω t θ fx k x k sin k ω t θ x k 1 2 c fx k x k cos δ θ k where δ θ k θ fx k θ x k is the phase difference between the force and velocity of the k th order fig 10 shows variations of the first to fourth harmonics of the velocity of the cylinder with the frequency ratio for two representative cases for each kc number and fig 11 shows the variations of the first to fourth harmonics of the inline forces with the frequency ratio for the same cases as in fig 10 the amplitudes of the k th harmonic of the velocity and inline force are represented by x m k and c fx k respectively it can be seen that both velocity and force are dominated by the first harmonics except at small freqeuncy ratios at very small frequency ratios f 0 25 for kc 10 the amplitude of the third harmonic of vibration velocity x is nearly the same as the first harmonic and both are small for kc 10 m 2 and ζ m0 0 007 the contribution of third harmonics of cylinder velocity and inline force exist in a wide range of freuqency ratio until f 2 fig 12 shows the contribution of the first to fourth harmonics of the power for kc 10 and m 2 the first harmonic power is nearly the same as the total power and the contributions from the second to fourth harmonics are negligibly small except for the case of kc 10 m 1 and ζ m0 0 001 where the maximium contribution of the third harmonic is about 0 005 which is 4 195 of the total power because the power is dominated by the first harmonic vibration fig 13 shows the variation of the phase difference δθ 1 between the first harmonic inline force and the first vibration displacement based on eq 16 for specific amplitudes of force amplitude and vibration velocity the power is zero if the phase between the force and vibration velocity δθ 1 is 90 the power increases as δθ 1 decrease and becomes maximum at δθ 1 0 if the damping ζ m0 is zero fig 13 e and f the phase difference of first harmonics are either 90 or 90 because there is no net energy transfer between the fluid and the cylinder when ζ m0 is non zero the first harmonic phase difference δθ 1 is nearly 90 at very small frequency ratios resulting in a nearly zero power as shown in fig 4 it is interesting that δθ 1 is 0 at f 1 for all the simulated cases indicating the phase synchronization between the force and vibration velocity however the maximum power occurs at f 1 instead of f 1 as shown in fig 4 the maximum power does not occur at f 1 because of the significant reduction of the force it can be seen in fig 11 that the inline force reduces significantly at f 1 compared with those at f 1 fig 14 shows the variation of the vibration amplitude x m of the cylinder with the frequency ratio where x m is defined as x m max x the amplitude of oscillatory fluid particles in undisturbed oscillatory flow a m are marked in fig 14 when the electromagnetic damping ratio ζ m0 0 the amplitude of the cylinder could be greater than a m because the vibration of the cylinder and the oscillation of the flow are out of phase with each other taheri et al 2020 the maximum vibration amplitude reduces with the increase of ζ m0 by comparing fig 4 with fig 14 it can be seen that vibration amplitude x m increases with the decrease of ζ m0 but smaller ζ m0 creates larger vibration amplitude but not larger power it can be seen that the vibration amplitudes for different values of ζ m0 tend to converge towards a constant value as f approaches infinity fig 15 shows the variation of standard deviation of the inline force coefficient c fx with the frequency ratio f for all the simulated cases c fx reaches its minimum value at f 1 if ζ m0 is less than 0 003 the minimum vlaue of c fx does not exist as ζ m0 0 007 it can be seen in figs 14 and 15 that at the largest simulated f both the vibration amplitude and c fx change little with the change of ζ m0 however the power at the largest f increases with the increase of ζ m0 based on eq 16 the power is dependent on not only the ampliude of the force and velocity but also the phase between the force and the vibration velocity it can be seen in fig 13 that the first harmonic phase difference δθ 1 decreases with the increase of ζ m0 for constant amplitudes of force and vibration displacement a decrease in δθ 1 causes increase in power based on eq 16 the force is minimum at f 1 at ζ m0 0 003 but the power is not because phase δθ 1 is zero taheri et al 2020 have demonstrated that the vortex flow pattern around the cylinder is dependent on the effective keulegan carpenter number kc eff which is defined based on the relative flow velocity to the moving cylinder because of the relative motion between the fluid and the cylinder kc eff changes with f and so does the vortex flow pattern the vortex flow patterns have been discussed in detail by taheri et al 2020 and will not be repeated here 4 conclusions energy harvesting through the vibration of a circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow is simulated using two dimensional numerical simulations the energy extraction device is an electromagnetic device comprising electric coils and a magnet in the numerical simulation the energy extracted by the device is achieved by a so called electromagnetic damping ratio ζ m0 which varies with time simulations are conducted for kc 5 and 10 mass ratios of 1 2 and 3 and a wide range of frequency ratio f and electromagnetic damping ratio ζ m0 the main conclusions are summarized as follows for specific kc and ζ m0 the maximum power occurs at f 1 the frequency ratio based on the natural frequency in water however the maximum vibration amplitude does not occur at f 1 but at a f value greater than 1 the best ζ m0 decreases with the increase of m for a specific kc number both the maximum power and the best mass damping parameter m ζ m0 are nearly independent on the mass ratio harmonic analysis of the vibration velocity and inline force show that the vibration is dominated by the first harmonic of vibration velocity and inline force the phase difference δθ 1 between the first harmonic inline force and vibration velocity has a significant effect on the power it is close to 90 when f is very small increases with the increase of f crosses zero at f 1 and remains smaller than 90 at the largest f for all the simulated cases at the maximum simulated f the phase decreases with the increase in ζ m0 resulting in increase of the power since the maximum power occurs at f 1 for specific kc and m simulations for ζ m0 0 001 to 0 013 and a constant of f 1 are simulated to find out the maximum achievable power the maximum achievable power is found to be independent of m for a constant kc however the ζ m0 where the maximum power occurs defined as the best ζ m0 decreases with the increase of m an increase of kc number causes a reduction of the maximum achievable power and increase of the best ζ m0 at kc 10 the vibration is found to change from period to period when f is around 1 and the aperiodicity of the vibration causes significant reduction of the power the harvested power varies significantly from period to period because of the aperiodicity of the vibration credit authorship contribution statement erfan taheri investigation validation

20177,harvesting energy from ocean waves has attracted increasing attention due to the depletion of fossil fuels water motion under ocean waves can be modelled as oscillatory flow when its impact on small scale structures are studied in this paper energy harvesting from inline vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in oscillatory flow is studied numerically at a low reynolds number of 150 two keulegan carpenter kc numbers of 5 and 10 and three mass ratios of 1 2 and 3 the energy harvesting device is an electromagnetic device comprising of electric coils and a magnet for specific kc number mass ratio and electromagnetic damping ratio the maximum power occurs when the natural frequency of the cylinder measured in water is the same as the oscillatory flow frequency and is defined as lock in power for a fixed flow condition the lock in power is affected by the electromagnetic damping ratio and there exists a best electromagnetic damping ratio where the lock in power reaches its maximum value which is defined as the best power the best power is found to be independent of the mass ratio and decreases with the increase of kc number the best electromagnetic damping ratio decreases with the increase of mass ratio and increase with the increase of kc number the irregular vibration of the cylinder at kc 10 causes significant reduction in the power the power is dominated by the first harmonic vibration and is closely correlated to the phase between the force and vibration velocity keywords flow induced vibration oscillatory flow circular cylinder 1 introduction electrical power is predominantly generated through the combustion of natural resources gas coal etc in addition to depleting rapidly natural resources also release large amounts of emissions that cause environmental damage sims 2004 research into utilising renewable energy sources solar wind hydropower etc has become increasingly important to meeting the increasing demand of energy harvesting energy from fluid flow is of particular interest as it is commonly found around the world the most common devices for harvesting energy from water flows are marine turbines which require large flow velocities to operate efficiently huynh et al 2017 another new method of harvesting energy from fluid flow is through flow induced vibrations fiv of structures elastically mounted and submerged in fluid the vibration of a structure allows the fluid energy to be converted to mechanical energy and then into electrical energy through an electricity generator the common electricity generators are comprised of magnet and coil or a piezoelectric element in contrast to the traditional concept of ensuring structural safety by reducing fiv the goal of harvesting energy is to enhance structural vibration soti et al 2017 shao et al 2020a b if a circular cylinder is placed in a steady fluid flow vortex shedding occurs if the reynolds number is greater than 47 williamson 1996 the vibration of structures due to vortex shedding is referred as vortex induced vibration viv the reynolds number re is defined as re ud ν where u d and ν are the fluid velocity the diameter of the cylinder and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively if a cylinder is elastically mounted in a fluid flow and if the frequency of the vortex shedding matches with the natural frequency large amplitude vibration occurs this phenomenon is referred to as lock in or synchronization govardhan and williamson 2000 bishop and hassan 1964 hsieh et al 2017 zang and gao 2014 lock in is found to occur within a range of reduced velocities the reduced velocity is defined as u r u f n d where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder it has also been demonstrated that increasing the damping ratio leads to a reduction in the vibration amplitude and also an increase in the phase angle between the amplitude and force of a circular cylinder shiels et al 2001 silva et al 2016 chen et al 2019 harvesting energy from fiv of a cylinder in steady flow has been investigated in a number of studies lefebure et al 2020 developed an analytical model to estimate the power harvested by viv in their analytical model the power was extracted by an equivalent damping constant in the experimental study of harvesting energy using viv by gu et al 2020 the effects of the submergence depth of the cylinder is studied jadidi and zeinoddini 2020 investigated the effect of marine fouling on the energy harvesting efficiency from viv of a cylinder jiang et al 2019 2020 conducted numerical simulations to use combined pitching and swing motion of a foil in steady flow to harvesting energy they found that tip leakage flow causes a reduction of the harvested power sun et al 2020 used an adaptive damper to improve the energy harnessing of two cylinders in tandem in steady flow they reported that the adaptive damper could increase overall harnessed power of the downstream cylinder by up to 94 arionfard and nishi 2019 used the fiv of a double cylinder device that can rotate around a pivot in steady current and achieved significant improvement of energy harvesting efficiency soti and de 2020 studied energy harvesting from viv of a cylinder between two parallel plates and found that a reduction of the distance between the two walls from 4 diameters to 2 diameters increased the harvested power by 2 8 times the studies mentioned above used a constant damping coefficient to harvesting energy which are different from the real energy harvesting devices one practical method of harvesting energy through viv is using a piezoelectric element which is able to convert mechanical vibrations into electrical energy hamlehdar et al 2019 by conducting numerical simulations pan et al 2017 calculated energy harvesting through a 0 03 m diameter d vibrating piezoelectric cantilever beam in a steady water flow with a velocity of u 0 4 m s producing a peak to peak voltage of 0 35 v mehmood et al 2013 numerically simulated vibration of a circular cylinder d 0 1 1 6 mm that vibrated in the transverse direction to a steady water flow with a reduced velocity range u r 5 35 to 6 57 a piezoelectric transducer attached to the cylinder generated a maximum average power of 10 5 watts at a re of 105 the amount of electrical energy generated from fiv through piezoelectric generators is generally aimed at powering small electronics such as wearable electronic devices and gps systems howells 2009 electromagnet coils are the devices used to generate powers in large power plants soti et al 2017 proved the potential of harnessing electrical power from a vibrating cylinder equipped with a coil magnet generator through numerical simulations the cylinder was elastically mounted in a fluid flow and allowed to vibrate in the transverse direction of the flow the maximum non dimensional power of 0 13 also called efficiency was harnessed when the reynolds number was 150 with a reduced velocity of 5 2 the maximum power was found to be nearly independent on the mass ratio m which is defined as the ratio of the system mass to the displaced fluid mass however a lower mass ratio maintains a wider range of reduced velocity that can generate high power zhang et al 2017 used a coil magnet generator attached to two bluff bodies in tandem arrangements spacing from 2d to 50d with varying cross sections the results showed the maximum power extracted 26 5 efficiency was when the bluff body was upstream and occurred with the largest displacement amplitude 1 17d showing the power is correlated to its vibration majority of research towards generating energy from viv s has been focused on steady flows huge amounts of potential energy are available in ocean waves research on capturing ocean energy using large scale buoys on the ocean surface has been investigated by zhang et al 2016 and chen et al 2019 further investigations into low wave energy convertors using the sea surface have been shown by xie and zuo 2013 and viet and wang 2018 harvesting energy from viv of small scale submerged structures under waves has rarely been studied the fluid motion under waves can be generally modelled as oscillatory flow when fluid structure interaction problems are studied kazeminezhad 2013 sumer et al 1991 the acceleration of the wave motion has great potential to generate large inertia force on structures and energy vibration of cylindrical structures in oscillatory flow were studied for investigating fatigue damage wang et al 2015 but not for energy harvesting zhao et al 2012 showed that the maximum vibration amplitude of a cylinder in oscillatory flow is much larger than the vibration produced in a purely steady flow oscillatory flows introduce a new parameter that affects flow induced vibrations the keulegan carpenter k c number which is defined as kc u m t d where u m and t are the amplitude and period of the oscillatory flow velocity respectively the formation of vortices from a cylinder in oscillatory flow requires the kc number to be greater than 1 1 sarpkaya 1986 the number of vortices generated from a cylinder in every period of oscillation flow is dependent on kc sarpkaya 1986 tatsuno and bearman 1990 conducted an experimental study to study vortex flow around a circular cylinder in oscillatory flow and identified eight different regimes depending on re and kc vortex flow patterns of a cylinder in oscillatory flow can also be categorized based on the number and pattern of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in each flow period williamson and roshko 1988 taheri et al 2020 conducted a numerical study on vibration of a circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow in the streamline direction referred to as inline direction thereafter at a low reynolds number of 150 kc 5 and 10 mass ratios m 1 2 and 3 and zero damping the most interesting conclusions is that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder could be greater than the amplitude of the oscillatory flow this conclusion shows the potential of harvesting energy from oscillatory flow induced vibration in this study numerical calculations are conducted to investigate the capability of harvesting energy from the vibration of an elastically mounted circular in streamwise direction subjected to oscillatory flow numerical simulations are conducted with a reynolds number of 150 kc numbers of 5 and 10 electromagnetic damping values of 0 001 0 013 three mass ratio values of 1 2 and 3 and a wide range of frequency ratios the frequency ratio is defined as the frequency of the oscillatory flow to the natural frequency of the cylinder anagnostopoulos and iliadis 1998 2 numerical method 2 1 flow simulation fig 1 shows the device for harvesting energy from the vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow the vibration of the cylinder is confined to the inline direction streamwise direction the electricity generator comprises of a magnet oscillating inside a coil a cartesian coordinate system is defined with its origin at the static balance position of the cylinder centre and x direction pointing towards the flow direction to find out the maximum possible harvested energy the mechanical damping coefficient is set to zero however the electromagnetic force behaves as a damping force which is a function of the oscillatory velocity of the magnet the velocity of the undisturbed oscillatory flow is modelled as a sinusoidal function of time 1 u t u m sin 2 π t t where t is time and u u m and t are the velocity amplitude and the period of the oscillatory flow respectively in this paper variables with and without a prime are dimensional and non dimensional parameters respectively except for the properties of the fluid and the magnet coil system the energy harvesting system shown in fig 1 is driven by an oscillatory flow in the x direciton to calculate fluid forces the flow around the cylinder is simulated by solving the imcompressible two dimensional navier stokes ns equations when simulating the flow the motion of the cylinder makes the computational domain deform continuously to account for the deformation of the computational domain the arbitrary langrangian eurlerian ale scheme is used zhao and cheng 2010 when solving ns equations the ale scheme ensures that the computational mesh is not overly distorted by moving the computational mesh nodes by an arbitrary way that ensures the quality of the mesh as a result the effects of the mesh moving should be included in the convection terms of the ns equations the fluid velocity u v the time t and the pressure p are non dimensionalized as u v u v u m t t u m d and p p ρ u m 2 respectively where u and v are the fluid velocity components in the x and y directions respectively based on the above non dimensionalisation method the non dimensional period t is the same as the keulegan carpenter kc number i e t k c u m t d the non dimensional ns equations in the ale scheme are expressed as 2 u x v y 0 3 u t u u ˆ u x v v ˆ u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 4 v t u u ˆ v x v v ˆ v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where u ˆ and v ˆ are the non dimensional velocity of the mesh movement in the x and y directions respectively and the reynolds number is defined using the amplitude of the oscillatory flow as r e u m d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem developed by zhao et al 2007 is used to solve the ns equations a square computational domain with a non dimensional size of 110 shown in fig 1 is used and the static balance position of the cylinder is located at its centre the blockage ratio cylinders diameter to computational domain size in the cross flow direction of 0 0091 is much smaller than the recommended maximum blockage ratio of 0 2 by anagnostopoulos and minear 2004 the boundary conditions for simulating the fluid flow are specified as follows if there is no cylinder the velocity is spatially constant and the solution of eq 3 is p xωcos ωt where ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the flow in the numerical simulations the velocity and pressure on the left and right boundary are given as u sin 2πt t and p xωcos ωt respectively the velocity and pressure boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries does not have effects on the results if the computational domain is sufficiently large the cylinder surface is smooth and therefore the no slip boundary condition is applied i e the velocity of the fluid on the cylinders surface is the same as the cylinders vibration velocity the top and bottom boundaries are symmetric boundaries where v 0 u y 0 and p y 0 after each computational time step the mesh is deformed due to the updated position of the cylinder and the equation for calculating the displacement of the mesh is zhao and cheng 2010 5 γ s i 0 where s i is the displacement of the nodal points of the computational mesh in the x i direction γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation which is calculated as γ 1 a and a is the area of the element eq 5 is solved by the conventional galerkin fem and its boundary condition is that s i is the same as the displacement of the cylinder on the cylinder surface and zero on rest boundaries the computational domain is descritized into 37040 four node quadrilateral finite elements and fig 2 shows the mesh near the cylinder the surface of the cylinder is divided into 160 finite elements with a size of 0 0008 in the radial direction of the cylinder the computational time step is δ t 0 0025 the computational domain the mesh and the comptuational time step used in this study are the same as those used by taheri et al 2020 who conducted detailed domain size dependency mesh dependency and time step dependency studies for oscillatory flow induced vibration of a cylinder without an energy harvesting device at re 150 and m 1 and converged results were achieved as adding an electricity generater in the system reduces the vibration ampltude of the cylinder the domain size mesh density and time step should be satisfactory for obtaining converged results for energy harvesting 2 2 power generation within each computational time step the fluid forces on the cylinder can be calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress over the surface of the cylinder after the ns equations are solved then the motion of the cylinder can be predicted by solving the equation of motion in addition to the forces from the fluid spring and mechanical damper the cylinder also experiences the resistence force from the magnet coil device also called electromagnetic device the coil of the electromagnetic device shown in fig 1 has non dimensional radius a non dimensional length l and number of turns n the dimensional force on the cylinder from the electromagnetic device f em is calculated by a single magnetic dipole g approximated by donoso et al 2010 and simulated by soti et al 2017 6 f em c m 0 g 2 x where 7 c m 0 u m 2 n 2 r d 4 and g is a non dimensional parameter defined as 8 g 2 π a 2 l 1 a 2 x cm l 2 2 3 2 1 a 2 x cm l 2 2 3 2 where r is electrical load resistance in eq 8 all the length dimensions are non dimensional so is the parameter g consider the force from the electromagnetic device the dimensional equation of the motion of the cylinder is 9 m x c c m 0 g 2 x k x f x where x and x are the acceleration and velocity of the cylinder respectively m is the mass of the system c is the mechancial damping constant k is the spring constant and f x is the fluid force in the x direction from eq 9 it can be seen the energy absorption by the electromagnetic device is equivalent to energy dissipation of a damper with a damping coefficient of c m 0 g 2 which is a function of time the non dimensional format of eq 9 is 10 x 4 π u r ζ ζ m 0 g 2 x 4 π 2 u r 2 x 2 c f x π m where ζ c 4 π f n is the mechanical damping ratio u r u m f n d is the reduced velocity and ζ m 0 c m 0 4 π m f n is defined as electromagnetic damping ratio and c fx f x ρ d u m 2 2 is the non dimensional force in the x direction the non dimensional electromagnetic force is 11 c fe c m 0 g 2 x ρ d u m 2 2 eq 10 is solved by the fourth order runge kutta method after the velocity of the cylinder is obtained the non dimensional power received by the generator is defined as 12 p e t f em x 1 2 ρ u m 3 d 2 π 2 m ζ m 0 g 2 x 2 u r the averaged power of the generator is obtained by averaging the power over time as 13 p e 1 n t 0 n t p e t d t if the motion of the cylinder is perfectly periodic the averaged power can be found using only one period of data n 1 in eq 12 otherwise the averaged power should be obtained by performing temporal averaging over many periods of flow 3 numerical results 3 1 numeircal validation taheri et al 2020 conducted validation of the numerical model for simulating oscillatory flow induced vibration of a cylinder without an energy harvesting device at re 150 ζ 0 kc 5 and a wide range of natural freqeuncy ratios the results agreed well with the results calculated by the open source spectral hp element code nektar developed by cantwell et al 2015 no available experimenal or numerical data has been found in literature regarding energy haversing from oscillatory flow induced vibrations to validate the numerical model energy harvesting through the electromagnetic device driven by flow induced vibration in steady current is simulated under exactly the same condition as used by soti et al 2017 the cylinder is allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction only the reynolds number is 150 mass ratio is 2 and the reduced velocity measured in the fluid is 5 2 the reduced velocity measured in the fluid is defined as u rw u f nw d where f nw is the natural frequency measured in fluid and its relationship with f n is f nw f n 1 1 c a m where c a is the added mass coefficient the value of added mass coefficient is c a 1 same as the value used by soti et al 2017 throuth experiments khalak and williamson 1999 also reported that c a 1 based on the relationship between f nw and f n the reduced velocity measured in vacuum corresponding to u rw 5 2 is u r 4 25 which was used in the simulations fig 3 shows the comparison of the average power acquired as a function of the electromagnetic damping co efficient soti et al 2017 the calculated p e values in the whole range of ζ m0 are very close to the numerical results by soti et al 2017 3 2 power this study investigates the amount of harvested energy through the vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in oscillating flow which is confined to vibrate in the streamwise direction only a 2d numerical investigation is performed with a low reynolds number of 150 to avoid any uncertainties caused by turbulence and to increase the reliability of results simulations are conducted for two k c values of 5 and 10 three mass ratios m 1 2 and 3 and six electromagnetic damping coefficients 0 001 0 003 0 007 0 008 0 009 and 0 13 each simulation is conducted for reduced velocities in the range of 1 20 which corresponds to a frequency ratio f of 1 2 for kc 10 and 1 4 for kc 5 the frequency ratio f f w f n ur kc where f w 1 t is the frequency of the oscillatory flow each numerical simulation was conducted for at least t 100 where t t t is the period number majority of simulations reaching equilibrium when t 20 fig 4 shows variations of the time averaged power p e with the frequency ratio f it is worth noting that the maximum power is generated at a frequency ratio less than 1 for all the cases the ratio of oscillatory flow frequency to the natural frequency measured in the fluid f is defined as f f w f nw and f 1 is marked in fig 4 it can be seen that the maximum energy occurs when the oscillatory flow frequency and the natural frequency measured in fluid synchronize in all the simulated cases it is also observed that kc 5 generated more maximum power when f 1 than kc 10 this is because a smaller period has greater flow acceleration to create inertia force on the cylinder at the maximum simulated frequency ratio f 4 and 2 for kc 5 and 10 respectively the averaged power increases with the increase of ζ m0 the averaged power peaks at f 1 for all the cases with kc 5 however for kc 10 the averaged power oscillates near f 1 at m 2 and 3 and a distinct peak cannot be identified the reason why the averaged power oscillates near f 1 can be explained by fig 5 where time histories of the instantaneous power and lift coefficient and the instaneous flow patterns for kc 10 m 3 ζ m 0 0 008 and f 0 8 are shown to facilitate the discussion the time from t n to t n 1 is referred to as n th period of the flow because the power is generated by the inline force the lift force does not have any contribution to it the lift force is shown in fig 5 b to demonstrate the degree of symmetry of the flow the lift force is zero if the flow is symmetric with respect to the x axis defined in fig 1 and non zero if flow is asymmetric the overall observation from fig 5 is that the power increases whenever the lift coefficient is small and decreases whenever the lift coefficient is increased initially the lift coefficient is zero and the power oscillates periodically with a large amplitude between t 30 and 42 the lift coefficient is increased but the power is decreased between t 42 and 50 the lift coefficient is reduced and the power is increased taheri et al 2020 found that due to the vibration of the cylinder the flow is very different from that of a stationary cylinder the irregular oscillation of the power and lift coefficient is because the flow pattern changes between a nearly symmetric pattern to an asymmetric pattern as shown in fig 5 c f where the power is small and lift coefficient is large in fig 5 c and f the roughly symmetric flow pattern resembles the symmetric flow pattern s reported by taheri et al 2020 in fig 5 d and e where the power is large and lift coefficient is small the flow pattern is in a typical regime d flow tatsuno and bearman 1990 where one pair of vortices labelled as a and b respectively in the figure are shed from the cylinder in one period of flow if the flow is aperiodic the power generated from different flow periods are different the maximum drag and lift coefficients a cfx a cfy the maximum amplitude of the velocity in the inline direction a vx and the power averaged over each individual period defined as p e to differentiate it form p e that is averaged over many periods for an exemplary case with aperiodic vibration are calculated and fig 6 shows their variation with time it can be seen that the inline force a cfx and inline velocity a vx increase simultaneously and their variation trend is opposite with that of cross flow force a cfy increases of a cfx and a vx in the same time cause increase of and vice versa the average power p e varies between about 0 4 and 0 55 fig 7 shows time histories of the non dimensional power and non dimensional lift force c fx of some exemplary cases with irregular vibration for kc 10 m 3 ζ m 0 0 008 the power extracted by the electromagnetic damper is always positive based on eq 12 the periodicity of the flow can be clearly identified through the time histories of the lift force in fig 7 b the oscillation of the lift force is perfectly periodic as f 0 2 0 3 and 0 7 the power changes periodically between peak values and zero in all the cases in the case of f 0 85 the time history of the lift coefficient is very irregular and as a result the peak value of the power changes from period to period when calculating time averaged power p e data within sufficient number of flow periods at least 50 periods are used for irregular vibration case such as f 0 85 in fig 7 b to clearly see how the power p e varies with time fig 8 shows the time histories of p e x 2 and g 2 with time within three flow periods for kc 10 m 3 ζ m 0 0 008 and f 0 8 based on eq 12 p e is the product of g 2 x 2 and a constant instead of following sinusoidal function of time p e reaches zero at four times during each period twice when x 2 0 and twice when g 2 0 it can be seen that g 2 and x 2 are roughly out of phase with each other as a result the power p e and x 2 do not reach their maximum velues at the same time the variation of p e within each period for other simulated cases for both kc 5 and 10 are very similar to that shown in fig 8 because the velocity is nearly a sinusoidal funciton of time as discussed later on fig 4 demonstrates that the maximum power generally occurs at f 1 for all the electromagnetic damping ratios in some exceptional cases where the vibration is irregular the power at f 1 is slightly reduced simulations for a constant f 1 and a wide range of ζ m0 are conducted and the computed mean power is shown in fig 9 a the peak value of power for a specific kc and m in fig 9 a is the maximum possible power that can be harvested from the device the following observation can be found from fig 9 a 1 for a constant kc the maximum power for different m values are nearly the same but the ζ m0 where the maximum power occurs defined as the best ζ m0 hereafter decreases with the increase of m 2 the maximum power decreases with the increase of the kc number in practical engineering the flow condition for a specific location should be fixed fig 9 a indicates that to increase the harvested power the diameter of the cylinder should increase corresponding to a reduction of kc 3 if the mass ratio is fixed the value of ζ m0 where the mean power reaches its maximum increases fig 9 b represents the variation of mean power with the mass damping parameter m ζ m0 which is defined as the product of the mass ratio and damping ratio at f 1 it is interesting to see that both the maximum power and the mass damping parameter where the maximum power occurs defined as the best m ζ m0 hereafter are nearly independent on the mass ratio however the maximum power decreases and the value of where m ζ m0 reaches its maximum increases with the increase of kc number 3 3 correlation between force and vibration amplitude due to the non linear interaction between the fluid and the cylinder the inline force and the vibration velocity are not monochromatic and include higher order harmonics to understand the contribution of power generation of each harmonic vibration harmonic decomposition is applied to the force and velocity of the cylinder as 14 ϕ t k 1 ϕ k sin k ω t θ k where epsilon represents the sum of all the harmonics subscript k stands for the k th harmonic ϕ represents velocity or force and ε k is the phase of the k th harmonic the non dimensional power transferred from the fluid to the cylinder can be calculated by 15 p f x x 1 2 ρ u m 3 d c fx x if the mechanical damping factor ζ 0 time averaged power p and p e are the same i e all the fluid power is transferred to the generator the contribution of the k th harmonic to the power is calculated by 16 p k 1 t 0 t c fx k sin k ω t θ fx k x k sin k ω t θ x k 1 2 c fx k x k cos δ θ k where δ θ k θ fx k θ x k is the phase difference between the force and velocity of the k th order fig 10 shows variations of the first to fourth harmonics of the velocity of the cylinder with the frequency ratio for two representative cases for each kc number and fig 11 shows the variations of the first to fourth harmonics of the inline forces with the frequency ratio for the same cases as in fig 10 the amplitudes of the k th harmonic of the velocity and inline force are represented by x m k and c fx k respectively it can be seen that both velocity and force are dominated by the first harmonics except at small freqeuncy ratios at very small frequency ratios f 0 25 for kc 10 the amplitude of the third harmonic of vibration velocity x is nearly the same as the first harmonic and both are small for kc 10 m 2 and ζ m0 0 007 the contribution of third harmonics of cylinder velocity and inline force exist in a wide range of freuqency ratio until f 2 fig 12 shows the contribution of the first to fourth harmonics of the power for kc 10 and m 2 the first harmonic power is nearly the same as the total power and the contributions from the second to fourth harmonics are negligibly small except for the case of kc 10 m 1 and ζ m0 0 001 where the maximium contribution of the third harmonic is about 0 005 which is 4 195 of the total power because the power is dominated by the first harmonic vibration fig 13 shows the variation of the phase difference δθ 1 between the first harmonic inline force and the first vibration displacement based on eq 16 for specific amplitudes of force amplitude and vibration velocity the power is zero if the phase between the force and vibration velocity δθ 1 is 90 the power increases as δθ 1 decrease and becomes maximum at δθ 1 0 if the damping ζ m0 is zero fig 13 e and f the phase difference of first harmonics are either 90 or 90 because there is no net energy transfer between the fluid and the cylinder when ζ m0 is non zero the first harmonic phase difference δθ 1 is nearly 90 at very small frequency ratios resulting in a nearly zero power as shown in fig 4 it is interesting that δθ 1 is 0 at f 1 for all the simulated cases indicating the phase synchronization between the force and vibration velocity however the maximum power occurs at f 1 instead of f 1 as shown in fig 4 the maximum power does not occur at f 1 because of the significant reduction of the force it can be seen in fig 11 that the inline force reduces significantly at f 1 compared with those at f 1 fig 14 shows the variation of the vibration amplitude x m of the cylinder with the frequency ratio where x m is defined as x m max x the amplitude of oscillatory fluid particles in undisturbed oscillatory flow a m are marked in fig 14 when the electromagnetic damping ratio ζ m0 0 the amplitude of the cylinder could be greater than a m because the vibration of the cylinder and the oscillation of the flow are out of phase with each other taheri et al 2020 the maximum vibration amplitude reduces with the increase of ζ m0 by comparing fig 4 with fig 14 it can be seen that vibration amplitude x m increases with the decrease of ζ m0 but smaller ζ m0 creates larger vibration amplitude but not larger power it can be seen that the vibration amplitudes for different values of ζ m0 tend to converge towards a constant value as f approaches infinity fig 15 shows the variation of standard deviation of the inline force coefficient c fx with the frequency ratio f for all the simulated cases c fx reaches its minimum value at f 1 if ζ m0 is less than 0 003 the minimum vlaue of c fx does not exist as ζ m0 0 007 it can be seen in figs 14 and 15 that at the largest simulated f both the vibration amplitude and c fx change little with the change of ζ m0 however the power at the largest f increases with the increase of ζ m0 based on eq 16 the power is dependent on not only the ampliude of the force and velocity but also the phase between the force and the vibration velocity it can be seen in fig 13 that the first harmonic phase difference δθ 1 decreases with the increase of ζ m0 for constant amplitudes of force and vibration displacement a decrease in δθ 1 causes increase in power based on eq 16 the force is minimum at f 1 at ζ m0 0 003 but the power is not because phase δθ 1 is zero taheri et al 2020 have demonstrated that the vortex flow pattern around the cylinder is dependent on the effective keulegan carpenter number kc eff which is defined based on the relative flow velocity to the moving cylinder because of the relative motion between the fluid and the cylinder kc eff changes with f and so does the vortex flow pattern the vortex flow patterns have been discussed in detail by taheri et al 2020 and will not be repeated here 4 conclusions energy harvesting through the vibration of a circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow is simulated using two dimensional numerical simulations the energy extraction device is an electromagnetic device comprising electric coils and a magnet in the numerical simulation the energy extracted by the device is achieved by a so called electromagnetic damping ratio ζ m0 which varies with time simulations are conducted for kc 5 and 10 mass ratios of 1 2 and 3 and a wide range of frequency ratio f and electromagnetic damping ratio ζ m0 the main conclusions are summarized as follows for specific kc and ζ m0 the maximum power occurs at f 1 the frequency ratio based on the natural frequency in water however the maximum vibration amplitude does not occur at f 1 but at a f value greater than 1 the best ζ m0 decreases with the increase of m for a specific kc number both the maximum power and the best mass damping parameter m ζ m0 are nearly independent on the mass ratio harmonic analysis of the vibration velocity and inline force show that the vibration is dominated by the first harmonic of vibration velocity and inline force the phase difference δθ 1 between the first harmonic inline force and vibration velocity has a significant effect on the power it is close to 90 when f is very small increases with the increase of f crosses zero at f 1 and remains smaller than 90 at the largest f for all the simulated cases at the maximum simulated f the phase decreases with the increase in ζ m0 resulting in increase of the power since the maximum power occurs at f 1 for specific kc and m simulations for ζ m0 0 001 to 0 013 and a constant of f 1 are simulated to find out the maximum achievable power the maximum achievable power is found to be independent of m for a constant kc however the ζ m0 where the maximum power occurs defined as the best ζ m0 decreases with the increase of m an increase of kc number causes a reduction of the maximum achievable power and increase of the best ζ m0 at kc 10 the vibration is found to change from period to period when f is around 1 and the aperiodicity of the vibration causes significant reduction of the power the harvested power varies significantly from period to period because of the aperiodicity of the vibration credit authorship contribution statement erfan taheri investigation validation

20178,helical strakes are the most common vibration suppression devices for cylindrical structures undergoing vortex shedding many problems with the performance of helical strakes on flow induced vibration fiv fatigue damage suppression of two tandem cylinders have not been solved yet the effectiveness of three strand helical strakes with a pitch of 17 5d and a height of 0 25d where d is the structural diameter in suppressing fatigue damage of two tandem long flexible cylinders undergoing fiv was investigated in this paper a constant spacing ratio center to center distance to cylinder diameter of 8 0 was selected four cases of the two cylinders i e naked naked naked straked straked naked and straked straked were executed under subcritical reynolds number re 1 6 104 based on the strain responses from the experimental tests fatigue damage was estimated by using s n curves and miner s rule to highlight the role of helical strakes in fiv fatigue damage suppression an isolated naked cylinder was considered as a benchmark it is shown that helical strakes exert substantially the same effect on fiv fatigue suppression of the upstream cylinder as they do on an isolated cylinder the upstream cylinder significantly affects the performance of helical strakes on fiv fatigue suppression of the downstream cylinder both vortex breaking and prevention of interaction of two shear layers predominate the primary mechanism of the downstream straked cylinder when the upstream one is naked which reinforces its cross flow fatigue damage and hereby lowers the performance of helical strakes in contrast due to wake induced vibration wiv the downstream straked cylinder laid behind a straked one might encounter much more serious fatigue damages in both the cross flow and in line directions than the case when the upstream cylinder is naked keywords flow induced vibration fiv fatigue damage suppression helical strakes multiple flexible cylinders tandem arrangement 1 introduction cylindrical structures e g marine risers subsea pipelines and mooring cables frequently experience significant flow induced vibration fiv under the action of current flows in ocean engineering fiv of multiple cylinders leads to intricate dynamic responses and thus becomes one of the most critical issues in engineering applications fiv responses of a group of cylinders have been investigated in many pioneering studies chen 1987 pettigrew et al 1998 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2012 xu et al 2019 2021a b zdravkovich 1985 zhu et al 2021 high amplitude fiv coupled with complex wake behaviors and strong mutual interference among cylindrical structures may cause serious structural fatigue damage helical strakes have been successfully utilized to suppress the vortex induced vibration viv response of an isolated cylinder quen et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 zhu et al 2020a 2020b they can destroy regular vortex shedding prevent the formation of vortices and suppress coincident shedding normal to the flow direction gao et al 2016 in addition helical strake can increase the vortex formation length and reduce the correlation length along with the cylinder by disturbing the synchronization of the flow separation korkischko and meneghini 2010 recently large numbers of studies have been done to optimize the geometric shapes pitch height and coverage and to improve the vibration suppression efficiency of helical strakes gao et al 2016 ishihara and li 2020 li et al 2020 liu et al 2019 ranjith et al 2016 xu et al 2017 2018b a huge effort has been made on the performance of helical strakes on the structural responses including displacement response frequency response mean drag force coefficient etc quen et al 2014 examined the effectiveness of helical strakes in suppressing viv of an isolated flexible cylinder by varying the pitch and height it was found that the variation of pitch affected the occurrence of lock in region and prevented the frequency from switching into a higher order mode and that the increase of strake height could narrow the lock in region blumberg et al 2012 experimentally investigated the fiv of a downstream cylinder fitted with three start helical strakes height of 0 12d width of 0 04d and pitch of 10d at various tandem center to center distances 1 5d 2 0d 3 0d and 4 0d in their tests the upstream cylinder was rigid bare and fixed and the downstream body was limited to vibrate only in the cross flow cf direction xu et al 2018b carried out a similar experimental investigation on fiv responses of two tandem cylinders with and without helical strakes more details about the experimental cases of blumberg et al 2012 and xu et al 2018b are shown in table 1 and the displacement response results in xu et al 2018b are displayed in table 2 li et al 2020 considered the fiv responses of two tandem risers i e the upstream riser was naked and the downstream one was fitted with three strand helical strakes in a uniform flow it was found that the interference effect did influence the fiv suppression efficiency of the downstream straked cylinder at different spacing ratios center to center distance to structural diameter resulting in higher vibrating amplitude than an isolated straked cylinder furthermore studies on fiv responses of two tandem cylinders abound hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2006 papaioannou et al 2008 huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 xu et al 2018a as regards elastically mounted rigid cylinders assi et al 2006 conducted an experimental investigation on the fiv of two tandem cylinders the vibrations were limited to the cf direction it was found that the galloping like phenomenon displacement response increased continuously with the increasing reduced velocity occurred at the downstream cylinder when spacing ratio ranging from 3 0 to 5 6 papaioannou et al 2008 numerically studied the fiv of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem arrangement with spacing ratios of 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 at reynolds number of 160 it was found that the maximum amplitude of the downstream cylinder increased when the two cylinders were set at a distance where the wake pattern displayed the reattachment phenomenon in contrast concerning the case of tandem flexible cylinders huera huarte and bearman 2010 utilized digital particle image velocimetry dpiv in the visualization of the wake of two tandem flexible cylinders which were free to oscillate in both the cf and in line il directions it was revealed that the il spacing ratio exerted a significant influence on the cf displacement amplitude of the upstream cylinder and that the closer the two cylinders were the larger the response of the upstream body was it is worth mentioning that wake reattachment still existed when the spacing ratio was 4 0 wang et al 2017 numerically examined the fiv responses of two tandem flexible cylinders by a fluid structure interaction fsi method under diverse spacing ratios at a reynolds number of 500 typical wake induced vibration wiv was detected on the downstream cylinder when the spacing ratio was large enough for the detachment of vortices on the upstream body xu et al 2018a 2020b systematically investigated the fiv responses and fatigue damages of two tandem flexible cylinders at reynolds number of 800 16 000 wake shielding effect and wake induced flutter were both discovered on the downstream cylinder with the variation of spacing ratio several pronounced results indicated that the response of the downstream cylinder was dominated by lower vibration frequencies and vibration modes due to the wake shielding effect when the spacing ratio was lower than 8 0 moreover wake induced flutter only caused il fatigue damage enlargement of the downstream cylinder without the increase of cf fatigue damage when spacing ratio increased than 10 0 nevertheless fewer studies focus on the effect of helical strakes on fiv fatigue damages of two tandem cylinders for an isolated cylinder trim et al 2005 investigated the fatigue damage and the viv suppression of a riser model partially or entirely fitted with helical strakes in both uniform and linearly sheared flows it was shown that there was no significant enhancement in viv suppression when the coverage was increased to 82 vandiver et al 2006 explored the viv fatigue damages of a bare pipe and a straked one in a uniform flow it was indicated that the reduction of fatigue damage could be attributed to the suppression of a third harmonic component in frequency gao et al 2016 experimentally examined the effect of helical strake coverage on viv of a flexible riser in both uniform and linearly sheared flows the maximum fatigue damages were considered under four different cases i e 25 50 75 and 100 strake coverage it was concluded that cf suppression efficiency could increase gradually to its maximum value of 96 in the uniform flow when 100 strake coverage was adopted and this value became 99 in the linearly sheared flow the fatigue damage suppression of an isolated cylinder by helical strakes has attracted much attention vandiver et al 2006 tognarelli et al 2008 sun et al 2014 but the fatigue suppression efficiency of helical strakes on two neighboring cylinders remains unknown existing studies have mostly involved the fatigue damage of an isolated cylinder fitted with helical strakes without addressing the fatigue suppression efficiency much dedication has been made to viv response mitigation but the response results cannot play a crucial role in fatigue analysis because the fatigue damage shows different features from the displacement response hence several questions about the fatigue damage of straked cylinders are still unanswered for example i what are the differences between performances of helical strakes on the fiv fatigue damage of an isolated cylinder and a pair of tandem cylinders and ii how are the fiv fatigue suppression efficiencies of the upstream and downstream cylinders with and without helical strakes therefore in this paper fiv fatigue damages of two tandem flexible cylinders with or without helical strakes are urgent to be addressed based on our previous experimental tests xu et al 2018b additionally fatigue damage suppression efficiencies of the two cylinders are calculated to broaden the understanding of the performance of helical strakes for the multiple cylinders overall the novelty contributions of the present study are as follows i performance of helical strakes on fiv fatigue damage characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders has been discussed ii effects of helical strakes have been quantified by fatigue damage suppression efficiency and they show a prominent discrepancy between the upstream and downstream cylinders 2 fatigue damage estimation method it is widely known that one of the existing theories of fatigue damage calculation is the linear cumulative damage theory of fatigue which postulates as 1 d τ i 1 d τ i where d τ is the total fatigue damage once the stresses σ z t are obtained the fatigue damage can be estimated by miner s rule miner 1945 which assumes that the total damage can be obtained by adding the damages from each cycle of stress lee et al 2005 it requires the estimation of the number of stress cycles under the corresponding stress range in the signal when an input stress signal σ t is processed the number of stress cycles n i and the stress range σ i can be extracted using a cycle counting method i e the rain flow counting method this method mainly identifies the turning points on the stress signal the stress ranges can be given by the difference between the consecutive turning points the number of stress ranges over the length of the stress signal is counted moreover the maximum number of stress cycles before structural failure n i is obtained from the s n curve of the material which quantifies the relationship between n i and σ i 2 log n i log a m log σ i where a and m are material parameters of the s n curve determined from fatigue tests thus the total fatigue damage d τ can be obtained based on stress cycles n i with a stress range σ i over the length of the stress signal as 3 d τ i 1 n i n i i 1 n i σ i m a d curve from the det norske veritas dnv regulations is applied in the following calculation and discussion dnvgl rp c203 2016 because it is valid for specimens in seawater exposed to free corrosion and has been verified effectiveness by many researchers baarholm et al 2006 xue et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the above parameters are correspondingly taken as m 3 0 logā 11 687 as listed in table 3 3 experimental arrangement 3 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in the 137 0 m 7 0 m 3 3 m length width depth towing tank at tianjin university china see fig 1 the towing tank was equipped with a towing carriage which is used to tow the tested cylinder models along the water to simulate a uniform flow the towing velocity u varied from 0 05 to 1 00 m s with an increment of 0 05 m s the corresponding reynolds number re ud ν where d is the diameter of the naked cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water ranged from 800 to 16 000 the experimental facility consisted of several components including the supporting structure the vertical supporting rods the supporting plates and the cylinder models with or without helical strakes etc as shown in fig 2 the cylinder models were connected via universal joints on one end for free vibration in both the cf and il directions tensioners were set up to adjust the axial tension and load cells were installed to keep it equal to a constant value i e 450 n more details about this facility can be referred to xu et al 2018a the cylinder model was made of a copper pipe covered by a silicone tube making them have a bending stiffness of ei 17 45 nm2 where e is young s modulus and i is the moment of inertia the naked cylinder model was 5 60 m in length and 16 mm in diameter leading to an aspect ratio length to diameter l d of 350 moreover the mass ratio the structural mass to the mass of the displaced water m 4 m s ρπd 2 where m s is the mass of the naked cylinder per unit length and ρ is the water density was approximately 1 90 xu et al 2017 2018a b table 4 lists the key parameters of the cylinder models in the tests fig 3 demonstrates the tested cylinder models without and with helical strakes respectively for the straked cylinders their outer surfaces were fully covered by the three strand helical strakes with strake pitch p of 17 5d and strake height h of 0 25d whose effectiveness in viv suppression of an isolated cylinder has been validated allen 1995 to measure the cf and il strain signals along the cylinder axis fourteen pairs of strain gauges were installed on the external surface of the copper pipe at seven measurement positions furthermore the distance between the two tandem cylinders from centre to centre was kept as a constant i e t 8 0d during the tests xu et al 2018b hereafter we abbreviate the upstream naked cylinder as unc for the sake of simplicity correspondingly the downstream naked cylinder upstream straked cylinder downstream straked cylinder and isolated cylinder can be abbreviated as dnc usc dsc and iso respectively hence either of the two cylinders is naked or both of them are naked or straked can result in four different cases for the following discussion i e naked naked naked straked straked naked and straked straked see table 5 to highlight the performance of helical strakes the case of an isolated naked cylinder was considered as a benchmark for comparison 3 2 data processing a filter was employed to eliminate the irrelevant frequency components from the strain signals low frequency components derived from the carriage motion were filtered out with a cut off of 1 0 hz and the inevitable high frequency noise was removed with a cut off of 40 0 hz the structural strain data measured from gauges were discrete thus it is necessary to reconstruct continuous strain function for the following fatigue damage estimation the modal analysis approach proposed by lie and kaasen 2006 is utilized to reconstruct the strain responses in the present study this approach has been verified for applicability in reconstructing the displacement response of flexible cylinders undergoing vortex shedding lie and kaasen 2006 gao et al 2015 li et al 2020 furthermore our previous works have employed this approach for the reconstruction of displacement based on the measured strain successfully xu et al 2017 2018a 2018b assuming that the tensioned cylinder deviates little from its vertical axis and that the dynamic process of its motion is approximately linear the time and space dependent displacement therefore can be composed of a series of mode shapes or eigenfunctions herein we show the cf displacement reconstruction process as an example which reads 4 y cf z t κ 1 ϕ κ z w κ t where y cf z t is the cf displacement z is the spanwise coordinate along the cylinder axis t represents time ϕ κ z and w κ t are the mode shape and modal weight respectively and κ is the mode number κ 1 2 3 xu et al 2018a due to the pined pined boundary condition a set of orthogonal modes satisfying the geometric boundary condition is used meirovitch 2010 5 ϕ κ z sin π κ z l cf strain response can be reconstructed based on the quantitative relation between strain and displacement 6 ε cf z t r y cf z t where yʺcf z t is the second derivative of y cf z t in respect of z and r is the radius of the copper pipe by substituting eqs 4 and 5 into eq 6 cf stress response is derived as 7 σ

of sampling time points hence w reads as 9 w λ 1 σ ω t ω ω t 1 by which both the cf displacement function y cf z t and stress function σ cf z t can be solved one can also refer to our previous papers for more details xu et al 2017 2018a b 4 results and discussion this section focuses on the fiv fatigue damage characteristics and corresponding fatigue suppression efficiencies of two tandem flexible cylinders preliminarily several parameters used for the following discussion are defined as 1 the reduced velocity 10 v r u f 1 d where u is the flow velocity that was implemented by the towing carriage and f 1 is the fundamental eigenfrequency of the naked cylinder in still water which has been estimated from the free decay tests xu et al 2018a ma et al 2019 the fundamental frequency can also be obtained by the following formula 11 f 1 1 2 l t a m π l 2 e i m where t a is the constant axial tension which was artificially exerted by tensioners and load cells in our experiments to keep the f 1 at a specific value t a 450n in the present study ei is the bending stiffness of the cylinder l is the total length of the cylinder and m is the total mass per unit length including structural mass m s and added fluid mass m a where m a is the equivalent mass caused by surrounding fluid and it participates in vibration m a c a ρπd 2 4 c a is the added mass coefficient herein c a 1 0 is

respectively preliminarily three academic words i e wake induced vibration wiv wake shielding effect and shear layers reattachment are necessary to clearly define wiv as shown in fig 4 a is one of the canonical vibration patterns for multiple cylinders experiencing fiv especially for the downstream cylinder in a tandem arrangement assi et al 2010 once suggested that wiv response was characterized by a sharp increase of amplitude persisting to high reduced velocities its mechanism is sustained by unsteady vortex structure interactions that input energy into the system as the downstream cylinder oscillated across the wake wiv requires the interaction between structures and vortices which are coming from the upstream wake or the upstream vortex shedding to sustain more details can be referred to zdravkovich 1977 assi et al 2006 2010 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 the wake shielding effect as depicted in fig 4b is a flow velocity deficit phenomenon caused by the shadow effect behind an upstream body usually leading to lower amplitudes and lower order dominant modes for downstream bodies in other words the wake shielding effect is one of the ubiquitous fluid phenomena in multiple cylinders subjected to fiv it is not a vibration form but a flow field effect many researchers have discussed its features e g vandiver 1983 huse 1993 huse and kleiven 2000 and ma et al 2019 finally shear layers reattachment is a wake flow coupling phenomenon in the tandem arrangement sumner 2010 thoroughly discussed shear layer reattachment behaviour in two tandem rigid cylinders wake flow fields it occurs when the two cylinders are placed sufficiently far the shear layer from the upstream cylinder can no longer enclose its downstream counterpart but reattach onto its upper or lower surface as portrayed in fig 4c moreover shear layer reattachment involves a wide variety of fluid behaviours including wiv wake induced flutter etc intricate reattachment principally involves the reattachment of the shear layers from the upstream cylinder and the formation and shedding of eddies in the gap region between the two cylinders in a nutshell wiv is a vibration pattern of cylinders whilst the wake shielding effect is a general feature of the flow field of multiple cylinders and shear layers reattachment is a flow field phenomenon characterized by wake flow interaction 4 1 fatigue damage discussion 4 1 1 two naked cylinders to highlight the effectiveness of helical strakes the results of two tandem naked cylinders are discussed above all a series of tests on fiv responses of two tandem naked cylinders have been conducted previously and some important findings have been reported in xu et al 2018a it was concluded that the main fiv mechanism of two tandem flexible cylinders was the wake shielding effect which causes lower order dominant vibration mode and lower dominant vibration frequency on the downstream cylinder hereinafter the nth order vibration mode refers to the nth synchronization between the vortex shedding frequency f s f s st u d where st is strouhal number and the nth natural eigenfrequency the dominant vibration mode is a resonant vibration mode whose weight tops the most in all participating modes due to the coexistence of many modes for lock in vibration of long flexible cylinders fig 5 demonstrates the cf and il maximum fatigue damages of two naked cylinders the dotted line refers to the case of an isolated cylinder for comparison the downstream cylinder shows lower maximum fatigue damage values than the upstream one because of the wake shielding effect xu et al 2018a and the upstream cylinder behaves similarly to an isolated cylinder in both the cf and il directions xu et al 2020b have discussed the fatigue damage characteristics of two naked flexible tandem cylinders with t d 8 0 the wake shielding effect occupies the primary reason that the downstream cylinder undergoes less serious fatigue damage at this spacing ratio the further mechanism behind the wake shielding effect is the shear layer reattachment pattern between the two cylinders reattachment frequently occurs to the downstream cylinder in a tandem arrangement when t d 4 0 8 0 which has been verified in many existing papers brika and laneville 1999 papaioannou et al 2008 huera huarte and gharib 2011 hence the shear layers emitting from the upstream cylinder simultaneously impact and attach on the upper and lower surfaces of the downstream 1 at t d 8 0 causing a slight vibration attenuation and hereby a fatigue damage mitigation fig 6 shows the damage distribution along the axis in the cf and il directions respectively it is known that the fatigue damage distribution trend resembles the root mean square rms displacement along the axis the rms displacement reads 14 y rms z 1 s i 1 s y 2 z t i x rms z 1 s i 1 s x 2 z t i where y rms and x rms represent the cf rms displacement and il rms displacement respectively z is the position along the axis of the cylinder s is the number of time samples and t refers to time as presented in xu et al 2018a the dominant modes of the upstream and downstream cylinders in the cf direction were 4th order and 3rd order respectively whilst the upstream cylinder owned its maximum dominant mode of 5th order in the il direction in comparison to the lower order dominant mode of the downstream cylinder at the same reduced velocity this might be ascribable to the wake shielding effect similar characteristics can be observed in fig 6 the vertical axis shows the fatigue damage value in the logarithmic coordinate and two horizontal axes represent the reduced velocity v r and nondimensional position coordinate z l respectively with careful observation of fig 6a the fatigue damage values surge exponentially with an increase in the reduced velocity moreover the cf fatigue damage curves of the upstream and downstream cylinders at v r 25 05 exhibit 4 and 3 peaks respectively which keeps potential consistency to the dominant mode orders in contrast the il fatigue damage curves show more peaks or valleys along the axes see fig 6b and approximately 6 peaks can be observed in the il fatigue damage curve of the upstream cylinder at the maximum reduced velocity 4 1 2 upstream naked cylinder and downstream straked cylinder when the downstream cylinder is attached with helical strakes a significant fatigue damage reduction in both the cf and il directions can be observed we have discussed the fiv behaviours of a straked flexible cylinder placed behind a naked one for the upstream naked cylinder it vibrates like the upstream naked cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system whether the downstream cylinder is straked or not can insignificantly affect the fiv response of the upstream naked one in contrast the helical strakes used on the downstream cylinder can reduce its dominant mode and rms displacement amplitude in comparison to a naked downstream cylinder xu et al 2018b fig 7 shows the maximum fatigue damages of the upstream naked cylinder and its straked counterpart in both the cf and il directions it can be seen that the maximum fatigue damage of the downstream straked cylinder is much lower than that of the naked upstream cylinder the maximum fatigue damage reduction of the downstream straked cylinder in the il direction is more obvious than that in the cf direction which is caused by the different performances of helical strakes on the cf and il fiv suppressions a similar trend has been reflected by xu et al 2018a and li et al 2020 in the experimental investigation on flexible cylinders fitted with helical strakes when comparing the outcomes in fig 7 with those exhibited in fig 5 it can also be concluded that the downstream cylinder fitted with helical strakes encounters less serious fatigue damage than it without helical strakes quantitatively it can be estimated that the cf and the il maximum fatigue damages of a downstream cylinder behind a naked one can be attenuated about 60 07 and 99 44 respectively by the coverage of helical strakes fig 8 presents the fatigue damage distributions of both the upstream naked and the downstream straked cylinders in both the cf and il directions there exists a more considerable fatigue damage discrepancy between the upstream naked cylinder and its staked counterpart in the il direction than in the cf direction comparing the upstream naked cylinder to the downstream straked cylinder the average fatigue damage value of the upstream naked cylinder is approximately 17 1 times higher than that of the downstream cylinder with helical strakes in the cf direction and this value sharply increases to nearly 1054 2 times in the il direction additionally the dominant modes of the upstream naked cylinder in the cf and il directions were 4th and 6th order respectively nevertheless the il dominant mode of the downstream cylinder was reduced to 4th order when it was fitted with helical strakes xu et al 2018b thus the cf and il fatigue damage distribution curves of the upstream cylinder show 4 and 6 peaks when v r 25 05 4 1 3 upstream straked cylinder and downstream naked cylinder fig 9 demonstrates the maximum fatigue damages of the upstream straked cylinder and downstream naked cylinder versus reduced velocity in both the cf and il directions an interesting phenomenon occurs that the downstream cylinder without helical strakes confronts much more serious fatigue damage than the upstream straked cylinder in both directions such an interesting finding indicates that the helical strakes used on the upstream cylinder can reduce its fiv response and fatigue damage in both the cf and il directions and that the performance of the helical strakes in suppressing fiv is more significant than the influence exerted by wake shielding effect for the upstream straked cylinder its maximum fatigue damages decrease by about 99 41 and 99 92 in the cf and il directions respectively when it is compared to a naked upstream cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system moreover there are two remarkable increases in the maximum fatigue damage of the upstream straked cylinder in both cf and il directions when v r 12 52 and v r 20 04 at which modal switching of the upstream cylinder occurs xu et al 2018a concerning the downstream naked cylinder it suffers much less serious fatigue damage than a naked downstream cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system in both cf and il directions this reduction rate in the cf direction is approximately 43 86 and this value becomes 76 60 or so in the il direction this can be attributed to the fact that the strong vortices generated from the upstream cylinder might be smashed by the helical strakes and they can hardly cause significant drag force on the downstream body in other words when the upstream cylinder is naked the wake shielding effect can only cause approximately 76 90 and 49 06 fatigue damage reduction rates on the downstream naked cylinder in the cf and il directions respectively whereas helical strakes fitted on the upstream cylinder can increase the two values up to 87 61 and 94 16 respectively hence it can be concluded that the wake shielding effect discussed in a two tandem naked cylinder system is enhanced by the helical strakes fitted on the upstream cylinder which in turn leads to more obvious fatigue damage attenuation in the il direction than in the cf direction fig 10 presents the fatigue damage distributions along the axis of the two cylinders in both cf and il directions a dominant vibration mode of 3rd order can be observed in both cf and il responses of the upstream cylinder with helical strakes which indicates that helical strakes can attenuate the fiv of the upstream cylinder by lowering its highest modal order this feature can explain the reason that the upstream straked cylinder shows quite a lower fatigue damage value when considering an isolated straked cylinder whose dominant modes are both 2nd order in both the cf and il directions xu et al 2018b the performance of helical strakes in suppressing the fiv of the upstream cylinder is worse than that of an isolated cylinder for the downstream naked cylinder the cf and il responses were dominated by at most 3rd and 5th order modes respectively lower than those of an isolated naked cylinder such a difference can be attributed to the reduced velocity deficit in the flow velocity shadowing region caused by the wake shielding effect in short the mechanism of fatigue damage reduction is potentially similar to that of fiv response suppression but the former one has a higher suppression efficiency than the latter one 4 1 4 two straked cylinders the maximum fatigue damages of the two straked cylinders versus reduced velocity are plotted in fig 11 for comparison the results of an isolated naked cylinder are also presented with a dotted line the cf maximum fatigue damage of the downstream straked cylinder is roughly consistent with that of the upstream straked cylinder when v r 12 52 and is much larger than when v r 15 03 which shows slightly different to the rms displacement response this might be caused by fatigue damage that varies with the integrated effect of the displacement and frequency responses trim et al 2005 thorsen et al 2015 another reasonable cause is that typical wiv might occur on the downstream straked cylinder leading to distinctive wiv responses with large amplitudes at higher reduced velocities i e v r 15 03 in contrast wiv was not observed on the downstream cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system at the same spacing ratio xu et al 2018a instead the wake shielding effect still exists this is because helical strakes on the upstream body change the separation position of the two shear layers by which the contribution of wiv exceeds that of wake shielding effect on the downstream straked cylinder the canonical wiv was comprehensively discussed by huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 on two tandem flexible cylinders wiv was one of the typical expressions of wake interference on the downstream cylinder and it was excessively dependent on the reduced velocity spacing ratio and how close the eigenfrequencies of the cylinders were the downstream straked cylinder therefore experiences a significantly larger fatigue damage value than its counterpart when wiv dominates the response mechanism interestingly the maximum fatigue damage of the upstream straked cylinder keeps following that of the upstream straked cylinder in front of a naked downstream cylinder it indicates that the downstream cylinder with or without helical strakes can barely affect the fatigue damage characteristic of the upstream straked cylinder fig 12 displays the corresponding fatigue damage distribution along the axis against reduced velocity for the upstream cylinder the dominant vibration modes in the cf and il directions were 3rd order and 2nd order respectively when the highest reduced velocity v r 25 05 was adopted moreover the upstream straked cylinder undergoes lower fatigue damage in the il direction than in the cf direction because its cf rms displacement y rms is larger than the il results xu et al 2018b in contrast the downstream straked cylinder shows typical wiv at higher reduced velocities v r 15 03 making it has larger displacement amplitudes and fatigue damage values than the upstream cylinder in addition to the enhancement of fatigue damage the dominant modes of the downstream straked cylinder in the cf and il directions resemble each other which keeps a little consistent with the wake flutter described by assi 2014 and xu et al 2020a simply speaking wake flutter is one of the distinctive cases of wiv and is caused by the vortex impact of the upstream cylinder xu et al 2020a found that wake flutter could make the downstream cylinder vibrate with the same frequency in both the cf and il directions interestingly the dominant vibration modes of the downstream cylinder were both 3rd order in the cf and il directions thus wiv constitutes the main mechanism of the fatigue damage characteristic of the downstream straked cylinder behind a straked cylinder 4 2 fatigue damage suppression efficiency the purpose of this subsection is to discuss the fatigue damage suppression efficiencies of helical strakes on the two tandem cylinders in both the cf and il directions by comparing the maximum fatigue damage furthermore the suppression efficiency η is also proposed to compare the fatigue sensitivities of two cylinders to helical strakes 4 2 1 on the upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is naked fig 13 shows the comparison of maximum fatigue damage between the upstream cylinder with and without helical strakes in the cf and il directions respectively the upstream cylinder without helical strakes encounters approximately the same maximum fatigue damage as an isolated naked cylinder when the upstream straked cylinder is considered the cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency holds an average value of more than 99 see in fig 13b in contrast as shown in fig 14 b higher fatigue suppression efficiency can be observed in the il direction with its average value of 99 92 when v r 5 01 interestingly the viv suppression efficiencies of an isolated cylinder attached with helical strakes in the cf and il directions were approximately 91 33 and 94 84 xu et al 2018b it can be ascribable to those vortices destroyed by helical strakes that can effectively prevent the vortex shedding from being correlated in the spanwise direction moreover the fatigue damage suppression efficiencies of an isolated cylinder with helical strakes can also be calculated by comparing the fatigue suppression efficiency of the upstream cylinder with that of an isolated cylinder we hold the view that in front of a naked downstream cylinder the upstream cylinder exhibits approximately the same level of susceptibility to helical strakes as an isolated cylinder does 4 2 2 on the upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is straked when the downstream cylinder is fitted with helical strakes the maximum fatigue damage and corresponding fatigue suppression efficiency of the upstream cylinder with without helical strakes are shown in figs 15 and 16 for the upstream cylinder in front of a downstream straked cylinder the disparity of the cf maximum fatigue damage between the straked and naked cylinders is gradually increasing when the reduced velocity is enhanced leading to the average value over 99 50 when v r 15 03 by contrast cf fatigue damage suppression of helical strakes on the upstream cylinder almost holds an invariable value regardless of the reduced velocity when its downstream counterpart is smooth as shown in fig 13b we might ascribe this great difference to the following causes 1 effects of whether the downstream cylinder is straked or naked on the wake patterns of its upstream counterpart a cylinder in front of another naked one shows similar sensitivity to helical strakes as an isolated cylinder does 2 synchronization between the two straked cylinders is stronger than that between the straked naked cylinder because the two straked cylinders have the same geometrical configuration 3 blockage effect of the naked downstream cylinder on the upstream one is slightly weaker than that of the straked downstream body it is also noted that the upstream straked cylinder might suffer a cf fatigue damage decline when lock in attenuates at v r 15 03 until the next order lock in occurs at v r 18 79 which in turn leads to an increasing cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency when v r 15 03 whereas the il maximum fatigue damage of the upstream straked cylinder holds a very low value which results in a considerably high fatigue suppression ratio of 99 98 this difference is similar to the trend of fiv suppression between the cf and il directions i e 81 34 in the cf direction and 90 17 in the il direction xu et al 2018b li et al 2020 found that the interference efficiency of the downstream straked cylinder on a naked upstream cylinder was smaller than 25 when the spacing ratio was 8 0 however it is noted that whether the downstream cylinder is straked or not can barely affect the effectiveness of helical strakes on the il fatigue damage of the upstream body as depicted in figs 14 and 16 in general helical strakes play a critical role in fiv fatigue suppression of the upstream cylinder moreover cf il fatigue suppression efficiency more than 99 can be observed on the upstream cylinder in front of the downstream body of which suppression efficiency in il has a higher and more stable value than that in cf however understanding such intricate phenomena requires a detailed analysis of the wake topology in our future work 4 2 3 on the downstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is naked it is important to discuss the suppression efficiency on the downstream cylinder because of the intricate wake interference more details can be found in figs 17 and 18 the average cf fatigue suppression efficiency of the downstream cylinder fluctuates at a lower level of 60 07 which is smaller than the average efficiency in the il direction of 99 44 these results are following those reported by many researchers who found that helical strakes usually performed better in the il viv suppression than in the cf case trim et al 2005 gao et al 2016 xu et al 2018b in addition higher fatigue suppression efficiency of helical strakes in the il direction than in the cf direction was also examined by vandiver et al 2006 and gao et al 2016 in a uniform flow furthermore such a lower cf fatigue suppression efficiency is mainly caused by the cf fatigue damage enhancement of the downstream straked cylinder in other words the performance of helical strakes on the downstream cylinder is worse than that on an isolated cylinder which might be explained by wiv in the cf direction moreover it might be illustrated from the wakefield perspective that helical strakes could break the regular vortex shedding or prevent the shear layers reattachment ren et al 2019 vortex breaking refers to the process where helical strakes smash the large orderly vortices into many small and messy ones and the latter effect is an anti reattachment process by preventing the two shear layers from interacting with each other see fig 19 lower reduced velocities tend to make the vortices quite weak and easily broken the breaking vortices are messy and cause a higher fiv response frequency which leads to serious fatigue damage in contrast the interaction of the two shear layers is extensively prevented by helical strakes when the reduced velocity is higher which leads to a parallel flow behind the cylinder and thereby reduces the dominant frequency and the higher harmonic frequency by which the fatigue damage will be attenuated thus the two vortex behaviours result in competition which further constitutes the main mechanism of performance of helical strakes when the upstream cylinder is naked vortices generated from it cannot be broken instead shear layers reattachment or co shedding pattern zdravkovich 1987 zhou and yiu 2006 might occur depending on the reduced velocity the wake shielding effect is obvious when the downstream cylinder is naked xu et al 2018a however the vortex breaking effect dominates when the downstream body is covered with helical strakes although the wake shielding effect does exist likewise making larger cf response and more serious cf fatigue damage upon closer inspection of fig 17b we could conclude that helical strakes on the downstream cylinder show decreasing cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency with the enhance of the reduced velocity until v r 15 03 this might be because that vortex breaking effect could cause stronger cf fatigue damage on the straked downstream body as the reduced velocity increases overwhelming the prevention of interaction of two shear layers when the reduced velocity is lower moreover vortex breaking leads to a higher cf fatigue damage and hereby a lower cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency on the downstream straked cylinder when compared to the case of an isolated one as shown in fig 18 b il fatigue damage suppression efficiency of helical strakes on the downstream cylinder does not vary considerably versus the reduced velocity basically maintaining a high level around 99 44 which might be attributed to the fact that vortex breaking behaviour exerts less significant influence on the il vibration than on the cf case hence il fatigue damage suppression efficiency can barely vary with the increase of the reduced velocity when the interaction of two shear layers is prevented the typical reattachment discussed in a two tandem naked cylinder system disappears hence parallel shear layers cannot impinge on the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder but overshoot it which will make the cylinder vibrate strongly in the cf direction in contrast the prevention of interaction of two shear layers can barely influence the straked downstream cylinder in the il direction which results in similar il fatigue suppression efficiency to an isolated cylinder with helical strakes to further discuss the fatigue damage suppression phenomenon figs 20 and 21demonstrate the cf and il strain power spectral density psd at seven measurement points of the downstream cylinder respectively when the upstream body is naked the first column shows the naked case and the second one shows the straked case three reduced velocities i e v r 12 52 15 03 and 20 04 are adopted ren et al 2019 once indicated that the vortex breaking effect caused broken eddies and in turn led to a higher response frequency when the reduced velocity was lower in contrast the response frequency was reduced under the anti reattachment of the two shear layers when the reduced velocity was increased the vortex breaking effect dominated when v r 12 52 making disordered small eddies and further leading to many various frequency components as depicted in figs 20a and 21a this phenomenon might constitute the reason why the fatigue damage suppression efficiency is reduced when the reduced velocity is increased when figs 20c and 21c were observed there existed fewer and lower frequency components in the strain psd of the downstream straked cylinder when v r 20 04 which proves the viewpoints of ren et al 2019 attenuates the response frequency and thereby mitigates the fatigue damage thus the fatigue damage suppression efficiency increases under the higher reduced velocity some intricate phenomena remain to be explained via flow visualizations in future work overall the fatigue damage suppression efficiency of helical strakes on the downstream cylinder behind a naked one might be affected by the competition between the vortex breaking effect and the shear layer anti reattachment effect showing a downtrend when the former effect dominates at a lower reduced velocity range and an uptrend when the latter prevails however some complex mechanism is still unknown understanding such phenomena requires a detailed analysis of the wake topology in the future 4 2 4 on the downstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is straked figs 22 and 23 demonstrate the maximum fatigue damage and fatigue suppression efficiency of the downstream cylinder behind a straked upstream cylinder versus reduced velocity different from the case shown in section 4 2 3 the vortices behind the upstream cylinder cannot keep intact anymore because of helical strakes thus they cannot make a significant discrepancy of cf maximum fatigue damage between the naked and the straked downstream cylinders resulting in a lower average fatigue suppression efficiency in the cf direction i e 22 82 when compared to 99 41 99 50 and 60 07 in the previous cases the downstream naked cylinder exhibits a slightly lower cf maximum fatigue damage value than an isolated cylinder because of the wake shielding effect however the downstream straked cylinder experiences similar cf fatigue damage to the downstream naked one due to the enlargement of displacement response and fatigue damage caused by wiv from a perspective of the flow field helical strakes attached to the upstream cylinder can break the large vortices into small and disordered ones see fig 19 which might enhance the cf vibrating response and fatigue damage when impinging on the downstream straked cylinder interestingly the il fatigue suppression efficiency of the downstream cylinder fitted with helical strakes only remains a relatively lower average value of 69 54 which is much lower than the il fatigue suppression efficiency of 99 44 in the naked straked cylinder system in section 4 1 4 typical wiv occurred on the downstream straked cylinder and made it vibrate with large amplitudes at high reduced velocities i e vr 17 54 xu et al 2018b hence it is revealed that il fatigue damage of the straked downstream cylinder anomalously overwhelms that of the naked downstream cylinder at vr 17 54 when its upstream body is straked a possible reason is that the downstream straked cylinder dramatically vibrates in the cf direction due to strong vortex impact when vr 17 54 which causes a drastic decline in the il fatigue suppression efficiency 4 3 general discussion the fatigue damage of an isolated naked cylinder is set as a benchmark to discuss the maximum fatigue damage and fatigue damage suppression efficiency of the upstream and downstream cylinders with or without helical strakes furthermore the effects of helical strakes on the upstream cylinder in front of a naked straked downstream cylinder and on the downstream cylinder behind a naked straked upstream cylinder are thoroughly investigated the cf fatigue damages of the two tandem cylinders are shown in fig 24 it can be concluded from figs 24a and c that a naked upstream cylinder is hardly affected by a naked or straked downstream cylinder and that whether the upstream cylinder is covered with helical strakes cannot obviously influence the naked downstream one the fatigue damage disparity between the downstream naked cylinder and the isolated naked one is significantly caused by the wake shielding effect in contrast helical strakes almost exert equivalent influence on fatigue damage of a straked upstream cylinder as that of an isolated straked one without the effect of the downstream cylinder comparing fig 24a and b the performance of helical strakes on the upstream cylinder is exceedingly prominent in general regardless of the presence of the downstream cylinder helical strakes impose the same influence on fatigue suppression of the upstream cylinder as they do on an isolated cylinder wiv might attenuate this excellent performance on the downstream cylinder when comparing fig 24c and d little fatigue damage difference is observed between the naked and the straked downstream cylinders when the upstream cylinder is naked the cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency of the downstream one reaches 60 07 and this value is only 22 82 when the upstream one is straked this is due to the helical strakes on the upstream cylinder can easily smash large vortices into small and disordered ones however the smooth upstream cylinder cannot thoroughly break vortices instead it prevents the separation of two shear layers hence wiv tends to occur on a two straked cylinder system than a naked straked cylinder system and it occurs to the downstream straked cylinder by increasing its fatigue damage and hereby lowering the effectiveness of helical strakes analysis of the wake topology is urgent in the future for a better understanding of such phenomena 5 conclusions based on the previous experimental investigation on fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders with without three strand helical strakes p 17 5d and h 0 25d we further discuss fiv fatigue damage characteristics and fatigue suppression efficiency of two tandem cylinders by helical strakes at the adopted centre to centre spacing ratio of 8 0 some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 fiv fatigue damage characteristic of the upstream naked cylinder is slightly affected by the downstream cylinder with or without helical strakes performance of helical strakes on the fatigue damage suppression of the upstream cylinder is consistent with that of an isolated cylinder with an approximate value of more than 99 2 depending on whether the upstream cylinder is straked or not helical strakes perform a little different behaviours on the downstream cylinder except for the wake shielding effect in a two tandem naked cylinder system the combined effect of vortex breaking and prevention of interaction of two shear layers could dominate the main mechanism of the downstream straked cylinder behind a naked one leading to a lower cf fatigue suppression efficiency i e 60 07 by increasing its cf fatigue damage via vortex breaking however il fatigue suppression efficiency still holds 99 44 or so 3 when the upstream cylinder is attached with helical strakes wiv might occur to the downstream straked cylinder at higher reduced velocities vr 17 54 due to the small and messy vortices derived from the upstream body making the fatigue suppression efficiencies of helical strakes reduce to 22 82 and 69 54 in the cf and il directions respectively 4 helical strakes on the upstream cylinder can excessively alleviate its fatigue damage as the way they do on an isolated one in contrast their effectiveness on the downstream cylinder is sharply attenuated by wiv caused by smashed vortices in short the present study only shows the fiv fatigue damage of two tandem flexible cylinders with helical strakes at one spacing ratio case of 8 0

20178,helical strakes are the most common vibration suppression devices for cylindrical structures undergoing vortex shedding many problems with the performance of helical strakes on flow induced vibration fiv fatigue damage suppression of two tandem cylinders have not been solved yet the effectiveness of three strand helical strakes with a pitch of 17 5d and a height of 0 25d where d is the structural diameter in suppressing fatigue damage of two tandem long flexible cylinders undergoing fiv was investigated in this paper a constant spacing ratio center to center distance to cylinder diameter of 8 0 was selected four cases of the two cylinders i e naked naked naked straked straked naked and straked straked were executed under subcritical reynolds number re 1 6 104 based on the strain responses from the experimental tests fatigue damage was estimated by using s n curves and miner s rule to highlight the role of helical strakes in fiv fatigue damage suppression an isolated naked cylinder was considered as a benchmark it is shown that helical strakes exert substantially the same effect on fiv fatigue suppression of the upstream cylinder as they do on an isolated cylinder the upstream cylinder significantly affects the performance of helical strakes on fiv fatigue suppression of the downstream cylinder both vortex breaking and prevention of interaction of two shear layers predominate the primary mechanism of the downstream straked cylinder when the upstream one is naked which reinforces its cross flow fatigue damage and hereby lowers the performance of helical strakes in contrast due to wake induced vibration wiv the downstream straked cylinder laid behind a straked one might encounter much more serious fatigue damages in both the cross flow and in line directions than the case when the upstream cylinder is naked keywords flow induced vibration fiv fatigue damage suppression helical strakes multiple flexible cylinders tandem arrangement 1 introduction cylindrical structures e g marine risers subsea pipelines and mooring cables frequently experience significant flow induced vibration fiv under the action of current flows in ocean engineering fiv of multiple cylinders leads to intricate dynamic responses and thus becomes one of the most critical issues in engineering applications fiv responses of a group of cylinders have been investigated in many pioneering studies chen 1987 pettigrew et al 1998 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2012 xu et al 2019 2021a b zdravkovich 1985 zhu et al 2021 high amplitude fiv coupled with complex wake behaviors and strong mutual interference among cylindrical structures may cause serious structural fatigue damage helical strakes have been successfully utilized to suppress the vortex induced vibration viv response of an isolated cylinder quen et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 zhu et al 2020a 2020b they can destroy regular vortex shedding prevent the formation of vortices and suppress coincident shedding normal to the flow direction gao et al 2016 in addition helical strake can increase the vortex formation length and reduce the correlation length along with the cylinder by disturbing the synchronization of the flow separation korkischko and meneghini 2010 recently large numbers of studies have been done to optimize the geometric shapes pitch height and coverage and to improve the vibration suppression efficiency of helical strakes gao et al 2016 ishihara and li 2020 li et al 2020 liu et al 2019 ranjith et al 2016 xu et al 2017 2018b a huge effort has been made on the performance of helical strakes on the structural responses including displacement response frequency response mean drag force coefficient etc quen et al 2014 examined the effectiveness of helical strakes in suppressing viv of an isolated flexible cylinder by varying the pitch and height it was found that the variation of pitch affected the occurrence of lock in region and prevented the frequency from switching into a higher order mode and that the increase of strake height could narrow the lock in region blumberg et al 2012 experimentally investigated the fiv of a downstream cylinder fitted with three start helical strakes height of 0 12d width of 0 04d and pitch of 10d at various tandem center to center distances 1 5d 2 0d 3 0d and 4 0d in their tests the upstream cylinder was rigid bare and fixed and the downstream body was limited to vibrate only in the cross flow cf direction xu et al 2018b carried out a similar experimental investigation on fiv responses of two tandem cylinders with and without helical strakes more details about the experimental cases of blumberg et al 2012 and xu et al 2018b are shown in table 1 and the displacement response results in xu et al 2018b are displayed in table 2 li et al 2020 considered the fiv responses of two tandem risers i e the upstream riser was naked and the downstream one was fitted with three strand helical strakes in a uniform flow it was found that the interference effect did influence the fiv suppression efficiency of the downstream straked cylinder at different spacing ratios center to center distance to structural diameter resulting in higher vibrating amplitude than an isolated straked cylinder furthermore studies on fiv responses of two tandem cylinders abound hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2006 papaioannou et al 2008 huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 xu et al 2018a as regards elastically mounted rigid cylinders assi et al 2006 conducted an experimental investigation on the fiv of two tandem cylinders the vibrations were limited to the cf direction it was found that the galloping like phenomenon displacement response increased continuously with the increasing reduced velocity occurred at the downstream cylinder when spacing ratio ranging from 3 0 to 5 6 papaioannou et al 2008 numerically studied the fiv of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem arrangement with spacing ratios of 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 at reynolds number of 160 it was found that the maximum amplitude of the downstream cylinder increased when the two cylinders were set at a distance where the wake pattern displayed the reattachment phenomenon in contrast concerning the case of tandem flexible cylinders huera huarte and bearman 2010 utilized digital particle image velocimetry dpiv in the visualization of the wake of two tandem flexible cylinders which were free to oscillate in both the cf and in line il directions it was revealed that the il spacing ratio exerted a significant influence on the cf displacement amplitude of the upstream cylinder and that the closer the two cylinders were the larger the response of the upstream body was it is worth mentioning that wake reattachment still existed when the spacing ratio was 4 0 wang et al 2017 numerically examined the fiv responses of two tandem flexible cylinders by a fluid structure interaction fsi method under diverse spacing ratios at a reynolds number of 500 typical wake induced vibration wiv was detected on the downstream cylinder when the spacing ratio was large enough for the detachment of vortices on the upstream body xu et al 2018a 2020b systematically investigated the fiv responses and fatigue damages of two tandem flexible cylinders at reynolds number of 800 16 000 wake shielding effect and wake induced flutter were both discovered on the downstream cylinder with the variation of spacing ratio several pronounced results indicated that the response of the downstream cylinder was dominated by lower vibration frequencies and vibration modes due to the wake shielding effect when the spacing ratio was lower than 8 0 moreover wake induced flutter only caused il fatigue damage enlargement of the downstream cylinder without the increase of cf fatigue damage when spacing ratio increased than 10 0 nevertheless fewer studies focus on the effect of helical strakes on fiv fatigue damages of two tandem cylinders for an isolated cylinder trim et al 2005 investigated the fatigue damage and the viv suppression of a riser model partially or entirely fitted with helical strakes in both uniform and linearly sheared flows it was shown that there was no significant enhancement in viv suppression when the coverage was increased to 82 vandiver et al 2006 explored the viv fatigue damages of a bare pipe and a straked one in a uniform flow it was indicated that the reduction of fatigue damage could be attributed to the suppression of a third harmonic component in frequency gao et al 2016 experimentally examined the effect of helical strake coverage on viv of a flexible riser in both uniform and linearly sheared flows the maximum fatigue damages were considered under four different cases i e 25 50 75 and 100 strake coverage it was concluded that cf suppression efficiency could increase gradually to its maximum value of 96 in the uniform flow when 100 strake coverage was adopted and this value became 99 in the linearly sheared flow the fatigue damage suppression of an isolated cylinder by helical strakes has attracted much attention vandiver et al 2006 tognarelli et al 2008 sun et al 2014 but the fatigue suppression efficiency of helical strakes on two neighboring cylinders remains unknown existing studies have mostly involved the fatigue damage of an isolated cylinder fitted with helical strakes without addressing the fatigue suppression efficiency much dedication has been made to viv response mitigation but the response results cannot play a crucial role in fatigue analysis because the fatigue damage shows different features from the displacement response hence several questions about the fatigue damage of straked cylinders are still unanswered for example i what are the differences between performances of helical strakes on the fiv fatigue damage of an isolated cylinder and a pair of tandem cylinders and ii how are the fiv fatigue suppression efficiencies of the upstream and downstream cylinders with and without helical strakes therefore in this paper fiv fatigue damages of two tandem flexible cylinders with or without helical strakes are urgent to be addressed based on our previous experimental tests xu et al 2018b additionally fatigue damage suppression efficiencies of the two cylinders are calculated to broaden the understanding of the performance of helical strakes for the multiple cylinders overall the novelty contributions of the present study are as follows i performance of helical strakes on fiv fatigue damage characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders has been discussed ii effects of helical strakes have been quantified by fatigue damage suppression efficiency and they show a prominent discrepancy between the upstream and downstream cylinders 2 fatigue damage estimation method it is widely known that one of the existing theories of fatigue damage calculation is the linear cumulative damage theory of fatigue which postulates as 1 d τ i 1 d τ i where d τ is the total fatigue damage once the stresses σ z t are obtained the fatigue damage can be estimated by miner s rule miner 1945 which assumes that the total damage can be obtained by adding the damages from each cycle of stress lee et al 2005 it requires the estimation of the number of stress cycles under the corresponding stress range in the signal when an input stress signal σ t is processed the number of stress cycles n i and the stress range σ i can be extracted using a cycle counting method i e the rain flow counting method this method mainly identifies the turning points on the stress signal the stress ranges can be given by the difference between the consecutive turning points the number of stress ranges over the length of the stress signal is counted moreover the maximum number of stress cycles before structural failure n i is obtained from the s n curve of the material which quantifies the relationship between n i and σ i 2 log n i log a m log σ i where a and m are material parameters of the s n curve determined from fatigue tests thus the total fatigue damage d τ can be obtained based on stress cycles n i with a stress range σ i over the length of the stress signal as 3 d τ i 1 n i n i i 1 n i σ i m a d curve from the det norske veritas dnv regulations is applied in the following calculation and discussion dnvgl rp c203 2016 because it is valid for specimens in seawater exposed to free corrosion and has been verified effectiveness by many researchers baarholm et al 2006 xue et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the above parameters are correspondingly taken as m 3 0 logā 11 687 as listed in table 3 3 experimental arrangement 3 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in the 137 0 m 7 0 m 3 3 m length width depth towing tank at tianjin university china see fig 1 the towing tank was equipped with a towing carriage which is used to tow the tested cylinder models along the water to simulate a uniform flow the towing velocity u varied from 0 05 to 1 00 m s with an increment of 0 05 m s the corresponding reynolds number re ud ν where d is the diameter of the naked cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water ranged from 800 to 16 000 the experimental facility consisted of several components including the supporting structure the vertical supporting rods the supporting plates and the cylinder models with or without helical strakes etc as shown in fig 2 the cylinder models were connected via universal joints on one end for free vibration in both the cf and il directions tensioners were set up to adjust the axial tension and load cells were installed to keep it equal to a constant value i e 450 n more details about this facility can be referred to xu et al 2018a the cylinder model was made of a copper pipe covered by a silicone tube making them have a bending stiffness of ei 17 45 nm2 where e is young s modulus and i is the moment of inertia the naked cylinder model was 5 60 m in length and 16 mm in diameter leading to an aspect ratio length to diameter l d of 350 moreover the mass ratio the structural mass to the mass of the displaced water m 4 m s ρπd 2 where m s is the mass of the naked cylinder per unit length and ρ is the water density was approximately 1 90 xu et al 2017 2018a b table 4 lists the key parameters of the cylinder models in the tests fig 3 demonstrates the tested cylinder models without and with helical strakes respectively for the straked cylinders their outer surfaces were fully covered by the three strand helical strakes with strake pitch p of 17 5d and strake height h of 0 25d whose effectiveness in viv suppression of an isolated cylinder has been validated allen 1995 to measure the cf and il strain signals along the cylinder axis fourteen pairs of strain gauges were installed on the external surface of the copper pipe at seven measurement positions furthermore the distance between the two tandem cylinders from centre to centre was kept as a constant i e t 8 0d during the tests xu et al 2018b hereafter we abbreviate the upstream naked cylinder as unc for the sake of simplicity correspondingly the downstream naked cylinder upstream straked cylinder downstream straked cylinder and isolated cylinder can be abbreviated as dnc usc dsc and iso respectively hence either of the two cylinders is naked or both of them are naked or straked can result in four different cases for the following discussion i e naked naked naked straked straked naked and straked straked see table 5 to highlight the performance of helical strakes the case of an isolated naked cylinder was considered as a benchmark for comparison 3 2 data processing a filter was employed to eliminate the irrelevant frequency components from the strain signals low frequency components derived from the carriage motion were filtered out with a cut off of 1 0 hz and the inevitable high frequency noise was removed with a cut off of 40 0 hz the structural strain data measured from gauges were discrete thus it is necessary to reconstruct continuous strain function for the following fatigue damage estimation the modal analysis approach proposed by lie and kaasen 2006 is utilized to reconstruct the strain responses in the present study this approach has been verified for applicability in reconstructing the displacement response of flexible cylinders undergoing vortex shedding lie and kaasen 2006 gao et al 2015 li et al 2020 furthermore our previous works have employed this approach for the reconstruction of displacement based on the measured strain successfully xu et al 2017 2018a 2018b assuming that the tensioned cylinder deviates little from its vertical axis and that the dynamic process of its motion is approximately linear the time and space dependent displacement therefore can be composed of a series of mode shapes or eigenfunctions herein we show the cf displacement reconstruction process as an example which reads 4 y cf z t κ 1 ϕ κ z w κ t where y cf z t is the cf displacement z is the spanwise coordinate along the cylinder axis t represents time ϕ κ z and w κ t are the mode shape and modal weight respectively and κ is the mode number κ 1 2 3 xu et al 2018a due to the pined pined boundary condition a set of orthogonal modes satisfying the geometric boundary condition is used meirovitch 2010 5 ϕ κ z sin π κ z l cf strain response can be reconstructed based on the quantitative relation between strain and displacement 6 ε

respectively preliminarily three academic words i e wake induced vibration wiv wake shielding effect and shear layers reattachment are necessary to clearly define wiv as shown in fig 4 a is one of the canonical vibration patterns for multiple cylinders experiencing fiv especially for the downstream cylinder in a tandem arrangement assi et al 2010 once suggested that wiv response was characterized by a sharp increase of amplitude persisting to high reduced velocities its mechanism is sustained by unsteady vortex structure interactions that input energy into the system as the downstream cylinder oscillated across the wake wiv requires the interaction between structures and vortices which are coming from the upstream wake or the upstream vortex shedding to sustain more details can be referred to zdravkovich 1977 assi et al 2006 2010 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 the wake shielding effect as depicted in fig 4b is a flow velocity deficit phenomenon caused by the shadow effect behind an upstream body usually leading to lower amplitudes and lower order dominant modes for downstream bodies in other words the wake shielding effect is one of the ubiquitous fluid phenomena in multiple cylinders subjected to fiv it is not a vibration form but a flow field effect many researchers have discussed its features e g vandiver 1983 huse 1993 huse and kleiven 2000 and ma et al 2019 finally shear layers reattachment is a wake flow coupling phenomenon in the tandem arrangement sumner 2010 thoroughly discussed shear layer reattachment behaviour in two tandem rigid cylinders wake flow fields it occurs when the two cylinders are placed sufficiently far the shear layer from the upstream cylinder can no longer enclose its downstream counterpart but reattach onto its upper or lower surface as portrayed in fig 4c moreover shear layer reattachment involves a wide variety of fluid behaviours including wiv wake induced flutter etc intricate reattachment principally involves the reattachment of the shear layers from the upstream cylinder and the formation and shedding of eddies in the gap region between the two cylinders in a nutshell wiv is a vibration pattern of cylinders whilst the wake shielding effect is a general feature of the flow field of multiple cylinders and shear layers reattachment is a flow field phenomenon characterized by wake flow interaction 4 1 fatigue damage discussion 4 1 1 two naked cylinders to highlight the effectiveness of helical strakes the results of two tandem naked cylinders are discussed above all a series of tests on fiv responses of two tandem naked cylinders have been conducted previously and some important findings have been reported in xu et al 2018a it was concluded that the main fiv mechanism of two tandem flexible cylinders was the wake shielding effect which causes lower order dominant vibration mode and lower dominant vibration frequency on the downstream cylinder hereinafter the nth order vibration mode refers to the nth synchronization between the vortex shedding frequency f s f s st u d where st is strouhal number and the nth natural eigenfrequency the dominant vibration mode is a resonant vibration mode whose weight tops the most in all participating modes due to the coexistence of many modes for lock in vibration of long flexible cylinders fig 5 demonstrates the cf and il maximum fatigue damages of two naked cylinders the dotted line refers to the case of an isolated cylinder for comparison the downstream cylinder shows lower maximum fatigue damage values than the upstream one because of the wake shielding effect xu et al 2018a and the upstream cylinder behaves similarly to an isolated cylinder in both the cf and il directions xu et al 2020b have discussed the fatigue damage characteristics of two naked flexible tandem cylinders with t d 8 0 the wake shielding effect occupies the primary reason that the downstream cylinder undergoes less serious fatigue damage at this spacing ratio the further mechanism behind the wake shielding effect is the shear layer reattachment pattern between the two cylinders reattachment frequently occurs to the downstream cylinder in a tandem arrangement when t d 4 0 8 0 which has been verified in many existing papers brika and laneville 1999 papaioannou et al 2008 huera huarte and gharib 2011 hence the shear layers emitting from the upstream cylinder simultaneously impact and attach on the upper and lower surfaces of the downstream 1 at t d 8 0 causing a slight vibration attenuation and hereby a fatigue damage mitigation fig 6 shows the damage distribution along the axis in the cf and il directions respectively it is known that the fatigue damage distribution trend resembles the root mean square rms displacement along the axis the rms displacement reads 14 y rms z 1 s i 1 s y 2 z t i x rms z 1 s i 1 s x 2 z t i where y rms and x rms represent the cf rms displacement and il rms displacement respectively z is the position along the axis of the cylinder s is the number of time samples and t refers to time as presented in xu et al 2018a the dominant modes of the upstream and downstream cylinders in the cf direction were 4th order and 3rd order respectively whilst the upstream cylinder owned its maximum dominant mode of 5th order in the il direction in comparison to the lower order dominant mode of the downstream cylinder at the same reduced velocity this might be ascribable to the wake shielding effect similar characteristics can be observed in fig 6 the vertical axis shows the fatigue damage value in the logarithmic coordinate and two horizontal axes represent the reduced velocity v r and nondimensional position coordinate z l respectively with careful observation of fig 6a the fatigue damage values surge exponentially with an increase in the reduced velocity moreover the cf fatigue damage curves of the upstream and downstream cylinders at v r 25 05 exhibit 4 and 3 peaks respectively which keeps potential consistency to the dominant mode orders in contrast the il fatigue damage curves show more peaks or valleys along the axes see fig 6b and approximately 6 peaks can be observed in the il fatigue damage curve of the upstream cylinder at the maximum reduced velocity 4 1 2 upstream naked cylinder and downstream straked cylinder when the downstream cylinder is attached with helical strakes a significant fatigue damage reduction in both the cf and il directions can be observed we have discussed the fiv behaviours of a straked flexible cylinder placed behind a naked one for the upstream naked cylinder it vibrates like the upstream naked cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system whether the downstream cylinder is straked or not can insignificantly affect the fiv response of the upstream naked one in contrast the helical strakes used on the downstream cylinder can reduce its dominant mode and rms displacement amplitude in comparison to a naked downstream cylinder xu et al 2018b fig 7 shows the maximum fatigue damages of the upstream naked cylinder and its straked counterpart in both the cf and il directions it can be seen that the maximum fatigue damage of the downstream straked cylinder is much lower than that of the naked upstream cylinder the maximum fatigue damage reduction of the downstream straked cylinder in the il direction is more obvious than that in the cf direction which is caused by the different performances of helical strakes on the cf and il fiv suppressions a similar trend has been reflected by xu et al 2018a and li et al 2020 in the experimental investigation on flexible cylinders fitted with helical strakes when comparing the outcomes in fig 7 with those exhibited in fig 5 it can also be concluded that the downstream cylinder fitted with helical strakes encounters less serious fatigue damage than it without helical strakes quantitatively it can be estimated that the cf and the il maximum fatigue damages of a downstream cylinder behind a naked one can be attenuated about 60 07 and 99 44 respectively by the coverage of helical strakes fig 8 presents the fatigue damage distributions of both the upstream naked and the downstream straked cylinders in both the cf and il directions there exists a more considerable fatigue damage discrepancy between the upstream naked cylinder and its staked counterpart in the il direction than in the cf direction comparing the upstream naked cylinder to the downstream straked cylinder the average fatigue damage value of the upstream naked cylinder is approximately 17 1 times higher than that of the downstream cylinder with helical strakes in the cf direction and this value sharply increases to nearly 1054 2 times in the il direction additionally the dominant modes of the upstream naked cylinder in the cf and il directions were 4th and 6th order respectively nevertheless the il dominant mode of the downstream cylinder was reduced to 4th order when it was fitted with helical strakes xu et al 2018b thus the cf and il fatigue damage distribution curves of the upstream cylinder show 4 and 6 peaks when v r 25 05 4 1 3 upstream straked cylinder and downstream naked cylinder fig 9 demonstrates the maximum fatigue damages of the upstream straked cylinder and downstream naked cylinder versus reduced velocity in both the cf and il directions an interesting phenomenon occurs that the downstream cylinder without helical strakes confronts much more serious fatigue damage than the upstream straked cylinder in both directions such an interesting finding indicates that the helical strakes used on the upstream cylinder can reduce its fiv response and fatigue damage in both the cf and il directions and that the performance of the helical strakes in suppressing fiv is more significant than the influence exerted by wake shielding effect for the upstream straked cylinder its maximum fatigue damages decrease by about 99 41 and 99 92 in the cf and il directions respectively when it is compared to a naked upstream cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system moreover there are two remarkable increases in the maximum fatigue damage of the upstream straked cylinder in both cf and il directions when v r 12 52 and v r 20 04 at which modal switching of the upstream cylinder occurs xu et al 2018a concerning the downstream naked cylinder it suffers much less serious fatigue damage than a naked downstream cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system in both cf and il directions this reduction rate in the cf direction is approximately 43 86 and this value becomes 76 60 or so in the il direction this can be attributed to the fact that the strong vortices generated from the upstream cylinder might be smashed by the helical strakes and they can hardly cause significant drag force on the downstream body in other words when the upstream cylinder is naked the wake shielding effect can only cause approximately 76 90 and 49 06 fatigue damage reduction rates on the downstream naked cylinder in the cf and il directions respectively whereas helical strakes fitted on the upstream cylinder can increase the two values up to 87 61 and 94 16 respectively hence it can be concluded that the wake shielding effect discussed in a two tandem naked cylinder system is enhanced by the helical strakes fitted on the upstream cylinder which in turn leads to more obvious fatigue damage attenuation in the il direction than in the cf direction fig 10 presents the fatigue damage distributions along the axis of the two cylinders in both cf and il directions a dominant vibration mode of 3rd order can be observed in both cf and il responses of the upstream cylinder with helical strakes which indicates that helical strakes can attenuate the fiv of the upstream cylinder by lowering its highest modal order this feature can explain the reason that the upstream straked cylinder shows quite a lower fatigue damage value when considering an isolated straked cylinder whose dominant modes are both 2nd order in both the cf and il directions xu et al 2018b the performance of helical strakes in suppressing the fiv of the upstream cylinder is worse than that of an isolated cylinder for the downstream naked cylinder the cf and il responses were dominated by at most 3rd and 5th order modes respectively lower than those of an isolated naked cylinder such a difference can be attributed to the reduced velocity deficit in the flow velocity shadowing region caused by the wake shielding effect in short the mechanism of fatigue damage reduction is potentially similar to that of fiv response suppression but the former one has a higher suppression efficiency than the latter one 4 1 4 two straked cylinders the maximum fatigue damages of the two straked cylinders versus reduced velocity are plotted in fig 11 for comparison the results of an isolated naked cylinder are also presented with a dotted line the cf maximum fatigue damage of the downstream straked cylinder is roughly consistent with that of the upstream straked cylinder when v r 12 52 and is much larger than when v r 15 03 which shows slightly different to the rms displacement response this might be caused by fatigue damage that varies with the integrated effect of the displacement and frequency responses trim et al 2005 thorsen et al 2015 another reasonable cause is that typical wiv might occur on the downstream straked cylinder leading to distinctive wiv responses with large amplitudes at higher reduced velocities i e v r 15 03 in contrast wiv was not observed on the downstream cylinder in a two tandem naked cylinder system at the same spacing ratio xu et al 2018a instead the wake shielding effect still exists this is because helical strakes on the upstream body change the separation position of the two shear layers by which the contribution of wiv exceeds that of wake shielding effect on the downstream straked cylinder the canonical wiv was comprehensively discussed by huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 on two tandem flexible cylinders wiv was one of the typical expressions of wake interference on the downstream cylinder and it was excessively dependent on the reduced velocity spacing ratio and how close the eigenfrequencies of the cylinders were the downstream straked cylinder therefore experiences a significantly larger fatigue damage value than its counterpart when wiv dominates the response mechanism interestingly the maximum fatigue damage of the upstream straked cylinder keeps following that of the upstream straked cylinder in front of a naked downstream cylinder it indicates that the downstream cylinder with or without helical strakes can barely affect the fatigue damage characteristic of the upstream straked cylinder fig 12 displays the corresponding fatigue damage distribution along the axis against reduced velocity for the upstream cylinder the dominant vibration modes in the cf and il directions were 3rd order and 2nd order respectively when the highest reduced velocity v r 25 05 was adopted moreover the upstream straked cylinder undergoes lower fatigue damage in the il direction than in the cf direction because its cf rms displacement y rms is larger than the il results xu et al 2018b in contrast the downstream straked cylinder shows typical wiv at higher reduced velocities v r 15 03 making it has larger displacement amplitudes and fatigue damage values than the upstream cylinder in addition to the enhancement of fatigue damage the dominant modes of the downstream straked cylinder in the cf and il directions resemble each other which keeps a little consistent with the wake flutter described by assi 2014 and xu et al 2020a simply speaking wake flutter is one of the distinctive cases of wiv and is caused by the vortex impact of the upstream cylinder xu et al 2020a found that wake flutter could make the downstream cylinder vibrate with the same frequency in both the cf and il directions interestingly the dominant vibration modes of the downstream cylinder were both 3rd order in the cf and il directions thus wiv constitutes the main mechanism of the fatigue damage characteristic of the downstream straked cylinder behind a straked cylinder 4 2 fatigue damage suppression efficiency the purpose of this subsection is to discuss the fatigue damage suppression efficiencies of helical strakes on the two tandem cylinders in both the cf and il directions by comparing the maximum fatigue damage furthermore the suppression efficiency η is also proposed to compare the fatigue sensitivities of two cylinders to helical strakes 4 2 1 on the upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is naked fig 13 shows the comparison of maximum fatigue damage between the upstream cylinder with and without helical strakes in the cf and il directions respectively the upstream cylinder without helical strakes encounters approximately the same maximum fatigue damage as an isolated naked cylinder when the upstream straked cylinder is considered the cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency holds an average value of more than 99 see in fig 13b in contrast as shown in fig 14 b higher fatigue suppression efficiency can be observed in the il direction with its average value of 99 92 when v r 5 01 interestingly the viv suppression efficiencies of an isolated cylinder attached with helical strakes in the cf and il directions were approximately 91 33 and 94 84 xu et al 2018b it can be ascribable to those vortices destroyed by helical strakes that can effectively prevent the vortex shedding from being correlated in the spanwise direction moreover the fatigue damage suppression efficiencies of an isolated cylinder with helical strakes can also be calculated by comparing the fatigue suppression efficiency of the upstream cylinder with that of an isolated cylinder we hold the view that in front of a naked downstream cylinder the upstream cylinder exhibits approximately the same level of susceptibility to helical strakes as an isolated cylinder does 4 2 2 on the upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is straked when the downstream cylinder is fitted with helical strakes the maximum fatigue damage and corresponding fatigue suppression efficiency of the upstream cylinder with without helical strakes are shown in figs 15 and 16 for the upstream cylinder in front of a downstream straked cylinder the disparity of the cf maximum fatigue damage between the straked and naked cylinders is gradually increasing when the reduced velocity is enhanced leading to the average value over 99 50 when v r 15 03 by contrast cf fatigue damage suppression of helical strakes on the upstream cylinder almost holds an invariable value regardless of the reduced velocity when its downstream counterpart is smooth as shown in fig 13b we might ascribe this great difference to the following causes 1 effects of whether the downstream cylinder is straked or naked on the wake patterns of its upstream counterpart a cylinder in front of another naked one shows similar sensitivity to helical strakes as an isolated cylinder does 2 synchronization between the two straked cylinders is stronger than that between the straked naked cylinder because the two straked cylinders have the same geometrical configuration 3 blockage effect of the naked downstream cylinder on the upstream one is slightly weaker than that of the straked downstream body it is also noted that the upstream straked cylinder might suffer a cf fatigue damage decline when lock in attenuates at v r 15 03 until the next order lock in occurs at v r 18 79 which in turn leads to an increasing cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency when v r 15 03 whereas the il maximum fatigue damage of the upstream straked cylinder holds a very low value which results in a considerably high fatigue suppression ratio of 99 98 this difference is similar to the trend of fiv suppression between the cf and il directions i e 81 34 in the cf direction and 90 17 in the il direction xu et al 2018b li et al 2020 found that the interference efficiency of the downstream straked cylinder on a naked upstream cylinder was smaller than 25 when the spacing ratio was 8 0 however it is noted that whether the downstream cylinder is straked or not can barely affect the effectiveness of helical strakes on the il fatigue damage of the upstream body as depicted in figs 14 and 16 in general helical strakes play a critical role in fiv fatigue suppression of the upstream cylinder moreover cf il fatigue suppression efficiency more than 99 can be observed on the upstream cylinder in front of the downstream body of which suppression efficiency in il has a higher and more stable value than that in cf however understanding such intricate phenomena requires a detailed analysis of the wake topology in our future work 4 2 3 on the downstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is naked it is important to discuss the suppression efficiency on the downstream cylinder because of the intricate wake interference more details can be found in figs 17 and 18 the average cf fatigue suppression efficiency of the downstream cylinder fluctuates at a lower level of 60 07 which is smaller than the average efficiency in the il direction of 99 44 these results are following those reported by many researchers who found that helical strakes usually performed better in the il viv suppression than in the cf case trim et al 2005 gao et al 2016 xu et al 2018b in addition higher fatigue suppression efficiency of helical strakes in the il direction than in the cf direction was also examined by vandiver et al 2006 and gao et al 2016 in a uniform flow furthermore such a lower cf fatigue suppression efficiency is mainly caused by the cf fatigue damage enhancement of the downstream straked cylinder in other words the performance of helical strakes on the downstream cylinder is worse than that on an isolated cylinder which might be explained by wiv in the cf direction moreover it might be illustrated from the wakefield perspective that helical strakes could break the regular vortex shedding or prevent the shear layers reattachment ren et al 2019 vortex breaking refers to the process where helical strakes smash the large orderly vortices into many small and messy ones and the latter effect is an anti reattachment process by preventing the two shear layers from interacting with each other see fig 19 lower reduced velocities tend to make the vortices quite weak and easily broken the breaking vortices are messy and cause a higher fiv response frequency which leads to serious fatigue damage in contrast the interaction of the two shear layers is extensively prevented by helical strakes when the reduced velocity is higher which leads to a parallel flow behind the cylinder and thereby reduces the dominant frequency and the higher harmonic frequency by which the fatigue damage will be attenuated thus the two vortex behaviours result in competition which further constitutes the main mechanism of performance of helical strakes when the upstream cylinder is naked vortices generated from it cannot be broken instead shear layers reattachment or co shedding pattern zdravkovich 1987 zhou and yiu 2006 might occur depending on the reduced velocity the wake shielding effect is obvious when the downstream cylinder is naked xu et al 2018a however the vortex breaking effect dominates when the downstream body is covered with helical strakes although the wake shielding effect does exist likewise making larger cf response and more serious cf fatigue damage upon closer inspection of fig 17b we could conclude that helical strakes on the downstream cylinder show decreasing cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency with the enhance of the reduced velocity until v r 15 03 this might be because that vortex breaking effect could cause stronger cf fatigue damage on the straked downstream body as the reduced velocity increases overwhelming the prevention of interaction of two shear layers when the reduced velocity is lower moreover vortex breaking leads to a higher cf fatigue damage and hereby a lower cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency on the downstream straked cylinder when compared to the case of an isolated one as shown in fig 18 b il fatigue damage suppression efficiency of helical strakes on the downstream cylinder does not vary considerably versus the reduced velocity basically maintaining a high level around 99 44 which might be attributed to the fact that vortex breaking behaviour exerts less significant influence on the il vibration than on the cf case hence il fatigue damage suppression efficiency can barely vary with the increase of the reduced velocity when the interaction of two shear layers is prevented the typical reattachment discussed in a two tandem naked cylinder system disappears hence parallel shear layers cannot impinge on the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder but overshoot it which will make the cylinder vibrate strongly in the cf direction in contrast the prevention of interaction of two shear layers can barely influence the straked downstream cylinder in the il direction which results in similar il fatigue suppression efficiency to an isolated cylinder with helical strakes to further discuss the fatigue damage suppression phenomenon figs 20 and 21demonstrate the cf and il strain power spectral density psd at seven measurement points of the downstream cylinder respectively when the upstream body is naked the first column shows the naked case and the second one shows the straked case three reduced velocities i e v r 12 52 15 03 and 20 04 are adopted ren et al 2019 once indicated that the vortex breaking effect caused broken eddies and in turn led to a higher response frequency when the reduced velocity was lower in contrast the response frequency was reduced under the anti reattachment of the two shear layers when the reduced velocity was increased the vortex breaking effect dominated when v r 12 52 making disordered small eddies and further leading to many various frequency components as depicted in figs 20a and 21a this phenomenon might constitute the reason why the fatigue damage suppression efficiency is reduced when the reduced velocity is increased when figs 20c and 21c were observed there existed fewer and lower frequency components in the strain psd of the downstream straked cylinder when v r 20 04 which proves the viewpoints of ren et al 2019 attenuates the response frequency and thereby mitigates the fatigue damage thus the fatigue damage suppression efficiency increases under the higher reduced velocity some intricate phenomena remain to be explained via flow visualizations in future work overall the fatigue damage suppression efficiency of helical strakes on the downstream cylinder behind a naked one might be affected by the competition between the vortex breaking effect and the shear layer anti reattachment effect showing a downtrend when the former effect dominates at a lower reduced velocity range and an uptrend when the latter prevails however some complex mechanism is still unknown understanding such phenomena requires a detailed analysis of the wake topology in the future 4 2 4 on the downstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder is straked figs 22 and 23 demonstrate the maximum fatigue damage and fatigue suppression efficiency of the downstream cylinder behind a straked upstream cylinder versus reduced velocity different from the case shown in section 4 2 3 the vortices behind the upstream cylinder cannot keep intact anymore because of helical strakes thus they cannot make a significant discrepancy of cf maximum fatigue damage between the naked and the straked downstream cylinders resulting in a lower average fatigue suppression efficiency in the cf direction i e 22 82 when compared to 99 41 99 50 and 60 07 in the previous cases the downstream naked cylinder exhibits a slightly lower cf maximum fatigue damage value than an isolated cylinder because of the wake shielding effect however the downstream straked cylinder experiences similar cf fatigue damage to the downstream naked one due to the enlargement of displacement response and fatigue damage caused by wiv from a perspective of the flow field helical strakes attached to the upstream cylinder can break the large vortices into small and disordered ones see fig 19 which might enhance the cf vibrating response and fatigue damage when impinging on the downstream straked cylinder interestingly the il fatigue suppression efficiency of the downstream cylinder fitted with helical strakes only remains a relatively lower average value of 69 54 which is much lower than the il fatigue suppression efficiency of 99 44 in the naked straked cylinder system in section 4 1 4 typical wiv occurred on the downstream straked cylinder and made it vibrate with large amplitudes at high reduced velocities i e vr 17 54 xu et al 2018b hence it is revealed that il fatigue damage of the straked downstream cylinder anomalously overwhelms that of the naked downstream cylinder at vr 17 54 when its upstream body is straked a possible reason is that the downstream straked cylinder dramatically vibrates in the cf direction due to strong vortex impact when vr 17 54 which causes a drastic decline in the il fatigue suppression efficiency 4 3 general discussion the fatigue damage of an isolated naked cylinder is set as a benchmark to discuss the maximum fatigue damage and fatigue damage suppression efficiency of the upstream and downstream cylinders with or without helical strakes furthermore the effects of helical strakes on the upstream cylinder in front of a naked straked downstream cylinder and on the downstream cylinder behind a naked straked upstream cylinder are thoroughly investigated the cf fatigue damages of the two tandem cylinders are shown in fig 24 it can be concluded from figs 24a and c that a naked upstream cylinder is hardly affected by a naked or straked downstream cylinder and that whether the upstream cylinder is covered with helical strakes cannot obviously influence the naked downstream one the fatigue damage disparity between the downstream naked cylinder and the isolated naked one is significantly caused by the wake shielding effect in contrast helical strakes almost exert equivalent influence on fatigue damage of a straked upstream cylinder as that of an isolated straked one without the effect of the downstream cylinder comparing fig 24a and b the performance of helical strakes on the upstream cylinder is exceedingly prominent in general regardless of the presence of the downstream cylinder helical strakes impose the same influence on fatigue suppression of the upstream cylinder as they do on an isolated cylinder wiv might attenuate this excellent performance on the downstream cylinder when comparing fig 24c and d little fatigue damage difference is observed between the naked and the straked downstream cylinders when the upstream cylinder is naked the cf fatigue damage suppression efficiency of the downstream one reaches 60 07 and this value is only 22 82 when the upstream one is straked this is due to the helical strakes on the upstream cylinder can easily smash large vortices into small and disordered ones however the smooth upstream cylinder cannot thoroughly break vortices instead it prevents the separation of two shear layers hence wiv tends to occur on a two straked cylinder system than a naked straked cylinder system and it occurs to the downstream straked cylinder by increasing its fatigue damage and hereby lowering the effectiveness of helical strakes analysis of the wake topology is urgent in the future for a better understanding of such phenomena 5 conclusions based on the previous experimental investigation on fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders with without three strand helical strakes p 17 5d and h 0 25d we further discuss fiv fatigue damage characteristics and fatigue suppression efficiency of two tandem cylinders by helical strakes at the adopted centre to centre spacing ratio of 8 0 some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 fiv fatigue damage characteristic of the upstream naked cylinder is slightly affected by the downstream cylinder with or without helical strakes performance of helical strakes on the fatigue damage suppression of the upstream cylinder is consistent with that of an isolated cylinder with an approximate value of more than 99 2 depending on whether the upstream cylinder is straked or not helical strakes perform a little different behaviours on the downstream cylinder except for the wake shielding effect in a two tandem naked cylinder system the combined effect of vortex breaking and prevention of interaction of two shear layers could dominate the main mechanism of the downstream straked cylinder behind a naked one leading to a lower cf fatigue suppression efficiency i e 60 07 by increasing its cf fatigue damage via vortex breaking however il fatigue suppression efficiency still holds 99 44 or so 3 when the upstream cylinder is attached with helical strakes wiv might occur to the downstream straked cylinder at higher reduced velocities vr 17 54 due to the small and messy vortices derived from the upstream body making the fatigue suppression efficiencies of helical strakes reduce to 22 82 and 69 54 in the cf and il directions respectively 4 helical strakes on the upstream cylinder can excessively alleviate its fatigue damage as the way they do on an isolated one in contrast their effectiveness on the downstream cylinder is sharply attenuated by wiv caused by smashed vortices in short the present study only shows the fiv fatigue damage of two tandem flexible cylinders with helical strakes at one spacing ratio case of 8 0 although some interesting findings have been reported further studies on the effects of spacing ratio of the geometric configuration of helical strakes and both are worthwhile credit authorship

20179,the exploitation of marine wave energy resource has led to the design of numerous wave energy converter wec configurations the power absorption of a wec is tightly related to its physical properties and the characteristics of the incoming wave front additionally the operational range of a wec is limited to certain characteristics of the incoming waves these restrictions are usually related to limitations in the maximum force of the power take off pto system and the safety of the wec as a result the power production of the wec must be stopped during sea states of high wave

installation of wave energy converters wecs has remarkably grown since the early 1980s babarit 2015 the pressure to combat climate change and the necessity to promote alternative renewable energy generation systems have caused the fast development of different wec technologies all of them aimed to the exploitation of the wave energy resource faizal et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 many studies have been directed to the estimation and characterization of the huge wave energy resource in various oceanic areas all over the world arinaga and cheung 2012 rusu and onea 2016 among wecs point absorbers have recently gained in interest due to their reduced dimensions and remarkable power absorption capability in relation to their size faizal et al 2014 these point absorbers designed to absorb the kinetic energy of the waves in offshore sites oscillate as a result of the hydrodynamic excitation generated by the waves in the device subsequently this mechanical motion is converted into electrical energy regarding their classification falcao 2010 point absorbers are principally categorized with respect to their physical location related to the ocean water level in this way floating point absorbers and fully submerged point absorbers are to be differentiated comparisonal studies of the performance of both technologies can be found in the literature sergiienko et al 2017 the secondary criterion for the classification of point absorbers is related to the degree of freedom of their motion with respect to the incoming waves according to this criterion translational point absorbers the device oscillates with a linear mechanical motion and rotational point absorbers the device oscillates with a rotational mechanical motion can be distinguished finally point absorbers can also be classified with respect to the number of bodies forming the wave energy exploitation device falnes 1999 korde 2003 wang et al 2018 to the present day the most widely studied wave energy absorption devices are the single body in heave oscillating linear point absorbers in order to understand and mathematically characterize the interaction between the waves and these point absorbers the hydrodynamics of in heave oscillating bodies of different forms flat plate bezunartea barrio et al 2020 cylinder gaeta et al 2020 and cone rusch et al 2020 have been studied in detail in the literature moreover the effect of increasing the size of the floating body has also been object of study bezunartea barrio et al 2020 according to the results of this latter analysis the radiation damping of the point absorber is heavily influenced by the frequency of the incoming wave front and the size of the device hence it is concluded that the performance of the wec is tightly related to its geometry additionally wec design selection and placing procedures based on optimization problems can also be found in the literature piscopo et al 2018 vantorre et al 2004 child and venugopal 2010 borgarino et al 2012 the aim of such optimization procedures is the selection of the optimal wec device for a predefined application and considering the techno economic constraints garcia teruel et al 2020 sirigu et al 2020 prototypes of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers have also been installed and tested in real wave conditions the first prototype called power buoy edwards et al 2014 has a rated power of 3 kw and is formed by a floating body and a damping heave plate moored to the ocean floor while the damping plate is designed to attenuate the vertical displacements of the device the floating body is free to oscillate in heave this linear motion is later converted into rotatory motion and electricity is generated by means of a rotating electrical generator another prototype the uppsala university point absorber danielsson 2006 has a rated power of 10 kw and consists of a floating cylindrical buoy connected to a gravity based foundation the electricity is generated with a permanent magnet synchronous linear generator pmslg finally the l10 prototype ruehl 2011 with a diameter of 3 5 m and a rated power of 10 kw was designed by the university of oregon and successfully tested in newport oregon in september 2008 all these prototypes have contributed to the increase of the industrial maturity of the technology an important aspect to consider related to the operation of point absorbers is the selection and design of the power take off pto system in wecs a double objective is pursued with the pto system conversion of the mechanical oscillation into electrical power and regulation of the point absorber motion to the end of maximizing its power absorption in case of linear point absorbers the design and application of hydraulic ptos cargo et al 2012 hansen et al 2013 antónio 2008 and electrical ptos prudell et al 2010 polinder et al 2004 ivanova et al 2005 have been extensively described in the literature in both cases the force the pto system exerts to the point absorber is aimed to influence its motion and maximize the power absorption therefore the design of many control strategies implemented in a generic pto system have been proposed in the literature latching control babarit and clément 2006 velocity tracking based model predictive control cretel et al 2011 proportional control coe et al 2020 and pseudo spectral control bacelli and coe 2020 in application to in heave oscillating linear point absorbers the employment of electrical ptos results easier than hydraulic ptos since no intermediate conversion of the linear mechanical motion into rotatory is required in fact the use of a pmslg enables direct conversion of the linear mechanical motion into electrical power the design procedure of a synchronous linear generator for wave energy generation is presented in the work of calado et al 2012 in such generators the magnetic flux of the rotor is produced by the permanent magnets and the magnetic flux electrical current and power in the stator are generated as a result of the motion of the rotor and its magnets the employment of a pmslg as the pto system of a wec requires the implementation of a control logic for the electrical generator aimed to ensure the adequate tracking of the set point generated by the wec controller and the safety of the generator the basic control strategy applied to electrical machines is the field oriented control foc which has been widely studied in the literature mayo et al 2020 wang et al 2015 ma et al 2001 the basic principle of the foc strategy is the decoupling of the stator current in the synchronous dq axes and their independent control additionally some features can be introduced in order to improve the performance of such controllers one of them being the field weakening fw strategy which allows attenuation of the statoric magnetic field in case of high magnetization an overview of various fw strategies is presented in the work of lu and kar 2010 according to this review fw strategies can be divided into two main groups improved magnetic design of the electrical drive xu et al 1995 and control functionalities based on power electronics tursini et al 2009 recent examples of implementation of a fw functionality for control purposes of electrical generators in wave energy applications oscillating water column owc ramirez et al 2019 wec ammar et al 2017 sullivan and lightbody 2016 can been found in the literature all of them stress the importance of such a strategy to avoid damages and improve operation of the systems during situations of high speed in the present work the analysis has been expanded and the potential benefits in terms of additional energy hydrogen generation at real oceanic locations of extending the operation of a wec by means of a fw strategy have been computed note that hydrogen generation will be calculated out of the produced energy serna and tadeo 2014 and will be used as an indicator of the production of the wecs as wave resource measurement data used in the validation procedure have been obtained from far offshore locations regarding the operation of linear point absorbers it is usually limited to a predefined range described with the significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p of the incoming wave front rusu and onea 2018 for waves with peak periods t p outside the range or significant wave heights h s below the cut in value the excitation induced in the point absorber is not high enough to sustent its operation on the contrary for significant wave heights h s above the cut out value the operation is restricted to preserve the integrity of the device for instance as a result of high waves the operation of the wec could be worsened due to the reduced performance of the pto system which faces a maximum force limitation coe et al 2020 in higher wave conditions excessive mechanical loads could be induced in the point absorber neary et al 2020 and its operation stopped for safety reasons an extreme wave conditions analysis prior to installation of a wec must be performed in order to guarantee the integrity of the device under extreme environmental conditions neary et al 2020 in this paper a fw functionality implemented in the foc control system of the pmslg is presented to improve and extend the operation of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers in scenarios of high wave excitation in those cases the velocity of the floating body increases as a result of the high excitation of the waves and consequently the magnetization of the stator of the pmslg is remarkably incremented on account of this high statoric magnetic field and the voltage limitations of the actuator the regulation performance of the pto system is remarkably worsened thus the demagnetization of the magnetic field by means of a fw functionality could help improve the performance of the pto system and therefore extend the operation and energy hydrogen generation of a wec furthermore the relation between the size of a wec and the potential benefits of the proposed fw strategy is also studied in this paper to that end the proposed strategy is applied to two point absorbers of different form and size in both cases the hydrodynamic parameters of the floating body are calculated with the boundary element method bem code nemoh nrel nwtc 2020 babarit and delhommeau 2015 subsequently the equations of the motion of the single body point absorber including the hydrodynamic parameters a model of a pmslg and the control strategies are implemented in matlab simulink by combining all of them a wave to wire w2w model penalba and ringwood 2019 2020 of the wec is obtained in which the temporal wave elevation data is the only input and any variable associated to the performance of the wec can be analysed with special mention to the generated power the irregular wave elevation data for the simulation based validation of the fw functionality are generated with the module hydrodyn jonkman et al 2015 finally the additional energy and hydrogen production of a wec due to extension of its operation with the proposed fw functionality in four far offshore locations and one nearshore location have been computed using real wave resource data from the atlantic ocean and the biscay coast respectively these data have been obtained using era5 hersbach et al 2020 a widely employed tool for meteorological studies all around the world this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the design of the w2w model is described including the wave data generation the hydrodynamics and motion modelling of the point absorber the pto system and the control strategy in sections 3 and 4 the obtained results and the discussion are presented respectively finally the conclusions of the conducted analysis are explained in section 5 2 wave energy converter w2w model 2 1 wave data the operation and power production of a wec are at first instance defined by the wave resource at the installation site of the device in order to ensure its correct performance in advance the operation of a wec at various sea states can be analysed in simulation in this case the wave elevation data for the design and simulation of the proposed w2w model have been obtained using the module hydrodyn jonkman et al 2015 which is part of the aeroelastic code fast v8 lheea centrale nantes 2019 the aforementioned hydrodyn module enables creation of wave elevation data with high temporal resolution and defined by various physical and meteorological parameters the most important being the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p additionally the wave data can be generated to be spread in different directions and according to diverse ocean wave spectra the wave elevation data generated for the present analysis are based on the jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 pierson and moskowitz 1964 which describes the concept of developing sea states and is widely employed in oceanography for extreme event analysis the peak enhancement factor for the aforementioned spectrum is calculated following the methodology in iec 61400 3 annex b i e based on the peak wave period t p and the significant wave height h s the time step for the output data has been set to 0 125 s more than ten times the lowest period expected for the waves in order to ensure that all frequencies get adequately modelled finally the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p will be modified to characterize various wave scenarios the obtained wave elevation data are directly applied to the w2w model as an input in format of temporal series 2 2 hydrodynamics and motion of the point absorber the wecs considered in this analysis are based on two different existing configurations of a single body linear point absorber the first point absorber from now on addressed as wavebot is inspired in the geometry of the commercial wavebot device coe et al 2016 the second point absorber addressed as flat is based on the flat geometry of the uppsala floating device danielsson 2006 in both cases the motion of the oscillating body is restricted to an in heave linear oscillation which is to be converted into electrical energy by means of a pto system linear in heave oscillating point absorbers are designed either to be moored to the ocean floor or to a submerged platform brekken 2011 which is usually the preferable solution for far offshore energy production farms in this case the functional design procedure of the point absorber is accomplished by considering an adequately moored device potential constraints arising from the design of the mooring system could be applied in a posterior procedure the main physical characteristics of both point absorber devices designed for the present analysis are listed in table 1 as it is to be noticed the flat point absorber has a bigger size and mass than the wavebot device the objective of comparing both floating bodies is to relate the benefits of the proposed fw control functionality to the size of the point absorber and thus their different hydrodynamic properties the computation of the hydrodynamic parameters corresponding to both point absorbers has been performed with the open source bem code nemoh nrel nwtc 2020 babarit and delhommeau 2015 by means of this code the radiated and diffracted velocity fields are computed and the frequency dependent radiation damping radiation added mass and excitation coefficient of both floating bodies are calculated as a result the performance of the floating body under interaction with the waves gets fully characterized the number of panels defined for the mesh and posterior hydrodynamic analysis of each point absorber has been defined as 200 and 400 respectively the mesh for both point absorbers are shown in figs 1a and 1b the dynamics of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers have been extensively studied in the literature antónio 2008 babarit and clément 2006 the time domain expression for the linear modelling of single body floating devices is shown in eq 1 which is based on the notorious cummins equation cummins 1962 1 m z t f e t f r t f h t f p t o t the radiation force faedo et al 2018 as shown in eq 2 is modelled as the sum of the added mass at infinite frequency and the convolution integral of the causal radiation impulse response function irf of the floating body 2 f r t μ z t 0 t k r t τ z τ d τ where μ is the radiation added mass at infinite frequency and k r represents the radiation irf the hydrostatic force is calculated with the hydrostatic stiffness k h of the floating body f h t k h z t and the excitation force is modelled as f e t f e η t with the normalized excitation force on the body f e previously calculated using linearized potential flow theory with nemoh genest and ringwood 2016 note that at this stage the non linearity associated to the froude krylov force see giorgi et al 2016 2020 has not been considered in the modelling of the motion nonetheless in light of its relevance in the motion of axisymmetric floating bodies under controller conditions its introduction will be studied for future analyses 2 3 pto system the pto system proposed in this paper for the electrical power generation see fig 2 is formed by the combination of a pmslg and a power electronics converter pec which is used to have control over the electromagnetic force generated by the linear generator as the power source of the pec an uninterrupted power supply ups is considered which could correspond either to the electrical grid in nearshore applications or to a hydrogen based fuel cell in far offshore applications the double purpose of the pto system is to convert the mechanical power of the oscillating body into electrical energy and actuate on the point absorber with the objective of maximizing its power absorption falcao 2010 the main advantage of using a pmslg as pto system with in heave linear oscillating devices is that the mechanical power of the point absorber can be directly transformed into electrical energy other pto techniques such as an hydraulic system would require a previous transformation of the linear oscillation into rotatory motion which introduces extra elements and complexity to the system kassem et al 2015 the principal parameters of the proposed pmslg are listed in table 2 in case of a pmslg the force exerted by the pto system f p t o t corresponds to the electromagnetic force f e m t generated in the stator of the electrical machine consequently the force the pto system exerts in the floating body can be controlled by regulation of this electromagnetic force according to the foc theory mayo et al 2020 sullivan and lightbody 2016 ammar et al 2017 the operation of an electrical generator can be controlled by regulation of its statoric electrical current in the synchronous dq axes the transformation of sinusoidal 3 phase signals into the synchronous dq axes is achieved by means of the park transformation park 1929 additionally according to the same foc theory if the control system aligns the rotor flux of the generator with one of the synchronous dq axes by means of an adequate phase definition in the current injection the electromagnetic force induced in the stator of the generator is directly proportional to the current in the opposite axis as shown in eq 3 3 f p t o t f e m t 3 π p σ i s q t l where f e m t is the electromagnetic force in the stator of the pmlsg and i s q t is the stator current in the synchronous q axis the expression of the electrical angle θ s t used for the alignment with the synchronous axes is shown in eq 4 likewise the mathematical expressions corresponding to the electrical voltage in the stator of the linear generator in the synchronous dq axes are shown in eq 6 and 7 4 θ s t 2 π p z t l 5 w s t d θ s t d t 6 v s d t r s i s d t l s d i s d t d t l s w s t i s q t 7 v s q t r s i s q t l s d i s q t d t l s w s t i s d t w s t σ where z t is the in heave displacement of the floating body w s t is the frequency of the electrical variables in the stator of the pmslg and i s d t i s q t v s d t and v s q t are the stator current and voltages in the synchronous dq axes as a result it is demonstrated that the heave velocity of the oscillating body z t eq 5 has a direct impact on the stator currents eqs 6 and 7 and hence on the force exerted by the pto system f p t o t eq 3 likewise it is shown that the force f p t o t and ultimately the motion of the oscillating body can be influenced by actuating on the stator voltage v s d t and v s q t to that end the power electronics converter and the associated control strategy are employed the control strategy proposed in this paper is based on the same principle as the original foc strategy and presents thus a double control objective on the one hand by controlling the stator current in the synchronous q axis the force f p t o t induced in the linear oscillating body can be regulated on the other hand by controlling the stator current in the synchronous d axis a fw functionality can be implemented in order to reduce the magnetic flux in the stator in cases of high wave excitation see ramirez et al 2019 for more detail during normal operation of the electrical drive without fw the regulation of the stator current in the synchronous d axis would serve to control the reactive power generation of the system in case any grid support requirements should be met 2 4 pto control strategy the control strategy of the pto system is formed by two regulation loops the wec controller it is the outer controller in open loop form which calculates the force f p t o r e f t the pto system must exert in the floating device and the pmslg controller it is the inner controller in closed loop form which receives the reference of the force f p t o r e f t from the outer controller and ensures its adequate tracking by regulation of the electrical currents in the linear generator thus the implementation of both controllers in a joint simulation is important to detect possible interactions between both regulators and adequately treat limitations that could affect either controller regarding the wec controller many strategies have been proposed in the literature for this purpose babarit and clément 2006 cretel et al 2011 coe et al 2020 bacelli and coe 2020 the complex conjugate control strategy falcão 2010 valid for regular wave conditions only provides the mathematically optimal force f p t o t the pto system should apply in the oscillating body in order to maximize its power absorption the practical application of this optimal force is complicated mainly due to two reasons the variability of the frequency of the incident waves and the power limitations of the pto system garcía violini et al 2020 a review of simple controllers applicable in real scenarios is presented in the work of garcía violini et al 2020 in this paper a simple proportional damping controller coe et al 2020 is proposed as the wec controller see eq 8 8 f p t o r e f t b p t o z t where z t is the in heave velocity of the floating body regarding the pmslg controller as previously introduced a foc strategy is proposed in this paper for the tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t calculated by the wec outer regulator in foc control as shown in eq 3 the tracking of the reference pto force is ensured by means of the closed loop regulation of the stator current in the synchronous q axis additionally in order to improve the performance of the foc control system in scenarios of high wave excitation a fw control functionality has been added in this paper the goal of the fw strategy is to attenuate the statoric magnetic flux in cases of high velocity of the rotor as a result an improved performance of the whole system at high speeds is expected as well as the possibility to extend the operational range of the wec as shown in fig 3 the fw functionality allows operation of the electrical generator at high speeds this is achieved by means of attenuating its statoric magnetic field ramirez et al 2019 since the fw is accomplished by regulation of the stator current in the synchronous d axis see eq 7 either the rotor torque must be reduced see pink line in fig 3 or it must be accounted for a greater current flow through the electrical system applied to the operation of wecs since the high speed situations are prone to happen in high wave elevation scenarios the fw functionality could help improve and extend the operation of the wecs to higher wave height scenarios ammar et al 2017 sullivan and lightbody 2016 in this case the set point of the d axis stator current has been made adaptive with respect to the linear velocity of the rotor using an interpolation table the current design makes the electrical system to be unable to effectively ensure tracking of the reference force f p t o r e f t for heave velocities greater than 3 5 m s consequently at low velocities no d axis stator current is injected however by increasing the heave velocity the set point i s d r e f must be incremented the tuning of the control parameters is shown in table 3 for the proportional pto controller the definition of the b p t o gain value is based on the premise that the reference pto force f p t o r e f t does not reach saturation until approximately the original wave height cut out value of the system in this case 6 m for the tuning of the controllers related to the foc control i s d and i s q control loops the locations of the closed loop poles as well as the phase margin and bandwidth have been considered to ensure a correct response of the system finally the d axis stator current set point corresponding to the fw functionality has been defined in form of an interpolation table the model of the point absorber the pmslg model and the control system are all combined and implemented in matlab simulink to form the w2w model see fig 4 as previously introduced the performance and power production of a wec under different wave resource scenarios can be studied using this w2w model the execution time step of the point absorber model is set to 0 01 s the execution time step of the pmslg model is set to 5 μ s and the execution time step of the control system is set to 200 μ s the selection of the time steps is the result of a compromise between the computational burden on the one hand and the frequencies of the signals that are modelled and the assurance of stability of the model on the other the interaction between the different elements of the w2w model can be observed in fig 4 the input of the model is the instantaneous wave elevation data see section 2 1 the hydrodynamic parameters of the point absorber calculated following the methodology presented in section 2 2 are implemented in the block named point absorber dynamics which corresponds to the equation of motion of the point absorber the model of the pmslg implemented in the block named pmslg model and described in section 2 3 receives the actuation of the control system wec pmslg control block and generates the electromagnetic force or f p t o that is applied to the point absorber and influences its motion finally the generated power can be measured at the stator windings of the pmslg 3 results 3 1 wave data instantaneous wave elevation data corresponding to a sea state defined by a significant wave height of h s 8 m and a wave peak period of t p 8 s have been generated for the validation of the proposed fw functionality the data generation has been accomplished with the module hydrodyn and following the methodology presented in section 2 1 since no statistical properties are to be extracted from the results in this simulation solely graphical representation and conceptual validation the duration of the simulation has been defined as 300 s as shown in fig 5 the generated wave elevation data contains sufficient scenarios for the conceptual validation of the fw strategy as it presents intervals with low wave elevation during which the floating body should operate normally as the heave velocity threshold to activate the fw functionality should not be reached and it also presents intervals with high wave elevation during which the floating body will not be able operate normally without the fw functionality since the heave velocity threshold that causes the high magnetization of the stator will be reached and the electrical system will be unable to effectively regulate the electromagnetic force in order to analyse the performance and power production of the wecs during this sea state the wave elevation data array is supplied to the w2w model presented in section 2 3 2 hydrodynamics of point absorber the interaction of a floating body with the incoming wave front and in consequence its motion are essentially defined by the inertial forces that arise from the potential flow theory in this case as introduced in section 2 2 the hydrodynamic equations corresponding to both point absorber geometries have been solved with the bem code nemoh and the added mass kg the radiation damping n m s and the excitation coefficient n m with respect to the frequency of the incoming wave front have been calculated and represented in figs 6a and 6b respectively the results are in concordance with similar studies in the literature isaacson et al 1990 gaeta et al 2020 and as expected the hydrodynamic analysis shows a remarkable correlation between the geometry of the point absorber and the frequential evolution of the inertial forces acting on it regarding the added mass it is incremented by increasing the cross sectional area of the point absorber regarding the radiation damping the increase of the size of the wec shows a considerable effect on its frequential evolution shifting the value of the maximum radiation damping to lower wave frequency values in absolute terms the value of the radiation damping is increased by incrementing its size finally in line with the radiation damping the excitation coefficient shows a tendency to be reduced for higher wave frequencies when the size of the wec is incremented in absolute terms the value of the excitation force is also increased by incrementing its size the variation of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the point absorber has a direct impact on the motion and thus power capture of the wec hence by applying the hydrodynamic parameters in the w2w model the joint performance of the point absorber and the pto system during different sea states of interest can be analysed in detail 3 3 point absorber operation improvement in this subsection the operation and power production of both wecs during the sea state shown in section 3 1 is presented to that end the instantaneous wave elevation data is applied to the corresponding w2w model and an analysis of the motion of the point absorber the electrical performance of the pto system and the power generation of the wec is carried out moreover the effect of implementing the fw strategy is also studied 3 3 1 wavebot point absorber the simulation results of the w2w model corresponding to the wavebot point absorber and without implementation of the fw functionality are shown in fig 7 the wave elevation η t and the in heave motion of the point absorber z t are represented in the upper plot the upper middle plot shows the motion velocity of the point absorber z t the middle plot presents the reference pto force f p t o r e f t and the corresponding instantaneous force f p t o t exerted by the pto system in the floating device the lower middle plot shows the instantaneous three phase electrical current through the stator windings of the electrical generator i s a b c t finally the lower plot represents the instantaneous power generated in the stator of the electrical generator p s t the obtained results support the expected premises since an inadequate operation of the pto system is observed when the instantaneous wave elevation increases while the wave elevation is low the limited excitation of the waves on the floating body causes neither abrupt motions of the floating body nor high heave velocities which enables an adequate operation of the pto system nevertheless as a result of the excitation exerted by high waves to the point absorber the motion velocity of the floating body z t becomes higher and consequently the magnetic flux in the stator of the pmslg is incremented see eq 7 subsequently on account of the voltage limitation of the electrical system its control capability is lost and the stator currents i s a b c t the electromagnetic force f e m t and the stator power p s t grow uncontrollably during this scenario the tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t is impossible and the wec should be stopped due to its safety not being guaranteed the application of the fw strategy proposed in this paper is aimed to solve the problem identified in fig 7 in order to validate the benefits associated to the implementation of the fw strategy the simulation results of the wavebot point absorber with implementation of the fw strategy are shown in fig 8 the order of the depicted variables has been maintained with respect to the previous figure in this subsection the simulation results depicted in fig 8 show a significantly improved operation of the pto system with high wave elevation and subsequent high excitation of the point absorber with the application of the fw functionality in fact in comparison to the same scenario in fig 7 the results in fig 8 present an adequate tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t during the whole simulation by reason of the fw functionality in cases of high excitation of the point absorber stator current in the synchronous d axis is injected in a controlled way and the magnetic flux in the stator of the pmslg is attenuated as a result the voltage limitation of the electrical system is not reached and the operation of the wec is kept under control by comparing simulation results in figs 7 and 8 an increase of the heave velocity of the point absorber z t after implementation of the fw functionality can be observed during certain periods it must be noted that in the results shown in fig 7 the application of extremely high f e m t forces is observable far beyond the maximum capability of the electrical system this behaviour is not realistic only numerical and evidences the impossibility of the electrical system to operate in such conditions with the application of this unreal and high force the heave velocity z t is kept low in contrast in the results shown in fig 8 the heave velocity z t grows bigger which responds to the application of a lower but realistic f e m t force which is saturated to the maximum capability of the electrical system finally it should be noted that as a result of the fw implementation and on account of the necessity to attenuate the statoric magnetic flux a high stator current in the synchronous d axis could be injected during some instants hence the power flow could be reverted which would result in power consumption the application of the fw strategy must be subject to a double condition on the one hand its implementation will only be legit if the mean power generation exceeds the mean power consumption caused by the fw functionality on the other hand the necessity to inject stator current in order to attenuate the magnetic flux must be taken into consideration when designing the electrical system and its maximal electrical current values 3 3 2 flat point absorber the simulation results of the flat point absorber without implementation of the fw strategy are shown in fig 9 the order of the depicted variables has been maintained following the example of the figures in the previous subsection the results obtained in fig 9 validate again the expected assumptions as the excitation of the high waves on the floating body cause high heave velocities z t and performance loss of the pto system the fast motions of the floating body cause an increment of the magnetic flux on the stator of the pmslg and in consequence the voltage capability of the pto system is exceeded and the control over the reference pto force f p t o r e f t is lost subsequently the motion of the wec is uncontrolled and the integrity of the pto system in this case the pmlsg is compromised due to overcurrents the simulation results of the flat point absorber with implementation of the fw strategy are shown in fig 10 the order of the depicted variables has been maintained with respect to the previous figure in this subsection the obtained results show that as expected the tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t is considerably improved with the application of the fw strategy moreover the overcurrents that may endanger the safety of the electrical system have been removed and substituted by a controlled current injection aimed to reduce the magnetization of the stator hence the safety of the wec is guaranteed and its operation sustained in comparison to the application of the fw strategy in the wavebot point absorber see fig 8 it is to be noted that with the larger flat point absorber the electrical current injection for the demagnetization of the stator has been increased as a consequence of the bigger mass of the device the recovery from the high excitation period is worsened see oscillations in heave velocity z t and the actuation of the fw functionality has been necessary on more occasions 3 4 extension of operation and power matrix the effect of implementing the proposed fw strategy in both wecs in terms of operational range extension is analysed in this subsection as it has been demonstrated in section 3 3 the application of the fw strategy is based on the controlled current injection in order to attenuate the magnetic flux in the stator of the pmslg and thus ensure the adequate tracking of the reference pto force and the safety of the wec as a result the operation of the wec can be extended to higher or additional significant wave height h s values see first column in table 4 however the injection of additional current due to the fw strategy is linked to an increase of the dimensions and capability of the electrical system which results in a bigger economical cost in this case in order to relate the benefits of the fw strategy to the overdimensioning of the electrical system two maximum electrical current values have been defined and the operation of the wecs with the fw functionality has been extended until the restriction of maximum current capability has been met the extensions of the power matrix in kw for both wec devices are shown in table 4 respectively note that the hs tp pair values used for the power matrix generation do not correspond to real wave measurements they are obtained following the methodology presented in section 2 1 and are used to fully characterize the operation of the wec in the whole additional operational range the time duration of the simulations to calculate the power production of the wec has been set to 30 min as recommended in the international tower tank conference ittc for seakeeping state simulations day et al 2014 the operation extension associated to a maximum demagnetization d axis electrical current of 450 a has been highlighted in blue colour the whole extension of the power matrices corresponds to the case of a maximum demagnetization electrical current of 550 a therefore it is to be noted that with an increased electrical current capability of the system the operation of the wec could be extended to higher significant wave height values h s at the expense of a higher economical cost of the electrical system and pending to a mechanical loads analysis that ensures the integrity of the device additionally in line to the results obtained in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 it is to be observed that a longer extension of the operation of the wec can be achieved in case of the smaller point absorber wavebot with the same dimensioning of the electrical system 3 5 additional energy and hydrogen calculation real wave elevation measurements from four far offshore locations p 00 54 n 29 5 w p 01 48 5 n 39 w p 02 37 5 n 57 w p 03 57 n 22 5 w at the atlantic ocean and one nearshore location at the biscay coast p 04 43 37 n 3 07 w ulazia et al 2020 have been used for the calculation of the additional energy hydrogen generated by the wecs as a result of the extension of their operational range by application of the fw functionality the wave resource data downloaded from the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2020 is presented in form of 1 hourly mean values and covers the 2010 2019 time period since solely the additional energy hydrogen generated by the wecs in case of implementation of the fw strategy is of interest only the extensions of the power matrices see table 4 have been used for the calculations the results of the additional energy generation of both wecs in the analysed offshore locations are listed in table 5 on account of the difficulties associated to the grid integration in oceanic far offshore locations the employment of energy vectors such as hydrogen or methanol for the energy storage is supported in those farms consequently the additional hydrogen production of the wecs as a result of the extension of their operational range by application of the fw functionality is presented in table 6 an energy consumption of 4 2 kwh n m 3 covering all desalination compression electrolysis and additional processes has been used for the computation of the hydrogen production serna and tadeo 2014 the results show that important additional energy hydrogen production could be achieved by extension of the operational range of the wecs with the application of the proposed fw strategy especially in the far offshore locations moreover it is to be observed that the achievable additional energy hydrogen gain is more important in wecs with bigger size for instance a maximum of 177 54 mwh energy or 42272 n m 3 hydrogen are to be produced with the flat wec at location p 01 during the analysed 20 years likewise a maximum of 131 67 mwh energy or 31350 n m 3 hydrogen are to be produced by using the wavebot wec at the same location in terms of equivalent production hours the generated additional energy hydrogen would correspond to 2270 equivalent production hours of the flat wec operating at maximum power and 2095 equivalent production hours of the wavebot wec operating at its maximum power it is to be observed that the achievable energy hydrogen gain depends on the dimensioning of the electrical system if the maximum demagnetization electrical current capability is increased the actuation of the fw functionality and therefore the operation of the wec can be extended to higher wave significant values h s and the produced additional energy hydrogen is also incremented moreover the dimensioning of the electrical system might also affect the selection of the best location for the installation of a wec in this way while the maximum additional energy hydrogen for a dimensioning of 550 a of demagnetization electrical current is produced at location p 01 the location with maximum additional production is p 03 if the electrical system is dimensioned for 450 a of demagnetization current therefore the wave resource characteristics of a given location might also be important to be considered during the design process of the fw strategy finally with the current control parametrization the additional energy production of the wavebot device is observed to surpass that of the flat device when the electrical system is dimensioned for a maximum demagnetization current of 450 a this fact emphasizes the importance of a multiperspective design procedure of the wecs adapting their geometry to the characteristics of the sea states and the capabilities of the electrical system 4 discussion the performance of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers has been extensively studied in the literature faizal et al 2014 bezunartea barrio et al 2020 piscopo et al 2018 rusu 2018 essentially while some works are devoted to the design of the best geometry and size of the point absorbers esmaeilzadeh and alam 2019 others are aimed to find the optimal control law to be applied to a wec in order to maximize its power absorption babarit and clément 2006 cretel et al 2011 coe et al 2020 bacelli and coe 2020 regarding the design process of the control strategy the most recent works in the literature include in their procedures a restriction for the maximum force the pto system can apply in the point absorber coe et al 2020 however this restriction is usually treated as a mathematical constraint and its physical origin is neglected in this analysis the introduction of a model of the pto system in the simulations allows to have a fully detailed system and the conversion and treatment of the mathematical restrictions as physical variables which enables a more detailed design of the whole wec an important aspect to consider during the design process of a wec is the definition of its operational range usually limited either by the maximum displacement of the point absorber or the maximum force the pto system can apply in the analysis presented in this paper a fw control algorithm has been proposed and validated as a solution to overcome some restrictions associated to an electrical pto system based on a pmslg as a result of applying the fw functionality the performance of the pto system is improved at high velocities of the point absorber and the operational range of the wec could be extended to higher significant wave height h s values the execution of a similar analysis would result unfeasible if the model of the pto system would have not been combined with the model of the point absorber and the electrical limitation had solely been treated as a simple mathematical constraint the development of advanced optimization problems which integrate modelling of the physical source of the constraints is contemplated as a paramount step for the evolution of energy maximizing strategies applied to wecs the benefits of the presented fw functionality have also been found to be related to the size of the wec in case of larger wecs with a higher size and therefore mass the implementation of the fw functionality could result especially helpful due to their prolonged malfunction after a sea state of high excitation consequence of the high inertia associated to their mass hence the fw strategy could result in important improvements of the operation of the wec during longer periods of time a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the energy gain associated to the fw functionality with respect to the pto control strategy parametrization is also considered as an important future work the benefits of the presented fw functionality could also be linked to the characteristics of the wave resource at the installation site of a wec see fig 11 the results presented in the analysis have shown that the actuation of the proposed functionality enables operation of the device at sea states with high wave amplitude consequently while at locations with low wave heights the application of the fw strategy could not result remarkably helpful the potential benefit of its implementation at locations with high wave heights is evident therefore in this case the implementation of the fw functionality would result more beneficial at the far offshore locations p 00 p 01 and p 03 where the amount of hours with high waves is larger than at locations p 02 and p o4 meteorological analyses of the wave characteristics at a defined location prior to the installation of the device could help determine the suitability of the strategy to be or not be implemented in the wec finally the industrial application of the strategy is considered to be significantly easier than complex optimization algorithms that could be problematic when being implemented and executed in real time applications in a microprocessor based ccu converter control unit in fact the proposed functionality could be considered as a plug play element of an extensively industrially mature control algorithm as it is the foc strategy the economical benefits associated to the installation of the fw strategy could be measured by the additional energy hydrogen production achieved as a result of the extension of the operation of the wec it must be taken into account that the application of the fw strategy requires an overdimensioning of the electrical system which will result in an increment of its economical cost and will have to be considered when studying the economical viability of the project 5 conclusions a fw control functionality to improve and extend the operation of linear in heave oscillating point absorber based wecs has been proposed in this paper the pto system associated to the linear point absorbers is electrical based on a pmslg as a result of the conducted analysis the potential benefits of implementing this functionality on the energy hydrogen generation of two different sized wecs has been stressed the implementation of a fw strategy has been found to effectively reduce the magnetic flux of the stator of the electrical generator during sea states of high excitation i e sea states that cause high velocity motions of the point absorber the application of the fw functionality during those periods enables to keep an adequate tracking of the reference pto force and to avoid overcurrents that may damage the electrical system in fact by injecting electrical current in a controlled way the performance of the electrical pto system is remarkably improved and its safety ensured which allows to extend the operation of the wec to higher values of the significant wave height h s always subject to a mechanical loads analysis that ensures the integrity of the device in such high wave conditions the effect of the proposed fw strategy has also been found to be dependent on the size and therefore hydrodynamic characteristics of the point absorber of the wec the application of the fw strategy has been found to be more necessary for larger wecs in which the recovery from a problematic sea state is worse due to the bigger inertia in case of smaller wecs their operational range could be further extended with the same dimensioning of the electrical system always subject to the control parametrization finally the additional energy hydrogen production of both different sized wecs have been computed using real wave resource data in four far offshore locations in the atlantic ocean and one nearshore location in the biscay coast the obtained results show that important additional energy hydrogen could be produced as a result of the extension of the operation of the point absorber using the fw functionality these economical benefits in combination with the overdimensioning of the electrical system due to the proposed fw functionality should be considered when assessing the economic viability of the installation of the wec credit authorship contribution statement aitor saenz aguirre conceptualization methodology

20179,the exploitation of marine wave energy resource has led to the design of numerous wave energy converter wec configurations the power absorption of a wec is tightly related to its physical properties and the characteristics of the incoming wave front additionally the operational range of a wec is limited to certain characteristics of the incoming waves these restrictions are usually related to limitations in the maximum force of the power take off pto system and the safety of the wec as a result the power production of the wec must be stopped during sea states of high wave elevation with the objective of improving the operation of a wec during these sea states a field weakening fw control functionality is proposed to be implemented in the control system of a single body linear in heave oscillating point absorber with a permanent magnet synchronous linear generator pmslg based electrical pto system the aim of the aforementioned functionality is to attenuate the magnetic flux in the pmslg during sea states of high wave elevation the influence of the size of a wec on the benefits of the proposed fw functionality is also studied to that end two point absorbers with different size are analysed with nemoh and a wave to wire w2w model of each wec is developed this w2w model enables analysis of the performance and power production of the wecs at different sea states of interest the obtained results show a remarkable improvement of the operation of a wec with the implementation of the fw strategy during sea states of high excitation which leads to an extension of its operation and subsequent additional energy hydrogen generation keywords wave energy fluid dynamics point absorber w2w model high waves linear generator field weakening list of

installation of wave energy converters wecs has remarkably grown since the early 1980s babarit 2015 the pressure to combat climate change and the necessity to promote alternative renewable energy generation systems have caused the fast development of different wec technologies all of them aimed to the exploitation of the wave energy resource faizal et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 many studies have been directed to the estimation and characterization of the huge wave energy resource in various oceanic areas all over the world arinaga and cheung 2012 rusu and onea 2016 among wecs point absorbers have recently gained in interest due to their reduced dimensions and remarkable power absorption capability in relation to their size faizal et al 2014 these point absorbers designed to absorb the kinetic energy of the waves in offshore sites oscillate as a result of the hydrodynamic excitation generated by the waves in the device subsequently this mechanical motion is converted into electrical energy regarding their classification falcao 2010 point absorbers are principally categorized with respect to their physical location related to the ocean water level in this way floating point absorbers and fully submerged point absorbers are to be differentiated comparisonal studies of the performance of both technologies can be found in the literature sergiienko et al 2017 the secondary criterion for the classification of point absorbers is related to the degree of freedom of their motion with respect to the incoming waves according to this criterion translational point absorbers the device oscillates with a linear mechanical motion and rotational point absorbers the device oscillates with a rotational mechanical motion can be distinguished finally point absorbers can also be classified with respect to the number of bodies forming the wave energy exploitation device falnes 1999 korde 2003 wang et al 2018 to the present day the most widely studied wave energy absorption devices are the single body in heave oscillating linear point absorbers in order to understand and mathematically characterize the interaction between the waves and these point absorbers the hydrodynamics of in heave oscillating bodies of different forms flat plate bezunartea barrio et al 2020 cylinder gaeta et al 2020 and cone rusch et al 2020 have been studied in detail in the literature moreover the effect of increasing the size of the floating body has also been object of study bezunartea barrio et al 2020 according to the results of this latter analysis the radiation damping of the point absorber is heavily influenced by the frequency of the incoming wave front and the size of the device hence it is concluded that the performance of the wec is tightly related to its geometry additionally wec design selection and placing procedures based on optimization problems can also be found in the literature piscopo et al 2018 vantorre et al 2004 child and venugopal 2010 borgarino et al 2012 the aim of such optimization procedures is the selection of the optimal wec device for a predefined application and considering the techno economic constraints garcia teruel et al 2020 sirigu et al 2020 prototypes of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers have also been installed and tested in real wave conditions the first prototype called power buoy edwards et al 2014 has a rated power of 3 kw and is formed by a floating body and a damping heave plate moored to the ocean floor while the damping plate is designed to attenuate the vertical displacements of the device the floating body is free to oscillate in heave this linear motion is later converted into rotatory motion and electricity is generated by means of a rotating electrical generator another prototype the uppsala university point absorber danielsson 2006 has a rated power of 10 kw and consists of a floating cylindrical buoy connected to a gravity based foundation the electricity is generated with a permanent magnet synchronous linear generator pmslg finally the l10 prototype ruehl 2011 with a diameter of 3 5 m and a rated power of 10 kw was designed by the university of oregon and successfully tested in newport oregon in september 2008 all these prototypes have contributed to the increase of the industrial maturity of the technology an important aspect to consider related to the operation of point absorbers is the selection and design of the power take off pto system in wecs a double objective is pursued with the pto system conversion of the mechanical oscillation into electrical power and regulation of the point absorber motion to the end of maximizing its power absorption in case of linear point absorbers the design and application of hydraulic ptos cargo et al 2012 hansen et al 2013 antónio 2008 and electrical ptos prudell et al 2010 polinder et al 2004 ivanova et al 2005 have been extensively described in the literature in both cases the force the pto system exerts to the point absorber is aimed to influence its motion and maximize the power absorption therefore the design of many control strategies implemented in a generic pto system have been proposed in the literature latching control babarit and clément 2006 velocity tracking based model predictive control cretel et al 2011 proportional control coe et al 2020 and pseudo spectral control bacelli and coe 2020 in application to in heave oscillating linear point absorbers the employment of electrical ptos results easier than hydraulic ptos since no intermediate conversion of the linear mechanical motion into rotatory is required in fact the use of a pmslg enables direct conversion of the linear mechanical motion into electrical power the design procedure of a synchronous linear generator for wave energy generation is presented in the work of calado et al 2012 in such generators the magnetic flux of the rotor is produced by the permanent magnets and the magnetic flux electrical current and power in the stator are generated as a result of the motion of the rotor and its magnets the employment of a pmslg as the pto system of a wec requires the implementation of a control logic for the electrical generator aimed to ensure the adequate tracking of the set point generated by the wec controller and the safety of the generator the basic control strategy applied to electrical machines is the field oriented control foc which has been widely studied in the literature mayo et al 2020 wang et al 2015 ma et al 2001 the basic principle of the foc strategy is the decoupling of the stator current in the synchronous dq axes and their independent control additionally some features can be introduced in order to improve the performance of such controllers one of them being the field weakening fw strategy which allows attenuation of the statoric magnetic field in case of high magnetization an overview of various fw strategies is presented in the work of lu and kar 2010 according to this review fw strategies can be divided into two main groups improved magnetic design of the electrical drive xu et al 1995 and control functionalities based on power electronics tursini et al 2009 recent examples of implementation of a fw functionality for control purposes of electrical generators in wave energy applications oscillating water column owc ramirez et al 2019 wec ammar et al 2017 sullivan and lightbody 2016 can been found in the literature all of them stress the importance of such a strategy to avoid damages and improve operation of the systems during situations of high speed in the present work the analysis has been expanded and the potential benefits in terms of additional energy hydrogen generation at real oceanic locations of extending the operation of a wec by means of a fw strategy have been computed note that hydrogen generation will be calculated out of the produced energy serna and tadeo 2014 and will be used as an indicator of the production of the wecs as wave resource measurement data used in the validation procedure have been obtained from far offshore locations regarding the operation of linear point absorbers it is usually limited to a predefined range described with the significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p of the incoming wave front rusu and onea 2018 for waves with peak periods t p outside the range or significant wave heights h s below the cut in value the excitation induced in the point absorber is not high enough to sustent its operation on the contrary for significant wave heights h s above the cut out value the operation is restricted to preserve the integrity of the device for instance as a result of high waves the operation of the wec could be worsened due to the reduced performance of the pto system which faces a maximum force limitation coe et al 2020 in higher wave conditions excessive mechanical loads could be induced in the point absorber neary et al 2020 and its operation stopped for safety reasons an extreme wave conditions analysis prior to installation of a wec must be performed in order to guarantee the integrity of the device under extreme environmental conditions neary et al 2020 in this paper a fw functionality implemented in the foc control system of the pmslg is presented to improve and extend the operation of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers in scenarios of high wave excitation in those cases the velocity of the floating body increases as a result of the high excitation of the waves and consequently the magnetization of the stator of the pmslg is remarkably incremented on account of this high statoric magnetic field and the voltage limitations of the actuator the regulation performance of the pto system is remarkably worsened thus the demagnetization of the magnetic field by means of a fw functionality could help improve the performance of the pto system and therefore extend the operation and energy hydrogen generation of a wec furthermore the relation between the size of a wec and the potential benefits of the proposed fw strategy is also studied in this paper to that end the proposed strategy is applied to two point absorbers of different form and size in both cases the hydrodynamic parameters of the floating body are calculated with the boundary element method bem code nemoh nrel nwtc 2020 babarit and delhommeau 2015 subsequently the equations of the motion of the single body point absorber including the hydrodynamic parameters a model of a pmslg and the control strategies are implemented in matlab simulink by combining all of them a wave to wire w2w model penalba and ringwood 2019 2020 of the wec is obtained in which the temporal wave elevation data is the only input and any variable associated to the performance of the wec can be analysed with special mention to the generated power the irregular wave elevation data for the simulation based validation of the fw functionality are generated with the module hydrodyn jonkman et al 2015 finally the additional energy and hydrogen production of a wec due to extension of its operation with the proposed fw functionality in four far offshore locations and one nearshore location have been computed using real wave resource data from the atlantic ocean and the biscay coast respectively these data have been obtained using era5 hersbach et al 2020 a widely employed tool for meteorological studies all around the world this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the design of the w2w model is described including the wave data generation the hydrodynamics and motion modelling of the point absorber the pto system and the control strategy in sections 3 and 4 the obtained results and the discussion are presented respectively finally the conclusions of the conducted analysis are explained in section 5 2 wave energy converter w2w model 2 1 wave data the operation and power production of a wec are at first instance defined by the wave resource at the installation site of the device in order to ensure its correct performance in advance the operation of a wec at various sea states can be analysed in simulation in this case the wave elevation data for the design and simulation of the proposed w2w model have been obtained using the module hydrodyn jonkman et al 2015 which is part of the aeroelastic code fast v8 lheea centrale nantes 2019 the aforementioned hydrodyn module enables creation of wave elevation data with high temporal resolution and defined by various physical and meteorological parameters the most important being the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p additionally the wave data can be generated to be spread in different directions and according to diverse ocean wave spectra the wave elevation data generated for the present analysis are based on the jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 pierson and moskowitz 1964 which describes the concept of developing sea states and is widely employed in oceanography for extreme event analysis the peak enhancement factor for the aforementioned spectrum is calculated following the methodology in iec 61400 3 annex b i e based on the peak wave period t p and the significant wave height h s the time step for the output data has been set to 0 125 s more than ten times the lowest period expected for the waves in order to ensure that all frequencies get adequately modelled finally the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p will be modified to characterize various wave scenarios the obtained wave elevation data are directly applied to the w2w model as an input in format of temporal series 2 2 hydrodynamics and motion of the point absorber the wecs considered in this analysis are based on two different existing configurations of a single body linear point absorber the first point absorber from now on addressed as wavebot is inspired in the geometry of the commercial wavebot device coe et al 2016 the second point absorber addressed as flat is based on the flat geometry of the uppsala floating device danielsson 2006 in both cases the motion of the oscillating body is restricted to an in heave linear oscillation which is to be converted into electrical energy by means of a pto system linear in heave oscillating point absorbers are designed either to be moored to the ocean floor or to a submerged platform brekken 2011 which is usually the preferable solution for far offshore energy production farms in this case the functional design procedure of the point absorber is accomplished by considering an adequately moored device potential constraints arising from the design of the mooring system could be applied in a posterior procedure the main physical characteristics of both point absorber devices designed for the present analysis are listed in table 1 as it is to be noticed the flat point absorber has a bigger size and mass than the wavebot device the objective of comparing both floating bodies is to relate the benefits of the proposed fw control functionality to the size of the point absorber and thus their different hydrodynamic properties the computation of the hydrodynamic parameters corresponding to both point absorbers has been performed with the open source bem code nemoh nrel nwtc 2020 babarit and delhommeau 2015 by means of this code the radiated and diffracted velocity fields are computed and the frequency dependent radiation damping radiation added mass and excitation coefficient of both floating bodies are calculated as a result the performance of the floating body under interaction with the waves gets fully characterized the number of panels defined for the mesh and posterior hydrodynamic analysis of each point absorber has been defined as 200 and 400 respectively the mesh for both point absorbers are shown in figs 1a and 1b the dynamics of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers have been extensively studied in the literature antónio 2008 babarit and clément 2006 the time domain expression for the linear modelling of single body floating devices is shown in eq 1 which is based on the notorious cummins equation cummins 1962 1 m z t f e t f r t f h t f p t o t the radiation force faedo et al 2018 as shown in eq 2 is modelled as the sum of the added mass at infinite frequency and the convolution integral of the causal radiation impulse response function irf of the floating body 2 f r t μ z t 0 t k r t τ z τ d τ where μ is the radiation added mass at infinite frequency and k r represents the radiation irf the hydrostatic force is calculated with the hydrostatic stiffness k h of the floating body f h t k h z t and the excitation force is modelled as f e t f e η t with the normalized excitation force on the body f e previously calculated using linearized potential flow theory with nemoh genest and ringwood 2016 note that at this stage the non linearity associated to the froude krylov force see giorgi et al 2016 2020 has not been considered in the modelling of the motion nonetheless in light of its relevance in the motion of axisymmetric floating bodies under controller conditions its introduction will be studied for future analyses 2 3 pto system the pto system proposed in this paper for the electrical power generation see fig 2 is formed by the combination of a pmslg and a power electronics converter pec which is used to have control over the electromagnetic force generated by the linear generator as the power source of the pec an uninterrupted power supply ups is considered which could correspond either to the electrical grid in nearshore applications or to a hydrogen based fuel cell in far offshore applications the double purpose of the pto system is to convert the mechanical power of the oscillating body into electrical energy and actuate on the point absorber with the objective of maximizing its power absorption falcao 2010 the main advantage of using a pmslg as pto system with in heave linear oscillating devices is that the mechanical power of the point absorber can be directly transformed into electrical energy other pto techniques such as an hydraulic system would require a previous transformation of the linear oscillation into rotatory motion which introduces extra elements and complexity to the system kassem et al 2015 the principal parameters of the proposed pmslg are listed in table 2 in case of a pmslg the force exerted by the pto system f p t o t corresponds to the electromagnetic force f e m t generated in the stator of the electrical machine consequently the force the pto system exerts in the floating body can be controlled by regulation of this electromagnetic force according to the foc theory mayo et al 2020 sullivan and lightbody 2016 ammar et al 2017 the operation of an electrical generator can be controlled by regulation of its statoric electrical current in the synchronous dq axes the transformation of sinusoidal 3 phase signals into the synchronous dq axes is achieved by means of the park transformation park 1929 additionally according to the same foc theory if the control system aligns the rotor flux of the generator with one of the synchronous dq axes by means of an adequate phase definition in the current injection the electromagnetic force induced in the stator of the generator is directly proportional to the current in the opposite axis as shown in eq 3 3 f p t o t f e m t 3 π p σ i s q t l where f e m t is the electromagnetic force in the stator of the pmlsg and i s q t is the stator current in the synchronous q axis the expression of the electrical angle θ s t used for the alignment with the synchronous axes is shown in eq 4 likewise the mathematical expressions corresponding to the electrical voltage in the stator of the linear generator in the synchronous dq axes are shown in eq 6 and 7 4 θ s t 2 π p z t l 5 w s t d θ s t d t 6 v s d t r s i s d t l s d i s d t d t l s w s t i s q t 7 v s q t r s i s q t l s d i s q t d t l s w s t i s d t w s t σ where z t is the in heave displacement of the floating body w s t is the frequency of the electrical variables in the stator of the pmslg and i s d t i s q t v s d t and v s q t are the stator current and voltages in the synchronous dq axes as a result it is demonstrated that the heave velocity of the oscillating body z t eq 5 has a direct impact on the stator currents eqs 6 and 7 and hence on the force exerted by the pto system f p t o t eq 3 likewise it is shown that the force f p t o t and ultimately the motion of the oscillating body can be influenced by actuating on the stator voltage v s d t and v s q t to that end the power electronics converter and the associated control strategy are employed the control strategy proposed in this paper is based on the same principle as the original foc strategy and presents thus a double control objective on the one hand by controlling the stator current in the synchronous q axis the force f p t o t induced in the linear oscillating body can be regulated on the other hand by controlling the stator current in the synchronous d axis a fw functionality can be implemented in order to reduce the magnetic flux in the stator in cases of high wave excitation see ramirez et al 2019 for more detail during normal operation of the electrical drive without fw the regulation of the stator current in the synchronous d axis would serve to control the reactive power generation of the system in case any grid support requirements should be met 2 4 pto control strategy the control strategy of the pto system is formed by two regulation loops the wec controller it is the outer controller in open loop form which calculates the force f p t o r e f t the pto system must exert in the floating device and the pmslg controller it is the inner controller in closed loop form which receives the reference of the force f p t o r e f t from the outer controller and ensures its adequate tracking by regulation of the electrical currents in the linear generator thus the implementation of both controllers in a joint simulation is important to detect possible interactions between both regulators and adequately treat limitations that could affect either controller regarding the wec controller many strategies have been proposed in the literature for this purpose babarit and clément 2006 cretel et al 2011 coe et al 2020 bacelli and coe 2020 the complex conjugate control strategy falcão 2010 valid for regular wave conditions only provides the mathematically optimal force f p t o t the pto system should apply in the oscillating body in order to maximize its power absorption the practical application of this optimal force is complicated mainly due to two reasons the variability of the frequency of the incident waves and the power limitations of the pto system garcía violini et al 2020 a review of simple controllers applicable in real scenarios is presented in the work of garcía violini et al 2020 in this paper a simple proportional damping controller coe et al 2020 is proposed as the wec controller see eq 8 8 f p t o r e f t b p t o z t where z t is the in heave velocity of the floating body regarding the pmslg controller as previously introduced a foc strategy is proposed in this paper for the tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t calculated by the wec outer regulator in foc control as shown in eq 3 the tracking of the reference pto force is ensured by means of the closed loop regulation of the stator current in the synchronous q axis additionally in order to improve the performance of the foc control system in scenarios of high wave excitation a fw control functionality has been added in this paper the goal of the fw strategy is to attenuate the statoric magnetic flux in cases of high velocity of the rotor as a result an improved performance of the whole system at high speeds is expected as well as the possibility to extend the operational range of the wec as shown in fig 3 the fw functionality allows operation of the electrical generator at high speeds this is achieved by means of attenuating its statoric magnetic field ramirez et al 2019 since the fw is accomplished by regulation of the stator current in the synchronous d axis see eq 7 either the rotor torque must be reduced see pink line in fig 3 or it must be accounted for a greater current flow through the electrical system applied to the operation of wecs since the high speed situations are prone to happen in high wave elevation scenarios the fw functionality could help improve and extend the operation of the wecs to higher wave height scenarios ammar et al 2017 sullivan and lightbody 2016 in this case the set point of the d axis stator current has been made adaptive with respect to the linear velocity of the rotor using an interpolation table the current design makes the electrical system to be unable to effectively ensure tracking of the reference force f p t o r e f t for heave velocities greater than 3 5 m s consequently at low velocities no d axis stator current is injected however by increasing the heave velocity the set point i s d r e f must be incremented the tuning of the control parameters is shown in table 3 for the proportional pto controller the definition of the b p t o gain value is based on the premise that the reference pto force f p t o r e f t does not reach saturation until approximately the original wave height cut out value of the system in this case 6 m for the tuning of the controllers related to the foc control i s d and i s q control loops the locations of the closed loop poles as well as the phase margin and bandwidth have been considered to ensure a correct response of the system finally the d axis stator current set point corresponding to the fw functionality has been defined in form of an interpolation table the model of the point absorber the pmslg model and the control system are all combined and implemented in matlab simulink to form the w2w model see fig 4 as previously introduced the performance and power production of a wec under different wave resource scenarios can be studied using this w2w model the execution time step of the point absorber model is set to 0 01 s the execution time step of the pmslg model is set to 5 μ s and the execution time step of the control system is set to 200 μ s the selection of the time steps is the result of a compromise between the computational burden on the one hand and the frequencies of the signals that are modelled and the assurance of stability of the model on the other the interaction between the different elements of the w2w model can be observed in fig 4 the input of the model is the instantaneous wave elevation data see section 2 1 the hydrodynamic parameters of the point absorber calculated following the methodology presented in section 2 2 are implemented in the block named point absorber dynamics which corresponds to the equation of motion of the point absorber the model of the pmslg implemented in the block named pmslg model and described in section 2 3 receives the actuation of the control system wec pmslg control block and generates the electromagnetic force or f p t o that is applied to the point absorber and influences its motion finally the generated power can be measured at the stator windings of the pmslg 3 results 3 1 wave data instantaneous wave elevation data corresponding to a sea state defined by a significant wave height of h s 8 m and a wave peak period of t p 8 s have been generated for the validation of the proposed fw functionality the data generation has been accomplished with the module hydrodyn and following the methodology presented in section 2 1 since no statistical properties are to be extracted from the results in this simulation solely graphical representation and conceptual validation the duration of the simulation has been defined as 300 s as shown in fig 5 the generated wave elevation data contains sufficient scenarios for the conceptual validation of the fw strategy as it presents intervals with low wave elevation during which the floating body should operate normally as the heave velocity threshold to activate the fw functionality should not be reached and it also presents intervals with high wave elevation during which the floating body will not be able operate normally without the fw functionality since the heave velocity threshold that causes the high magnetization of the stator will be reached and the electrical system will be unable to effectively regulate the electromagnetic force in order to analyse the performance and power production of the wecs during this sea state the wave elevation data array is supplied to the w2w model presented in section 2 3 2 hydrodynamics of point absorber the interaction of a floating body with the incoming wave front and in consequence its motion are essentially defined by the inertial forces that arise from the potential flow theory in this case as introduced in section 2 2 the hydrodynamic equations corresponding to both point absorber geometries have been solved with the bem code nemoh and the added mass kg the radiation damping n m s and the excitation coefficient n m with respect to the frequency of the incoming wave front have been calculated and represented in figs 6a and 6b respectively the results are in concordance with similar studies in the literature isaacson et al 1990 gaeta et al 2020 and as expected the hydrodynamic analysis shows a remarkable correlation between the geometry of the point absorber and the frequential evolution of the inertial forces acting on it regarding the added mass it is incremented by increasing the cross sectional area of the point absorber regarding the radiation damping the increase of the size of the wec shows a considerable effect on its frequential evolution shifting the value of the maximum radiation damping to lower wave frequency values in absolute terms the value of the radiation damping is increased by incrementing its size finally in line with the radiation damping the excitation coefficient shows a tendency to be reduced for higher wave frequencies when the size of the wec is incremented in absolute terms the value of the excitation force is also increased by incrementing its size the variation of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the point absorber has a direct impact on the motion and thus power capture of the wec hence by applying the hydrodynamic parameters in the w2w model the joint performance of the point absorber and the pto system during different sea states of interest can be analysed in detail 3 3 point absorber operation improvement in this subsection the operation and power production of both wecs during the sea state shown in section 3 1 is presented to that end the instantaneous wave elevation data is applied to the corresponding w2w model and an analysis of the motion of the point absorber the electrical performance of the pto system and the power generation of the wec is carried out moreover the effect of implementing the fw strategy is also studied 3 3 1 wavebot point absorber the simulation results of the w2w model corresponding to the wavebot point absorber and without implementation of the fw functionality are shown in fig 7 the wave elevation η t and the in heave motion of the point absorber z t are represented in the upper plot the upper middle plot shows the motion velocity of the point absorber z t the middle plot presents the reference pto force f p t o r e f t and the corresponding instantaneous force f p t o t exerted by the pto system in the floating device the lower middle plot shows the instantaneous three phase electrical current through the stator windings of the electrical generator i s a b c t finally the lower plot represents the instantaneous power generated in the stator of the electrical generator p s t the obtained results support the expected premises since an inadequate operation of the pto system is observed when the instantaneous wave elevation increases while the wave elevation is low the limited excitation of the waves on the floating body causes neither abrupt motions of the floating body nor high heave velocities which enables an adequate operation of the pto system nevertheless as a result of the excitation exerted by high waves to the point absorber the motion velocity of the floating body z t becomes higher and consequently the magnetic flux in the stator of the pmslg is incremented see eq 7 subsequently on account of the voltage limitation of the electrical system its control capability is lost and the stator currents i s a b c t the electromagnetic force f e m t and the stator power p s t grow uncontrollably during this scenario the tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t is impossible and the wec should be stopped due to its safety not being guaranteed the application of the fw strategy proposed in this paper is aimed to solve the problem identified in fig 7 in order to validate the benefits associated to the implementation of the fw strategy the simulation results of the wavebot point absorber with implementation of the fw strategy are shown in fig 8 the order of the depicted variables has been maintained with respect to the previous figure in this subsection the simulation results depicted in fig 8 show a significantly improved operation of the pto system with high wave elevation and subsequent high excitation of the point absorber with the application of the fw functionality in fact in comparison to the same scenario in fig 7 the results in fig 8 present an adequate tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t during the whole simulation by reason of the fw functionality in cases of high excitation of the point absorber stator current in the synchronous d axis is injected in a controlled way and the magnetic flux in the stator of the pmslg is attenuated as a result the voltage limitation of the electrical system is not reached and the operation of the wec is kept under control by comparing simulation results in figs 7 and 8 an increase of the heave velocity of the point absorber z t after implementation of the fw functionality can be observed during certain periods it must be noted that in the results shown in fig 7 the application of extremely high f e m t forces is observable far beyond the maximum capability of the electrical system this behaviour is not realistic only numerical and evidences the impossibility of the electrical system to operate in such conditions with the application of this unreal and high force the heave velocity z t is kept low in contrast in the results shown in fig 8 the heave velocity z t grows bigger which responds to the application of a lower but realistic f e m t force which is saturated to the maximum capability of the electrical system finally it should be noted that as a result of the fw implementation and on account of the necessity to attenuate the statoric magnetic flux a high stator current in the synchronous d axis could be injected during some instants hence the power flow could be reverted which would result in power consumption the application of the fw strategy must be subject to a double condition on the one hand its implementation will only be legit if the mean power generation exceeds the mean power consumption caused by the fw functionality on the other hand the necessity to inject stator current in order to attenuate the magnetic flux must be taken into consideration when designing the electrical system and its maximal electrical current values 3 3 2 flat point absorber the simulation results of the flat point absorber without implementation of the fw strategy are shown in fig 9 the order of the depicted variables has been maintained following the example of the figures in the previous subsection the results obtained in fig 9 validate again the expected assumptions as the excitation of the high waves on the floating body cause high heave velocities z t and performance loss of the pto system the fast motions of the floating body cause an increment of the magnetic flux on the stator of the pmslg and in consequence the voltage capability of the pto system is exceeded and the control over the reference pto force f p t o r e f t is lost subsequently the motion of the wec is uncontrolled and the integrity of the pto system in this case the pmlsg is compromised due to overcurrents the simulation results of the flat point absorber with implementation of the fw strategy are shown in fig 10 the order of the depicted variables has been maintained with respect to the previous figure in this subsection the obtained results show that as expected the tracking of the reference pto force f p t o r e f t is considerably improved with the application of the fw strategy moreover the overcurrents that may endanger the safety of the electrical system have been removed and substituted by a controlled current injection aimed to reduce the magnetization of the stator hence the safety of the wec is guaranteed and its operation sustained in comparison to the application of the fw strategy in the wavebot point absorber see fig 8 it is to be noted that with the larger flat point absorber the electrical current injection for the demagnetization of the stator has been increased as a consequence of the bigger mass of the device the recovery from the high excitation period is worsened see oscillations in heave velocity z t and the actuation of the fw functionality has been necessary on more occasions 3 4 extension of operation and power matrix the effect of implementing the proposed fw strategy in both wecs in terms of operational range extension is analysed in this subsection as it has been demonstrated in section 3 3 the application of the fw strategy is based on the controlled current injection in order to attenuate the magnetic flux in the stator of the pmslg and thus ensure the adequate tracking of the reference pto force and the safety of the wec as a result the operation of the wec can be extended to higher or additional significant wave height h s values see first column in table 4 however the injection of additional current due to the fw strategy is linked to an increase of the dimensions and capability of the electrical system which results in a bigger economical cost in this case in order to relate the benefits of the fw strategy to the overdimensioning of the electrical system two maximum electrical current values have been defined and the operation of the wecs with the fw functionality has been extended until the restriction of maximum current capability has been met the extensions of the power matrix in kw for both wec devices are shown in table 4 respectively note that the hs tp pair values used for the power matrix generation do not correspond to real wave measurements they are obtained following the methodology presented in section 2 1 and are used to fully characterize the operation of the wec in the whole additional operational range the time duration of the simulations to calculate the power production of the wec has been set to 30 min as recommended in the international tower tank conference ittc for seakeeping state simulations day et al 2014 the operation extension associated to a maximum demagnetization d axis electrical current of 450 a has been highlighted in blue colour the whole extension of the power matrices corresponds to the case of a maximum demagnetization electrical current of 550 a therefore it is to be noted that with an increased electrical current capability of the system the operation of the wec could be extended to higher significant wave height values h s at the expense of a higher economical cost of the electrical system and pending to a mechanical loads analysis that ensures the integrity of the device additionally in line to the results obtained in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 it is to be observed that a longer extension of the operation of the wec can be achieved in case of the smaller point absorber wavebot with the same dimensioning of the electrical system 3 5 additional energy and hydrogen calculation real wave elevation measurements from four far offshore locations p 00 54 n 29 5 w p 01 48 5 n 39 w p 02 37 5 n 57 w p 03 57 n 22 5 w at the atlantic ocean and one nearshore location at the biscay coast p 04 43 37 n 3 07 w ulazia et al 2020 have been used for the calculation of the additional energy hydrogen generated by the wecs as a result of the extension of their operational range by application of the fw functionality the wave resource data downloaded from the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2020 is presented in form of 1 hourly mean values and covers the 2010 2019 time period since solely the additional energy hydrogen generated by the wecs in case of implementation of the fw strategy is of interest only the extensions of the power matrices see table 4 have been used for the calculations the results of the additional energy generation of both wecs in the analysed offshore locations are listed in table 5 on account of the difficulties associated to the grid integration in oceanic far offshore locations the employment of energy vectors such as hydrogen or methanol for the energy storage is supported in those farms consequently the additional hydrogen production of the wecs as a result of the extension of their operational range by application of the fw functionality is presented in table 6 an energy consumption of 4 2 kwh n m 3 covering all desalination compression electrolysis and additional processes has been used for the computation of the hydrogen production serna and tadeo 2014 the results show that important additional energy hydrogen production could be achieved by extension of the operational range of the wecs with the application of the proposed fw strategy especially in the far offshore locations moreover it is to be observed that the achievable additional energy hydrogen gain is more important in wecs with bigger size for instance a maximum of 177 54 mwh energy or 42272 n m 3 hydrogen are to be produced with the flat wec at location p 01 during the analysed 20 years likewise a maximum of 131 67 mwh energy or 31350 n m 3 hydrogen are to be produced by using the wavebot wec at the same location in terms of equivalent production hours the generated additional energy hydrogen would correspond to 2270 equivalent production hours of the flat wec operating at maximum power and 2095 equivalent production hours of the wavebot wec operating at its maximum power it is to be observed that the achievable energy hydrogen gain depends on the dimensioning of the electrical system if the maximum demagnetization electrical current capability is increased the actuation of the fw functionality and therefore the operation of the wec can be extended to higher wave significant values h s and the produced additional energy hydrogen is also incremented moreover the dimensioning of the electrical system might also affect the selection of the best location for the installation of a wec in this way while the maximum additional energy hydrogen for a dimensioning of 550 a of demagnetization electrical current is produced at location p 01 the location with maximum additional production is p 03 if the electrical system is dimensioned for 450 a of demagnetization current therefore the wave resource characteristics of a given location might also be important to be considered during the design process of the fw strategy finally with the current control parametrization the additional energy production of the wavebot device is observed to surpass that of the flat device when the electrical system is dimensioned for a maximum demagnetization current of 450 a this fact emphasizes the importance of a multiperspective design procedure of the wecs adapting their geometry to the characteristics of the sea states and the capabilities of the electrical system 4 discussion the performance of in heave oscillating linear point absorbers has been extensively studied in the literature faizal et al 2014 bezunartea barrio et al 2020 piscopo et al 2018 rusu 2018 essentially while some works are devoted to the design of the best geometry and size of the point absorbers esmaeilzadeh and alam 2019 others are aimed to find the optimal control law to be applied to a wec in order to maximize its power absorption babarit and clément 2006 cretel et al 2011 coe et al 2020 bacelli and coe 2020 regarding the design process of the control strategy the most recent works in the literature include in their procedures a restriction for the maximum force the pto system can apply in the point absorber coe et al 2020 however this restriction is usually treated as a mathematical constraint and its physical origin is neglected in this analysis the introduction of a model of the pto system in the simulations allows to have a fully detailed system and the conversion and treatment of the mathematical restrictions as physical variables which enables a more detailed design of the whole wec an important aspect to consider during the design process of a wec is the definition of its operational range usually limited either by the maximum displacement of the point absorber or the maximum force the pto system can apply in the analysis presented in this paper a fw control algorithm has been proposed and validated as a solution to overcome some restrictions associated to an electrical pto system based on a pmslg as a result of applying the fw functionality the performance of the pto system is improved at high velocities of the point absorber and the operational range of the wec could be extended to higher significant wave height h s values the execution of a similar analysis would result unfeasible if the model of the pto system would have not been combined with the model of the point absorber and the electrical limitation had solely been treated as a simple mathematical constraint the development of advanced optimization problems which integrate modelling of the physical source of the constraints is contemplated as a paramount step for the evolution of energy maximizing strategies applied to wecs the benefits of the presented fw functionality have also been found to be related to the size of the wec in case of larger wecs with a higher size and therefore mass the implementation of the fw functionality could result especially helpful due to their prolonged malfunction after a sea state of high excitation consequence of the high inertia associated to their mass hence the fw strategy could result in important improvements of the operation of the wec during longer periods of time a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the energy gain associated to the fw functionality with respect to the pto control strategy parametrization is also considered as an important future work the benefits of the presented fw functionality could also be linked to the characteristics of the wave resource at the installation site of a wec see fig 11 the results presented in the analysis have shown that the actuation of the proposed functionality enables operation of the device at sea states with high wave amplitude consequently while at locations with low wave heights the application of the fw strategy could not result remarkably helpful the potential benefit of its implementation at locations with high wave heights is evident therefore in this case the implementation of the fw functionality would result more beneficial at the far offshore locations p 00 p 01 and p 03 where the amount of hours with high waves is larger than at locations p 02 and p o4 meteorological analyses of the wave characteristics at a defined location prior to the installation of the device could help determine the suitability of the strategy to be or not be implemented in the wec finally the industrial application of the strategy is considered to be significantly easier than complex optimization algorithms that could be problematic when being implemented and executed in real time applications in a microprocessor based ccu converter control unit in fact the proposed functionality could be considered as a plug play element of an extensively industrially mature control algorithm as it is the foc strategy the economical benefits associated to the installation of the fw strategy could be measured by the additional energy hydrogen production achieved as a result of the extension of the operation of the wec it must be taken into account that the application of the fw strategy requires an overdimensioning of the electrical system which will result in an increment of its economical cost and will have to be considered when studying the economical viability of the project 5 conclusions a fw control functionality to improve and extend the operation of linear in heave oscillating point absorber based wecs has been proposed in this paper the pto system associated to the linear point absorbers is electrical based on a pmslg as a result of the conducted analysis the potential benefits of implementing this functionality on the energy hydrogen generation of two different sized wecs has been stressed the implementation of a fw strategy has been found to effectively reduce the magnetic flux of the stator of the electrical generator during sea states of high excitation i e sea states that cause high velocity motions of the point absorber the application of the fw functionality during those periods enables to keep an adequate tracking of the reference pto force and to avoid overcurrents that may damage the electrical system in fact by injecting electrical current in a controlled way the performance of the electrical pto system is remarkably improved and its safety ensured which allows to extend the operation of the wec to higher values of the significant wave height h s always subject to a mechanical loads analysis that ensures the integrity of the device in such high wave conditions the effect of the proposed fw strategy has also been found to be dependent on the size and therefore hydrodynamic characteristics of the point absorber of the wec the application of the fw strategy has been found to be more necessary for larger wecs in which the recovery from a problematic sea state is worse due to the bigger inertia in case of smaller wecs their operational range could be further extended with the same dimensioning of the electrical system always subject to the control parametrization finally the additional energy hydrogen production of both different sized wecs have been computed using real wave resource data in four far offshore locations in the atlantic ocean and one nearshore location in the biscay coast the obtained results show that important additional energy hydrogen could be produced as a result of the extension of the operation of the point absorber using the fw functionality these economical benefits in combination with the overdimensioning of the electrical system due to the proposed fw functionality should be considered when assessing the economic viability of the installation of the wec credit authorship contribution statement aitor saenz aguirre conceptualization methodology
