9115,in the ethiopian upper blue nile basin like in other regions in the world agricultural productivity is declining due to water scarcity owing to longer dry seasons coupled with soil acidity induced fertility problems wheat is one of the major food security crops in ethiopia but its productivity is reduced due to water scarcity especially during the irrigation season addressing these problems might be essential to increase productivity this study explores the effect of deficit irrigation di combined with lime manure and inorganic fertilizer on wheat production and water productivity wp in the koga irrigation scheme ethiopia four levels of di strategies 100 etc or 0 deficit as a control 80 60 and 50 etc were applied for two irrigated seasons five levels of soil fertility management were applied for four consecutive cropping seasons i 0 86 t ha 1 lime combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose urea and nps b hereafter referred to as inorganic fertilizer l3 ii 1 15 t ha 1 lime combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer l2 iii 1 43 t ha 1 lime combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer l1 iv 3 t ha 1 manure combined with full dose inorganic fertilizer m and v full dose inorganic fertilizer alone c the grain yield and biomass data were collected at harvest from a sample area of 2 m 3 m from each plot with three replicates the effect of di and liming as well as manuring on average grain yield and biomass were highly significant under all irrigation scenarios higher grain yield and biomass were found at l1 l2 l3 and m in that order compared with c the highest wp was obtained at 50 etc irrigation dose compared with 60 80 and 100 etc in that order yet the lowest wp was found at c under all irrigation scenarios compared with l1 l2 l3 and m the wp increased when the amount of water supply decreased and liming doses increased the application of full dose lime and manure combined with 50 etc di resulted in comparable grain yield biomass and wp as 100 etc full irrigation at l3 and m it could be concluded that liming and manuring could be used to mitigate the yield penalty effect of di in the study area in scenarios where farmers have to pay for water profitability rises as the irrigation water supply reduces thus under such conditions a 50 etc irrigation scenario is more profitable than scenarios with 60 80 and 100 etc irrigation keywords biomass grain yield gross profit lime manure water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l the target crop in this study is one of the world s most important food crops yielding an average of 3 t ha 1 globally ali et al 2019 anon 2016 2013 yu et al 2020 in ethiopia the average wheat yields grew from 1 3 t ha 1 in 1994 csa 1995 to 2 5 t ha 1 in 2021 csa 2021 but the demand for wheat has grown up substantially over the past decades and is expected to continue tadesse et al 2022 hordofa et al 2022 hodson et al 2020 mann and warner 2017 the current wheat production is inadequate to meet the national demand forcing the country to import 30 50 to fill the gap hodson et al 2020 shikur 2022 minot et al 2015 though wheat is widely grown in ethiopia its productivity is low mostly due to soil fertility depletion as a result of continuous crop nutrient uptake soil acidity induced fertility problems inadequate use of fertilizer insufficient organic matter application and crop failure due to moisture stress gurmessa 2020 agegnehu et al 2019 agegnehu and yirga 2009 yield gap analysis has shown that improved soil and water management practices including increased fertilizer use proper soil fertility maintenance and irrigation have the potential to increase production hordofa et al 2022 hodson et al 2020 taye et al 2020b mann and warner 2017 soil acidity substantially affects 50 of the world s potentially arable soils demil et al 2020 hodson et al 2020 tefera et al 2022 kochian et al 2004 in the high rainfall areas of ethiopia 43 of the cultivated land is affected by soil acidity taye et al 2020a and more than 80 of the nitisols are acidic demil et al 2020 agegnehu et al 2019 the problem is most serious in northwestern ethiopia where this study was conducted and in the country s central and southwestern highlands demil et al 2020 taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 haile and boke 2011 high rainfall induced leaching acidic parent materials removal of organic matter and continuous application of acid forming fertilizers are some of the major causes of soil acidity taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 agegnehu et al 2019 haynes and naidu 1998 soil acidity hampers microorganism activity reduces plant root growth and restricts the absorption of nutrients and water movement taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 abate et al 2013 the availability of micronutrients such as aluminum manganese and iron increases as the ph decreases agegnehu et al 2019 crops planted in acidic soils can be stunted are vulnerable to drought and are not very responsive to fertilizers which eventually leads to low productivity taye et al 2020b abate et al 2013 in response to this farmers tend to apply higher rates of fertilizer than the recommended dose tefera et al 2022 tamene et al 2017 asmamaw et al 2021a confirmed that in koga located in northwestern ethiopia the fertilizer response of the crop is declining unless due attention is given to the amendment and maintenance of soil acidity it can lead to a decline or complete failure of crop production agegnehu et al 2019 this attention is needed given that the soil acidity problem in ethiopia is mainly found in the high crop production potential areas of the country taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 dinkecha 2017 several authors found that soil acidity can be managed using integrated soil fertility management isfm practices such as lime manure crop residue inorganic fertilizers and biochar application abate et al 2013 ameyu 2019 asmare and markku 2016 worth noting is that the application of organic matter in the form of manure and compost can reduce soil acidity tefera et al 2022 mike 2003 thus applying organic manure seems a good strategy for the resource poor farmers of the tropics who cannot afford a large volume of lime and inorganic fertilizers taye et al 2020a abate et al 2013 agegnehu et al 2014 coupled with soil acidity induced fertility problems water scarcity during the extended dry season is the major limiting factor for agricultural production in ethiopia asmamaw et al 2021a 2021b to curb this problem farmers apply small scale irrigation by river diversion and groundwater pumping but their application system often results in doses being either more or less than the crop water requirements beyene et al 2018 over irrigation increases the cost of production and might leach nutrients out of the root zone yet introducing an efficient irrigation water management strategy such as deficit irrigation di is important for farmers asmamaw et al 2021b hence there is a growing interest in di an irrigation practice whereby water supply is reduced below maximum and mild stress is allowed with minimal effects on yield thus leading to higher water productivity wp abdelhady et al 2017 ali et al 2019 fl√∂rke et al 2018 gahnnem et al 2021 yu et al 2020 geerts and raes 2009 in a recent review in ethiopia asmamaw et al 2021b showed that for saving 65 water the yield penalty was 26 while wp increased by 110 for wheat in addition by irrigating less water per unit area the area under irrigation could be expanded to keep yield levels high combining di with soil acidity management activities such as liming and manuring combined with inorganic fertilizer might be needed yet scientific studies that combine di with isfm under wheat production are not available asmamaw et al 2022 in koga there are poor medium and rich farmers asmamaw et al 2021a by considering farmer s lime purchasing power searching for applicable alternative acidic soil management options is essential to identify cost effective isfm strategies analyzing revenue and gross profit for these strategies is also imperative combining isfm with improved irrigation strategies could reduce water scarcity and improve crop productivity designing efficient deficit irrigation options could reduce pressure on water resources and increase the area under irrigation hence understanding the possible effect of di and isfm on grain yield biomass and wp is vital to bridge these knowledge gaps the effect of lime at different rates with fixed doses of manure and inorganic fertilizer combined with di on wheat production and wp was evaluated the specific objectives of this study were i to evaluate the effect of di and isfm including applications of lime combined with manure on wheat grain yield and biomass ii to assess the combined effect of di and isfm on wp compared with the use of inorganic fertilizer and full irrigation iii to identify cost effective irrigation and isfm strategies the effects of liming and manuring on physical chemical and biological quality of the acid soils under study have been reported elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the field tests were carried out in ethiopia part of the upper blue nile basin at koga irrigation scheme 12 61 23 n and 37 03 92 e in 2018 19 and 2019 20 irrigated seasons the experimental site has an average slope of less than 0 2 the long term 1987 2020 meteorological data collected from ethiopian national meteorological service agency s bahir dar branch revealed a rainfall distribution with a unimodal pattern asmamaw et al 2021a the yearly rainfall ranges from 855 to 2200 mm with a mean of 1528 mm the highest air temperatures and reference evapotranspiration eto mm are recorded in march and april while the lowest air temperatures and eto are recorded in january and december and july and august respectively supplementary fig s1 the season for irrigated wheat normally begins in october when rainfall drops significantly and lasts until january while the irrigated maize season begins in january and ends in may supplmentary table s1 shows the monthly meteorological information for the 2018 19 and 2019 20 irrigated wheat growing seasons including rainfall mm maximum and minimum air temperatures c relative humidity sunlight hours h day 1 and wind speed m s 1 recorded at 2 m height in contrast to the long term trend supplementary fig s1 neither 2018 19 nor 2019 20 experienced any rain from october to january based on asmamaw et al 2022 report the soils of the study area are clayey and categorized as nitisols wrb 2015 the soils have a very low sand content 2 6 compared to a very high clay content 72 supplmentary table s7 also relatively higher dry bulk density was found in both soil depths in comparison to the control liming doses combined with manuring improved bulk density which improved moisture content at field capacity the average soil ph h2o at the control plot was 5 15 asmamaw et al 2022 the soil exchangeable acidity was considerably high however the sodium adsorption ratio was low thus soil condition in koga is strogly acidic asmamaw et al 2022 daily eto was calculated by the cropwat program based on the fao penman monteith equation smith et al 1998 the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was 0 90 ds m 1 asmamaw et al 2022 2 2 experimental design experiments were done under deficit irrigation di for four successive irrigated seasons 2018 19 2019 20 in this study the annual cropping sequence was wheat triticum aestivum l maize zea mays l with wheat grown in the first round of the irrigation season october to january and maize during the second round of the irrigation season january to may similar to farmer s practice in koga only the findings for wheat are presented here to exactly apply farmers practices such as ploughing furrow preparations weed and pest control ten model farmers were involved during the experiments i e five farmers per year because of other farmers interest to be involved in our research those who were involved in 2018 19 were substituted by another new five farmers they worked together in the same field based on the researcher s instructions the field management practices ploughing and weed management were the same except for the deficit irrigation di and integrated soil fertility management isfm treatments field managements were done on the same day trainings were given to the participating farmers on the main concepts and application of lime caco3 and manure combined with inorganic fertilizer and di the effect of isfm and di treatments was tested in a full factorial experiment with five isfm and four irrigation water scenarios yielding 20 treatments 5 4 and with three replicates the treatments were randomly arranged in three blocks each block contained a complete replicate of the treatment setting supplementary fig s2 shows 1 block except for the treatments the other possible factors such as soil conditions field management ploughing weed and pest control slope land leveling plot sizes plot shape and furrow length were the same in all plots thus isfm treatments with three levels of lime a fixed level of manure and inorganic fertilizer were arranged in a randomized complete block design the isfm treatments were i 0 86 t ha 1 lime 60 of the lime requirement combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer l3 ii 1 15 t ha 1 lime 80 of lime requirement combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer l2 iii 1 43 t ha 1 lime 100 of lime requirement combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer l1 iv 3 t ha 1 manure combined with full dose inorganic fertilizers m and v full dose inorganic fertilizer c as a control supplementary table s2 three water stress scenarios 80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc and a full irrigation 100 etc treatment were defined because in agricultural real life farmers have experienced limited water availability during the dry season full irrigation 100 etc estimated by cropwat was used as a control for di scenarios 2 3 soil fertility management the manure was prepared from cow sheep poultry and pig dung by the researcher it was stored in a room for a few days packed in sacks and stored in a room for a month until application based on its local availability and the current level of soil acidity 3 t ha 1 of manure was applied farmers manually broadcasted and thoroughly mixed it into the soil while working in dry weather using an ox driven maresha plough to till the soil to a depth of 10 15 cm on the same dates asmamaw et al 2012 temesgen et al 2012 based on the advice of the ethiopian institute of agricultural research the required amount of lime was calculated agegnehu et al 2019 the estimate takes into account the soil s bulk density depth of tillage degree of exchangeable acidity and ph similar to the manure a month before planting the lime was mixed into the soil to a depth of 10 15 cm mineral fertilizer comprised urea 46 n and nps b nitrogen phosphorus sulphur and boron for all treatments a full dose of urea 183 kg ha 1 was used and the dose was determined in accordance with the amhara region agricultural research institute s recommendation arari 2014 during sowing 1 3 of the urea was administered and the remaining 2 3 was applied while the wheat was at the tillering stage nps b which contains 18 9 nitrogen 37 7 phosphorus 6 95 sulfur and 0 1 boron was applied at a full dose 120 kg ha 1 2 4 crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling daily eto was computed using the cropwat program version 8 0 based on the fao penman monteith equation as described by allen et al 1998 the daily weather data was collected from the bahir dar meteorological station 35 km north of the study site in addition daily rainfall and temperature data were recorded using a tipping bucket rain gauge hobo ware equipped with a data logger and a thermometer installed at the study site and used as input for irrigation scheduling optimum soil moisture depletion level and root depth were adopted from fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 2006 the crop coefficient kc for wheat kekeba variety similar to our tested crop variety was adopted from tezera et al 2019 they studied wheat seasonal water demand and crop coefficient for three succeeding years following standard procedures as part of the ethiopian institute of agricultural research trials the daily water requirement of the crop and actual evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the cropwat program version 8 0 as well the etc and kc values are lowest highest and moderate at the initial mid and late stages respectively supplementary table s3 2 5 irrigation water management in the scenario analysis we evaluated the effect of reducing the net irrigation requirement 100 etc by 50 40 20 and 0 during the whole growth stages of wheat a rain fed scenario with no irrigation was not evaluated as this typically results in complete crop failure the watering was scheduled rotationally as the experimental site is part of the koga irrigation scheme where more than 10 000 households are benefiting from the same water source koga dam all plots were commonly off season irrigated with 30 mm of water two days before sowing as pre irrigation i e the sowing dates were 28 september for 2018 and 2 october for 2019 the crop was irrigated every 12 days using the furrow irrigation method totaling the number of irrigation events to 8 per growing season supplementary table s3 shows the irrigation scheduling for all treatments a 15 cm 6 inch throat width calibrated standard parshall flume installed at the inlet of the main plot was used to measure the discharge supplementary fig s3 water was diverted into the experimental field from a quaternary canal at a constant discharge rate this discharge was allowed to flow into a plot and each furrow for a given time the time t s required to apply the desired depth of water was calculated as 1 t d a q where d is the depth of water to be irrigated in every irrigation session m a is the plot size to be irrigated m2 and q is the discharge m3 s 1 instantly after the desired depth was applied to a given plot the discharge was cut off by closing the channel banks to stop water from entering the plots the discharge q was estimated as 2 q k h a n k is the flume discharge constant coefficient which varies with throat width flume size h a is the depth at the point of measurement m and n is the discharge exponent depends upon flume size 2 6 crop management wheat triticum aestivum l kekeba variety picaflora 1 was planted for two irrigated seasons with wheat maize cropping sequences kekeba a bread wheat variety is a semi dwarf is early maturing and is widely cultivated in various parts of ethiopia it can grow under a wide range of agro ecological conditions ranging from an altitude of 1500 2200 m a s l mahamed et al 2011 sowing was done by drilling manually in a row after the land was well prepared four tillage passes with a seeding rate of 150 kg ha 1 on 28 september 2018 and 02 october 2019 the seed was sown in a double row on both sides of the ridges weed management was done manually every season the crop was harvested on 26 january 2019 and 01 february 2020 in the 2018 and 2019 irrigated seasons respectively 2 7 soil moisture data collection by considering the wheat root zone gravimetric soil water content was measured one day before and two days after each irrigation session at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm with three replicates in each treatment samples were taken at different spots of each plot for every irrigation events during the study periods 2018 19 and 2019 20 the mean soil water content in the soil profile was taken to be the average of the soil water content measured in the 0 60 cm soil layer soil samples were collected using 10 cm height core samplers and the samples were oven dried at 105 0c for 48 h and the water content in the soil was determined on a weighted base as follows 3 Œ∏ m w w w d w d x 100 where Œ∏m is water content on a weight basis wd is weight of dry soil g and ww is weight of wet soil g but for et water productivity calculations the soil water content only taken at plantig and ripening periods was considered 2 8 crop data collection and yield calculation plant height was measured at the maturity stage in each plot with three replicates for all plant samples data were collected from the middle rows the grain yield and aboveground biomass data were collected at harvesting time from a sample area of 2 m 3 m in each plot with three replicates and the average values were taken for statistical analysis for all treatments the harvested crop was sun dried and threshed separately using wooden sticks and finally the grain was separated cleaned and weighed to record the grain yield the weight of a thousand grains per plot was recorded by 3 decimal places using a sensitive weighing balance with three replicates grain yield was measured as the weight of harvested grain and adjusted to 13 5 standard moisture content for wheat meskelu et al 2017 it was then converted to tons per hectare it was also expressed per amount of irrigation water that would be needed to meet the net irrigation water requirement niw this allowed us to assess the yield that can be produced under di when using the same amount of water as with full irrigation but on land currently not irrigated as well yield per total niw was calculated by multiplying the yield observed per ha for a given isfm treatment with a factor of 1 23 1 58 and 1 85 for 80 60 and 50 etc di strategies respectively these values were obtained by dividing total net irrigation water niw by total applied irrigation water aiw supplementary table s3 including the 30 mm pre irrigation water under full lime treated treatment l1 for example if the yield is 5 4 t ha 1 at full irrigation with 378 mm of water then under 100 etc yield per total niw is indeed 5 4 t while under 80 60 and 50 etc it is 6 4 8 1 and 8 9 t respectively for the same 378 mm water for 2018 season table 2 the area under irrigation needed to produce these yields is then 1 ha for full irrigation and 1 23 1 58 and 1 85 ha for di strategies respectively on land that is not irrigated there is no yield given the lack or complete absence of rain between october and january 2 9 water productivity crop water productivity wp was calculated to evaluate the effects of di strategies as 4 wp y et where y is the marketable wheat grain yield kg and et is the seasonal total evapotranspiration mm estimated by the water balance equation du et al 2015 5 e t p i c s w 1 s w 2 d r where p mm is the total rainfall i mm is the amount of irrigation water c mm is capillary rise into the root zone sw1 mm is the soil moisture content at planting time sw2 mm is the soil moisture contents at late ripening stage d mm is the drainage r mm is the surface runoff the groundwater table measured from two piezometers remained below 5 m depth while the capillary rise was estimated at 1 1 m using the aquacrop model we therefore assumed that there was no upward flow that contributed to the root zone the study field was flat 0 2 average slope so a runoff was never observed and also we used end diked furrows deep percolation drainage was negligible since the amount of irrigation water was equal to the depletion amount in the root zone thus the applied irrigation water was aimed to replenish the soil to field capacity 2 10 gross profit analysis to assess and compare the short term economic returns of producing wheat using di under isfm strategies a rough gross profit analysis was done such analysis is imperative to provide an applicable recommendation to farmers and farm managers the gross profit was computed as kifuko et al 2007 6 gross profit revenue input costs 7 revenue grain yield market price input costs and revenue of wheat cultivation in the study area are summarized in table 3 the unit cost was calculated based on existing retail prices during the study periods labor costs included sowing watering fertilizer application weeding manuring liming harvesting and shelling costs the data used for labor cost analysis was recorded at the specific time of each activity within the season computations were based on the existing labor cost for daily workers and the number of days required to realize a given activity wheat yield was computed as an average per treatment for the two seasons revenue from wheat grain yield was computed using existing market prices in koga input costs revenue and gross profit were calculated per ha and per total niw applied the additional land that could be irrigated using the saved water due to deficit irrigation as well as the extra costs associated with cultivating additional land fertilizer seed labor lime manure and other charges were then taken into account supplementary table s4 2 11 statistical analyses statistical analysis and graphics were done in r software version 3 4 2 r development core team 2020 the effect of di and isfm treatments on wheat grain yield biomass plant height and thousand grain weight were analyzed through randomized complete block design using a two way analysis of variance anova with replications following the general linear model procedure tukey hsd multiple comparisions test was used for mean separation when the analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the parameters the relationships between yield and thousand grain weight biomass and plant height water productivity and applied water were analyzed by linear regression the residual normal distribution and homoscedasticity of the data were tested before these analyses 3 results 3 1 grain yield per ha of land table 1 shows the treatments effect on wheat grain yield per ha for the irrigated seasons of 2018 19 and 2019 20 under all treatments there was no statistical difference in grain yield among treatments between the 2018 19 and 2019 20 experiment seasons except for that under di strategies at c yet there was a slight yield increase in 2019 20 for most isfm treatments l1 l2 l3 and m grain yield per ha was significantly p 0 05 affected by water deficits regardless of the soil fertility levels table 1 and suplementary table s11 the tukey hsd multiple mean comparision test proved that all di scenarios were significantly different suplementary table s12 at 80 etc di it was reduced by 2 0 8 0 under l1 to l3 by 0 4 2 under m and by 6 1 9 4 under c in comparison with 100 etc full irrigation when di was 60 etc grain yield under l1 to l3 was 4 0 10 lower than that at full irrigation while under m this was 2 2 4 2 and under c 9 1 22 a 50 etc di resulted in a reduction in grain yield of 8 2 11 under l1 to l3 of 4 3 6 3 under m and 12 25 under c irrespective of the irrigation water doses the isfm application rate considerably p 0 05 affected the grain yield per ha table 1 and suplementary table s10 the tukey hsd multiple mean comparision test results also confirmed that all isfm treatments were significantly different suplementary table s13 the grain yield was improved by 52 104 under the lime combined with manure treatments l1 to l3 and by 44 80 under m compared with c under all irrigation strategies 100 50 etc when looking at the interaction between di and isfm it was also statistically significant p 0 05 supplementary table s6 this suggests that in addition to the individual significant effects of di and isfm their synergy had a significant impact on wheat yield the control treatment c significantly different with the other combined di and isfm tratments in both study years supplementary table s6 full lime dose l1 was highly significant compared with l3 m and c under all irrigation scenarios in 2018 irrigated season when considering only 2019 irrigated season l1 and l2 were significantly different compared with l3 and m but m and l3 are not significant under all irrigation scenarios compared with l1 at 60 and 50 etc l2 at 80 and 60 etc was not significantly different the positive effect of soil fertility improvement through liming and manuring combined with inorganic fertilizers on wheat yield was significantly decreased with decreasing water stress but as presented in table 1 liming and manuring significantly improved wheat yield under non limited water supply conditions and this effect decreases with reducing water supply with soil fertility stress circumstances the beneficial impact of optimal moisture availability on wheat yield was significantly reduced but the full irrigation combined with improved soil fertility levels siginificantly increased wheat yield yield penalties resulting from reduced irrigation were affected by lime dose with higher lime doses l1 showing relatively the lowest yield penalties and lower lime doses l3 the largest interestingly at m no lime applied the grain yield reduction was smaller than under lime and manure l1 l3 while the highest reductions were observed under c the positive response to isfm was least pronounced under full irrigation and became higher with less water being applied for example the increase from c to l1 highest increase among isfm treatments was 69 70 at 100 etc while at 60 and 50 etc it varied between 76 and 104 depending on the year the 80 etc treatment took an intermediate position similar observations can be made for the other isfm treatments worth noting is also particularly as all treatments received inorganic fertilizer at recommended rates e g at 50 etc di the grain yield per ha under l1 was only 0 2 lower than that under m and higher than that under l3 4 6 when both received 100 etc full irrigation the use of 50 etc di under m yielded even a 36 38 higher grain yield per ha compared with full irrigation under c 3 2 biomass plant height and thousand grain weight the effect of irrigation water regimes and soil fertility conditions on biomass was highly significant p 0 05 in both seasons supplementary table s8 the trends observed are similar to those of grain yield though the differences in response between liming l1 to l3 m and c seem less pronounced than was the case with grain yield compared with full irrigation the biomass reduction was 1 5 20 under l1 to l3 12 20 under m and 13 21 under c at 80 60 and 50 etc di strategies as for yield we only see minor differences in biomass between 2018 19 and 2019 20 but whereas for yield the minor differences always resulted in higher yields in 2019 as compared to 2018 this was not the case for biomass where minor decreases were observed in 2019 20 relative to 2018 19 plant height at maturity per di and isfm treatment are presented in appendices supplementary table s8 irrigating 100 etc at l1 l2 l3 m and c gave the largest average plant heights at maturity of 93 92 89 91 and 87 cm respectively the lowest plant height recorded at maturity was 81 cm which was observed at 50 etc under c plant height as a yield attribute might be a good proxy to assess the total biomass needed for livestock fodder fig 1 shows a good correlation between biomass and plant height with biomass of wheat increasing linearly with plant height and 57 of the variation in biomass being explained by plant height being an indicator of grain quality thousand grain weight tgw was determined as presented in supplementary table s8 per di and isfm treatment in line with the other findings tgw was significantly affected p 0 05 by di and isfm the tgw values were higher at l1 l2 l3 and m in that order than at c irrespective of moisture deficits however the effects of di and isfm were less pronounced as compared to those of crop yield and biomass for example a 50 moisture deficit reduced tgw by 4 10 under l1 to l3 2 2 2 under m and 2 3 4 7 under c in comparison to full irrigation a highly significant linear relationship was observed between yield and tgw fig 2 with tgw explaining 76 of the variation in yield 3 3 grain yield per applied irrigation water amount and water productivity table 2 shows that yield of wheat in 2018 and 2019 calculated per total irrigated water amount aiw was increased with increasing water deficit strategies for example for l1 the average grain yield over the two seasons was 5 5 t ha 1 under 100 etc and 5 0 t ha 1 under 50 etc since under the latter regime 46 less water is used and thus 1 85 times as much land can be irrigated with the same amount of water supplementary table s3 the overall yield becomes 10 2 ton per 1 85 ha also 50 etc di applied under c yielded on average 5 0 t per 1 85 ha with an irrigation amount equal to aiw which is only slightly less than the overall yield at 100 etc with l1 5 5 t and equal to that at 100 etc under l3 similarly on average 50 etc di at m produced 8 7 t per 1 85 ha which was always much higher than the overall yield at 100 etc at all lime doses 5 0 5 5 t compared with 100 etc full irrigation the overall yield per unit of aiw increases with increasing water stress regardless of the isfm treatments in all isfm scenarios the yield increase per unit of water consumed was higher in the 50 60 and 80 etc irrigation scenarios in that order but at 100 etc irrigation scenarios there is no yield increase because there is no saved water to irrigate extra land which increases yield in each irrigation scenario the yield increase per unit of aiw appears to be higher at m however this is due to the lower yield reduction at m compared to lime and manure l1 l3 received plots see table 3 indirectly di enhanced yield per unit of water applied regardless of which isfm was used and as the degree of water stress increased the yield improvement per unit of water used likewise increased in a similar fashion di and isfm treatments significantly influenced water productivity wp during the study period as shown in fig 3 water productivity was always highest under the lowest irrigation water regimes or the highest water saved and decreased linearly with more water being applied this was the case for all isfm treatments notably is that the decrease in wp from least to most irrigation water was similar for all lime and manure treatments l1 l3 m which showed a similar slope of the regression line these treatments made wp increase up to 67 68 when the amount of irrigation water almost halved 50 etc in comparison with full irrigation notably is that wp values of l3 and m were most comparable the c treatment however showed a relatively lower response to variation in irrigation strategy with an increment of 52 with about half the amount of irrigation water but even more important than the water saved and being less consumed under the di regimes was the increase in yield resulting from the isfm treatments in comparison with c wp now increased by 15 68 under l1 l3 depending on di at m the increment still ranged between 20 and 75 across di treatments in all di treatments 100 etc 80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc the highest wp was found at l1 compared with the other isfm treatments 3 4 effect of di and isfm on soil moisture availability and plant gowth stages fig 4 shows the soil water content swc of the soil profile 0 60 cm measured one day and two days after irrigation sessions from all di and isfm treatments under the irrigated wheat growing seasons 2018 19 2019 20 under 100 etc in all isfm treatments the crop growth stages experiences no water stress except at c where the crop experienced water sress at maturity followed by ripening stages perhaps the soil fertility stress due to soil acidity could be a possible reason for the lower soil moisture availability for crops at c but the water stress occurred at maturity and ripening stages may not significantly affect the wheat yield regardless of the isfm at 80 etc the crop experienced a modest moisture stress that leads to stomata closure at flowering maturity and ripening stages in all isfm treatments at 60 etc the crop was exposed to water stress the whole growth stage but was highly stressed at the maturity and ripening stages while at c the stress occurred starting from around early flowering development maturity and ripening stages this implies that the soil fertility stress exacerbated the water stress level at c at 50 etc the level of water stress was higher at c in all growth stages but at l1 l2 l3 and m the flowering maturity and ripening stages were considerably stressed the trends of swc throughout the cropping periods were consistent indicating that the watering was applied with a predetermined schedule and amount 3 5 gross profit under all treatments the input costs were in the order of l1 l2 l3 m and c table 3 at full irrigation 100 etc the order of gross profit per ha was l1 m l2 l3 and c whereas at 80 and 60 etc the order was m l1 l2 l3 and c reducing the irrigation water amount under m was always more profitable per ha even without adding lime l1 l3 than full irrigation under c manuring only m at 50 etc was more profitable per ha than adding lime in addition to manure l1 l3 under 60 etc at 80 and 100 etc adding lime was more profitable per ha except for l3 under 80 etc compared with m at 50 etc calculating the gross profit per amount of water and thus using the water that could be saved by not fully irrigating individual fields sheds another light on the findings the order of gross profit per aiw at full irrigation 100 etc and 80 etc was l1 m l2 l3 and c whereas at 60 etc the order was m l1 l2 l3 and c yet at 50 etc the order of gross profit per aiw was l1 m l3 l2 and c amazingly wheat production profitability increases now tremendously with increasing deficit irrigation levels the highest profitability per aiw was found under l1 with 50 etc this combination almost doubled the profitability in comparison with full irrigation 100 etc under the isfm treatments l2 l3 m and c all 50 etc di treatments even the control without any extra manure or lime were more profitable than all 100 etc treatments 4 discussion 4 1 yield per unit of land and biomass production the effect of di combined with integrated soil fertility management isfm on water productivity wp and wheat production was studied over two irrigated seasons in 2018 and 2019 yields in the 2019 wheat season were slightly higher than those in the previous season table 1 which was most likely due to improved soil conditions because of the residual effect of previous liming and manuring as well as the return of crop residue and straw which may increase soil organic matter weather conditions in both years were very similar supplementary table s1 as expected wheat production per ha increased with increasing irrigation water amount under all isfm treatments table 1 the lower grain yield and biomass found at di under all isfm treatments compared with full irrigation could be due to moisture stress which may reduce photosynthesis and other cellular functions and damage the reaction center of the photosystem ultimately reducing grain yield and biomass dhiman et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 greaves and wang 2017 guo et al 2013 gurmessa 2020 junior et al 2020 a decreased wheat grain yield and biomass with increasing moisture deficit was also reported by ding et al 2021 jemal et al 2019 meskelu et al 2017 and tavakoli and moghadam 2016 from di field trials irrespective of the di strategy the grain yield and biomass were higher in the isfm treatments l1 l2 l3 and m compared with c the improvement in soil quality of the acidic nitisol such as soil structure bulk density porosity air capacity and water holding capacity mainly water content at fc as demonstrated by asmamaw et al 2022 in the same field trial could be one reason a better physical soil environment can promote root growth and reduce non productive water flow most like soil evaporation rather than deep percolation given that irrigation doses were as such that they replenish soil to field capacity also the increase in ph and soil organic matter by liming and adding manure asmamaw et al 2022 could have made adequate basic nutrients more available for uptake by plant roots with l1 showing the highest impact on yield and biomass in comparison with l2 l3 m and c in that order liming reduces aluminum and hydrogen toxicity and thus promotes normal plant growth and enhances the plant s nutrient and water uptake leading to increased grain yield and biomass auler et al 2017 demil et al 2020 dhiman et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 gurmessa 2020 junior et al 2020 this is supported by the findings of marschner 2011 who reported that the application of lime reduced soil acidity which enhanced better crop growth that can provide additional organic matter through residue returns and free calcium carbonates which help increase soil ph improve the solubility and availability of important nutrients to plants and improve the water holding capacity and uptake of nutrients interesting is that di was most successful i e showing the lowest yield penalty under m it was having the largest negative effect under c vice versa the highest response to isfm was found under the most deficit irrigation strategies and the lowest at full irrigation this could indicate that liming will primarily increase the availability of nutrients while manuring creates a better physical soil environment since nutrients can only move to roots through continuous water films within the soil reduced water contents and lack of water continuity in soils associated with the increased level of di will reduce nutrient uptake rates auler et al 2017 gurmessa 2020 junior et al 2020 shaxson and barber 2003 under manuring alone this effect seems less important and the effect of manuring is probably limited mostly to a higher physical resilience to water stress resulting from higher organic matter content and microbial activities that can promote soil aggregation ferreira et al 2019 lal shukla 2004 the c treatment without having manure being added therefore shows a much larger yield penalty with increasing water stress than the m treatment in a study on wheat production under different di and fertility strategies on a deep clay silty soil in northwest iran tavakoli and moghadam 2016 showed that the application of 67 etc combined with 90 kg n ha 1 reduced grain production by 20 compared to 100 etc but at full irrigation a 68 yield improvement was found due to 90 kg n application compared with no fertilizer used they concluded that enhancing soil fertility combined with di might result in a significant and consistent improvement in wheat yield in semi arid regions for farmers improved soil and irrigation water management approaches that could improve grain yield are vital asmamaw et al 2021a 2021b also producing more biomass as such is crucial as livestock ranching is the secondary agricultural activity that needs the straw for animal fodder amede et al 2021 agegnehu et al 2017 desalegn et al 2017 the lowest grain yield found from c coincides with the national 2 5 t ha 1 and global 2 9 t ha 1 average wheat yield csa 2021 minot et al 2015 adding relatively low amounts of water as under di in combination with improving soil health can thus more than double the biomass and yield of wheat even in a dry season the lowest yield found in c at 50 etc could be attributed to the aluminum toxicity which restricts root growth that hampers water uptake of plants and the nutrient s unavailability to plants due to soil acidity this means the plants could not use the applied di and nutrients the lowest yield found in c at 50 etc could also be caused by a moisture shortage but with the same amount of di used at l1 l2 l3 and m higher yields were discovered this means plants can access the available water this depends on root depth adding lime increased the availability of p which might have stimulated root growth and thus increasing root depth as a result not only the accessibility to water increases but also that to nutrients 4 2 grain yield per applied irrigation water amount and water productivity though there was a small yield penalty per ha under di it increased the overall wheat production per unit of water application in all isfm practices when compared to full irrigation table 2 the overall yield increase per unit of aiw under all isfm suggested us the possibility of expanding the currently irrigated area by irrigating extra land with the saved water when 80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc irrigation strategies are used 23 58 and 85 irrigation water can be saved compared to full irrigation with the same amount of water used for instance at all isfm practices 50 etc application almost doubled the overall yield by irrigating about 85 more irrigable land using the saved water this way water scarcity could be reduced in areas where moisture is the limiting factor for crop production thus in the koga irrigation scheme these irrigation scenarios could increase the irrigable area as displayed in fig 5 where command areas were delineated by considering a slope of less than 6 land leveling and farmers settlement also the yield increase for each scenario under each isfm treatment is shown in table 2 this means that those farmers that are currently not irrigating their land due to water shortage though initially considered in the project could now benefit from it yet to be more beneficial from di amending the soil with lime and manure seems an interesting option as our findings suggest that the small yield penalty due to di could be compensated by soil fertility management in line with this study ding et al 2021 concluded that applying compost could be used to mitigate the wheat yield penalty effect of di in egypt under a silt clay dominated aridisol water productivity wp can be improved by applying di admasu et al 2019 ali et al 2019 fl√∂rke et al 2018 gahnnem et al 2021 qin et al 2022 singh et al 2021 tari 2016 yu et al 2020 and isfm practices as the first reduces the amount of water consumed while the latter increases crop yield ding et al 2021 considering only the liming and manuring effects in all irrigation scenarios 100 etc 80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc the increment in wp followed the order of l1 l2 l3 m and c fig 3 yet regardless of the isfm wp increased with increasing moisture deficit the highest wp we found from 40 and 50 di can be attributed to the wise use of irrigation water and reduced non productive water flux mostly evaporation while at 100 etc part of the irrigation water may not be efficiently used by the crop but rather be lost in the form of evaporation as the irrigation water applied at full irrigation was done to replenish the depleted water from the root zone by the researcher there was no excess water that could be deep percolated the capillary rise was assumed to have a negligible contribution to the root zone as the water table was found below 5 m from the surface and capillary rise was estimated at 1 1 m only in all isfm treatments the stored soil moisture content decreased with increasing the moisture deficit supplementary table s9 in comparison to c the lime treatments l1 l3 increased soil moisture content up to 14 39 depending on the di levels at m the increment ranged between 7 and 10 compared with c in comparison with full irrigation the soil moisture content stored at lime treatments l1 l3 reduced between 16 and 24 at about half of the irrigation water used but at m and c it decreased by 16 and 13 respectively also lime and manure were clearly shown to enhance wp hence investing in lime and manure could also save more water that could be used to irrigate extra land when compared with the control no liming and manuring wp at 50 etc is 67 86 higher under lime and manure treated fields l1 to m fig 3 our results comply with that of a recent review asmamaw et al 2021a 2021b that reported a 27 maize yield reduction but a 109 wp increase when saving 65 water in a di field trial carried out in ethiopia on clay soil jemal et al 2019 mahamed et al 2011 and meskelu et al 2017 reported improved wheat wp under di compared with full irrigation 4 3 thousand grain weight under di and isfm the value of tgw a grain quality indicator is very essential to determine the seed rate a high tgw is mostly associated with large grain size hence farmers need more seeds while they need less for low tgw our findings suggest that wheat grain quality is moderate to low in its sensitivity to water and soil fertility stress the grain yield of wheat increases linearly with increasing tgw fig 2 this means that the heavier grain weight and highest grain yield observed at lower moisture deficits combined with the highest lime doses are likely due to adequate nutrient availability and more translocation of food processed in photosynthesis due to adequate water in the root zone compared to other treatments compared with c the combined application of lime manure and inorganic fertilizer improved tgw irrespective of di applications liming improves the ability of the plant to absorb nutrients by eliminating al toxicity and by increasing the vegetative growth of wheat which resulted in increased tgw regardless of liming and manuring the values of tgw decrease with an increasing water deficit in all treatments this implies that photosynthesis respiration and other cellular functions of plants are more affected under 60 or 50 etc compared with 100 etc and 80 etc in a previous study meskelu et al 2017 reported the highest tgw at 100 and 85 etc compared with 50 40 etc and 30 etc under clay soil in ethiopia mahamed et al 2011 reported significantly decreased wheat tgw with increasing soil moisture depletion levels due to di application compared with non water stressed plots in semi arid ethiopia under haplic andosol also tari 2016 found a 37 reduced tgw value of wheat over an optimally irrigated clay dominated soil in turkey this implies that to some extent imposing water stress could contribute to the reduction of tgw as the amount of available water may not be sufficient for producing better grain the decrease in irrigation water level decreases the plant height in all isfm supplementary table s8 this showed that plant height is mainly affected by moisture stress due to the reduction in photosynthesis of the plant 4 4 gross profit irrespective of the isfm di improved the profitability of wheat production in comparison with 100 etc full irrigation this means profitability increases with increasing moisture deficit among the tested isfm treatments l1 requires the highest investment but it is the most profitable strategy compared with l2 l3 m and c table 3 at 100 etc 80 etc and 50 etc under 40 di manuring is the most profitable followed by l1 l2 l3 and c respectively this means that the combined use of manure and lime was found to be more important to increase gross profit rather than the use of inorganic fertilizer alone which produced a low yield when di alone is considered a 50 moisture deficit is more profitable followed by a 40 and 20 deficit respectively as such with a 50 etc in all isfm treatments grain yield is close to double resulting in higher profitability this infers that by di farmers can irrigate more land with the saved water which improved their gross profit compared with the full irrigation strategy as described earlier this also can be taken as a climate change resilient strategy particularly in the time of prolonged dry seasons in general the use of di and isfm improves profitability in addition when the moisture deficit increase profitability raised linearly thus farmers could choose one of the isfm and di strategies based on their lime purchasing power water and land availability 5 conclusion and recommendations the effect of integrated soil fertility management isfm and deficit irrigation di on wheat production and water productivity wp was studied applying full dose lime combined with manure substantially enhanced wheat grain yield biomass and wp compared with 80 of the lime requirement lr and 60 of lr combined with manure at 100 80 60 and 50 etc scenarios manure application also considerably improved wheat grain yield biomass and wp under all irrigation water scenarios the highest wp was found at 100 of lime requirement l1 80 of lime requirement l2 60 of lime requirement l3 and 3 t ha 1 manure m respectively possibly because of increasing organic matter and improved basic nutrients available for plants at all irrigation water levels we note that liming and manuring could be used to mitigate the yield penalty effect of di while it further increases wp in the study area this could help with the decision of choosing soil and water management strategies that could be used to reduce yield loss due to soil acidity induced soil fertility stress and water stress the overall yield increase per unit of applied irrigation water for each scenario under all isfm suggested the possibility of expanding the existing irrigated area by irrigating additional land with the saved water this means that farmers who are currently unable to irrigate their land owing to a lack of water though initially were considered in the project could now benefit from it the use of l1 under full irrigation 100 etc 80 etc and 50 etc is the most profitable strategy whereas manuring is the most lucrative strategy under 60 etc when we considered irrigation water management alone a 50 di is more profitable than 60 80 and 100 etc thus farmers could choose one of the tested isfm strategies based on their lime purchasing power water availability and extra land available for irrigation from an irrigation water management viewpoint wheat could be irrigated at 60 etc to increase wp with less grain yield reduction at l1 l2 l3 m and c to save more water to irrigate extra irrigable lands currently not irrigated in the koga irrigation area farmers should invest more in di integrated with liming and manuring declaration

9115,in the ethiopian upper blue nile basin like in other regions in the world agricultural productivity is declining due to water scarcity owing to longer dry seasons coupled with soil acidity induced fertility problems wheat is one of the major food security crops in ethiopia but its productivity is reduced due to water scarcity especially during the irrigation season addressing these problems might be essential to increase productivity this study explores the effect of deficit irrigation di combined with lime manure and inorganic fertilizer on wheat production and water productivity wp in the koga irrigation scheme ethiopia four levels of di strategies 100 etc or 0 deficit as a control 80 60 and 50 etc were applied for two irrigated seasons five levels of soil fertility management were applied for four consecutive cropping seasons i 0 86 t ha 1 lime combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose urea and nps b hereafter referred to as inorganic fertilizer l3 ii 1 15 t ha 1 lime combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer l2 iii 1 43 t ha 1 lime combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer l1 iv 3 t ha 1 manure combined with full dose inorganic fertilizer m and v full dose inorganic fertilizer alone c the grain yield and biomass data were collected at harvest from a sample area of 2 m 3 m from each plot with three replicates the effect of di and liming as well as manuring on average grain yield and biomass were highly significant under all irrigation scenarios higher grain yield and biomass were found at l1 l2 l3 and m in that order compared with c the highest wp was obtained at 50 etc irrigation dose compared with 60 80 and 100 etc in that order yet the lowest wp was found at c under all irrigation scenarios compared with l1 l2 l3 and m the wp increased when the amount of water supply decreased and liming doses increased the application of full dose lime and manure combined with 50 etc di resulted in comparable grain yield biomass and wp as 100 etc full irrigation at l3 and m it could be concluded that liming and manuring could be used to mitigate the yield penalty effect of di in the study area in scenarios where farmers have to pay for water profitability rises as the irrigation water supply reduces thus under such conditions a 50 etc irrigation scenario is more profitable than scenarios with 60 80 and 100 etc irrigation keywords biomass grain yield gross profit lime manure water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l the target crop in this study is one of the world s most important food crops yielding an average of 3 t ha 1 globally ali et al 2019 anon 2016 2013 yu et al 2020 in ethiopia the average wheat yields grew from 1 3 t ha 1 in 1994 csa 1995 to 2 5 t ha 1 in 2021 csa 2021 but the demand for wheat has grown up substantially over the past decades and is expected to continue tadesse et al 2022 hordofa et al 2022 hodson et al 2020 mann and warner 2017 the current wheat production is inadequate to meet the national demand forcing the country to import 30 50 to fill the gap hodson et al 2020 shikur 2022 minot et al 2015 though wheat is widely grown in ethiopia its productivity is low mostly due to soil fertility depletion as a result of continuous crop nutrient uptake soil acidity induced fertility problems inadequate use of fertilizer insufficient organic matter application and crop failure due to moisture stress gurmessa 2020 agegnehu et al 2019 agegnehu and yirga 2009 yield gap analysis has shown that improved soil and water management practices including increased fertilizer use proper soil fertility maintenance and irrigation have the potential to increase production hordofa et al 2022 hodson et al 2020 taye et al 2020b mann and warner 2017 soil acidity substantially affects 50 of the world s potentially arable soils demil et al 2020 hodson et al 2020 tefera et al 2022 kochian et al 2004 in the high rainfall areas of ethiopia 43 of the cultivated land is affected by soil acidity taye et al 2020a and more than 80 of the nitisols are acidic demil et al 2020 agegnehu et al 2019 the problem is most serious in northwestern ethiopia where this study was conducted and in the country s central and southwestern highlands demil et al 2020 taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 haile and boke 2011 high rainfall induced leaching acidic parent materials removal of organic matter and continuous application of acid forming fertilizers are some of the major causes of soil acidity taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 agegnehu et al 2019 haynes and naidu 1998 soil acidity hampers microorganism activity reduces plant root growth and restricts the absorption of nutrients and water movement taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 abate et al 2013 the availability of micronutrients such as aluminum manganese and iron increases as the ph decreases agegnehu et al 2019 crops planted in acidic soils can be stunted are vulnerable to drought and are not very responsive to fertilizers which eventually leads to low productivity taye et al 2020b abate et al 2013 in response to this farmers tend to apply higher rates of fertilizer than the recommended dose tefera et al 2022 tamene et al 2017 asmamaw et al 2021a confirmed that in koga located in northwestern ethiopia the fertilizer response of the crop is declining unless due attention is given to the amendment and maintenance of soil acidity it can lead to a decline or complete failure of crop production agegnehu et al 2019 this attention is needed given that the soil acidity problem in ethiopia is mainly found in the high crop production potential areas of the country taye et al 2020b tefera et al 2022 dinkecha 2017 several authors found that soil acidity can be managed using integrated soil fertility management isfm practices such as lime manure crop residue inorganic fertilizers and biochar application abate et al 2013 ameyu 2019 asmare and markku 2016 worth noting is that the application of organic matter in the form of manure and compost can reduce soil acidity tefera et al 2022 mike 2003 thus applying organic manure seems a good strategy for the resource poor farmers of the tropics who cannot afford a large volume of lime and inorganic fertilizers taye et al 2020a abate et al 2013 agegnehu et al 2014 coupled with soil acidity induced fertility problems water scarcity during the extended dry season is the major limiting factor for agricultural production in ethiopia asmamaw et al 2021a 2021b to curb this problem farmers apply small scale irrigation by river diversion and groundwater pumping but their application system often results in doses being either more or less than the crop water requirements beyene et al 2018 over irrigation increases the cost of production and might leach nutrients out of the root zone yet introducing an efficient irrigation water management strategy such as deficit irrigation di is important for farmers asmamaw et al 2021b hence there is a growing interest in di an irrigation practice whereby water supply is reduced below maximum and mild stress is allowed with minimal effects on yield thus leading to higher water productivity wp abdelhady et al 2017 ali et al 2019 fl√∂rke et al 2018 gahnnem et al 2021 yu et al 2020 geerts and raes 2009 in a recent review in ethiopia asmamaw et al 2021b showed that for saving 65 water the yield penalty was 26 while wp increased by 110 for wheat in addition by irrigating less water per unit area the area under irrigation could be expanded to keep yield levels high combining di with soil acidity management activities such as liming and manuring combined with inorganic fertilizer might be needed yet scientific studies that combine di with isfm under wheat production are not available asmamaw et al 2022 in koga there are poor medium and rich farmers asmamaw et al 2021a by considering farmer s lime purchasing power searching for applicable alternative acidic soil management options is essential to identify cost effective isfm strategies analyzing revenue and gross profit for these strategies is also imperative combining isfm with improved irrigation strategies could reduce water scarcity and improve crop productivity designing efficient deficit irrigation options could reduce pressure on water resources and increase the area under irrigation hence understanding the possible effect of di and isfm on grain yield biomass and wp is vital to bridge these knowledge gaps the effect of lime at different rates with fixed doses of manure and inorganic fertilizer combined with di on wheat production and wp was evaluated the specific objectives of this study were i to evaluate the effect of di and isfm including applications of lime combined with manure on wheat grain yield and biomass ii to assess the combined effect of di and isfm on wp compared with the use of inorganic fertilizer and full irrigation iii to identify cost effective irrigation and isfm strategies the effects of liming and manuring on physical chemical and biological quality of the acid soils under study have been reported elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the field tests were carried out in ethiopia part of the upper blue nile basin at koga irrigation scheme 12 61 23 n and 37 03 92 e in 2018 19 and 2019 20 irrigated seasons the experimental site has an average slope of less than 0 2 the long term 1987 2020 meteorological data collected from ethiopian national meteorological service agency s bahir dar branch revealed a rainfall distribution with a unimodal pattern asmamaw et al 2021a the yearly rainfall ranges from 855 to 2200 mm with a mean of 1528 mm the highest air temperatures and reference evapotranspiration eto mm are recorded in march and april while the lowest air temperatures and eto are recorded in january and december and july and august respectively supplementary fig s1 the season for irrigated wheat normally begins in october when rainfall drops significantly and lasts until january while the irrigated maize season begins in january and ends in may supplmentary table s1 shows the monthly meteorological information for the 2018 19 and 2019 20 irrigated wheat growing seasons including rainfall mm maximum and minimum air temperatures c relative humidity sunlight hours h day 1 and wind speed m s 1 recorded at 2 m height in contrast to the long term trend supplementary fig s1 neither 2018 19 nor 2019 20 experienced any rain from october to january based on asmamaw et al 2022 report the soils of the study area are clayey and categorized as nitisols wrb 2015 the soils have a very low sand content 2 6 compared to a very high clay content 72 supplmentary table s7 also relatively higher dry bulk density was found in both soil depths in comparison to the control liming doses combined with manuring improved bulk density which improved moisture content at field capacity the average soil ph h2o at the control plot was 5 15 asmamaw et al 2022 the soil exchangeable acidity was considerably high however the sodium adsorption ratio was low thus soil condition in koga is strogly acidic asmamaw et al 2022 daily eto was calculated by the cropwat program based on the fao penman monteith equation smith et al 1998 the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was 0 90 ds m 1 asmamaw et al 2022 2 2 experimental design experiments were done under deficit irrigation di for four successive irrigated seasons 2018 19 2019 20 in this study the annual cropping sequence was wheat triticum aestivum l maize zea mays l with wheat grown in the first round of the irrigation season october to january and maize during the second round of the irrigation season january to may similar to farmer s practice in koga only the findings for wheat are presented here to exactly apply farmers practices such as ploughing furrow preparations weed and pest control ten model farmers were involved during the experiments i e five farmers per year because of other farmers interest to be involved in our research those who were involved in 2018 19 were substituted by another new five farmers they worked together in the same field based on the researcher s instructions the field management practices ploughing and weed management were the same except for the deficit irrigation di and integrated soil fertility management isfm treatments field managements were done on the same day trainings were given to the participating farmers on the main concepts and application of lime caco3 and manure combined with inorganic fertilizer and di the effect of isfm and di treatments was tested in a full factorial experiment with five isfm and four irrigation water scenarios yielding 20 treatments 5 4 and with three replicates the treatments were randomly arranged in three blocks each block contained a complete replicate of the treatment setting supplementary fig s2 shows 1 block except for the treatments the other possible factors such as soil conditions field management ploughing weed and pest control slope land leveling plot sizes plot shape and furrow length were the same in all plots thus isfm treatments with three levels of lime a fixed level of manure and inorganic fertilizer were arranged in a randomized complete block design the isfm treatments were i 0 86 t ha 1 lime 60 of the lime requirement combined with 3 t ha 1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer

80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc and a full irrigation 100 etc treatment were defined because in agricultural real life farmers have experienced limited water availability during the dry season full irrigation 100 etc estimated by cropwat was used as a control for di scenarios 2 3 soil fertility management the manure was prepared from cow sheep poultry and pig dung by the researcher it was stored in a room for a few days packed in sacks and stored in a room for a month until application based on its local availability and the current level of soil acidity 3 t ha 1 of manure was applied farmers manually broadcasted and thoroughly mixed it into the soil while working in dry weather using an ox driven maresha plough to till the soil to a depth of 10 15 cm on the same dates asmamaw et al 2012 temesgen et al 2012 based on the advice of the ethiopian institute of agricultural research the required amount of lime was calculated agegnehu et al 2019 the estimate takes into account the soil s bulk density depth of tillage degree of exchangeable acidity and ph similar to the manure a month before planting the lime was mixed into the soil to a depth of 10 15 cm mineral fertilizer comprised urea 46 n and nps b nitrogen phosphorus sulphur and boron for all treatments a full dose of urea 183 kg ha 1 was used and the dose was determined in accordance with the amhara region agricultural research institute s recommendation arari 2014 during sowing 1 3 of the urea was administered and the remaining 2 3 was applied while the wheat was at the tillering stage nps b which contains 18 9 nitrogen 37 7 phosphorus 6 95 sulfur and 0 1 boron was applied at a full dose 120 kg ha 1 2 4 crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling daily eto was computed using the cropwat program version 8 0 based on the fao penman monteith equation as described by allen et al 1998 the daily weather data was collected from the bahir dar meteorological station 35 km north of the study site in addition daily rainfall and temperature data were recorded using a tipping bucket rain gauge hobo ware equipped with a data logger and a thermometer installed at the study site and used as input for irrigation scheduling optimum soil moisture depletion level and root depth were adopted from fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 2006 the crop coefficient kc for wheat kekeba variety similar to our tested crop variety was adopted from tezera et al 2019 they studied wheat seasonal water demand and crop coefficient for three succeeding years following standard procedures as part of the ethiopian institute of agricultural research trials the daily water requirement of the crop and actual evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the cropwat program version 8 0 as well the etc and kc values are lowest highest and moderate at the initial mid and late stages respectively supplementary table s3 2 5 irrigation water management in the scenario analysis we evaluated the effect of reducing the net irrigation requirement 100 etc by 50 40 20 and 0 during the whole growth stages of wheat a rain fed scenario with no irrigation was not evaluated as this typically results in complete crop failure the watering was scheduled rotationally as the experimental site is part of the koga irrigation scheme where more than 10 000 households are benefiting from the same water source koga dam all plots were commonly off season irrigated with 30 mm of water two days before sowing as pre irrigation i e the sowing dates were 28 september for 2018 and 2 october for 2019 the crop was irrigated every 12 days using the furrow irrigation method totaling the number of irrigation events to 8 per growing season supplementary table s3 shows the irrigation scheduling for all treatments a 15 cm 6 inch throat width calibrated standard parshall flume installed at the inlet of the main plot was used to measure the discharge supplementary fig s3 water was diverted into the experimental field from a quaternary canal at a constant discharge rate this discharge was allowed to flow into a plot and each furrow for a given time the time t s required to apply the desired depth of water was calculated as 1 t d a q where d is the depth of water to be irrigated in every irrigation session m a is the plot size to be irrigated m2 and q is the discharge m3 s 1 instantly after the desired depth was applied to a given plot the discharge was cut off by closing the channel banks to stop water from entering the plots the discharge q was estimated as 2 q k h a n k is the flume discharge constant coefficient which varies with throat width flume size h a is the depth at the point of measurement m and n is the discharge exponent depends upon flume size 2 6 crop management wheat triticum aestivum l kekeba variety picaflora 1 was planted for two irrigated seasons with wheat maize cropping sequences kekeba a bread wheat variety is a semi dwarf is early maturing and is widely cultivated in various parts of ethiopia it can grow under a wide range of agro ecological conditions ranging from an altitude of 1500 2200 m a s l mahamed et al 2011 sowing was done by drilling manually in a row after the land was well prepared four tillage passes with a seeding rate of 150 kg ha 1 on 28 september 2018 and 02 october 2019 the seed was sown in a double row on both sides of the ridges weed management was done manually every season the crop was harvested on 26 january 2019 and 01 february 2020 in the 2018 and 2019 irrigated seasons respectively 2 7 soil moisture data collection by considering the wheat root zone gravimetric soil water content was measured one day before and two days after each irrigation session at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm with three replicates in each treatment samples were taken at different spots of each plot for every irrigation events during the study periods 2018 19 and 2019 20 the mean soil water content in the soil profile was taken to be the average of the soil water content measured in the 0 60 cm soil layer soil samples were collected using 10 cm height core samplers and the samples were oven dried at 105 0c for 48 h and the water content in the soil was determined on a weighted base as follows 3 Œ∏ m w w w d w d x 100 where Œ∏m is water content on a weight basis wd is weight of dry soil g and ww is weight of wet soil g but for et water productivity calculations the soil water content only taken at plantig and ripening periods was considered 2 8 crop data collection and yield calculation plant height was measured at the maturity stage in each plot with three replicates for all plant samples data were collected from the middle rows the grain yield and aboveground biomass data were collected at harvesting time from a sample area of 2 m 3 m in each plot with three replicates and the average values were taken for statistical analysis for all treatments the harvested crop was sun dried and threshed separately using wooden sticks and finally the grain was separated cleaned and weighed to record the grain yield the weight of a thousand grains per plot was recorded by 3 decimal places using a sensitive weighing balance with three replicates grain yield was measured as the weight of harvested grain and adjusted to 13 5 standard moisture content for wheat meskelu et al 2017 it was then converted to tons per hectare it was also expressed per amount of irrigation water that would be needed to meet the net irrigation water requirement niw this allowed us to assess the yield that can be produced under di when using the same amount of water as with full irrigation but on land currently not irrigated as well yield per total niw was calculated by multiplying the yield observed per ha for a given isfm treatment with a factor of 1 23 1 58 and 1 85 for 80 60 and 50 etc di strategies respectively these values were obtained by dividing total net irrigation water niw by total applied irrigation water aiw supplementary table s3 including the 30 mm pre irrigation water under full lime treated treatment l1 for example if the yield is 5 4 t ha 1 at full irrigation with 378 mm of water then under 100 etc yield per total niw is indeed 5 4 t while under 80 60 and 50 etc it is 6 4 8 1 and 8 9 t respectively for the same 378 mm water for 2018 season table 2 the area under irrigation needed to produce these yields is then 1 ha for full irrigation and 1 23 1 58 and 1 85 ha for di strategies respectively on land that is not irrigated there is no yield given the lack or complete absence of rain between october and january 2 9 water productivity crop water productivity wp was calculated to evaluate the effects of di strategies as 4 wp y et where y is the marketable wheat grain yield kg and et is the seasonal total evapotranspiration mm estimated by the water balance equation du et al 2015 5 e t p i c s w 1 s w 2 d r where p mm is the total rainfall i mm is the amount of irrigation water c mm is capillary rise into the root zone sw1 mm is the soil moisture content at planting time sw2 mm is the soil moisture contents at late ripening stage d mm is the drainage r mm is the surface runoff the groundwater table measured from two piezometers remained below 5 m depth while the capillary rise was estimated at 1 1 m using the aquacrop model we therefore assumed that there was no upward flow that contributed to the root zone the study field was flat 0 2 average slope so a runoff was never observed and also we used end diked furrows deep percolation drainage was negligible since the amount of irrigation water was equal to the depletion amount in the root zone thus the applied irrigation water was aimed to replenish the soil to field capacity 2 10 gross profit analysis to assess and compare the short term economic returns of producing wheat using di under isfm strategies a rough gross profit analysis was done such analysis is imperative to provide an applicable recommendation to farmers and farm managers the gross profit was computed as kifuko et al 2007 6 gross profit revenue input costs 7 revenue grain yield market price input costs and revenue of wheat cultivation in the study area are summarized in table 3 the unit cost was calculated based on existing retail prices during the study periods labor costs included sowing watering fertilizer application weeding manuring liming harvesting and shelling costs the data used for labor cost analysis was recorded at the specific time of each activity within the season computations were based on the existing labor cost for daily workers and the number of days required to realize a given activity wheat yield was computed as an average per treatment for the two seasons revenue from wheat grain yield was computed using existing market prices in koga input costs revenue and gross profit were calculated per ha and per total niw applied the additional land that could be irrigated using the saved water due to deficit irrigation as well as the extra costs associated with cultivating additional land fertilizer seed labor lime manure and other charges were then taken into account supplementary table s4 2 11 statistical analyses statistical analysis and graphics were done in r software version 3 4 2 r development core team 2020 the effect of di and isfm treatments on wheat grain yield biomass plant height and thousand grain weight were analyzed through randomized complete block design using a two way analysis of variance anova with replications following the general linear model procedure tukey hsd multiple comparisions test was used for mean separation when the analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the parameters the relationships between yield and thousand grain weight biomass and plant height water productivity and applied water were analyzed by linear regression the residual normal distribution and homoscedasticity of the data were tested before these analyses 3 results 3 1 grain yield per ha of land table 1 shows the treatments effect on wheat grain yield per ha for the irrigated seasons of 2018 19 and 2019 20 under all treatments there was no statistical difference in grain yield among treatments between the 2018 19 and 2019 20 experiment seasons except for that under di strategies at c yet there was a slight yield increase in 2019 20 for most isfm treatments l1 l2 l3 and m grain yield per ha was significantly p 0 05 affected by water deficits regardless of the soil fertility levels table 1 and suplementary table s11 the tukey hsd multiple mean comparision test proved that all di scenarios were significantly different suplementary table s12 at 80 etc di it was reduced by 2 0 8 0 under l1 to l3 by 0 4 2 under m and by 6 1 9 4 under c in comparison with 100 etc full irrigation when di was 60 etc grain yield under l1 to l3 was 4 0 10 lower than that at full irrigation while under m this was 2 2 4 2 and under c 9 1 22 a 50 etc di resulted in a reduction in grain yield of 8 2 11 under l1 to l3 of 4 3 6 3 under m and 12 25 under c irrespective of the irrigation water doses the isfm application rate considerably p 0 05 affected the grain yield per ha table 1 and suplementary table s10 the tukey hsd multiple mean comparision test results also confirmed that all isfm treatments were significantly different suplementary table s13 the grain yield was improved by 52 104 under the lime combined with manure treatments l1 to l3 and by 44 80 under m compared with c under all irrigation strategies 100 50 etc when looking at the interaction between di and isfm it was also statistically significant p 0 05 supplementary table s6 this suggests that in addition to the individual significant effects of di and isfm their synergy had a significant impact on wheat yield the control treatment c significantly different with the other combined di and isfm tratments in both study years supplementary table s6 full lime dose l1 was highly significant compared with l3 m and c under all irrigation scenarios in 2018 irrigated season when considering only 2019 irrigated season l1 and l2 were significantly different compared with l3 and m but m and l3 are not significant under all irrigation scenarios compared with l1 at 60 and 50 etc l2 at 80 and 60 etc was not significantly different the positive effect of soil fertility improvement through liming and manuring combined with inorganic fertilizers on wheat yield was significantly decreased with decreasing water stress but as presented in table 1 liming and manuring significantly improved wheat yield under non limited water supply conditions and this effect decreases with reducing water supply with soil fertility stress circumstances the beneficial impact of optimal moisture availability on wheat yield was significantly reduced but the full irrigation combined with improved soil fertility levels siginificantly increased wheat yield yield penalties resulting from reduced irrigation were affected by lime dose with higher lime doses l1 showing relatively the lowest yield penalties and lower lime doses l3 the largest interestingly at m no lime applied the grain yield reduction was smaller than under lime and manure l1 l3 while the highest reductions were observed under c the positive response to isfm was least pronounced under full irrigation and became higher with less water being applied for example the increase from c to l1 highest increase among isfm treatments was 69 70 at 100 etc while at 60 and 50 etc it varied between 76 and 104 depending on the year the 80 etc treatment took an intermediate position similar observations can be made for the other isfm treatments worth noting is also particularly as all treatments received inorganic fertilizer at recommended rates e g at 50 etc di the grain yield per ha under l1 was only 0 2 lower than that under m and higher than that under l3 4 6 when both received 100 etc full irrigation the use of 50 etc di under m yielded even a 36 38 higher grain yield per ha compared with full irrigation under c 3 2 biomass plant height and thousand grain weight the effect of irrigation water regimes and soil fertility conditions on biomass was highly significant p 0 05 in both seasons supplementary table s8 the trends observed are similar to those of grain yield though the differences in response between liming l1 to l3 m and c seem less pronounced than was the case with grain yield compared with full irrigation the biomass reduction was 1 5 20 under l1 to l3 12 20 under m and 13 21 under c at 80 60 and 50 etc di strategies as for yield we only see minor differences in biomass between 2018 19 and 2019 20 but whereas for yield the minor differences always resulted in higher yields in 2019 as compared to 2018 this was not the case for biomass where minor decreases were observed in 2019 20 relative to 2018 19 plant height at maturity per di and isfm treatment are presented in appendices supplementary table s8 irrigating 100 etc at l1 l2 l3 m and c gave the largest average plant heights at maturity of 93 92 89 91 and 87 cm respectively the lowest plant height recorded at maturity was 81 cm which was observed at 50 etc under c plant height as a yield attribute might be a good proxy to assess the total biomass needed for livestock fodder fig 1 shows a good correlation between biomass and plant height with biomass of wheat increasing linearly with plant height and 57 of the variation in biomass being explained by plant height being an indicator of grain quality thousand grain weight tgw was determined as presented in supplementary table s8 per di and isfm treatment in line with the other findings tgw was significantly affected p 0 05 by di and isfm the tgw values were higher at l1 l2 l3 and m in that order than at c irrespective of moisture deficits however the effects of di and isfm were less pronounced as compared to those of crop yield and biomass for example a 50 moisture deficit reduced tgw by 4 10 under l1 to l3 2 2 2 under m and 2 3 4 7 under c in comparison to full irrigation a highly significant linear relationship was observed between yield and tgw fig 2 with tgw explaining 76 of the variation in yield 3 3 grain yield per applied irrigation water amount and water productivity table 2 shows that yield of wheat in 2018 and 2019 calculated per total irrigated water amount aiw was increased with increasing water deficit strategies for example for l1 the average grain yield over the two seasons was 5 5 t ha 1 under 100 etc and 5 0 t ha 1 under 50 etc since under the latter regime 46 less water is used and thus 1 85 times as much land can be irrigated with the same amount of water supplementary table s3 the overall yield becomes 10 2 ton per 1 85 ha also 50 etc di applied under c yielded on average 5 0 t per 1 85 ha with an irrigation amount equal to aiw which is only slightly less than the overall yield at 100 etc with l1 5 5 t and equal to that at 100 etc under l3 similarly on average 50 etc di at m produced 8 7 t per 1 85 ha which was always much higher than the overall yield at 100 etc at all lime doses 5 0 5 5 t compared with 100 etc full irrigation the overall yield per unit of aiw increases with increasing water stress regardless of the isfm treatments in all isfm scenarios the yield increase per unit of water consumed was higher in the 50 60 and 80 etc irrigation scenarios in that order but at 100 etc irrigation scenarios there is no yield increase because there is no saved water to irrigate extra land which increases yield in each irrigation scenario the yield increase per unit of aiw appears to be higher at m however this is due to the lower yield reduction at m compared to lime and manure l1 l3 received plots see table 3 indirectly di enhanced yield per unit of water applied regardless of which isfm was used and as the degree of water stress increased the yield improvement per unit of water used likewise increased in a similar fashion di and isfm treatments significantly influenced water productivity wp during the study period as shown in fig 3 water productivity was always highest under the lowest irrigation water regimes or the highest water saved and decreased linearly with more water being applied this was the case for all isfm treatments notably is that the decrease in wp from least to most irrigation water was similar for all lime and manure treatments l1 l3 m which showed a similar slope of the regression line these treatments made wp increase up to 67 68 when the amount of irrigation water almost halved 50 etc in comparison with full irrigation notably is that wp values of l3 and m were most comparable the c treatment however showed a relatively lower response to variation in irrigation strategy with an increment of 52 with about half the amount of irrigation water but even more important than the water saved and being less consumed under the di regimes was the increase in yield resulting from the isfm treatments in comparison with c wp now increased by 15 68 under l1 l3 depending on di at m the increment still ranged between 20 and 75 across di treatments in all di treatments 100 etc 80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc the highest wp was found at l1 compared with the other isfm treatments 3 4 effect of di and isfm on soil moisture availability and plant gowth stages fig 4 shows the soil water content swc of the soil profile 0 60 cm measured one day and two days after irrigation sessions from all di and isfm treatments under the irrigated wheat growing seasons 2018 19 2019 20 under 100 etc in all isfm treatments the crop growth stages experiences no water stress except at c where the crop experienced water sress at maturity followed by ripening stages perhaps the soil fertility stress due to soil acidity could be a possible reason for the lower soil moisture availability for crops at c but the water stress occurred at maturity and ripening stages may not significantly affect the wheat yield regardless of the isfm at 80 etc the crop experienced a modest moisture stress that leads to stomata closure at flowering maturity and ripening stages in all isfm treatments at 60 etc the crop was exposed to water stress the whole growth stage but was highly stressed at the maturity and ripening stages while at c the stress occurred starting from around early flowering development maturity and ripening stages this implies that the soil fertility stress exacerbated the water stress level at c at 50 etc the level of water stress was higher at c in all growth stages but at l1 l2 l3 and m the flowering maturity and ripening stages were considerably stressed the trends of swc throughout the cropping periods were consistent indicating that the watering was applied with a predetermined schedule and amount 3 5 gross profit under all treatments the input costs were in the order of l1 l2 l3 m and c table 3 at full irrigation 100 etc the order of gross profit per ha was l1 m l2 l3 and c whereas at 80 and 60 etc the order was m l1 l2 l3 and c reducing the irrigation water amount under m was always more profitable per ha even without adding lime l1 l3 than full irrigation under c manuring only m at 50 etc was more profitable per ha than adding lime in addition to manure l1 l3 under 60 etc at 80 and 100 etc adding lime was more profitable per ha except for l3 under 80 etc compared with m at 50 etc calculating the gross profit per amount of water and thus using the water that could be saved by not fully irrigating individual fields sheds another light on the findings the order of gross profit per aiw at full irrigation 100 etc and 80 etc was l1 m l2 l3 and c whereas at 60 etc the order was m l1 l2 l3 and c yet at 50 etc the order of gross profit per aiw was l1 m l3 l2 and c amazingly wheat production profitability increases now tremendously with increasing deficit irrigation levels the highest profitability per aiw was found under l1 with 50 etc this combination almost doubled the profitability in comparison with full irrigation 100 etc under the isfm treatments l2 l3 m and c all 50 etc di treatments even the control without any extra manure or lime were more profitable than all 100 etc treatments 4 discussion 4 1 yield per unit of land and biomass production the effect of di combined with integrated soil fertility management isfm on water productivity wp and wheat production was studied over two irrigated seasons in 2018 and 2019 yields in the 2019 wheat season were slightly higher than those in the previous season table 1 which was most likely due to improved soil conditions because of the residual effect of previous liming and manuring as well as the return of crop residue and straw which may increase soil organic matter weather conditions in both years were very similar supplementary table s1 as expected wheat production per ha increased with increasing irrigation water amount under all isfm treatments table 1 the lower grain yield and biomass found at di under all isfm treatments compared with full irrigation could be due to moisture stress which may reduce photosynthesis and other cellular functions and damage the reaction center of the photosystem ultimately reducing grain yield and biomass dhiman et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 greaves and wang 2017 guo et al 2013 gurmessa 2020 junior et al 2020 a decreased wheat grain yield and biomass with increasing moisture deficit was also reported by ding et al 2021 jemal et al 2019 meskelu et al 2017 and tavakoli and moghadam 2016 from di field trials irrespective of the di strategy the grain yield and biomass were higher in the isfm treatments l1 l2 l3 and m compared with c the improvement in soil quality of the acidic nitisol such as soil structure bulk density porosity air capacity and water holding capacity mainly water content at fc as demonstrated by asmamaw et al 2022 in the same field trial could be one reason a better physical soil environment can promote root growth and reduce non productive water flow most like soil evaporation rather than deep percolation given that irrigation doses were as such that they replenish soil to field capacity also the increase in ph and soil organic matter by liming and adding manure asmamaw et al 2022 could have made adequate basic nutrients more available for uptake by plant roots with l1 showing the highest impact on yield and biomass in comparison with l2 l3 m and c in that order liming reduces aluminum and hydrogen toxicity and thus promotes normal plant growth and enhances the plant s nutrient and water uptake leading to increased grain yield and biomass auler et al 2017 demil et al 2020 dhiman et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 gurmessa 2020 junior et al 2020 this is supported by the findings of marschner 2011 who reported that the application of lime reduced soil acidity which enhanced better crop growth that can provide additional organic matter through residue returns and free calcium carbonates which help increase soil ph improve the solubility and availability of important nutrients to plants and improve the water holding capacity and uptake of nutrients interesting is that di was most successful i e showing the lowest yield penalty under m it was having the largest negative effect under c vice versa the highest response to isfm was found under the most deficit irrigation strategies and the lowest at full irrigation this could indicate that liming will primarily increase the availability of nutrients while manuring creates a better physical soil environment since nutrients can only move to roots through continuous water films within the soil reduced water contents and lack of water continuity in soils associated with the increased level of di will reduce nutrient uptake rates auler et al 2017 gurmessa 2020 junior et al 2020 shaxson and barber 2003 under manuring alone this effect seems less important and the effect of manuring is probably limited mostly to a higher physical resilience to water stress resulting from higher organic matter content and microbial activities that can promote soil aggregation ferreira et al 2019 lal shukla 2004 the c treatment without having manure being added therefore shows a much larger yield penalty with increasing water stress than the m treatment in a study on wheat production under different di and fertility strategies on a deep clay silty soil in northwest iran tavakoli and moghadam 2016 showed that the application of 67 etc combined with 90 kg n ha 1 reduced grain production by 20 compared to 100 etc but at full irrigation a 68 yield improvement was found due to 90 kg n application compared with no fertilizer used they concluded that enhancing soil fertility combined with di might result in a significant and consistent improvement in wheat yield in semi arid regions for farmers improved soil and irrigation water management approaches that could improve grain yield are vital asmamaw et al 2021a 2021b also producing more biomass as such is crucial as livestock ranching is the secondary agricultural activity that needs the straw for animal fodder amede et al 2021 agegnehu et al 2017 desalegn et al 2017 the lowest grain yield found from c coincides with the national 2 5 t ha 1 and global 2 9 t ha 1 average wheat yield csa 2021 minot et al 2015 adding relatively low amounts of water as under di in combination with improving soil health can thus more than double the biomass and yield of wheat even in a dry season the lowest yield found in c at 50 etc could be attributed to the aluminum toxicity which restricts root growth that hampers water uptake of plants and the nutrient s unavailability to plants due to soil acidity this means the plants could not use the applied di and nutrients the lowest yield found in c at 50 etc could also be caused by a moisture shortage but with the same amount of di used at l1 l2 l3 and m higher yields were discovered this means plants can access the available water this depends on root depth adding lime increased the availability of p which might have stimulated root growth and thus increasing root depth as a result not only the accessibility to water increases but also that to nutrients 4 2 grain yield per applied irrigation water amount and water productivity though there was a small yield penalty per ha under di it increased the overall wheat production per unit of water application in all isfm practices when compared to full irrigation table 2 the overall yield increase per unit of aiw under all isfm suggested us the possibility of expanding the currently irrigated area by irrigating extra land with the saved water when 80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc irrigation strategies are used 23 58 and 85 irrigation water can be saved compared to full irrigation with the same amount of water used for instance at all isfm practices 50 etc application almost doubled the overall yield by irrigating about 85 more irrigable land using the saved water this way water scarcity could be reduced in areas where moisture is the limiting factor for crop production thus in the koga irrigation scheme these irrigation scenarios could increase the irrigable area as displayed in fig 5 where command areas were delineated by considering a slope of less than 6 land leveling and farmers settlement also the yield increase for each scenario under each isfm treatment is shown in table 2 this means that those farmers that are currently not irrigating their land due to water shortage though initially considered in the project could now benefit from it yet to be more beneficial from di amending the soil with lime and manure seems an interesting option as our findings suggest that the small yield penalty due to di could be compensated by soil fertility management in line with this study ding et al 2021 concluded that applying compost could be used to mitigate the wheat yield penalty effect of di in egypt under a silt clay dominated aridisol water productivity wp can be improved by applying di admasu et al 2019 ali et al 2019 fl√∂rke et al 2018 gahnnem et al 2021 qin et al 2022 singh et al 2021 tari 2016 yu et al 2020 and isfm practices as the first reduces the amount of water consumed while the latter increases crop yield ding et al 2021 considering only the liming and manuring effects in all irrigation scenarios 100 etc 80 etc 60 etc and 50 etc the increment in wp followed the order of l1 l2 l3 m and c fig 3 yet regardless of the isfm wp increased with increasing moisture deficit the highest wp we found from 40 and 50 di can be attributed to the wise use of irrigation water and reduced non productive water flux mostly evaporation while at 100 etc part of the irrigation water may not be efficiently used by the crop but rather be lost in the form of evaporation as the irrigation water applied at full irrigation was done to replenish the depleted water from the root zone by the researcher there was no excess water that could be deep percolated the capillary rise was assumed to have a negligible contribution to the root zone as the water table was found below 5 m from the surface and capillary rise was estimated at 1 1 m only in all isfm treatments the stored soil moisture content decreased with increasing the moisture deficit supplementary table s9 in comparison to c the lime treatments l1 l3 increased soil moisture content up to 14 39 depending on the di levels at m the increment ranged between 7 and 10 compared with c in comparison with full irrigation the soil moisture content stored at lime treatments l1 l3 reduced between 16 and 24 at about half of the irrigation water used but at m and c it decreased by 16 and 13 respectively also lime and manure were clearly shown to enhance wp hence investing in lime and manure could also save more water that could be used to irrigate extra land when compared with the control no liming and manuring wp at 50 etc is 67 86 higher under lime and manure treated fields l1 to m fig 3 our results comply with that of a recent review asmamaw et al 2021a 2021b that reported a 27 maize yield reduction but a 109 wp increase when saving 65 water in a di field trial carried out in ethiopia on clay soil jemal et al 2019 mahamed et al 2011 and meskelu et al 2017 reported improved wheat wp under di compared with full irrigation 4 3 thousand grain weight under di and isfm the value of tgw a grain quality indicator is very essential to determine the seed rate a high tgw is mostly associated with large grain size hence farmers need more seeds while they need less for low tgw our findings suggest that wheat grain quality is moderate to low in its sensitivity to water and soil fertility stress the grain yield of wheat increases linearly with increasing tgw fig 2 this means that the heavier grain weight and highest grain yield observed at lower moisture deficits combined with the highest lime doses are likely due to adequate nutrient availability and more translocation of food processed in photosynthesis due to adequate water in the root zone compared to other treatments compared with c the combined application of lime manure and inorganic fertilizer improved tgw irrespective of di applications liming improves the ability of the plant to absorb nutrients by eliminating al toxicity and by increasing the vegetative growth of wheat which resulted in increased tgw regardless of liming and manuring the values of tgw decrease with an increasing water deficit in all treatments this implies that photosynthesis respiration and other cellular functions of plants are more affected under 60 or 50 etc compared with 100 etc and 80 etc in a previous study meskelu et al 2017 reported the highest tgw at 100 and 85 etc compared with 50 40 etc and 30 etc under clay soil in ethiopia mahamed et al 2011 reported significantly decreased wheat tgw with increasing soil moisture depletion levels due to di application compared with non water stressed plots in semi arid ethiopia under haplic andosol also tari 2016 found a 37 reduced tgw value of wheat over an optimally irrigated clay dominated soil in turkey this implies that to some extent imposing water stress could contribute to the reduction of tgw as the amount of available water may not be sufficient for producing better grain the decrease in irrigation water level decreases the plant height in all isfm supplementary table s8 this showed that plant height is mainly affected by moisture stress due to the reduction in photosynthesis of the plant 4 4 gross profit irrespective of the isfm di improved the profitability of wheat production in comparison with 100 etc full irrigation this means profitability increases with increasing moisture deficit among the tested isfm treatments l1 requires the highest investment but it is the most profitable strategy compared with l2 l3 m and c table 3 at 100 etc 80 etc and 50 etc under 40 di manuring is the most profitable followed by l1 l2 l3 and c respectively this means that the combined use of manure and lime was found to be more important to increase gross profit rather than the use of inorganic fertilizer alone which produced a low yield when di alone is considered a 50 moisture deficit is more profitable followed by a 40 and 20 deficit respectively as such with a 50 etc in all isfm treatments grain yield is close to double resulting in higher profitability this infers that by di farmers can irrigate more land with the saved water which improved their gross profit compared with the full irrigation strategy as described earlier this also can be taken as a climate change resilient strategy particularly in the time of prolonged dry seasons in general the use of di and isfm improves profitability in addition when the moisture deficit increase profitability raised linearly thus farmers could choose one of the isfm and di strategies based on their lime purchasing power water and land availability 5 conclusion and recommendations the effect of integrated soil fertility management isfm and deficit irrigation di on wheat production and water productivity wp was studied applying full dose lime combined with manure substantially enhanced wheat grain yield biomass and wp compared with 80 of the lime requirement lr and 60 of lr combined with manure at 100 80 60 and 50 etc scenarios manure application also considerably improved wheat grain yield biomass and wp under all irrigation water scenarios the highest wp was found at 100 of lime requirement l1 80 of lime requirement l2 60 of lime requirement l3 and 3 t ha 1 manure m respectively possibly because of increasing organic matter and improved basic nutrients available for plants at all irrigation water levels we note that liming and manuring could be used to mitigate the yield penalty effect of di while it further increases wp in the study area this could help with the decision of choosing soil and water management strategies that could be used to reduce yield loss due to soil acidity induced soil fertility stress and water stress the overall yield increase per unit of applied irrigation water for each scenario under all isfm suggested the possibility of expanding the existing irrigated area by irrigating additional land with the saved water this means that farmers who are currently unable to irrigate their land owing to a lack of water though initially were considered in the project could now benefit from it the use of l1 under full irrigation 100 etc 80 etc and 50 etc is the most profitable strategy whereas manuring is the most lucrative strategy under 60 etc when we considered irrigation water management alone a 50 di is more profitable than 60 80 and 100 etc thus farmers could choose one of the tested isfm strategies based on their lime purchasing power water availability and extra land available for irrigation from an irrigation water management viewpoint wheat could be irrigated at 60 etc to increase wp with less grain yield reduction at l1 l2 l3 m and c to save more water to irrigate extra irrigable lands currently not irrigated in the koga irrigation area farmers should invest more in di integrated with liming and manuring declaration

9116,the stability of soybean yields in brazil is regularly affected by drought periods and soil management practices are crucial to expanding the water holding capacity of the soil and providing higher levels of moisture during critical periods which contribute to increasing crop yields relieving the need for non agricultural areas to be converted into croplands the research reported herein aimed to quantitatively monitor the soil moisture of a soybean crop through leaf based hyperspectral reflectance and suggest a remote sensing based approach that might assist in identifying soil management zones a field experiment at the brazilian agricultural research corporation during 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons had ten soybean genotypes subjected to four water conditions irrigated non irrigated and water deficit induced at the vegetative or reproductive stages the soil of the experimental site is characterized as udox oxisol leaf reflectance 400 2500 nm was collected by the spectroradiometer fieldspec 3 jr simultaneously with soil moisture 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths at eleven dates data submitted to principal component analysis pca evaluated the clustering of water conditions and which are the most critical spectral wavelengths to characterize the plant water status the partial least squares regression plsr was applied to develop a quantitative spectral model to predict soil moisture the pca explained over 93 of the spectral variance within each assessment day and shortwave infrared wavelengths presented a higher contribution to water status clustering at the cross validation step the plsr presented r2 up to 0 860 and 0 906 0 20 and 20 40 cm underperforming when soil moisture showed no significant differences between water conditions using samples from all assessment days plsr presented r2 0 609 and 0 722 0 20 and 20 40 cm at the external validation step rmse 2 7 and 1 9 respectively with a soil moisture range equal to 16 35 and 20 35 at both depths remarkably outperforming the traditional univariate spectral models our results contribute to soil moisture assessment in extensive soybean areas regardless of the stage of crop development and provide a significant contribution since the brazilian soybean crop calendar might present differences of over 30 days within the same production region due to that soybean plants are rarely at the same phenological stage on a given date in the season keywords drought leaf water content yield principal component analysis partial least squares regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations anon 2018 the world population will exceed 9 billion people by 2050 which requires maximized food production to meet the food demand and assist food security policies concurrently to the agricultural production expansion only sustainable practices adoption shall guarantee environmental preservation anon 2018 hence increasing crop yield is crucial to relieve the need for non agricultural areas to be converted into croplands meet the world food demand and adopt sustainable production standards nepomuceno 2021 brazil is the largest soybean producer responsible for nearly one third 140 million tons anon 2022 of soybeans produced worldwide 372 million tons anon 2022 in the last decades soybean yield in brazil has grown at higher rates compared to the increment of production areas which prevented by the adoption of technologies for soybean production and consequently yield gains millions of ha to be converted into agricultural areas to achieve the same production amount gazzoni and dall agnol 2018 however the yield stability in brazil is regularly affected by unfavorable climatic events especially drought periods although dryness is not observable across the entire soybean cropping season periods of water deficit regularly cause high yield losses compromising over 30 of the brazilian soybean production sentelhas et al 2015 and leading to financial losses of over us 79 billion in 38 years ferreira 2016 irrigated areas in brazil represent a small percentage of the areas devoted to agricultural production specifically only about 2 of the areas devoted to soybean production is irrigated fao 2017 conab 2022 thus considering the need to optimize the use of water resources anon 2018 several strategies to cope with water deficit periods during the soybean cropping season are available including but not limited to the development of soybean cultivars with drought tolerance stolf moreira et al 2011 rolla et al 2014 marinho et al 2016 honna et al 2016 fuganti pagliarini et al 2017 the grouping of soybean production areas based on their edaphoclimatic characteristics indicating more suitable cultivars for each of them kaster and farias 2012 and the agricultural zoning of climatic risk addressing the more favorable sowing periods for each production area to minimize the probability of occurrence of water deficit periods at critical stages of crop development farias et al 2001 in addition do rio et al 2016 have proposed alternative sowing dates based on the future climatic scenarios for soybean production another strategy is the adoption of soil management practices aiming at enlarging the soil water holding capacity providing thus higher levels of water availability to support crop development during water deficit periods however the traditional methods for soil moisture determination are laborious and time consuming requiring the collection of several samples in each production area which impair the soil water status monitoring over large areas in short time intervals in this context remote sensing becomes a proxy for crop water status monitoring delivering accurate fast and spatial information about crop conditions non destructively using remote sensing information peng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 and yuan et al 2019 have reported the relation between soil moisture and soil spectral response however assessing soil moisture via spectral response requires laborious and time consuming field campaigns for in situ samplings therefore most existing methods using remotely sensed data for monitoring soil moisture rely on the indirect and qualitative relation between crop reflectance and soil moisture which in turn bases itself on the direct relationship between reflectance and vegetation water content this relation is a crucial indicator of soil water status kovar et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 many authors demonstrated the relation between reflectance and vegetation water content in several crops including wheat el hendawy et al 2014 feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 maize ge et al 2016 and 2019b zygielbaum et al 2009 cotton yi et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 and soybean kovar et al 2019 braga et al 2021 in soybean braga et al 2021 and wijewardana et al 2019 reported that physiological traits such as photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration internal co2 content leaf water potential and leaf water content are affected by low levels of soil moisture so spectral measurements can be accurately related to crop traits for monitoring crop and soil water status although the many efforts to retrieve crop water status by spectral measurements still lack discussion on the direct and quantitative soil moisture assessment through crop reflectance ge et al 2019a sobrino et al 2012 used an airborne hyperspectral scanner ahs and satellite images to estimate the soil moisture of several crops at distinct crop phenological stages ge et al 2019a assessed soil moisture via uav based hyperspectral image over wheat fields at a single phenological stage and panigrahi and das 2018 modeled soil water potential using ground based hyperspectral measurements over rice fields at multiple phenological stages however models for soil moisture prediction using canopy spectral data might be susceptible to interferences from canopy structure leaf area angle and position shadow and background liu et al 2015 ma et al 2019 imposing limitations on acquisition of the quantitative relation between soil moisture and leaf reflectance and the extendibility of the developed models to new agricultural areas moreover considering the soybean sowing calendar in brazil which might extend over more than one month within the same production area crusiol et al 2021b it is highly desirable that spectral models accurately predict soil moisture regardless of crop phenological development based on the current progress this research aims at monitoring the soil moisture quantitatively at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths using leaf based hyperspectral reflectance to support a soil water holding capacity enlargement through a more precise delimitation of soil management practices in a soybean crop the specific goals are to assess the sensitive spectral bands for soybean water status monitoring develop soil moisture prediction models at different stages of crop development and develop soil moisture prediction models regardless of the soybean crop stage of development 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment fig 1 in a split plot model in a randomized complete block design with four blocks was undertaken on the experimental farm of the national soybean research center embrapa soja a branch of the brazilian agricultural research corporation located in londrina municipality paran√° state southern brazil 23 11 37 s 51 11 03 w 630 m above sea level in the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons following the soybean production technologies embrapa soja 2013 the soil of the experimental site table 1 is characterized as udox oxisol anon 1999 with 75 mm of water holding capacity with the following characteristics soil analysis in march 2016 according to the k√∂ppen climate classification the experimental site is in a cfa climate i e subtropical climate with a mean temperature in the hottest month higher than 22 ¬∫c and rainfall concentrated in the summer months with no defined dry season wrege et al 2012 alvares et al 2013 considering the soybean calendar in central and south brazil the largest soybean producers the rainy season corresponds to the periods of soybean production but not without water deficit periods the field plots received four water condition treatments irrigated irr receiving rainfall and irrigation when necessary with a soil water matric potential between 0 03 and 0 05 mpa non irrigated nirr receiving only rainfall water deficit induced at the vegetative stages wdv water deficit induced at reproductive stages wdr and ten soybean genotypes with drought tolerance genes and different responses to water deficit were distributed in the subplots genotypes 1ea15 2ha11 2ia4 br16 and brs 184 in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons and genotypes 1ea2939 3ma2 brs 283 brt18 0089 and brt18 0201 in 2018 2019 cropping season automated rainout shelters kept wdv and wdr subplots free from receiving rainfalls higher than 0 1 mm in the vegetative and reproductive phases respectively and imposed the water deficit treatments and increased the soil gravimetric humidity variability across treatments shelters automatically uncovered plants once rainfalls had ceased the plots had in their perimeter vertical concrete barriers buried up to 90 cm depth to prevent water lateral movement from outside into the plot soil during the period in which wdv plots were deprived of rainfalls wdr was under natural water availability conditions from the flowering period to full maturity harvesting the wdr treatment was deprived of natural rainfall and wdv plots began to be rain watered under natural water availability conditions thus water deficit periods could be simulated both in the vegetative and reproductive stages of development drip irrigation was performed using groundwater from artesian well and kept in a water tank table 2 displays the sowing dates and periods of water deficit inducement in the vegetative and reproductive periods table 3 presents the irrigation schedule performed in the 2016 2017 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons the irrigation volume needed to keep the soil water matric potential between 0 03 and 0 05 mpa was determined by the soil moisture 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths on irr plots daily monitored by tensiometers installed on each block in the 2017 2018 cropping season there was no need for irrigation and therefore plants of irr and nirr treatments were under the same experimental conditions in the 2016 2017 cropping season irr plots received 69 4 mm of irrigation between november 11 and 25 in the 2018 2019 cropping season irr plots received irrigation during two periods between december 6 and 20 2018 63 mm and between january 29 and february 11 2018 43 1 mm in a total of 106 1 mm in all plots soil moisture 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths was monitored by gravimetric analysis on eleven dates across the three cropping seasons as described in table 4 in all plots at 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths soil samples were collected using a dutch auger and immediately placed in hermetic aluminum boxes weighted and placed in the oven at 105 for 48 h to reach constant weight the growth stages of the soybean plants were weekly monitored from emergence to maturation according to fehr and caviness 1977 and grain yield was calculated and corrected for 13 grain moisture according to eq 1 eq 1 gy 100 hgm 100 dgm hgw 10 000 hpa in which gy is the grain

grain moisture meter gehaka inc weather data air temperature relative air humidity and rainfall were monitored by the weather station located within the experimental area the calculation of the climatic water balance was according to thornthwaite and mather 1955 for each experimental treatment of each cropping season additional information on the weather monitoring of the experiment is available at sibaldelli and farias 2017 2018 2019 2 2 spectral data acquisition and processing soybean leaf reflectance data was collected by the fieldspec 3 jr spectroradiometer analytical spectral devices boulder co usa with a spectral resolution of 3 nm between 350 and 1400 nm and 30 nm resolution between 1400 and 2500 nm the output spectra are given in single bands of 1 nm intervals and 2151 spectral bands fig 2 each spectral reading was averaged from 20 internal automatic spectral readings preventing the occurrence of noise in the obtained data the plant probe device connected to the fieldspec by a one meter bare fiber fig 2b was used during the leaf reflectance spectral assessment to prevent illumination interferences of adjacent targets and to ensure pure leaf reflectance spectra collection without noises scattering or attenuations from the interaction between electromagnetic energy and atmospheric water vapor also we used an internal 99 reflectance board spectralon as the reflectance standard and a 1 reflectance blackboard as the opaque one the use of the plant probe device does not require the application of spectral filters for noise removal and data smoothness streher et al 2020 the acquisition of the reflectance spectra data was on the central leaflet of the fullest expanded third trifoliate leaf from the top leaf reflectance spectra were collected from four plants and then averaged to minimize spectral variability within the same subplot resulting in the values used for data processing and statistical analysis the spectral assessment days coincided with the soil moisture assessment table 4 except for december 15 2016 when the soil moisture was assessed on the day after december 16 2016 even though neither irrigation nor rainfall occurred on those dates a total of 3376 leaf reflectance data were collected resulting in 844 spectral samples at 11 days of spectral assessment across the three cropping seasons the collected leaf reflectance spectra were analyzed within each day of spectral assessment by the hyperspectral reflectance between 400 nm and 2500 nm wavelengths between 350 and 399 nm stayed out of the spectral analysis because of the frequent noises observed during vegetation analysis in this spectral interval peng et al 2018 furlanetto et al 2021 2 3 statistical analysis upon meeting the assumptions of the analysis of variance anova we submitted soil moisture data of the eleven assessments on the three cropping seasons and grain yield data from each cropping season to anova and compared means by the tukey test p 0 05 using the software sisvar ferreira 2011 we used two statistical approaches to monitor the soybean water status and predict soil moisture the principal component analysis pca explored the qualitative differences in soybean leaf spectral response to investigate the possibility of clustering the water condition treatments the use of partial least squares regression plsr was to develop soil moisture prediction models by the soybean leaf based hyperspectral reflectance both pca and plsr were performable by the unscrambler camo software norway 2 3 1 principal component analysis pca we applied the principal component analysis to the soybean leaf based hyperspectral reflectance data within each assessment day table 4 to assess the explained variance from leaf based reflectance and to evaluate whether the clustering of water conditions is possible the pca is a data mining method that transforms the full reflectance spectrum into a new group of variables principal components pc using a matrix of covariances composed of all wavelengths most of the information on data variance resides in the first principal component pc1 the second principal component carries the residual information of pc1 the third principal component carries the residual information of pc1 and pc2 pc1 pc2 and so on jolliffe and cadima 2016 furlanetto et al 2021 the pc can be defined as the linear combination of all wavelengths to explain their variance within the dataset the percentage of explained variance can be assessed by each pc s score while the contribution of each wavelength to each pc can be assessed by the loading correlation expressed in r 2 3 2 partial least squares regression plsr the partial least squares regression is a multivariate statistical analysis method widely used when the number of predictor variables e g wavelengths is larger than the number of response variables e g soil moisture and has the advantage of overcoming the multicollinearity of independent variables often observed in hyperspectral data zhou et al 2019 based on a new dataset of latent variables or plsr factors or orthogonal base vectors that account for most of the variation in a trait variable the spectral data matrix x is correlated to the soil moisture matrix y using a linear model composed by wavelength scaling coefficients derived from the full spectrum data yendrek et al 2017 the number of plsr factors a critical process in the plsr deeply affecting its prediction capacity streher et al 2020 was set based on the lowest value of root mean square error rmse highest coefficient of determination r2 and value of bias close to zero through the leave one out cross validation method souza et al 2013 on each spectral dataset we normalized the reflectance spectra by subtracting the mean reflectance from the actual reflectance at each wavelength enabling the comparison among the fitted wavelength scaling coefficients outliers and homogeneity of the spectral data assessment were by the leverage and hotelling s t2 tests in the first stage we used plsr to develop soil moisture prediction models at both 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths by the soybean leaf based hyperspectral reflectance within each assessment day table 4 in the second stage we evaluated the possibility of developing a soil moisture prediction model based on soybean leaf reflectance at different phenological stages to do so plsr models for soil moisture prediction at both 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths were developed using all the 844 samples leaf reflectance and soil moisture acquired on the eleven assessment days on the three cropping seasons this randomly divided dataset had two subsets calibration cross validation steps containing 80 of data 669 samples and external validation with the remaining 20 of the data 175 samples each developed plsr model had its accuracy assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the systematic error bias in the calibration and cross validation using the leave one out cross validation method steps in the second stage plsr models developed using 80 of samples and tested over the remaining 20 of samples external validation were assessed by the r2 and rmse between predicted and observed soil moisture values at both depths 0 20 and 20 40 cm 2 3 3 comparison of plsr performance with traditional univariate spectral models we used three approaches to investigate whether traditional univariate spectral models might deliver competitive results compared to the plsr using spectral and soil moisture data from all assessment days from the three cropping seasons we performed tests using the calibration dataset containing 80 of data 669 samples of soil moisture values 0 20 and 20 40 cm to check their correlation to a reflectance from each one of the 2101 single wavelengths b reflectance resampled to broad multispectral bands anon 2021 supplementary table 1 and derived vegetation indices supplementary table 2 c hyperspectral vegetation indices hvi derived from all possible combination between two spectral bands calculated under a normalized difference vegetation index formula according to eq 2 eq 2 hvi wavelength 1 wavelength 2 wavelength 1 wavelength 2 the accuracy was assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 from the linear regression p 0 05 between soil moisture and each narrow or broad spectral band and each multispectral or hyperspectral vegetation index the linear regression models from the outstanding single wavelength broad multispectral band or vegetation index and hyperspectral vegetation index were then applied to the remaining 20 of samples external validation dataset and the accuracy was assessed by the r2 and rmse between the predicted and observed values of soil moisture at both depths 0 20 and 20 40 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of experimental treatments on climatic water balance soil moisture and grain yield fig 3 presents the climatic water balance calculated according to thornthwaite and mather 1955 for each experimental treatment of each cropping season the efficiency of the experimental treatments in simulating water deficit periods at the vegetative and reproductive stages of plant development are in fig 3 a e i at december 1 and 2 10 day periods and fig 3 b f j at december 3 and january 1 2 and 3 10 day periods respectively in the three cropping seasons higher deficits can be observable in wdr plants in contrast to wdv most likely because of the more extended water withholding period to which plants were submitted in the 2016 2017 cropping season the irrigation performed on irr plots provided good water availability conditions during november 3 and december 1 10 days periods fig 3d in the 2018 2019 cropping season it is possible to observe severe natural water deficit periods during both vegetative and reproductive phases fig 3k and the irrigated treatment promoted good conditions of water availability during december 1 2 and 3 january 2 and february 2 10 days periods fig 3l fig 4 presents the soil moisture in the eleven assessment days across the three evaluated cropping seasons on all assessment days but at 57 das in the 2017 2018 cropping season and 41 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season the experimental treatments produced differences in soil gravimetric humidity at both depths 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm considering the dates of water deficit inducement and the irrigation schedule tables 2 and 3 the differences among treatments follow the water availability provided by the treatments at 41 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season the differences between treatments were undetectable since irr plots had not received irrigation until that day and the water deficit in the wdv treatment was not present yet the effects of differential water availability on soybean yields in the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons are in fig 5 the effectiveness of the experimental treatments in promoting differential water availability levels to plants is demonstrated by the intense decreases in yield of wdr treatment especially during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons when its attained productivity was less than half of the other treatments although wdv plants were under water scarcity they revealed similar yield compared to the non irrigated treatment and higher yield compared to the wdr treatment reinforcing that the water deficit during the reproductive stages of plant development is more harmful to yield rolla et al 2014 also reported the similar grain yield of soybean plants subjected to water withholding at vegetative stages and plants under natural rainfall or irrigation in the 2016 2017 cropping season a severe natural water deficit was not observed fig 3c and the 69 6 mm of irrigation on irr plots received between 24 and 38 das did not increased yields however when severe natural water deficit occurred across both vegetative and reproductive stages as it occurred in the 2018 2019 cropping season fig 3k the irrigated treatment revealed higher grain yields compared to plants receiving only natural rainfall 3 2 principal component analysis of soybean leaf spectral response we submitted the collected leaf based hyperspectral data to principal component analysis to explore the qualitative spectral differences among the experimental treatments the spectral response of soybean genotypes evaluated at 87 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season under maximum and minimum soil moisture content at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths is presented in fig 6 at both depths it is possible to observe differences in the soybean spectral response across wavelengths with higher reflectance from plants under lower soil moisture agreeing with damm et al 2018 which described the interference of plant water status in crop spectra the most conspicuous changes in reflectance due to changes in plant water status were observed across the shortwave infrared spectrum however it is worth mentioning that the differences in spectral responses of soybean plants under different levels of water availability are not the same across the wavelengths due to leaf biochemical properties and structure maimaitiyiming et al 2016 falcioni et al 2020 the differential effects of the crop water status on the interaction between electromagnetic energy and soybean leaves across wavelengths can be considered primary or secondary the primary effects are directly related to the absorption of radiation by water imposing a strong influence over shortwave infrared swir wavelengths the secondary effects cannot be explained solely by the water absorption of radiation but also by its indirect relation to the leaf structure and physiology imposing a substantial influence over visible and near infrared wavelengths carter 1991 el hendawy et al 2019 visible wavelengths between 400 nm and 720 nm are associated with the leaf pigments and the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation and under water stress there is lower light absorption leading to higher values of reflectance carter 1991 singer et al 2011 gitelson et al 2015 gitelson 2019 near infrared wavelengths between 720 and 1300 nm relate to the light scattering along the mesophyll under the influence of internal leaf structures such as cell wall width intercellular air spaces and the amount of mesophyll per unit of leaf area inside the mesophyll carter 1991 liu et al 2016 2020 hence changes in crop water status might lead to changes in the internal scattering of the incident light resulting in higher light absorption and lower reflectance from plants under higher levels of water content between 1300 nm and 2500 nm the swir spectrum demonstrated to be more affected by changes in soil moisture presenting higher values of reflectance under lower levels of water content this spectral interval is closely related to leaf water content one of the critical parameters for establishing the crop water status gao 1996 wang and qu 2007 2021 considering the effects of water availability on leaf reflectance fig 7 presents the results from principal component analysis for each assessment day table 4 demonstrating the possibility of clustering the water condition treatments for all the eleven evaluation dates across the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons the first pc pc 1 explained over 44 of the spectral variance within each dataset and the cumulative percentage of pc 1 and pc 2 demonstrated to be over 82 the cumulative results from pc1 pc 2 and pc 3 revealed over 93 of the explained variance within each dataset in the 2016 2017 cropping season the scatterplot from pc 1 and pc 2 at 58 das fig 7a showed a similar distribution of the four water condition treatments by this day the irr plots had been receiving 69 4 mm irrigation and the wdv deprived of 123 8 mm rainfall until flowering 55 das receiving 3 8 mm within three days before the spectral assessment at 112 das wdr had been deprived of 407 4 mm rainfall since flowering 55 das leading to its distinct spectral response as demonstrated by fig 7 b on this day the three other water condition treatments showed similar responses in the 2017 2018 cropping season when wdv had been deprived of 71 4 mm rainfall the scatterplot from pc 1 and pc 2 at 57 das demonstrated similar distribution among the four water condition treatments fig 7c however as observed in the previous cropping season the wdr plots subjected to water scarcity presented a distinct response from the other treatments at 96 106 and 112 das fig 7d e f as for these three assessment dates the wdr plots had been deprived of 507 9 mm rainfall until 96 das and 562 7 mm until 106 and 112 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season the four water condition treatments demonstrated similar distribution at 41 das when wdv plots had not received the water deficit treatment yet and the irr plots had not been irrigated still fig 7g at 57 das fig 7h the four treatments demonstrated similar responses regardless of the irrigation performed on irr 40 3 mm and the low amount of rain 1 4 mm prevented to fall on wdv as seen in the previous two cropping seasons the water shortage in wdr is better identifiable by its leaf reflectance analyzed through pca at 87 das fig 7i despite the irrigation received 63 mm the irr could not be clearly identified in the scatterplot between pc 1 and pc 2 notwithstanding the wdr deprived of 137 4 mm of rainfall could be undoubtedly clustered from the others at 101 das fig 7j wdr had been deprived of 143 6 mm of rainwater until 90 das when this treatment started to be rain watered received 19 8 mm of rainfall since then which affected the spectral response from this treatment and led to its clustering concerning the other three water conditions at 107 das fig 7k irr could not be clustered out from the other three treatments although it had received 70 2 mm of total irrigation wdr which had received 23 4 mm of rainfall since it started to be rain watered 90 das been previously deprived of 143 6 mm of rainfall demonstrated differential spectral response relative to the other three water conditions as observed in the three cropping seasons wdr could be better identified compared to wdv due to its more extended water deficit period table 2 and the consequent impact on the climatic water balance fig 3 accordingly as shown in fig 5 wdv demonstrated a similar yield to nirr while wdr largely impaired yield despite the irrigation performed on irr plots 69 4 mm across the 2016 2017 cropping season and 106 1 mm across the 2018 2019 cropping season this treatment did not present spectral behavior that could lead to its cluster from the other three water conditions considering the explanatory power from the first three principal components on the eleven spectral assessments for soybean water status monitoring fig 8 presents the loading correlation from the pca performed across the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons the results revealed three trends in most of the eleven spectral datasets swir wavelengths were the main contributors to the first principal component nir wavelengths were the major contributors to the second principal component and the vis wavelengths were the predominant contributors to the third principal component in the 2016 2017 cropping season at 112 das fig 8b vis wavelengths showed a higher contribution to pc 2 while nir wavelengths contributed mainly to pc 3 that might be associated with changes in leaf structure and photosynthetically active radiation absorption when plants are about to reach the maturation stages of crop development as highlighted in crusiol et al 2021a in the 2018 2019 cropping season at 41 das fig 8g nir wavelengths demonstrated a higher contribution to pc 1 while swir wavelengths showed a higher contribution to pc 2 on this date 41 das the four water condition treatments were under the same water status since irr irrigation had not happened yet and wdv was still not subjected to water deficit presenting similar soil moisture contents fig 4c 3 3 partial least squares regression for soil moisture prediction by soybean leaf spectral response the results of plsr in the prediction of soil moisture for 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons are in table 5 on all days of spectral assessment one observes higher correlation coefficients r2 at the calibration step and consequently higher values of rmse at the cross validation step the lowest soil moisture prediction accuracies both at 0 20 and 20 40 depths were obtained at 57 das in the 2017 2018 cropping season and 41 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season at 57 das 2017 2018 cropping season the coefficients of determination r2 at 0 20 cm depth were 0 332 calibration and 0 230 cross validation while the values of r2 at 20 40 depth were 0 602 calibration and 0 492 cross validation at 41 das 2018 2019 cropping season the values of r2 at 0 20 cm depths were 0 308 calibration and 0 212 cross validation while the values of r2 at 20 40 depth was 0 006 calibration and presented non significance in the cross validation step the results obtained at the two days 41 and 57 das are related to the low amplitude of soil moisture values fig 9 and to the absence of significant differences among the water condition treatments fig 4 on the other nine assessment days across the three cropping seasons large amplitudes in soil moisture were observed fig 9 and significant differences between the experimental treatments were detected fig 4 hence at 0 20 cm depth the r2 ranged from 0 702 to 0 938 calibration step and from 0 519 to 0 860 cross validation step with soil moisture values ranging from 18 to 35 at 20 40 cm depth the r2 ranged from 0 735 to 0 950 calibration step and from 0 589 to 0 906 cross validation step with soil moisture values ranging from 20 to 35 for developing a soil moisture prediction model based on soybean leaf reflectance at different phenological stages at 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths we analyzed spectral and soil moisture data acquired on the eleven assessment days on the three cropping seasons into the same plsr model fig 10 presents the soil moisture values comprising all the 844 samplings all data and their random division into calibration cross validation subset 80 and external validation subset 20 within each depth the soil moisture values from each dataset demonstrated having a similar distribution when comparing the two evaluated depths it is possible to observe the similarity in their maximum values but with smaller minimum values at 0 20 cm depth table 6 displays the results of the plsr in the prediction of soil moisture comprising spectral data collected in the three evaluated cropping seasons 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at 0 20 cm depth the obtained r2 during the calibration and cross validation steps was over 0 58 and rmse lower than 2 855 at 20 40 cm depth the plsr model showed higher accuracy during the calibration and cross validation steps with r2 over 0 69 and rmse lower than 2 014 fig 11 presents the regression coefficients of the plsr model for soil moisture prediction at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths the shape of the regression coefficients curve from both depths was similar but with larger amplitudes positive and negative peaks observed at 20 40 cm depths at the two evaluated depths though the adequate distribution of plsr coefficients across the spectrum positive and negative sizable peaks were observed across visible wavelengths highly influenced by the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation and across shortwave wavelengths deeply influenced by the leaf water content when applying the generated soil moisture prediction models to external samples external validation a positive correlation was achieved between the observed and predicted values at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths as demonstrated in fig 12 the regression analysis with an intersection passing through the origin y bx revealed at 0 20 depth an adjusted model y 0 9948 x with a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 609 at 20 40 depth the regression analysis with an intersection passing through the origin y bx revealed an adjusted model y 0 9958 x with r2 equal to 0 722 the similar accuracies r2 and rmse within each depth among the calibration cross validation and external validation steps demonstrate the prediction capacity and stability of the plsr models strengthening the possibility of their application to new soybean cropping areas the developed plsr model based on the eleven assessment days and both depths despite the lower accuracy compared to the plsr models intended specifically for each assessment day table 5 comprises the variability from plants at different water statuses and different phenological stages across three cropping seasons with soil moisture values ranging from 16 to 35 0 20 cm depth and from 20 to 35 20 40 cm depth brazil has enormous variability in weather conditions sentelhas et al 2015 and an extended soybean sowing calendar in each region kaster and farias 2012 that fact impairs the spectral assessment of the crop in extensive areas at the same phenological stage a soil moisture prediction model applicable throughout the cropping season would help to improve agricultural practices resulting in better soil moisture management for optimum crop development the contributions of the results from the present manuscript include the possible identification of zones with limitations to the development of the root zone due to soil compaction and consequent lower levels of soil water availability to support crop development during water deficit periods enabling the soil management in specific areas added to that the methodology presented might assist the delimitation of managements zones according to the levels of soil water availability maximizing the potential for crop production in each area and reducing the cost of production although irrigation represents a small percentage of soybean areas in brazil the definition of irrigation schedule in soybean crop might benefit from the soil moisture monitoring through leaf reflectance assessments enlarging the percentage of irrigated soybeans in brazil with sustainable practices promoting the environment preservation and contributing for a larger stability of grain yield during water deficit periods the methodology described in the present research has large potential to be applied in different soil types however the coefficients of the spectral models are expected to be different in each soil type due to its physical chemical characteristics therefore spectral models for crop water status monitoring and soil moisture prediction should be developed specifically for each soil type considering its specific edaphoclimatic characteristics guarantying thus the prediction of values in accordance to the real values observed in field conditions 3 4 performance comparison of partial least squares regression with spectral bands and vegetation indices for soil moisture monitoring following the soil moisture prediction using samplings from the eleven assessment days on the three cropping seasons results from plsr were compared to the results from single wavelength reflectance hyperspectral vegetation index and broadband reflectance and vegetation index to evaluate whether univariate linear regression based on simple spectral models can deliver competitive results fig 13 presents the coefficient of determination r2 from the calibration step using 80 of samples between soil moisture and single wavelengths reflectance a broadband reflectance and vegetation index b and all possible band to band combinations to calculate the hyperspectral vegetation indices c and d eq 2 using single wavelength reflectance across the vis nir swir spectrum fig 13 a the highest correlations were observed across swir wavelengths followed by the vis spectrum and nir spectrum the lowest correlations the outstanding spectral bands were 1965 nm r2 0 335 and 1957 nm r2 0 331 for 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm respectively using broadband reflectance and vegetation indices fig 13 b spectral bands outperformed vegetation indices and the outstanding spectral features were the swir 3 r2 0 219 and swir 2 r2 0 219 the calculated hyperspectral vegetation indices fig 13 c and d displayed a low correlation for vis vis vis nir vis swir and nir nir band combinations with an intermediate correlation for nir swir band combination and the highest correlations for swir swir band combinations the index outperformance was composed of 1878 nm and 2004 nm r2 0 418 at 0 20 cm and by 2065 nm and 2067 nm r2 0 405 fig 14 presents the results from the external validation step spectral models developed during the calibration step applied to the remaining 20 of data using the univariate regression models all strategies using univariate linear regression from a simple spectral model demonstrated to underperform the use of all spectral bands under the partial least squares regression hyperspectral sensors are a potential benchmark for spectral analysis and identification of essential absorption features associated with agronomic traits to be transferred later to multispectral sensors prey and schmidhalter 2019 our results demonstrated that the plsr has higher accuracy r2 over 0 60 than the other methods tested r2 under 0 41 broadband reflectance and vegetation index and hyperspectral vegetation indices according to sakamoto 2020 broadband vegetation indices are usually derived from satellite images to assess their direct relationship to biomass and infer the indirect relationship between biomass and crop traits such as soil moisture since the plsr and univariate models were developed using leaf based reflectance without external interferences solar light atmosphere conditions and canopy background recognized the effect of the development of spectral models liu et al 2015 ma et al 2019 the vegetation indices performed poorly compared to the other models besides that cao et al 2015 have shown that the larger the bandwidth the weaker the correlation with plant water related properties due to spectral information loss mirzaie et al 2014 while hyperspectral vegetation indices avoid losses of spectral information contained in broadband data and have the advantage of detecting spectral features related to vegetation biophysical properties being more suitable than the use of single wavelengths ge et al 2019b shu et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 plsr is an efficient multivariate and machine learning regression method since it deals with multicollinearity usually found in spectral data the model also enables the simultaneous use of hundreds of spectral bands into the same model weighting each one of them according to their contribution as key spectral features to predict the crop trait inoue et al 2012 2017 thus plsr outperformed the broadband reflectance and vegetation indices single wavelength reflectance and hyperspectral vegetation indices for monitoring water related properties in several plant species ullah et al 2014 mirzaie et al 2014 el hendawy et al 2019 ge et al 2019b 4 conclusion this research quantitatively monitored the soil moisture at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths in a soybean field using leaf based hyperspectral reflectance based on the effects of water condition treatments on soybean leaf reflectance the principal component analysis pca contributed to the clustering of the experimental treatments especially when the water deficit is during the soybean reproductive phase the highest contribution of shortwave infrared wavelengths to crop water status monitoring the partial least squares regression plsr demonstrated efficiency for predicting soil moisture admitting the poor performance observed under the absence of significant soil moisture differences between water conditions the plsr models developed using samples from all assessment days across the three cropping seasons presented r2 of 0 607 0 20 cm and 0 690 20 40 cm in the cross validation step and r2 of 0 609 0 20 cm and 0 722 20 40 cm in the external validation step with rmse of 2 7 and 1 9 at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths respectively a remarkable outperformance of the plsr was observed when using the entire soybean leaf spectra vis nir swir in the calibration and external validation steps compared to traditional univariate regression methods single wavelength reflectance hyperspectral vegetation index and broadband reflectance and vegetation index emphasizing the contribution of hyperspectral data in the quantitative monitoring of soil moisture in soybean areas while most publications address soil moisture monitoring based on qualitative and indirect measurements this article demonstrates the potential of developing spectral models capable of quantitatively describing the levels of water availability for plants under field conditions the present methodology enhances the possibility of applying spectral models for soil moisture assessment in extended soybean areas regardless of their stage of development that constitutes a distinguished contribution since in brazil the sowing calendar might present differences of over 30 days within the same production region and rarely with plants at the same phenological stage

9116,the stability of soybean yields in brazil is regularly affected by drought periods and soil management practices are crucial to expanding the water holding capacity of the soil and providing higher levels of moisture during critical periods which contribute to increasing crop yields relieving the need for non agricultural areas to be converted into croplands the research reported herein aimed to quantitatively monitor the soil moisture of a soybean crop through leaf based hyperspectral reflectance and suggest a remote sensing based approach that might assist in identifying soil management zones a field experiment at the brazilian agricultural research corporation during 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons had ten soybean genotypes subjected to four water conditions irrigated non irrigated and water deficit induced at the vegetative or reproductive stages the soil of the experimental site is characterized as udox oxisol leaf reflectance 400 2500 nm was collected by the spectroradiometer fieldspec 3 jr simultaneously with soil moisture 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths at eleven dates data submitted to principal component analysis pca evaluated the clustering of water conditions and which are the most critical spectral wavelengths to characterize the plant water status the partial least squares regression plsr was applied to develop a quantitative spectral model to predict soil moisture the pca explained over 93 of the spectral variance within each assessment day and shortwave infrared wavelengths presented a higher contribution to water status clustering at the cross validation step the plsr presented r2 up to 0 860 and 0 906 0 20 and 20 40 cm underperforming when soil moisture showed no significant differences between water conditions using samples from all assessment days plsr presented r2 0 609 and 0 722 0 20 and 20 40 cm at the external validation step rmse 2 7 and 1 9 respectively with a soil moisture range equal to 16 35 and 20 35 at both depths remarkably outperforming the traditional univariate spectral models our results contribute to soil moisture assessment in extensive soybean areas regardless of the stage of crop development and provide a significant contribution since the brazilian soybean crop calendar might present differences of over 30 days within the same production region due to that soybean plants are rarely at the same phenological stage on a given date in the season keywords drought leaf water content yield principal component analysis partial least squares regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations anon 2018 the world population will exceed 9 billion people by 2050 which requires maximized food production to meet the food demand and assist food security policies concurrently to the agricultural production expansion only sustainable practices adoption shall guarantee environmental preservation anon 2018 hence increasing crop yield is crucial to relieve the need for non agricultural areas to be converted into croplands meet the world food demand and adopt sustainable production standards nepomuceno 2021 brazil is the largest soybean producer responsible for nearly one third 140 million tons anon 2022 of soybeans produced worldwide 372 million tons anon 2022 in the last decades soybean yield in brazil has grown at higher rates compared to the increment of production areas which prevented by the adoption of technologies for soybean production and consequently yield gains millions of ha to be converted into agricultural areas to achieve the same production amount gazzoni and dall agnol 2018 however the yield stability in brazil is regularly affected by unfavorable climatic events especially drought periods although dryness is not observable across the entire soybean cropping season periods of water deficit regularly cause high yield losses compromising over 30 of the brazilian soybean production sentelhas et al 2015 and leading to financial losses of over us 79 billion in 38 years ferreira 2016 irrigated areas in brazil represent a small percentage of the areas devoted to agricultural production specifically only about 2 of the areas devoted to soybean production is irrigated fao 2017 conab 2022 thus considering the need to optimize the use of water resources anon 2018 several strategies to cope with water deficit periods during the soybean cropping season are available including but not limited to the development of soybean cultivars with drought tolerance stolf moreira et al 2011 rolla et al 2014 marinho et al 2016 honna et al 2016 fuganti pagliarini et al 2017 the grouping of soybean production areas based on their edaphoclimatic characteristics indicating more suitable cultivars for each of them kaster and farias 2012 and the agricultural zoning of climatic risk addressing the more favorable sowing periods for each production area to minimize the probability of occurrence of water deficit periods at critical stages of crop development farias et al 2001 in addition do rio et al 2016 have proposed alternative sowing dates based on the future climatic scenarios for soybean production another strategy is the adoption of soil management practices aiming at enlarging the soil water holding capacity providing thus higher levels of water availability to support crop development during water deficit periods however the traditional methods for soil moisture determination are laborious and time consuming requiring the collection of several samples in each production area which impair the soil water status monitoring over large areas in short time intervals in this context remote sensing becomes a proxy for crop water status monitoring delivering accurate fast and spatial information about crop conditions non destructively using remote sensing information peng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 and yuan et al 2019 have reported the relation between soil moisture and soil spectral response however assessing soil moisture via spectral response requires laborious and time consuming field campaigns for in situ samplings therefore most existing methods using remotely sensed data for monitoring soil moisture rely on the indirect and qualitative relation between crop reflectance and soil moisture which in turn bases itself on the direct relationship between reflectance and vegetation water content this relation is a crucial indicator of soil water status kovar et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 many authors demonstrated the relation between reflectance and vegetation water content in several crops including wheat el hendawy et al 2014 feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 maize ge et al 2016 and 2019b zygielbaum et al 2009 cotton yi et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 and soybean kovar et al 2019 braga et al 2021 in soybean braga et al 2021 and wijewardana et al 2019 reported that physiological traits such as photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration internal co2 content leaf water potential and leaf water content are affected by low levels of soil moisture so spectral measurements can be accurately related to crop traits for monitoring crop and soil water status although the many efforts to retrieve crop water status by spectral measurements still lack discussion on the direct and quantitative soil moisture assessment through crop reflectance ge et al 2019a sobrino et al 2012 used an airborne hyperspectral scanner ahs and satellite images to estimate the soil moisture of several crops at distinct crop phenological stages ge et al 2019a assessed soil moisture via uav based hyperspectral image over wheat fields at a single phenological stage and panigrahi and das 2018 modeled soil water potential using ground based hyperspectral measurements over rice fields at multiple phenological stages however models for soil moisture prediction using canopy spectral data might be susceptible to interferences from canopy structure leaf area angle and position shadow and background liu et al 2015 ma et al 2019 imposing limitations on acquisition of the quantitative relation between soil moisture and leaf reflectance and the extendibility of the developed models to new agricultural areas moreover considering the soybean sowing calendar in brazil which might extend over more than one month within the same production area crusiol et al 2021b it is highly desirable that spectral models accurately predict soil moisture regardless of crop phenological development based on the current progress this research aims at monitoring the soil moisture quantitatively at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths using leaf based hyperspectral reflectance to support a soil water holding capacity enlargement through a more precise delimitation of soil management practices in a soybean crop the specific goals are to assess the sensitive spectral bands for soybean water status monitoring develop soil moisture prediction models at different stages of crop development and develop soil moisture prediction models regardless of the soybean crop stage of development 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment fig 1 in a split plot model in a randomized complete block design with four blocks was undertaken on the experimental farm of the national soybean research center embrapa soja a branch of the brazilian agricultural research corporation located in londrina municipality paran√° state southern brazil 23 11 37 s 51 11 03 w 630 m above sea level in the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons following the soybean production technologies embrapa soja 2013 the soil of the experimental site table 1 is characterized as udox oxisol anon 1999 with 75 mm of water holding capacity with the following characteristics soil analysis in march 2016 according to the k√∂ppen climate classification the experimental site is in a cfa climate i e subtropical climate with a mean temperature in the hottest month higher than 22 ¬∫c and rainfall concentrated in the summer months with no defined dry season wrege et al 2012 alvares et al 2013 considering the soybean calendar in central and south brazil the largest soybean producers the rainy season corresponds to the periods of soybean production but not without water deficit periods the field plots received four water condition treatments irrigated irr receiving rainfall and irrigation when necessary with a soil water matric potential between 0 03 and 0 05 mpa non irrigated nirr receiving only rainfall water deficit induced at the vegetative stages wdv water deficit induced at reproductive stages wdr and ten soybean genotypes with drought tolerance genes and different responses to water deficit were distributed in the subplots genotypes 1ea15 2ha11 2ia4 br16 and brs 184 in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons and genotypes 1ea2939 3ma2 brs 283 brt18 0089 and brt18 0201 in 2018 2019 cropping season automated rainout shelters kept wdv and wdr subplots free from receiving rainfalls higher than 0 1 mm in the vegetative and reproductive phases respectively and imposed the water deficit treatments and increased the soil gravimetric humidity variability across treatments shelters automatically uncovered plants once rainfalls had ceased the plots had in their perimeter vertical concrete barriers buried up to 90 cm depth to prevent water lateral movement from outside into the plot soil during the period in which wdv plots were deprived of rainfalls wdr was under natural water availability conditions from the flowering period to full maturity harvesting the wdr treatment was deprived of natural rainfall and wdv plots began to be rain watered under natural water availability conditions thus water deficit periods could be simulated both in the vegetative and reproductive stages of development drip irrigation was performed using groundwater from artesian well and kept in a water tank table 2 displays the sowing dates and periods of water deficit inducement in the vegetative and reproductive periods table 3 presents the irrigation schedule performed in the 2016 2017 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons the irrigation volume needed to keep the soil water matric potential between 0 03 and 0 05 mpa was determined by the soil moisture 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths on irr plots daily monitored by tensiometers installed on each block in the 2017 2018 cropping season there was no need for irrigation and therefore plants of irr and nirr treatments were under the same experimental conditions in the 2016 2017 cropping season irr plots received 69 4 mm of irrigation between november 11 and 25 in the 2018 2019 cropping season irr plots received irrigation during two periods between december 6 and 20 2018 63 mm and between january 29 and february 11 2018 43 1 mm in a total of 106 1 mm in all plots soil moisture 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths was monitored by gravimetric analysis on eleven dates across the three cropping seasons as described in table 4 in all plots at 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths soil samples were collected using a dutch auger and immediately placed in hermetic aluminum boxes weighted and placed in the oven at 105 for 48 h to reach constant weight the growth stages of the soybean plants were weekly monitored from emergence to maturation according to fehr and caviness 1977 and grain yield was calculated and corrected for 13 grain moisture according to eq 1 eq 1 gy 100 hgm 100 dgm hgw 10 000 hpa in which gy is the grain

grain moisture meter gehaka inc weather data air temperature relative air humidity and rainfall were monitored by the weather station located within the experimental area the calculation of the climatic water balance was according to thornthwaite and mather 1955 for each experimental treatment of each cropping season additional information on the weather monitoring of the experiment is available at sibaldelli and farias 2017 2018 2019 2 2 spectral data acquisition and processing soybean leaf reflectance data was collected by the fieldspec 3 jr spectroradiometer analytical spectral devices boulder co usa with a spectral resolution of 3 nm between 350 and 1400 nm and 30 nm resolution between 1400 and 2500 nm the output spectra are given in single bands of 1 nm intervals and 2151 spectral bands fig 2 each spectral reading was averaged from 20 internal automatic spectral readings preventing the occurrence of noise in the obtained data the plant probe device connected to the fieldspec by a one meter bare fiber fig 2b was used during the leaf reflectance spectral assessment to prevent illumination interferences of adjacent targets and to ensure pure leaf reflectance spectra collection without noises scattering or attenuations from the interaction between electromagnetic energy and atmospheric water vapor also we used an internal 99 reflectance board spectralon as the reflectance standard and a 1 reflectance blackboard as the opaque one the use of the plant probe device does not require the application of spectral filters for noise removal and data smoothness streher et al 2020 the acquisition of the reflectance spectra data was on the central leaflet of the fullest expanded third trifoliate leaf from the top leaf reflectance spectra were collected from four plants and then averaged to minimize spectral variability within the same subplot resulting in the values used for data processing and statistical analysis the spectral assessment days coincided with the soil moisture assessment table 4 except for december 15 2016 when the soil moisture was assessed on the day after december 16 2016 even though neither irrigation nor rainfall occurred on those dates a total of 3376 leaf reflectance data were collected resulting in 844 spectral samples at 11 days of spectral assessment across the three cropping seasons the collected leaf reflectance spectra were analyzed within each day of spectral assessment by the hyperspectral reflectance between 400 nm and 2500 nm wavelengths between 350 and 399 nm stayed out of the spectral analysis because of the frequent noises observed during vegetation analysis in this spectral interval peng et al 2018 furlanetto et al 2021 2 3 statistical analysis upon meeting the assumptions of the analysis of variance anova we submitted soil moisture data of the eleven assessments on the three cropping seasons and grain yield data from each cropping season to anova and compared means by the tukey test p 0 05 using the software sisvar ferreira 2011 we used two statistical approaches to monitor the soybean water status and predict soil moisture the principal component analysis pca explored the qualitative differences in soybean leaf spectral response to investigate the possibility of clustering the water condition treatments the use of partial least squares regression plsr was to develop soil moisture prediction models by the soybean leaf based hyperspectral reflectance both pca and plsr were performable by the unscrambler camo software norway 2 3 1 principal component analysis pca we applied the principal component analysis to the soybean leaf based hyperspectral reflectance data within each assessment day table 4 to assess the explained variance from leaf based reflectance and to evaluate whether the clustering of water conditions is possible the pca is a data mining method that transforms the full reflectance spectrum into a new group of variables principal components pc using a matrix of covariances composed of all wavelengths most of the information on data variance resides in the first principal component pc1 the second principal component carries the residual information of pc1 the third principal component carries the residual information of pc1 and pc2 pc1 pc2 and so on jolliffe and cadima 2016 furlanetto et al 2021 the pc can be defined as the linear combination of all wavelengths to explain their variance within the dataset the percentage of explained variance can be assessed by each pc s score while the contribution of each wavelength to each pc can be assessed by the loading correlation expressed in r 2 3 2 partial least squares regression plsr the partial least squares regression is a multivariate statistical analysis method widely used when the number of predictor variables e g wavelengths is larger than the number of response variables e g soil moisture and has the advantage of overcoming the multicollinearity of independent variables often observed in hyperspectral data zhou et al 2019 based on a new dataset of latent variables or plsr factors or orthogonal base vectors that account for most of the variation in a trait variable the spectral data matrix x is correlated to the soil moisture matrix y using a linear model composed by wavelength scaling coefficients derived from the full spectrum data yendrek et al 2017 the number of plsr factors a critical process in the plsr deeply affecting its prediction capacity streher et al 2020 was set based on the lowest value of root mean square error rmse highest coefficient of determination r2 and value of bias close to zero through the leave one out cross validation method souza et al 2013 on each spectral dataset we normalized the reflectance spectra by subtracting the mean reflectance from the actual reflectance at each wavelength enabling the comparison among the fitted wavelength scaling coefficients outliers and homogeneity of the spectral data assessment were by the leverage and hotelling s t2 tests in the first stage we used plsr to develop soil moisture prediction models at both 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths by the soybean leaf based hyperspectral reflectance within each assessment day table 4 in the second stage we evaluated the possibility of developing a soil moisture prediction model based on soybean leaf reflectance at different phenological stages to do so plsr models for soil moisture prediction at both 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths were developed using all the 844 samples leaf reflectance and soil moisture acquired on the eleven assessment days on the three cropping seasons this randomly divided dataset had two subsets calibration cross validation steps containing 80 of data 669 samples and external validation with the remaining 20 of the data 175 samples each developed plsr model had its accuracy assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the systematic error bias in the calibration and cross validation using the leave one out cross validation method steps in the second stage plsr models developed using 80 of samples and tested over the remaining 20 of samples external validation were assessed by the r2 and rmse between predicted and observed soil moisture values at both depths 0 20 and 20 40 cm 2 3 3 comparison of plsr performance with traditional univariate spectral models we used three approaches to investigate whether traditional univariate spectral models might deliver competitive results compared to the plsr using spectral and soil moisture data from all assessment days from the three cropping seasons we performed tests using the calibration dataset containing 80 of data 669 samples of soil moisture values 0 20 and 20 40 cm to check their correlation to a reflectance from each one of the 2101 single wavelengths b reflectance resampled to broad multispectral bands anon 2021 supplementary table 1 and derived vegetation

vegetation index and hyperspectral vegetation index were then applied to the remaining 20 of samples external validation dataset and the accuracy was assessed by the r2 and rmse between the predicted and observed values of soil moisture at both depths 0 20 and 20 40 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of experimental treatments on climatic water balance soil moisture and grain yield fig 3 presents the climatic water balance calculated according to thornthwaite and mather 1955 for each experimental treatment of each cropping season the efficiency of the experimental treatments in simulating water deficit periods at the vegetative and reproductive stages of plant development are in fig 3 a e i at december 1 and 2 10 day periods and fig 3 b f j at december 3 and january 1 2 and 3 10 day periods respectively in the three cropping seasons higher deficits can be observable in wdr plants in contrast to wdv most likely because of the more extended water withholding period to which plants were submitted in the 2016 2017 cropping season the irrigation performed on irr plots provided good water availability conditions during november 3 and december 1 10 days periods fig 3d in the 2018 2019 cropping season it is possible to observe severe natural water deficit periods during both vegetative and reproductive phases fig 3k and the irrigated treatment promoted good conditions of water availability during december 1 2 and 3 january 2 and february 2 10 days periods fig 3l fig 4 presents the soil moisture in the eleven assessment days across the three evaluated cropping seasons on all assessment days but at 57 das in the 2017 2018 cropping season and 41 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season the experimental treatments produced differences in soil gravimetric humidity at both depths 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm considering the dates of water deficit inducement and the irrigation schedule tables 2 and 3 the differences among treatments follow the water availability provided by the treatments at 41 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season the differences between treatments were undetectable since irr plots had not received irrigation until that day and the water deficit in the wdv treatment was not present yet the effects of differential water availability on soybean yields in the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons are in fig 5 the effectiveness of the experimental treatments in promoting differential water availability levels to plants is demonstrated by the intense decreases in yield of wdr treatment especially during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons when its attained productivity was less than half of the other treatments although wdv plants were under water scarcity they revealed similar yield compared to the non irrigated treatment and higher yield compared to the wdr treatment reinforcing that the water deficit during the reproductive stages of plant development is more harmful to yield rolla et al 2014 also reported the similar grain yield of soybean plants subjected to water withholding at vegetative stages and plants under natural rainfall or irrigation in the 2016 2017 cropping season a severe natural water deficit was not observed fig 3c and the 69 6 mm of irrigation on irr plots received between 24 and 38 das did not increased yields however when severe natural water deficit occurred across both vegetative and reproductive stages as it occurred in the 2018 2019 cropping season fig 3k the irrigated treatment revealed higher grain yields compared to plants receiving only natural rainfall 3 2 principal component analysis of soybean leaf spectral response we submitted the collected leaf based hyperspectral data to principal component analysis to explore the qualitative spectral differences among the experimental treatments the spectral response of soybean genotypes evaluated at 87 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season under maximum and minimum soil moisture content at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths is presented in fig 6 at both depths it is possible to observe differences in the soybean spectral response across wavelengths with higher reflectance from plants under lower soil moisture agreeing with damm et al 2018 which described the interference of plant water status in crop spectra the most conspicuous changes in reflectance due to changes in plant water status were observed across the shortwave infrared spectrum however it is worth mentioning that the differences in spectral responses of soybean plants under different levels of water availability are not the same across the wavelengths due to leaf biochemical properties and structure maimaitiyiming et al 2016 falcioni et al 2020 the differential effects of the crop water status on the interaction between electromagnetic energy and soybean leaves across wavelengths can be considered primary or secondary the primary effects are directly related to the absorption of radiation by water imposing a strong influence over shortwave infrared swir wavelengths the secondary effects cannot be explained solely by the water absorption of radiation but also by its indirect relation to the leaf structure and physiology imposing a substantial influence over visible and near infrared wavelengths carter 1991 el hendawy et al 2019 visible wavelengths between 400 nm and 720 nm are associated with the leaf pigments and the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation and under water stress there is lower light absorption leading to higher values of reflectance carter 1991 singer et al 2011 gitelson et al 2015 gitelson 2019 near infrared wavelengths between 720 and 1300 nm relate to the light scattering along the mesophyll under the influence of internal leaf structures such as cell wall width intercellular air spaces and the amount of mesophyll per unit of leaf area inside the mesophyll carter 1991 liu et al 2016 2020 hence changes in crop water status might lead to changes in the internal scattering of the incident light resulting in higher light absorption and lower reflectance from plants under higher levels of water content between 1300 nm and 2500 nm the swir spectrum demonstrated to be more affected by changes in soil moisture presenting higher values of reflectance under lower levels of water content this spectral interval is closely related to leaf water content one of the critical parameters for establishing the crop water status gao 1996 wang and qu 2007 2021 considering the effects of water availability on leaf reflectance fig 7 presents the results from principal component analysis for each assessment day table 4 demonstrating the possibility of clustering the water condition treatments for all the eleven evaluation dates across the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons the first pc pc 1 explained over 44 of the spectral variance within each dataset and the cumulative percentage of pc 1 and pc 2 demonstrated to be over 82 the cumulative results from pc1 pc 2 and pc 3 revealed over 93 of the explained variance within each dataset in the 2016 2017 cropping season the scatterplot from pc 1 and pc 2 at 58 das fig 7a showed a similar distribution of the four water condition treatments by this day the irr plots had been receiving 69 4 mm irrigation and the wdv deprived of 123 8 mm rainfall until flowering 55 das receiving 3 8 mm within three days before the spectral assessment at 112 das wdr had been deprived of 407 4 mm rainfall since flowering 55 das leading to its distinct spectral response as demonstrated by fig 7 b on this day the three other water condition treatments showed similar responses in the 2017 2018 cropping season when wdv had been deprived of 71 4 mm rainfall the scatterplot from pc 1 and pc 2 at 57 das demonstrated similar distribution among the four water condition treatments fig 7c however as observed in the previous cropping season the wdr plots subjected to water scarcity presented a distinct response from the other treatments at 96 106 and 112 das fig 7d e f as for these three assessment dates the wdr plots had been deprived of 507 9 mm rainfall until 96 das and 562 7 mm until 106 and 112 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season the four water condition treatments demonstrated similar distribution at 41 das when wdv plots had not received the water deficit treatment yet and the irr plots had not been irrigated still fig 7g at 57 das fig 7h the four treatments demonstrated similar responses regardless of the irrigation performed on irr 40 3 mm and the low amount of rain 1 4 mm prevented to fall on wdv as seen in the previous two cropping seasons the water shortage in wdr is better identifiable by its leaf reflectance analyzed through pca at 87 das fig 7i despite the irrigation received 63 mm the irr could not be clearly identified in the scatterplot between pc 1 and pc 2 notwithstanding the wdr deprived of 137 4 mm of rainfall could be undoubtedly clustered from the others at 101 das fig 7j wdr had been deprived of 143 6 mm of rainwater until 90 das when this treatment started to be rain watered received 19 8 mm of rainfall since then which affected the spectral response from this treatment and led to its clustering concerning the other three water conditions at 107 das fig 7k irr could not be clustered out from the other three treatments although it had received 70 2 mm of total irrigation wdr which had received 23 4 mm of rainfall since it started to be rain watered 90 das been previously deprived of 143 6 mm of rainfall demonstrated differential spectral response relative to the other three water conditions as observed in the three cropping seasons wdr could be better identified compared to wdv due to its more extended water deficit period table 2 and the consequent impact on the climatic water balance fig 3 accordingly as shown in fig 5 wdv demonstrated a similar yield to nirr while wdr largely impaired yield despite the irrigation performed on irr plots 69 4 mm across the 2016 2017 cropping season and 106 1 mm across the 2018 2019 cropping season this treatment did not present spectral behavior that could lead to its cluster from the other three water conditions considering the explanatory power from the first three principal components on the eleven spectral assessments for soybean water status monitoring fig 8 presents the loading correlation from the pca performed across the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons the results revealed three trends in most of the eleven spectral datasets swir wavelengths were the main contributors to the first principal component nir wavelengths were the major contributors to the second principal component and the vis wavelengths were the predominant contributors to the third principal component in the 2016 2017 cropping season at 112 das fig 8b vis wavelengths showed a higher contribution to pc 2 while nir wavelengths contributed mainly to pc 3 that might be associated with changes in leaf structure and photosynthetically active radiation absorption when plants are about to reach the maturation stages of crop development as highlighted in crusiol et al 2021a in the 2018 2019 cropping season at 41 das fig 8g nir wavelengths demonstrated a higher contribution to pc 1 while swir wavelengths showed a higher contribution to pc 2 on this date 41 das the four water condition treatments were under the same water status since irr irrigation had not happened yet and wdv was still not subjected to water deficit presenting similar soil moisture contents fig 4c 3 3 partial least squares regression for soil moisture prediction by soybean leaf spectral response the results of plsr in the prediction of soil moisture for 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 cropping seasons are in table 5 on all days of spectral assessment one observes higher correlation coefficients r2 at the calibration step and consequently higher values of rmse at the cross validation step the lowest soil moisture prediction accuracies both at 0 20 and 20 40 depths were obtained at 57 das in the 2017 2018 cropping season and 41 das in the 2018 2019 cropping season at 57 das 2017 2018 cropping season the coefficients of determination r2 at 0 20 cm depth were 0 332 calibration and 0 230 cross validation while the values of r2 at 20 40 depth were 0 602 calibration and 0 492 cross validation at 41 das 2018 2019 cropping season the values of r2 at 0 20 cm depths were 0 308 calibration and 0 212 cross validation while the values of r2 at 20 40 depth was 0 006 calibration and presented non significance in the cross validation step the results obtained at the two days 41 and 57 das are related to the low amplitude of soil moisture values fig 9 and to the absence of significant differences among the water condition treatments fig 4 on the other nine assessment days across the three cropping seasons large amplitudes in soil moisture were observed fig 9 and significant differences between the experimental treatments were detected fig 4 hence at 0 20 cm depth the r2 ranged from 0 702 to 0 938 calibration step and from 0 519 to 0 860 cross validation step with soil moisture values ranging from 18 to 35 at 20 40 cm depth the r2 ranged from 0 735 to 0 950 calibration step and from 0 589 to 0 906 cross validation step with soil moisture values ranging from 20 to 35 for developing a soil moisture prediction model based on soybean leaf reflectance at different phenological stages at 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths we analyzed spectral and soil moisture data acquired on the eleven assessment days on the three cropping seasons into the same plsr model fig 10 presents the soil moisture values comprising all the 844 samplings all data and their random division into calibration cross validation subset 80 and external validation subset 20 within each depth the soil moisture values from each dataset demonstrated having a similar distribution when comparing the two evaluated depths it is possible to observe the similarity in their maximum values but with smaller minimum values at 0 20 cm depth table 6 displays the results of the plsr in the prediction of soil moisture comprising spectral data collected in the three evaluated cropping seasons 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at 0 20 cm depth the obtained r2 during the calibration and cross validation steps was over 0 58 and rmse lower than 2 855 at 20 40 cm depth the plsr model showed higher accuracy during the calibration and cross validation steps with r2 over 0 69 and rmse lower than 2 014 fig 11 presents the regression coefficients of the plsr model for soil moisture prediction at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths the shape of the regression coefficients curve from both depths was similar but with larger amplitudes positive and negative peaks observed at 20 40 cm depths at the two evaluated depths though the adequate distribution of plsr coefficients across the spectrum positive and negative sizable peaks were observed across visible wavelengths highly influenced by the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation and across shortwave wavelengths deeply influenced by the leaf water content when applying the generated soil moisture prediction models to external samples external validation a positive correlation was achieved between the observed and predicted values at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths as demonstrated in fig 12 the regression analysis with an intersection passing through the origin y bx revealed at 0 20 depth an adjusted model y 0 9948 x with a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 609 at 20 40 depth the regression analysis with an intersection passing through the origin y bx revealed an adjusted model y 0 9958 x with r2 equal to 0 722 the similar accuracies r2 and rmse within each depth among the calibration cross validation and external validation steps demonstrate the prediction capacity and stability of the plsr models strengthening the possibility of their application to new soybean cropping areas the developed plsr model based on the eleven assessment days and both depths despite the lower accuracy compared to the plsr models intended specifically for each assessment day table 5 comprises the variability from plants at different water statuses and different phenological stages across three cropping seasons with soil moisture values ranging from 16 to 35 0 20 cm depth and from 20 to 35 20 40 cm depth brazil has enormous variability in weather conditions sentelhas et al 2015 and an extended soybean sowing calendar in each region kaster and farias 2012 that fact impairs the spectral assessment of the crop in extensive areas at the same phenological stage a soil moisture prediction model applicable throughout the cropping season would help to improve agricultural practices resulting in better soil moisture management for optimum crop development the contributions of the results from the present manuscript include the possible identification of zones with limitations to the development of the root zone due to soil compaction and consequent lower levels of soil water availability to support crop development during water deficit periods enabling the soil management in specific areas added to that the methodology presented might assist the delimitation of managements zones according to the levels of soil water availability maximizing the potential for crop production in each area and reducing the cost of production although irrigation represents a small percentage of soybean areas in brazil the definition of irrigation schedule in soybean crop might benefit from the soil moisture monitoring through leaf reflectance assessments enlarging the percentage of irrigated soybeans in brazil with sustainable practices promoting the environment preservation and contributing for a larger stability of grain yield during water deficit periods the methodology described in the present research has large potential to be applied in different soil types however the coefficients of the spectral models are expected to be different in each soil type due to its physical chemical characteristics therefore spectral models for crop water status monitoring and soil moisture prediction should be developed specifically for each soil type considering its specific edaphoclimatic characteristics guarantying thus the prediction of values in accordance to the real values observed in field conditions 3 4 performance comparison of partial least squares regression with spectral bands and vegetation indices for soil moisture monitoring following the soil moisture prediction using samplings from the eleven assessment days on the three cropping seasons results from plsr were compared to the results from single wavelength reflectance hyperspectral vegetation index and broadband reflectance and vegetation index to evaluate whether univariate linear regression based on simple spectral models can deliver competitive results fig 13 presents the coefficient of determination r2 from the calibration step using 80 of samples between soil moisture and single wavelengths reflectance a broadband reflectance and vegetation index b and all possible band to band combinations to calculate the hyperspectral vegetation indices c and d eq 2 using single wavelength reflectance across the vis nir swir spectrum fig 13 a the highest correlations were observed across swir wavelengths followed by the vis spectrum and nir spectrum the lowest correlations the outstanding spectral bands were 1965 nm r2 0 335 and 1957 nm r2 0 331 for 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm respectively using broadband reflectance and vegetation indices fig 13 b spectral bands outperformed vegetation indices and the outstanding spectral features were the swir 3 r2 0 219 and swir 2 r2 0 219 the calculated hyperspectral vegetation indices fig 13 c and d displayed a low correlation for vis vis vis nir vis swir and nir nir band combinations with an intermediate correlation for nir swir band combination and the highest correlations for swir swir band combinations the index outperformance was composed of 1878 nm and 2004 nm r2 0 418 at 0 20 cm and by 2065 nm and 2067 nm r2 0 405 fig 14 presents the results from the external validation step spectral models developed during the calibration step applied to the remaining 20 of data using the univariate regression models all strategies using univariate linear regression from a simple spectral model demonstrated to underperform the use of all spectral bands under the partial least squares regression hyperspectral sensors are a potential benchmark for spectral analysis and identification of essential absorption features associated with agronomic traits to be transferred later to multispectral sensors prey and schmidhalter 2019 our results demonstrated that the plsr has higher accuracy r2 over 0 60 than the other methods tested r2 under 0 41 broadband reflectance and vegetation index and hyperspectral vegetation indices according to sakamoto 2020 broadband vegetation indices are usually derived from satellite images to assess their direct relationship to biomass and infer the indirect relationship between biomass and crop traits such as soil moisture since the plsr and univariate models were developed using leaf based reflectance without external interferences solar light atmosphere conditions and canopy background recognized the effect of the development of spectral models liu et al 2015 ma et al 2019 the vegetation indices performed poorly compared to the other models besides that cao et al 2015 have shown that the larger the bandwidth the weaker the correlation with plant water related properties due to spectral information loss mirzaie et al 2014 while hyperspectral vegetation indices avoid losses of spectral information contained in broadband data and have the advantage of detecting spectral features related to vegetation biophysical properties being more suitable than the use of single wavelengths ge et al 2019b shu et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 plsr is an efficient multivariate and machine learning regression method since it deals with multicollinearity usually found in spectral data the model also enables the simultaneous use of hundreds of spectral bands into the same model weighting each one of them according to their contribution as key spectral features to predict the crop trait inoue et al 2012 2017 thus plsr outperformed the broadband reflectance and vegetation indices single wavelength reflectance and hyperspectral vegetation indices for monitoring water related properties in several plant species ullah et al 2014 mirzaie et al 2014 el hendawy et al 2019 ge et al 2019b 4 conclusion this research quantitatively monitored the soil moisture at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths in a soybean field using leaf based hyperspectral reflectance based on the effects of water condition treatments on soybean leaf reflectance the principal component analysis pca contributed to the clustering of the experimental treatments especially when the water deficit is during the soybean reproductive phase the highest contribution of shortwave infrared wavelengths to crop water status monitoring the partial least squares regression plsr demonstrated efficiency for predicting soil moisture admitting the poor performance observed under the absence of significant soil moisture differences between water conditions the plsr models developed using samples from all assessment days across the three cropping seasons presented r2 of 0 607 0 20 cm and 0 690 20 40 cm in the cross validation step and r2 of 0 609 0 20 cm and 0 722 20 40 cm in the external validation step with rmse of 2 7 and 1 9 at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths respectively a remarkable outperformance of the plsr was observed when using the entire soybean leaf spectra vis nir swir in the calibration and external validation steps compared to traditional univariate regression methods single wavelength reflectance hyperspectral vegetation index and broadband reflectance and vegetation index emphasizing the contribution of hyperspectral data in the quantitative monitoring of soil moisture in soybean areas while most publications address soil moisture monitoring based on qualitative and indirect measurements this article demonstrates the potential of developing spectral models capable of quantitatively describing the levels of water availability for plants under field conditions the present methodology enhances the possibility of applying spectral models for soil moisture assessment in extended soybean areas regardless of their stage of development that constitutes a distinguished contribution since in brazil the sowing calendar might present differences of over 30 days within the same production region and rarely with plants at the same phenological stage

9117,through the stomata of plants water h2o and carbon dioxide co2 are transferred between leaves and the atmosphere the intakes of co2 during photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration are facilitated by stomata to effectively model plant transpiration and study the mass energy transfer between plants and the atmosphere stomatal conductance of plant leaves requires accurate modelling abnormal changes in soil moisture result from frequent droughts in water strapped environmental regions in a warming context this has an impact on the stomatal conductance models s applicability and in turn the precision of the carbon and water cycles in agro ecosystems four commonly used stomatal conductance models jarvis ball woodrow berry bwb ball berry leuning bbl and unified stomatal optimization os were investigated in the simulation of spring maize during persistent water stress to determine the impact of introducing a soil moisture response function on the simulation effect of the stomatal conductance model the results showed that the bwb model was the best model for spring maize during persistent water stress followed by the os and bbl models and the jarvis model was the worst model the os and bbl models simulation effects were improved by the addition of the soil moisture response function while the jarvis and bwb models simulation effects were diminished the os Œ∏ model was the best followed by the bbl Œ∏ and bwb Œ∏ models and the jarvis Œ∏ model was the worst according to the model simulation effect the 95 confidence intervals of bwb Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were simulated with the addition of the soil moisture response function the addition of soil moisture function improved the model s applicability allowing it to be used for a variety of relative soil moisture contents including 13 68 13 89 13 78 and 13 89 forthe jarvis bwb bbl and uso models with or without the addition of a moisture response function the os model performs optimally and is appropriate for various soil moisture conditions the study s finding may serve as a foundation for choosing an appropriate stomatal conductance model for effective simulation of carbon and water cycles of agricultural ecosystems under drought conditions in water limited environmental regions this may support effective use and evaluation of agricultural water resources keywords water resources

channel for carbon and water exchange between vegetation and atmosphere which affects plant productivity levels and water use efficiency itis an important regulation channel for mass and energy exchange along the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac wu et al 2007 stomatal conductance plays an important role in regulating the water balance between plants and external environment yin et al 2009 which in turn affects vegetation physiological functions such as transpiration and photosynthesis warren et al 2006 stomatal conductance is the main factor influencing photosynthesis respiration and transpiration of plants however environmental factors like temperature soil humidity solar radiation and water vapor pressure deficit primarily affect the stomatal conductance of vegetation the environmental conditions in which it is found determine how frequently stomatal conductance changes serving as an equilibrium regulator leuning 1995 vegetation balances optimizes the relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration rates by regulating stomatal conductance the movement of stomata reflects to some extent the metabolism in plants and stomatal sensitivity is an important drought resistant feature of plants zhang and gao 1998 zhang et al 2021 stomatal conductance modeling is currently the most effective and applicable approach due to the complicated mechanism of stomatal response to the environment and the heavy work load of human observation the commonly used stomatal conductance models include empirical models based on the statistical relationship between stomatal conductance and environmental factors jarvis 1976 lange et al 1997 monteith 2010 jones 1992 the semi empirical models based on the linear relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis ball et al 1987 leuning 1995 tuzet et al 2003 misson et al 2004 and mechanistic models based on the theory of optimal stomatal behavior and the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic parameters and environmental factors medlyn et al 2011 dewar 2002 as a frequently used global climate model stomatal conductance models bonan et al 2014 de kauwe et al 2015 are used to simulate the response of stomata to environmental factors in specific plants wheat rice and maize wang et al 2012 wei et al 2013 ji et al 2017 gao et al 2016a yu et al 2001 luo et al 2016 and investigate grassland and wetland ecosystems wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2006 plant characteristics experimental setting environmental variables and temporal and spatial scale affect stomatal conductance simulation accuracy gao et al 2016b when simulating data over a long period and with significant changes in soil water the stomatal conductance model performs poorly wang et al 2018a when simulating the effects of drought it is challenging to prepare the stomatal conductance model to reflect the level of water deficit the range of applicability is derived from the accurate simulation of the impact of soil moisture change by the stomatal conductance model studying the physiological traits of crops during droughts and promoting the effective use of agricultural water resources depend greatly on it global warming is making droughts more frequent and more intense which has led to an increase in drought prone areas all over the world the primary factor currently limiting crop growth is drought which has a seriously negative impact on crop growth and yield yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2008a the world s carbon and water cycles were impacted wang et al 2018a to understand how crop ecosystems respond and adapt climate change as well as to forecast the carbon water cycle between crops and the atmosphere in the context of future climate change it is critical to accurately model the stomatal behavior of crops during progressive water stress maize is one of the world s most important cereal and food crop and plays an important role in ensuring global food security according to eurostat 2019 areas that are arid semi arid and semi humid zones collectively referred to as drylands account for about 50 of the world s land area with 2 43 million km2 of that land area found in the arid and semi arid zones of china these areas are water limited environmental zones and one of the main maize production areas in china huang et al 2012 li et al 2004 qi et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 with about 30 of the country s agricultural and chen et al 2021 however the region has a long history of drought and low rainfall dry air and high evaporation and water deficiency limiting maize production zhang et al 2012 lin et al 2012 zhao et al 2008 the core of the drought resistance mechanism in plants is the regulation of water relations in which the stomatal movement plays a key regulatory role liu et al 2011 wang et al 2013 accurately modeling the stomatal behavior of spring maize under extreme drought conditions is important for the response mechanisms of drought in water limited environmental zones in this study spring maize at the seven leaf stage in 2017 and at the jointing stage in 2021 were subjected to water stress pot experiment in the water limited environment experiments were used to gather observation data on gas exchange parameters during the spring maize water stress during persistent water stress the adaptability of four stomatal conductance models were investigated the performance of the stomatal conductance model was examined after the addition of the soil moisture response function for each of the four stomatal conductance models the range of soil moisture adaptation were identified the study will investigate the four stomatal conductance models range of adaptation to soil moisture assess their applicability in face of extreme drought and offer technical support for crop drought monitoring and early warning this may support effective use and evaluation of agricultural water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design and environmental conditions the experiment was carried out in 2017 and 2021 at dingxi arid meteorology and ecological environment station of china meteorological administration in dingxi city gansu province 104 37 e 35 35 n 1896 7 m fig 1 the experimental station is located in the semi arid rain fed agricultural region of the loess plateau a typical water resource limitation environmental zone in china it has a typical temperate semi arid climate with an annual average temperature of 6 7 annual sunshine hours of 2433 0 h and annual total solar radiation of 5923 8 mj m 2 the annual precipitation in this region is 386 mm unevenly distributed and primarily occurs between may to october and accounts for more than 80 of annual precipitation the soil at the experiment site is a loess

zone is about 8 13 chen et al 2022 the soil has loose texture poor water and fertilizer retention capacity and is susceptible to drought the pot experiment of spring maize was conducted in 2017 and 2021 spring maize was cultivated outdoors in pots 29 cm diameter 45 cm height the test soil was loessal soil with 9 8 12 0 g kg 1 organic matter and the soil profile is composed of an arable layer and a loess parent layer the soil was fetched from the field at a depth ranging from 0 to 30 cm 14 kg of dry soil for each pot the average soil bulk density field capacity and wilting point of the soil used in the pots were 1 15 g cm 3 26 8 cm3 cm3 and 5 8 cm3 cm3 respectively the spring maize variety used was chengdan20 a mid late maturity hybrid with good lodging and disease resistance the spring sowing growth period was about 123 days the average yield was 11 994 0 kg hm 2 spring maize was sown on 18 june 2017 and 11 may 2021 respectively in each pot a quantity of 4 seeds was evenly sown at a depth of about 3 cm we established two treatments well water ck and water stress ws each treatment had 10 pots the same amount of water was used to irrigate the two treatments up until the beginning of the seven leaf stage in 2017 and the jointing stage in 2021 respectively following that the two treatments received full field irrigation the ck treatment was irrigated to field capacity when its soil water content reached 70 of the field capacity while the ws treatment was not irrigated until the crops wilted and died every day the two treatments were observed they were automatically or manually protected from the rain by an electric canopy or plastic sheet 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 soil moisture content measurement for various water treatments using the weighing method the weight of each pot was measured every day with an electronic scale with a minimum weight of 1 g mt301b meilen shenzhen china the weight of each pot was subtracted from the total weight of the dry soil empty pot and fresh plant material to determine the soil water content the mass of the fresh plant material was measured at the end of soil drying while the plant was wilting due to rapid soil drying the amount of plant material in each pot changed very little every day length at seven days the soil water content Œ∏ was calculated using the following formula 1 Œ∏ w c w d w d 100 soil relative

exchange parameters the observation of leaf gas exchange parameters was carried out from 9 00 am to 11 30 am on a sunny and cloudless day and each measurement was repeated three times to obtain the leaf gas exchange parameters the co2 response curve for each treatment with three replicates under the daily soil water conditions was measured from 9 00 am to11 30 am the portable gas exchange system li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa measured photosynthetic parameters and co2 response curves during plant gas exchange the co2 response curve of the top first unfolded leaves of spring maize was measured using a red and blue led light source leaf chamber 6200 02 b led the photosynthetically active radiation par was fixed at 1800 Œºmol mol 1 s 1 and the leaf temperature at 25 c the co2 concentration

2 3 stomatal conductance models 2 3 1 jarvis model the jarvis model is a typical empirical multiplicative model the model considers stomatal conductance to be the product of a combination of environmental factors the combined effects of simultaneous changes in multiple environmental factors on leaf stomatal conductance are obtained by superimposing stomatal conductance responses to a single environmental factor jarvis 1976 the response of stomatal conductance to each environmental factor is independent the model reports statistical relationships with environmental variables such as photosynthetically active radiation air temperature atmospheric co2 concentration and saturated water vapour pressure difference as follows 3 g s f q f d f t f c a in this study the effects of radiation q and external co2 concentrations c a were not considered in addition the effect function for water vapour pressure deficit d used was adapted from leuning 1995 and the effect function for temperature t was the quadratic equation proposed by hofstra and hesketh 1969 4 g s g m a x f d f t 5 f d b 1 1 b 2 d 6 f t c 1 c 2 t where g s is the stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 f d f t and f c

fitted parameters the advantages and disadvantages of jarvis model were showed in table 1 2 3 2 ball woodrow berry model the bwb model ball woodrow berry model is a semi empirical model based on the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate ball et al 1987 established a relationship between stomatal conductance as a function of photosynthetic rate p n leaf surface co2 concentration c s and relative humidity h s stomatal conductance has a linear relationship with net photosynthetic rate at steady state when leaf surface co2 concentration and atmospheric humidity are constant taking into account the function of stomata to maintain intercellular co2 concentration as a constant 7 g s m p n h s c s g 0 where c s denotes the leaf surface co2 concentration Œºmol mol 1 and m g 0 are the fitting parameters the advantages and disadvantages of bwb model was showed in table 1 2 3 3 ball berry leuning model since the bwb model could not accurately simulate the stomatal conductance of the plant when the leaf surface co2 concentration was close to its co2 compensation point leuning 1990 modified the bwb model by changing the leaf surface co2 concentration from c s to c s Œ≥ since the effect of relative humidity h s on stomata is mainly expressed as the response of stomatal conductance to vapor pressure deficit e h s was modified as the function of d leuning 1995 and the bbl model was developed the advantages and disadvantages of bbl model were showed in table 1 8 g s m p n c s Œ≥ 1 d d 0 g 0 where Œ≥ denotes the co2 compensation point Œºmol mol 1 d is the

optimal stomatal behavior medlyn et al 2011 suggests that the optimal behavior of stomata is to maximize carbon fixed by photosynthesis over a certain period while minimizing transpiration i e for a given carbon fixation minimizing transpiration cowan and farquhar 1977 the proposed optimal stomatal conductance model os model was developed with the goal of minimizing water loss assuming that atmospheric co2 concentrations are significantly higher than the co2 compensation point and that only rubp regeneration is taken into account to limit photosynthesis 11 g s 1 6 1 g 1 d p n c a g 0 12

advantages and disadvantages of os model were showed in table 1 2 3 5 soil moisture response function the stomatal conductance of crop leaves is influenced by the combination of atmospheric dryness soil water supply capacity and plant biology soil water content can have an important effect on stomatal conductance of maize in this study the stomatal conductance models considered have been modified by introducing a soil water response function in relation to the method proposed by wang et al 2018a a three stage linear function wang and leuning 1998 jones and sutherland 1991 was also used to simulate soil moisture content to modify the stomatal conductance model 13 f Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ Œ∏ w Œ∏ Œ∏ w Œ∏ f Œ∏ w Œ∏ w Œ∏ Œ∏ f 1 Œ∏ Œ∏ f the average soil moisture content of the 0 30 cm soil was 26

photosynthetic rate of maize leaves during persistent drought soil moisture in a spring maize field changed during progressive water stress in the various years fig 2 during the progressive water stress srwc of ws declined from 89 4 to 24 9 with average daily decline of 8 1 in 2017 thus ws of spring maize appeared severe to drought conversely srwc of ws declined from 85 1 to 13 0 with average daily decline of 6 0 in 2021 thus ws of spring maize appeared extremely severe to drought net photosynthetic rate in spring maize during progressive water stress in the various years fig 3 the net photosynthetic rate p n of ck was 30 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 in 2017 and 2021 under progressive water stress p n of ws declined from 32 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1to 3 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 when srwc was less than 40 p n declined from 29 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 to 17 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1in 2017 the p n of ws declined from 36 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 to 2 1 Œºmol m 2 s 1 furthermore when srwc was less than 40 p n rapidly declined from 32 4 Œºmol m 2 s 1 to 2 1 Œºmol m 2 s 1 3 2 comparison of stomatal conductance model simulation results for spring maize during progressive water stress the stomatal conductance of spring maize was simulated using observed co2 response curve during progressive water stress the stomatal conductance model s parameters and the equations for the soil moisture modification model s parameters were obtained table 2 all models passed the significance test p 0 05 however the stomatal conductance model was influenced by meteorological elements but the addition of soil moisture response function improved the model the interaction between meteorological elements and soil moisture influenced stomatal conductance of spring maize the b values of the models peaked above 0 9 and were all less than 1 during the progressive water stress of spring maize the stomatal conductance model underestimated the simulation results but the degree of underestimation was not significant the model s overall impact was favorable b 1 following the os bbl and jarvis models in order of highest r 2 value were the correlation coefficients of bwb model the os Œ∏ model had the highest r 2 value after the addition of the soil moisture response function followed by the bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and jarvis Œ∏ models the jarvis and jarvis Œ∏ models had the lowest r 2 values although the model was a multiplicative model r 2 increased from 0 52 to 0 62 after the addition of soil moisture function in this study the bwb model had a linear relationship between stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate under stable soil moisture conditions during the progressive water stress srwc was significantly changed the addition of soil moisture response function led to reduction in the performance of model however the r 2 of bwb model decreased from 0 81 to 0 77 while that of bbl model decreased from 0 68 to 0 66 consequently os model performance improved after addition of soil moisture response function as the r 2 of os model improved from 0 77 to 0 81 3 3 evaluation of stomatal conductance model of spring corn during progressive water stress the simulated value of stomatal conductance was compared with the measured value of stomatal conductance during the progressive water stress of spring maize fig 4 the simulated values of bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were closer to the observed values than the values of bwb bbl and os models the jarvis model deviated more significantly from the measured values in the high value area the model simulations were closer to the measured values after the addition of soil moisture response function the evaluation of the soil moisture function correction model and stomatal conductance model are shown in table 3 the rmse mae mape aic and nrmse of bwb and bbl models increased after the addition of the soil moisture response function the rmse of bwb and bbl models increased by 13 8 and 7 4 mae increased by 15 7 and 4 0 and mape increased by 45 9 and 35 1 after the addition of soil moisture response function without the addition of the water response function the aic values indicated that the bwb model s simulation effect was the best followed by os bbl and jarvis models the aic values revealed that the os Œ∏ model s simulation effect was the best followed by the bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and jarvis Œ∏ models after the addition of soil moisture response function the jarvis and os models decreased after the addition of the soil moisture response function the jarvis model showed a greater decrease than os model without the addition of the water response function the bwb model s simulation effect was the best followed by the os model and then the bbl model however the simulation effect of jarvis model was the worst while that of os Œ∏ model was the best followed by the bwb Œ∏ and bbl Œ∏ model after the addition of soil moisture response function in addition the simulation effect of jarvis Œ∏ model was the worst the addition of the soil moisture response function had a greater effect on jarvis and os models but a smaller effect on bbl and bwb models 3 4 applicability of spring maize stomatal conductance model during progressive water stress the relationship between simulated residuals of stomatal conductance simulated measured values and soil relative water content were analyzed during progressive water stress of spring maize fig 5 jarvis and jarvis Œ∏ models simulation results were poor with scattered distribution of residuals the jarvis bwb bbl and os models overestimated stomatal conductance at low soil moisture levels while bwb and bbl models severely over estimated the jarvis bwb bbl and os models all underestimated stomatal conductance at higher soil moisture while jarvis and bbl models severely underestimated the bwb Œ∏ and bbl Œ∏ models overestimated stomatal conductance at low soil moisture after the addition of soil moisture response function while jarvis Œ∏ model was underestimated stomatal conductance jarvis Œ∏ model overestimated stomatal conductance at higher soil moisture the residual stomatal conductance of bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were less affected by soil moisture on the other hand the jarvis model was unstable during progressive water stress followed by the os and bbl models the bwb model remained largely stable and was less frequently underestimated or overestimated under progressive water stress the addition of soil moisture response function had a significant impact on bwb bbl and os models which were all influenced by the jarvis model for the simulated and observed values of g s and srwc regression equations were created table 4 the regression equations were passed at the 0 05 level significant tests within 95 confidence intervals of g s observations and srwc fit curves were spring maize leaf simulated values and curves fig 6 the appropriate srwc for each model was chosen based on whether the fitted curves for the simulated g s values exceeded the 95 confidence interval of the fitted curves for the observed g s values the jarvis model underestimated g s when srwc was higher than 15 and lower than 81 during progressive water stress of spring maize the jarvis model overestimated g s when srwc was lower than 15 and higher than 81 thus the jarvis model was applicable in the extreme drought within a certain range of srwc srwc 20 or srwc 75 when srwc was higher than 28 and less than 79 the bwb model overestimated g s and it underestimated g s when it was lower than 28 and higher than 79 when srwc was lower than 35 or higher than 75 bwb model simulated g s within the 95 confidence interval of the observed g s thus the bwb model was only applicable within a specific range of srwc 20 srwc 35 or srwc 75 the bbl model overestimated g s when the srwc was lower than 31 or higher than 85 and underestimated g s when the srwc was higher than 31 and lower than 85 the bbl model simulates g s within the 95 confidence interval of observed g s when srwc was higher than 22 and lower than 41 or higher than 78 as a result the bbl model was only applicable within a certain srwc range 22 srwc 41 or srwc 78 the os model overestimated g s when srwc was lower than 23 or higher than 75 and underestimated gs when srwc was higher than 23 and lower than 75 the gs simulated by os model were all within the 95 confidence interval of the observed g s thus os model had advantage in the 13 89 relative soil moisture range under progressive water stress of spring maize the simulated values were all within the 95 confidence interval of the observed g s indicating that os model had stability thus os model was more applicable under extreme drought the simulated g s of bwb Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were basically within the 95 confidence interval of observed g s after the addition of soil moisture responded function however the applicability of the model was improved the applicable range of soil moisture for jarvis Œ∏ model was 13 srwc 68 while that of jarvis model was srwc 75 when srwc was applicable i e 13 78 bbl Œ∏ model was used and when srwc was greater than 78 bbl model was again used the srwc range i e 13 89 was applicable to bwb Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models additionally regardless of whether the water response function was introduced or not simulated g s of os Œ∏ model was essentially within the 95 confidence interval of observed g s this indicates that os model was relatively stable under varying range of soil moisture conditions however bbl model performed satisfactorily and was more useful after the addition of the soil moisture response function 4 discussion stomatal conductance balances the conflicting needs of plant h2o protection and co2 capture pantin et al 2013 stomatal response to the environment is key to understanding plant photosynthesis transpiration predicting productivity and water and heat exchange within the spac wang and zhou 2000 the accurate modeling of stomatal conductance affects flux interactions in the spac plant productivity levels and water use efficiency ran et al 2017 stomatal conductance is influenced by a variety of environmental factors and differences in environmental conditions affect the simulation accuracy of stomatal conductance models stomatal response to vegetation metabolism is mainly influenced by soil moisture conditions in this study we found that stomatal conductance was mainly influenced by the interaction between meteorological elements and soil moisture during the progressive water stress of spring maize droughts have become more frequent and severe as a result of global warming the annual numbers of drought days show an increasing trend in china especially in arid and semi arid regions fu and ma 2008 zhang et al 2008b however stomatal sensitivity is an important characteristic of plant drought resistance jia and zhang 2008 many scholars have studied the stomatal conductance simulation of different plants under extreme drought yu et al 2001 investigated the response of stomatal conductance of multi stemmed willow to air humidity in an extreme drought zone the simulation effect of the bwb model is better than the bbl model gao et al 2016a showed that the simulation accuracy of the jarvis model for stomatal conductance of young and middle aged populus euphratica forest was higher than that of bwb model under extreme drought conditions in this study the bwb model simulated best followed by the os and bbl models and jarvis model was the worst during progressive water stress of spring maize the os Œ∏ model simulated best followed by bwb Œ∏ and bbl Œ∏ models and jarvis Œ∏ model was the worst after the addition of soil moisture response function the simulation effect of stomatal conductance model depends on the study object test area environmental conditions and time scale the influence of factors should be considered when selecting stomatal conductance model the response process of spring maize to water stress is very complex and the mechanisms of water stress on the crop are still unclear egea et al 2011 medlyn et al 2011 the simulation of water stress by a stomatal conductance model is mostly based on empirical models wang et al 2006 damour et al 2010 many scholars modified stomatal conductance models based on soil water potential soil water content and leaf water potential baldocchi 1997 sala and tenhunen 1996 tenhunen et al 1990 wijk et al 2000 wang et al 2018a found that the performance of the model was improved by introducing soil moisture response functions in this study the applicability of stomatal conductance model was analyzed during the progressive water stress of spring maize extreme drought conditions spring maize leaf gs simulated values and srwc fit curves within 95 confidence intervals of g s observations and srwc fit curves was used as a basis for judgment the applicability of the model was improved by introducing a soil moisture response function the os models were applicable in all the range of soil moisture whether or not the soil moisture response function was introduced the os model had a certain degree of stability the bwb Œ∏ model was applicable across the srwc range i e 13 89 the bbl Œ∏ model was applicable across the srwc range i e 13 78 the bbl model was applied since it fell within this srwc range the jarvis Œ∏ model was applicable over srwc range i e 13 68 and when srwc 75 jarvis model was used the model interacts with various factors in the simulation process due to the large number of parameters involved in the stomatal conductance model this varies considerably from region to region and from vegetation to vegetation under different climatic conditions resulting in inaccurate model simulation results baldocchi 1992 wang et al 2008 sellers et al 1989 the jarvis model is a non linear relationship between stomatal conductance and environmental factors itis assumed that each environmental factor affects vegetation stomata independently and that there are differences between regions and vegetation it is challenging to model because the model s parameters require a significant amount of data collected in a variety of environmental settings wang and zhou 2018b studied the simulation effect of jarvis model during the progressive water stress of maize and the simulation effect was poor contrarily in this study the jarvis model had better simulation results under extreme drought of spring maize srwc 21 the simulation results of jarvis Œ∏ model was greatly improved after the addition of soil moisture correction function however based on the theory of optimal stomatal conductance os model was established arneth et al 2002 hari et al 1986 katul et al 2009 lloyd 1991 the parameter g 1 has a proportional relationship with critical water use efficiency Œª in the model which has biological implications and can be used to represent the water use strategy of plants heroult et al 2013 medlyn et al 2011 due to the lack of a quantitative relationship between Œª and soil moisture katul et al 2009 it was generally obtained by fitting which limited the application of os model de kauwe et al 2015 lin et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 in this study the os model was better applied whether or not the addition of soil moisture response function during progressive water stress of spring maize the effect of drought stress on stomatal conductance is simulated by changing the relationship between water stress photosynthesis and stomatal conductance sala and tenhunen 1996 verhoef and allen 2000 however the model simulates changes in photosynthesis and hence stomatal conductance under water stress by changing the relationship between water stress and photosynthesis or photosynthetic parameters of v cmax and j max ronda et al 2001 best et al 2011 the model simulates the effects of water stress on leaf scale carbon and water fluxes under a mild drought however the model cannot accurately simulate both photosynthesis and transpiration under extreme drought conditions keenan et al 2010 reichstein et al 2002 verhoef and allen 2000 egea et al 2011 showed that the accuracy of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance simulations was improved by limiting mesophyll and stomatal conductance as well as photosynthesis parameters under drought conditions the simulation of stomatal conductance under drought conditions must take into account for the combined impact of drought on stomatal and non stomatal factors i e v cmax zhou et al 2013 in order to account for combined effects of drought on stomatal and non stomatal factors under drought conditions such as maximum photosynthetic efficiency and critical water use efficiency the stomatal conductance mechanism model s slope of stomatal conductance was adjusted a previous study provided a concise and integrated framework for studying the adaptation of coupled carbon and water in terrestrial ecosystems under global change fan et al 2016 in this study the simulation effect of os model was better under water stress however how water stress affects stomatal conductance slope and critical water use efficiency needs further study the study investigates the effects of persistent soil drought conditions on the stomatal conductance of maize in a water limited environment it aims to provide a foundation for an accurate prediction of carbon and water exchange between plants and the atmosphere in a climate change context the results could help to improve stomatal conductance models of vegetation adaptation mechanisms to the environment in arid and semi arid regions the application of stomatal conductance models across climatic zones research subjects and environmental variables should be fully considered in the future to increase the capacity

investigated by comparing the adaptability of stomatal conductance models in water limited regions the results showed that the bwb model simulated the water stress of spring maize the best followed by the os and bbl models furthermore after the addition of the soil moisture response function the os Œ∏ model simulated best followed by bbl Œ∏ and bwb Œ∏ models the simulation of os and bbl models was improved after the addition of soil moisture response function but that of jarvis and bwb models declined however the four stomatal conductance models were applicable after the addition of the soil moisture response function under extreme drought conditions comparing the different stomatal conductance models the os model performed optimally regard less of the addition of soil moisture response

9117,through the stomata of plants water h2o and carbon dioxide co2 are transferred between leaves and the atmosphere the intakes of co2 during photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration are facilitated by stomata to effectively model plant transpiration and study the mass energy transfer between plants and the atmosphere stomatal conductance of plant leaves requires accurate modelling abnormal changes in soil moisture result from frequent droughts in water strapped environmental regions in a warming context this has an impact on the stomatal conductance models s applicability and in turn the precision of the carbon and water cycles in agro ecosystems four commonly used stomatal conductance models jarvis ball woodrow berry bwb ball berry leuning bbl and unified stomatal optimization os were investigated in the simulation of spring maize during persistent water stress to determine the impact of introducing a soil moisture response function on the simulation effect of the stomatal conductance model the results showed that the bwb model was the best model for spring maize during persistent water stress followed by the os and bbl models and the jarvis model was the worst model the os and bbl models simulation effects were improved by the addition of the soil moisture response function while the jarvis and bwb models simulation effects were diminished the os Œ∏ model was the best followed by the bbl Œ∏ and bwb Œ∏ models and the jarvis Œ∏ model was the worst according to the model simulation effect the 95 confidence intervals of bwb Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were simulated with the addition of the soil moisture response function the addition of soil moisture function improved the model s applicability allowing it to be used for a variety of relative soil moisture contents including 13 68 13 89 13 78 and 13 89 forthe jarvis bwb bbl and uso models with or without the addition of a moisture response function the os model performs optimally and is appropriate for various soil moisture conditions the study s finding may serve as a foundation for choosing an appropriate stomatal conductance model for effective simulation of carbon and water

channel for carbon and water exchange between vegetation and atmosphere which affects plant productivity levels and water use efficiency itis an important regulation channel for mass and energy exchange along the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac wu et al 2007 stomatal conductance plays an important role in regulating the water balance between plants and external environment yin et al 2009 which in turn affects vegetation physiological functions such as transpiration and photosynthesis warren et al 2006 stomatal conductance is the main factor influencing photosynthesis respiration and transpiration of plants however environmental factors like temperature soil humidity solar radiation and water vapor pressure deficit primarily affect the stomatal conductance of vegetation the environmental conditions in which it is found determine how frequently stomatal conductance changes serving as an equilibrium regulator leuning 1995 vegetation balances optimizes the relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration rates by regulating stomatal conductance the movement of stomata reflects to some extent the metabolism in plants and stomatal sensitivity is an important drought resistant feature of plants zhang and gao 1998 zhang et al 2021 stomatal conductance modeling is currently the most effective and applicable approach due to the complicated mechanism of stomatal response to the environment and the heavy work load of human observation the commonly used stomatal conductance models include empirical models based on the statistical relationship between

conductance simulation accuracy gao et al 2016b when simulating data over a long period and with significant changes in soil water the stomatal conductance model performs poorly wang et al 2018a when simulating the effects of drought it is challenging to prepare the stomatal conductance model to reflect the level of water deficit the range of applicability is derived from the accurate simulation of the impact of soil moisture change by the stomatal conductance model studying the physiological traits of crops during droughts and promoting the effective use of agricultural water resources depend greatly on it global warming is making droughts more frequent and more intense which has led to an increase in drought prone areas all over the world the primary factor currently limiting crop growth is drought which has a seriously negative impact on crop growth and yield yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2008a the world s carbon and water cycles were impacted wang et al 2018a to understand how crop ecosystems respond and adapt climate change as well as to forecast the carbon water cycle between crops and the atmosphere in the context of future climate change it is critical to accurately model the stomatal behavior of crops during progressive water stress maize is one of the world s most important cereal and food crop and plays an important role in ensuring global food security according to eurostat 2019 areas that are arid semi arid and semi humid zones collectively referred to as drylands account for about 50 of the world s land area with 2 43 million km2 of that land area found in the arid and semi arid zones of china these areas are water limited environmental zones and one of the main maize production areas in china huang et al 2012 li et al 2004 qi et al 2022 zhang

maize production zhang et al 2012 lin et al 2012 zhao et al 2008 the core of the drought resistance mechanism in plants is the regulation of water relations in which the stomatal movement plays a key regulatory role liu et al 2011 wang et al 2013 accurately modeling the stomatal behavior of spring maize under extreme drought conditions is important for the response mechanisms of drought in water limited environmental zones in this study spring maize at the seven leaf stage in 2017 and at the jointing stage in 2021 were subjected to water stress pot experiment in the water limited environment experiments were used to gather observation data on gas exchange parameters during the spring maize water stress during persistent water stress the adaptability of four stomatal conductance models were investigated the performance of the stomatal conductance model was examined after the addition of the soil moisture response function for each of the four stomatal conductance models the range of soil moisture adaptation were identified the study will investigate the four stomatal conductance models range of adaptation to soil moisture assess their applicability in face of extreme drought and offer technical support for crop drought monitoring and early warning this may support effective use and evaluation of agricultural water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design and environmental conditions the experiment was carried out in 2017 and 2021 at dingxi arid meteorology and ecological environment station of china meteorological administration in dingxi city gansu province 104 37 e 35 35 n 1896 7 m fig 1 the experimental station is located in the semi arid rain fed agricultural region of the loess plateau a typical water resource limitation environmental zone

zone is about 8 13 chen et al 2022 the soil has loose texture poor water and fertilizer retention capacity and is susceptible to drought the pot experiment of spring maize was conducted in 2017 and 2021 spring maize was cultivated outdoors in pots 29 cm diameter 45 cm height the test soil was loessal soil with 9 8 12 0 g kg 1 organic matter and the soil profile is composed of an arable layer and a loess parent layer the soil was fetched from the field at a depth ranging from 0 to 30 cm 14 kg of dry soil for each pot the average soil bulk density field capacity and wilting point of the soil

sowing growth period was about 123 days the average yield was 11 994 0 kg hm 2 spring maize was sown on 18 june 2017 and 11 may 2021 respectively in each pot a quantity of 4 seeds was evenly sown at a depth of about 3 cm we established two treatments well water ck and water stress ws each treatment had 10 pots the same amount of water was used to irrigate the two treatments up until the beginning of the seven leaf stage in 2017 and the jointing stage in 2021 respectively following that the two treatments received full field irrigation the ck treatment was irrigated to field capacity when its soil water content reached 70 of the field capacity while the ws treatment was not irrigated until the crops wilted and died every day the two treatments were observed they were automatically or manually protected from the rain by an electric canopy or plastic sheet 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 soil moisture content measurement for various water treatments using the weighing method the weight of each pot was measured every day with an electronic scale with a minimum weight of 1 g mt301b meilen shenzhen china the weight of each pot was subtracted from the total weight of the dry soil empty pot and fresh plant material to determine the soil water content the mass of the fresh plant material was measured at the end of soil drying while the plant was wilting due to rapid soil drying the amount of plant material in each pot changed very little every day length at seven days the soil water content Œ∏ was calculated using the following formula 1 Œ∏ w c w d w d 100 soil relative

exchange parameters the observation of leaf gas exchange parameters was carried out from 9 00 am to 11 30 am on a sunny and cloudless day and each measurement was repeated three times to obtain the leaf gas exchange parameters the co2 response curve for each treatment with three replicates under the daily soil water conditions was measured from 9 00 am to11 30 am the portable gas exchange system li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa measured photosynthetic parameters and co2 response curves during plant gas exchange the co2 response curve of the top first unfolded leaves of spring maize was measured using a red and blue led light source leaf chamber 6200 02 b led the photosynthetically active radiation par was fixed at 1800 Œºmol mol 1 s 1 and the leaf temperature at 25 c the co2 concentration

2 3 stomatal conductance models 2 3 1 jarvis model the jarvis model is a typical empirical multiplicative model the model considers stomatal conductance to be the product of a combination of environmental factors the combined effects of simultaneous changes in multiple environmental factors on leaf stomatal conductance are obtained by superimposing stomatal conductance responses to a single environmental factor jarvis 1976 the response of stomatal conductance to each environmental factor is independent the model reports statistical relationships with environmental variables such as photosynthetically active radiation air temperature atmospheric co2 concentration and saturated water vapour pressure difference as follows 3 g s f q f d f t f c a in this study the effects of radiation q and external co2 concentrations c a were not considered in addition the effect function for water vapour pressure deficit d used was adapted from leuning 1995 and the effect function for temperature t was the quadratic equation proposed by hofstra and hesketh 1969 4 g s g m a x f d f t 5 f d b 1 1 b 2 d 6 f t c 1 c 2 t where g s is the stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 f d f t and f c

fitted parameters the advantages and disadvantages of jarvis model were showed in table 1 2 3 2 ball woodrow berry model the bwb model ball woodrow berry model is a semi empirical model based on the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate ball et al 1987 established a relationship between stomatal conductance as a function of photosynthetic rate p n leaf surface co2 concentration c s and relative humidity h s stomatal conductance has a linear relationship with net photosynthetic rate at steady state when leaf surface co2 concentration and atmospheric humidity are constant taking into account the function of stomata to maintain intercellular co2 concentration as a constant 7 g s m p n h s c s g 0 where c s denotes the leaf surface co2 concentration Œºmol mol 1 and m g 0 are the fitting parameters the advantages and disadvantages of bwb model was showed in table 1 2 3 3 ball berry leuning model since the bwb model could not accurately simulate the stomatal conductance of the plant when the leaf surface co2 concentration was close to its co2 compensation point leuning 1990 modified the bwb model by changing the leaf surface co2 concentration from c s to c s Œ≥ since the effect of relative humidity h s on stomata is mainly expressed as the response of stomatal conductance to vapor pressure deficit e h s was modified as the function of d leuning 1995 and the bbl model was developed the advantages and disadvantages of bbl model were showed in table 1 8 g s m p n c s Œ≥ 1 d d 0 g 0 where Œ≥ denotes the co2 compensation point Œºmol mol 1 d is the saturation vapor pressure difference between leaf and air kpa m g 0 and d 0are the fitting parameters where vapor pressure deficit d was calculated as follows 9 d 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t t 237 3 1 h s

optimal stomatal behavior medlyn et al 2011 suggests that the optimal behavior of stomata is to maximize carbon fixed by photosynthesis over a certain period while minimizing transpiration i e for a given carbon fixation minimizing transpiration cowan and farquhar 1977 the proposed optimal stomatal conductance model os model was developed with the goal of minimizing water loss assuming that atmospheric co2 concentrations are significantly higher than the co2 compensation point and that only rubp regeneration is taken into account to limit photosynthesis 11 g s 1 6 1 g 1 d p n c a g 0 12

advantages and disadvantages of os model were showed in table 1 2 3 5 soil moisture response function the stomatal conductance of crop leaves is influenced by the combination of atmospheric dryness soil water supply capacity and plant biology soil water content can have an important effect on stomatal conductance of maize in this study the stomatal conductance models considered have been modified by introducing a soil water response function in relation to the method proposed by wang et al 2018a a three stage linear function wang and leuning 1998 jones and sutherland 1991 was also used to simulate soil moisture content to modify the stomatal conductance model 13 f Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ Œ∏ w Œ∏ Œ∏ w Œ∏ f Œ∏ w Œ∏ w Œ∏ Œ∏ f 1 Œ∏ Œ∏ f the average soil moisture content of the 0 30 cm soil was 26

photosynthetic rate of maize leaves during persistent drought soil moisture in a spring maize field changed during progressive water stress in the various years fig 2 during the progressive water stress srwc of ws declined from 89 4 to 24 9 with average daily decline of 8 1 in 2017 thus ws of spring maize appeared severe to drought conversely srwc of ws declined from 85 1 to 13 0 with average daily decline of 6 0 in 2021 thus ws of spring maize appeared extremely severe to drought net photosynthetic rate in spring maize during progressive water stress in the various years fig 3 the net photosynthetic rate p n of ck was 30 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 in 2017 and 2021 under progressive water stress p n of ws declined from 32 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1to 3 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 when srwc was less than 40 p n declined from 29 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 to 17 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1in 2017 the p n of ws declined from 36 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 to 2 1 Œºmol m 2 s 1 furthermore when srwc was less than 40 p n rapidly declined from 32 4 Œºmol m 2 s 1 to 2 1 Œºmol m 2 s 1 3 2 comparison of stomatal conductance model simulation results for spring maize during progressive water stress the stomatal conductance of spring maize was simulated using observed co2 response curve during progressive water stress the stomatal conductance model s parameters and the equations for the soil moisture modification model s parameters were obtained table 2 all models passed the significance test p 0 05 however the stomatal conductance model was influenced by meteorological elements but the addition of soil moisture response function improved the model the interaction between meteorological elements and soil moisture influenced stomatal conductance of spring maize the b values of the models peaked above 0 9 and were all less than 1 during the progressive water stress of spring maize the stomatal conductance model underestimated the simulation results but the degree of underestimation was not significant the model s overall impact was favorable b 1 following the os bbl and jarvis models in order of highest r 2 value were the correlation coefficients of bwb model the os Œ∏ model had the highest r 2 value after the addition of the soil moisture response function followed by the bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and jarvis Œ∏ models the jarvis and jarvis Œ∏ models had the lowest r 2 values although the model was a multiplicative model r 2 increased from 0 52 to 0 62 after the addition of soil moisture function in this study the bwb model had a linear relationship between stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate under stable soil moisture conditions during the progressive water stress srwc was significantly changed the addition of soil moisture response function led to reduction in the performance of model however the r 2 of bwb model decreased from 0 81 to 0 77 while that of bbl model decreased from 0 68 to 0 66 consequently os model performance improved after addition of soil moisture response function as the r 2 of os model improved from 0 77 to 0 81 3 3 evaluation of stomatal conductance model of spring corn during progressive water stress the simulated value of stomatal conductance was compared with the measured value of stomatal conductance during the progressive water stress of spring maize fig 4 the simulated values of bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were closer to the observed values than the values of bwb bbl and os models the jarvis model deviated more significantly from the measured values in the high value area the model simulations were closer to the measured values after the addition of soil moisture response function the evaluation of the soil moisture function correction model and stomatal conductance model are shown in table 3 the rmse mae mape aic and nrmse of bwb and bbl models increased after the addition of the soil moisture response function the rmse of bwb and bbl models increased by 13 8 and 7 4 mae increased by 15 7 and 4 0 and mape increased by 45 9 and 35 1 after the addition of soil moisture response function without the addition of the water response function the aic values indicated that the bwb model s simulation effect was the best followed by os bbl and jarvis models the aic values revealed that the os Œ∏ model s simulation effect was the best followed by the bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and jarvis Œ∏ models after the addition of soil moisture response function the jarvis and os models decreased after the addition of the soil moisture response function the jarvis model showed a greater decrease than os model without the addition of the water response function the bwb model s simulation effect was the best followed by the os model and then the bbl model however the simulation effect of jarvis model was the worst while that of os Œ∏ model was the best followed by the bwb Œ∏ and bbl Œ∏ model after the addition of soil moisture response function in addition the simulation effect of jarvis Œ∏ model was the worst the addition of the soil moisture response function had a greater effect on jarvis and os models but a smaller effect on bbl and bwb models 3 4 applicability of spring maize stomatal conductance model during progressive water stress the relationship between simulated residuals of stomatal conductance simulated measured values and soil relative water content were analyzed during progressive water stress of spring maize fig 5 jarvis and jarvis Œ∏ models simulation results were poor with scattered distribution of residuals the jarvis bwb bbl and os models overestimated stomatal conductance at low soil moisture levels while bwb and bbl models severely over estimated the jarvis bwb bbl and os models all underestimated stomatal conductance at higher soil moisture while jarvis and bbl models severely underestimated the bwb Œ∏ and bbl Œ∏ models overestimated stomatal conductance at low soil moisture after the addition of soil moisture response function while jarvis Œ∏ model was underestimated stomatal conductance jarvis Œ∏ model overestimated stomatal conductance at higher soil moisture the residual stomatal conductance of bwb Œ∏ bbl Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were less affected by soil moisture on the other hand the jarvis model was unstable during progressive water stress followed by the os and bbl models the bwb model remained largely stable and was less frequently underestimated or overestimated under progressive water stress the addition of soil moisture response function had a significant impact on bwb bbl and os models which were all influenced by the jarvis model for the simulated and observed values of g s and srwc regression equations were created table 4 the regression equations were passed at the 0 05 level significant tests within 95 confidence intervals of g s observations and srwc fit curves were spring maize leaf simulated values and curves fig 6 the appropriate srwc for each model was chosen based on whether the fitted curves for the simulated g s values exceeded the 95 confidence interval of the fitted curves for the observed g s values the jarvis model underestimated g s when srwc was higher than 15 and lower than 81 during progressive water stress of spring maize the jarvis model overestimated g s when srwc was lower than 15 and higher than 81 thus the jarvis model was applicable in the extreme drought within a certain range of srwc srwc 20 or srwc 75 when srwc was higher than 28 and less than 79 the bwb model overestimated g s and it underestimated g s when it was lower than 28 and higher than 79 when srwc was lower than 35 or higher than 75 bwb model simulated g s within the 95 confidence interval of the observed g s thus the bwb model was only applicable within a specific range of srwc 20 srwc 35 or srwc 75 the bbl model overestimated g s when the srwc was lower than 31 or higher than 85 and underestimated g s when the srwc was higher than 31 and lower than 85 the bbl model simulates g s within the 95 confidence interval of observed g s when srwc was higher than 22 and lower than 41 or higher than 78 as a result the bbl model was only applicable within a certain srwc range 22 srwc 41 or srwc 78 the os model overestimated g s when srwc was lower than 23 or higher than 75 and underestimated gs when srwc was higher than 23 and lower than 75 the gs simulated by os model were all within the 95 confidence interval of the observed g s thus os model had advantage in the 13 89 relative soil moisture range under progressive water stress of spring maize the simulated values were all within the 95 confidence interval of the observed g s indicating that os model had stability thus os model was more applicable under extreme drought the simulated g s of bwb Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models were basically within the 95 confidence interval of observed g s after the addition of soil moisture responded function however the applicability of the model was improved the applicable range of soil moisture for jarvis Œ∏ model was 13 srwc 68 while that of jarvis model was srwc 75 when srwc was applicable i e 13 78 bbl Œ∏ model was used and when srwc was greater than 78 bbl model was again used the srwc range i e 13 89 was applicable to bwb Œ∏ and os Œ∏ models additionally regardless of whether the water response function was introduced or not simulated g s of os Œ∏ model was essentially within the 95 confidence interval of observed g s this indicates that os model was relatively stable under varying range of soil moisture conditions however bbl model performed satisfactorily and was more useful after the addition of the soil moisture response function 4 discussion stomatal conductance balances the conflicting needs of plant h2o protection and co2 capture pantin et al 2013 stomatal response to the environment is key to understanding plant photosynthesis transpiration predicting productivity and water and heat exchange within the spac wang and zhou 2000 the accurate modeling of stomatal conductance affects flux interactions in the spac plant productivity levels and water use efficiency ran et al 2017 stomatal conductance is influenced by a variety of environmental factors and differences in environmental conditions affect the simulation accuracy of stomatal conductance models stomatal response to vegetation metabolism is mainly influenced by soil moisture conditions in this study we found that stomatal conductance was mainly influenced by the interaction between meteorological elements and soil moisture during the progressive water stress of spring maize droughts have become more frequent and severe as a result of global warming the annual numbers of drought days show an increasing trend in china especially in arid and semi arid regions fu and ma 2008 zhang et al 2008b however stomatal sensitivity is an important characteristic of plant drought resistance jia and zhang 2008 many scholars have studied the stomatal conductance simulation of different plants under extreme drought yu et al 2001 investigated the response of stomatal conductance of multi stemmed willow to air humidity in an extreme drought zone the simulation effect of the bwb model is better than the bbl model gao et al 2016a showed that the simulation accuracy of the jarvis model for stomatal conductance of young and middle aged populus euphratica forest was higher than that of bwb model under extreme drought conditions in this study the bwb model simulated best followed by the os and bbl models and jarvis model was the worst during progressive water stress of spring maize the os Œ∏ model simulated best followed by bwb Œ∏ and bbl Œ∏ models and jarvis Œ∏ model was the worst after the addition of soil moisture response function the simulation effect of stomatal conductance model depends on the study object test area environmental conditions and time scale the influence of factors should be considered when selecting stomatal conductance model the response process of spring maize to water stress is very complex and the mechanisms of water stress on the crop are still unclear egea et al 2011 medlyn et al 2011 the simulation of water stress by a stomatal conductance model is mostly based on empirical models wang et al 2006 damour et al 2010 many scholars modified stomatal conductance models based on soil water potential soil water content and leaf water potential baldocchi 1997 sala and tenhunen 1996 tenhunen et al 1990 wijk et al 2000 wang et al 2018a found that the performance of the model was improved by introducing soil moisture response functions in this study the applicability of stomatal conductance model was analyzed during the progressive water stress of spring maize extreme drought conditions spring maize leaf gs simulated values and srwc fit curves within 95 confidence intervals of g s observations and srwc fit curves was used as a basis for judgment the applicability of the model was improved by introducing a soil moisture response function the os models were applicable in all the range of soil moisture whether or not the soil moisture response function was introduced the os model had a certain degree of stability the bwb Œ∏ model was applicable across the srwc range i e 13 89 the bbl Œ∏ model was applicable across the srwc range i e 13 78 the bbl model was applied since it fell within this srwc range the jarvis Œ∏ model was applicable over srwc range i e 13 68 and when srwc 75 jarvis model was used the model interacts with various factors in the simulation process due to the large number of parameters involved in the stomatal conductance model this varies considerably from region to region and from vegetation to vegetation under different climatic conditions resulting in inaccurate model simulation results baldocchi 1992 wang et al 2008 sellers et al 1989 the jarvis model is a non linear relationship between stomatal conductance and environmental factors itis assumed that each environmental factor affects vegetation stomata independently and that there are differences between regions and vegetation it is challenging to model because the model s parameters require a significant amount of data collected in a variety of environmental settings wang and zhou 2018b studied the simulation effect of jarvis model during the progressive water stress of maize and the simulation effect was poor contrarily in this study the jarvis model had better simulation results under extreme drought of spring maize srwc 21 the simulation results of jarvis Œ∏ model was greatly improved after the addition of soil moisture correction function however based on the theory of optimal stomatal conductance os model was established arneth et al 2002 hari et al 1986 katul et al 2009 lloyd 1991 the parameter g 1 has a proportional relationship with critical water use efficiency Œª in the model which has biological implications and can be used to represent the water use strategy of plants heroult et al 2013 medlyn et al 2011 due to the lack of a quantitative relationship between Œª and soil moisture katul et al 2009 it was generally obtained by fitting which limited the application of os model de kauwe et al 2015 lin et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 in this study the os model was better applied whether or not the addition of soil moisture response function during progressive water stress of spring maize the effect of drought stress on stomatal conductance is simulated by changing the relationship between water stress photosynthesis and stomatal conductance sala and tenhunen 1996 verhoef and allen 2000 however the model simulates changes in photosynthesis and hence stomatal conductance under water stress by changing the relationship between water stress and photosynthesis or photosynthetic parameters of v cmax and j max ronda et al 2001 best et al 2011 the model simulates the effects of water stress on leaf scale carbon and water fluxes under a mild drought however the model cannot accurately simulate both photosynthesis and transpiration under extreme drought conditions keenan et al 2010 reichstein et al 2002 verhoef and allen 2000 egea et al 2011 showed that the accuracy of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance simulations was improved by limiting mesophyll and stomatal conductance as well as photosynthesis parameters under drought conditions the simulation of stomatal conductance under drought conditions must take into account for the combined impact of drought on stomatal and non stomatal factors i e v cmax zhou et al 2013 in order to account for combined effects of drought on stomatal and non stomatal factors under drought conditions such as maximum photosynthetic efficiency and critical water use efficiency the stomatal conductance mechanism model s slope of stomatal conductance was adjusted a previous study provided a concise and integrated framework for studying the adaptation of coupled carbon and water in terrestrial ecosystems under global change fan et al 2016 in this study the simulation effect of os model was better under water stress however how water stress affects stomatal conductance slope and critical water use efficiency needs further study the study investigates the effects of persistent soil drought conditions on the stomatal conductance of maize in a water limited environment it aims to provide a foundation for an accurate prediction of carbon and water exchange between plants and the atmosphere in a climate change context the results could help to improve stomatal conductance models of vegetation adaptation mechanisms to the environment in arid and semi arid regions the application of stomatal conductance models across climatic zones research subjects and environmental variables should be fully considered in the future to increase the capacity

9118,reduced irrigation generally induces the tomato fruit yield reduction but enhance the fruit quality elevated co2 eco2 injection is a common technique for alleviating water stress while eco2 could inevitably lead to the element concentration dilution in the plant organs inoculated with photosynthetic bacteria psb are confirmed to form a symbiotic relationship with crop roots thereby promoting root development and improving crop root nutrient and water uptake capacity yet it remains unknown whether psb could mitigate the adversely effect of nutrient dilution under eco2 condition and the yield decline under reduced irrigation to investigate that two water treatments including reduced irrigation ri plants were irrigated to 75 field water capacity and full irrigation fi plants were irrigated to 90 field water capacity of tomato plants were grown under normal ambient co2 aco2 400 ppm and elevated co2 eco2 800 ppm conditions respectively and photosynthetic bacteria were inoculated in half plants the results showed that inoculation of psb improved the effectiveness of co2 stimulation on biomass and yield in tomato plants grown under reduced irrigation conditions the stimulation effects have been associated with increased advantages linked to their root system we have observed that co2 and psb inoculation promoted the root development and antioxidant abilities these consequently increased nitrogen uptake efficiency under eco2 and reduced irrigation conditions and increased nitrogen accumulation in various organs furthermore eco2 and inoculation with psb individually or in combination ameliorated yield penalties under reduced irrigation conditions combined elevated co2 and inoculation with psb resulted in the highest fruit quality collectively the responses of tomato fruit yield and quality to water reduced irrigation regimes are further enhanced by the combination of eco2 and psb inoculation and this would be efficacious in greenhouse tomato

due to the greenhouse effect induced by rising global co2 levels ault 2020 trenberth 2011 although high co2 concentration is beneficial for agricultural production in terms of crop yield and quality long et al 2004 there still exists an inevitable challenge that crops have to use limited water resources to ensure high crop yields cao et al 2018 therefore it is essential to understand the response of plants with the limited water supplement to elevated co2 concentration to address the agricultural sustainability and food security in the future climate scenario deficit irrigation saves water and improves the water use efficiency of plants patan√® et al 2011 savic et al 2011 better fruit quality is also observed in moderate water stress treated plants murtic et al 2018 p√©k et al 2019 but these benefits were at the cost of reduced fruit yields it is reported that high co2 concentration can compensate for decreased crop yields under moderate water deficit kizildeniz et al 2015 lahive et al 2021 for instance co2 enrichment is generally used in greenhouse cultivation to improve the performance of plants long et al 2004 and mitigate the detrimental effect of water stress by increasing photosynthesis and productivity alonso et al 2012 porras et al 2017 nonetheless high co2 concentration curtails the mass flow of nutrition elements from the rhizosphere soil to plants root loladze 2014 the improvements of crop yield and quality in responses to long term co2 enrichment were worse than expected kant et al 2012 khan et al 2013 and that elevated co2 may not always be beneficial for fruit yield or quality when plants grow under adverse environmental conditions with insufficient nutritional status wang et al 2018 considering the positive effect of certain plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb on plants ge and zhang 2019 harada et al 2005 lee et al 2008 application of pgpb may provide an excellent opportunity for further improving crop yields and quality under eco2 condition as well as under reduced irrigation condition yadav et al 2020 these bacteria associated with roots may have profound effects on plant growth through several mechanisms such as improving the resistance to adverse conditions fixing nitrogen for the host plant and transforming nutrients to stimulate root growth ludden and roberts 2002 pieterse et al 2000 vacheron et al 2013 moreover the effect of pgpb on plant growth promotion are boosted under eco2 condition because photosynthesis in response to elevated co2 could be expected to release more root exudates for symbiotic bacteria drigo et al 2007 grover et al 2015 it has been reported that application of pgpb fertilizer and co2 enrichment acting synergistically may be more effective on crop growth than individual treatments in both optimal and water deficit conditions du et al 2021 therefore inoculation of pgpb possibly has the potential to assist plants in dealing with complex climate conditions in the future yang et al 2009 roots morphological and physiological characteristics significantly affects plants physiological activities larigauderie et al 1994 as the organ that directly participates in the absorption and transport of water and nutrient the greater root density and total root areas are important features associated with higher efficiency of nitrogen uptake in plants hodge 2004 zhou et al 2021 in general root development is directly affected by the environmental factors for instance water stress induces the accumulation of ethylene and reactive oxygen species in root tips thus suppressing the root tip cells division brunetti et al 2021 finally reducing the supply of water and nutrients for above ground growth besides the development of the root system seems unable to meet the nutrient absorption demand of plants due to the boost of above ground growth induced by eco2 conditions nie et al 2013 therefore the application of pgpb will possibly endow more advantages of plant roots under water shortage and eco2 conditions in the future thus providing more nutrients for plant growth among these bacteria photosynthetic bacteria psb as a nitrogen fixing microorganism could provide additional nitrogen supply to the roots of the host plant due to the symbiosis relationship ludden and roberts 2002 apart from the n2 fixation function photosynthetic bacteria significantly augment lateral roots and root hairs formation by secreting 3 indoleacetic acid iaa 5 aminolevulinic acid ala and cytokines ctk rae hyun and song 2007 sasikala and ramana 1998 which could assist plants to withstand abiotic stress egamberdieva and kucharova 2009 previous studies have confirmed either the promotion of psb on plant growth or the stimulation of photosynthesis to high co2 concentration whereas the interactive effects of eco2 psb biofertilizer and reduced irrigation regimes on roots and fruit development in tomato are not thoroughly studied to complement the mechanistic response of tomato plants solanum lycopersicum l with inoculated psb to eco2 and reduced irrigation conditions in this study a climate controlled chamber experiment was conducted the objectives of the study were to explore the interactive effects of psb with eco2 on dry matter distribution nitrogen accumulation root development fruit yield and quality characteristics of tomato plants under reduced irrigation conditions we hypothesized that i a combination of eco2 and psb will alleviate the yield penalties due to the reduction of water irrigation ii psb and eco2 would boost the absorption of water and nitrogen under reduced irrigation conditions by influencing the root morphology and physiology and iii psb inoculation and elevated co2 would further improve the performance of tomato quality to reduced irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and growth conditions the experiment was conducted in two climate controlled chambers at shiyanghe experimental station 37 52 n 102 50 e altitude 1581 m above sea level of china agricultural university wuwei city gansu province china from january to may 2021 the tomato variety cultivated was fortesa cherry tomato at the fourth leaf stage the seedlings were transplanted to a type of 19 l volume pot with a top diameter of 28 cm bottom diameter of 22 cm and a height of 30 cm each pot was filled with 14 kg sandy loam which was collected from the topsoil of local experimental field the soil bulk density of the pot was 1 52 0 08 g cm 3 with a field water capacity Œ∏f of 0 27 0 06 cm3 cm 3 on the 14th day after transplanting all plants were equally allocated to two adjacent climate chambers for cultivation one of the chambers was set with an elevated co2 concentration eco2 and the other was maintained at the average ambient co2 concentration aco2 our previous publication presents more information on the climate chambers other climatic factors in both chambers were set at 28 22 2 day night air temperature and 50 5 relative humidity a 14 hr photoperiod was operated in each chamber and 2000 lux light intensity supplied by two sets of led lamps du et al 2021 2 2 experiment treatments the experiment was conducted in two independent chambers one with eco2 800 ppm and the other with aco2 as control group 400 ppm in each chamber plants were subjected to two water treatments full irrigation treatments fi plants were irrigated to 90 field water capacity and reduced irrigation treatments ri plants were irrigated to 75 field water capacity the water content sensors em50 decagon devices inc usa continuously monitored water content of each treatment all plants were irrigated manually to the upper limit of different water treatments at 17 00 h daily plants were exposed to two sub treatments of bacterial fertilizer photosynthetic bacteria treatments p1 plants were inoculated with photosynthetic bacteria preparation 10 days once and 100 ml of photosynthetic bacteria preparation with approximately 3000 million colony forming units cfu rhodopseudomonas were drenched into soil with water each time and non inoculation of photosynthetic bacteria treatments p0 photosynthetic bacteria preparations were replaced with same amount of water information on photosynthetic bacteria preparations was reported in our previous study du et al 2021 each treatment was set 12 duplicates and total of 48 pots were placed in each chamber the water used for the irrigation was tap water and 5 hoagland solution was applied to satisfy the other nutrient requirements for plant growth in seedling and fruiting stages 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 the lc ms analysis of the photosynthetic bacteria components photosynthetic bacteria components were determined by metware biotechnology company wuhan china the photosynthetic bacteria liquid was separated into three duplicates and each sample 50 Œºl was mixed with 150 Œºl extract solution acetonitrile methanol 1 4 volume ratio after centrifuging at 12000 revolutions per minute rpm for 10 min under 4 c 150 Œºl supernatant was taken from the mixture and placed at 20 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 3 min 4 c again 120 Œºl aliquots of supernatant were transferred for lc ms analysis all samples were acquired by the lc ms system followed machine orders to determine their components the 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid deaminase acc deaminase was determined by the bacteria elisa method according to saleh and glick 2001 2 3 2 dry matter accumulation and nitrogen content after 80 days of cultivation three replicated plants with consistent growth were harvested in each treatment and then roots stems and leaves were separated and they were placed in the oven at 105 for deactivation of enzymes and dried at 80 until constant dry weight then the dry matter weight of these organs was measured and nitrogen content was determined by the kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer using dried samples song et al 2015 nitrogen accumulation mg plant 1 was described as the product of n concentration mg g 1 and dry matter weight g nitrogen uptake efficiency ne was calculated according to the eqs 1 and 2 described by larigauderie et al 1994 1 ne root weight n uptake root dry weight 2 ne root length n uptake root length where ne root weight is the nitrogen uptake efficiency based on root dry weight ne root length is the nitrogen uptake efficiency based on root length is the integral of n uptake quantity and root dry weight from the first sampling date 25 days after treatment to the fourth sampling date 70 days after treatment root dry weights and n accumulation values obtained from different treatments at each sampling date were used for the integration of root dry weight and n uptake respectively nitrogen uptake per unit root length was calculated from the second sampling date 40 days after treatment to the fourth sampling date because the root length was not measured at first and second sampling date root length at second sampling date was defined as a common initial root length of 1000 mm for all treatments 2 3 3 root morphology parameters to examine the root morphology index the whole roots of six plants for each treatment were washed with deionized water to remove impurities and ensure that the nutrition substance attached to the root surface was completely rinsed away after that three replicates were quickly placed in liquid nitrogen and stored in a 80 freezer for physiological indicators analysis the remaining three samples were used for the determination of the root morphological index roots were separated and placed into the transparent trays loaded with small amounts of water and root crowns were manually separated to ensure they do not overlap with each other the transparent tray was scanned using the epson scanner v700 usa and images were taken at 1200 dpi and analyzed with the winrhizo software to measure total root length total root volume total root surface area and average diameter 2 3 4 determination of malondialdehyde contents and antioxidant enzyme activity the malondialdehyde contents mda in roots were determined according to the thiobarbituric acid reaction method banerjee et al 2016 all measurements were performed with three replicates for each treatment superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat activity were assayed following the method of arora et al 2012 peroxidase pod activity was determined according to the method described by kole≈°ka et al 2017 2 3 5 fruit yield and quality parameters at the final harvest the yield was measured as the weight of all fruits for each plant and irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as the ratio of fruit yields g plant 1 and the total amount of irrigated water m3 plant 1 red matured fruits were picked from the first ear of plants for quality measurement quality parameters included single fruit weight fruit firmness total acid ta total soluble sugar tss vitamin c vc and lycopene single fruit weight was measured as the average of all fruit weights in the first ear of plants fruit firmness was measured by a fruit hardness meter hpeii fff bareiss germany subsequently the fruits of each treatment were cut into small pieces and mashed thoroughly with a fruit blender total soluble sugar was determined according to the anthrone colorimetric method described by yemm and wills 1954 the total organic acid concentration was determined by titration method kaur et al 2013 the sugar acid ratio sar was calculated as the ratio of tss to ta vitamin c concentrations were determined by dichloroindophenol titrimetric method zhai et al 2015 tomato lycopene contents were analyzed by uv 2500 spectrophotometer fish et al 2002 a portable colorimeter cm 23d konica minolta holdings inc japan was used to determine the fruit color parameters including l lightness a green red shade and b blue yellow shade four fruits per replicate were randomly sampled and fruit chroma was calculated by equation 3

differences three way analysis of variance anova was performed for comparing the differences between means of variables co2 concentration c irrigation regime i and psb inoculation p the statistical analyses were conducted using spss software version 23 0 ibm corp 3 results 3 1 identification of photosynthetic bacteria and their metabolic components through lc ms analysis the amino acids and their derivatives vitamins and organic acids in the photosynthetic bacteria solution are shown in table 1 the photosynthetic bacteria solution is rich in variety of amino acids and vitamins besides growth promoting hormones such as 5 aminosalicylic acid indoleacetic acid and 5 aminolevulinic acid were identified in the photosynthetic bacteria solution an acc deaminase that can inhibit the synthesis of the ethylene precursor was also identified in the bacteria solution table 1 3 2 plant dry matter accumulation and distribution in different organs the dry matter accumulation and distribution in different organs are listed in table 2 both above and under ground dry matter were significantly increased in eco2 and high water treatments whereas the stem dry matter was not affected by psb inoculation the interaction of eco2 and water supply affected the dry matter in different organs and the high water treated plants under eco2 conditions had larger fruit yields with greater leaves and roots dry matter compared to the corresponding plants at aco2 levels elevated co2 increased the dry matter of aboveground by 98 98 and 89 57 in ri and fi treatments respectively and the roots dry matter were increased by 20 82 and 38 71 respectively the interaction between the irrigation regime eco2 and psb showed significant effects on the dry matter accumulation as well table 2 the eco2 and psb inoculation significantly increased the leaves roots and fruits dry matter accumulation besides this effect was more obvious with the increase of irrigation amount table 2 compared with the corresponding plants grown under aco2 conditions combination of eco2 and psb increased the dry weight of above ground biomass that was increased by 109 84 and 105 50 in the ri and fi treatments respectively and the root biomass was increased by 37 76 and 63 23 it is noteworthy that the greatest fruit dry weight was observed in psb inoculated plants subjected to high water treatment at eco2 conditions the distribution of dry matter in different organs was also significantly affected by the psb and irrigation regimes under different co2 concentrations the distribution of dry matter in the roots was significantly decreased under elevated co2 conditions but was not affected by irrigation amount a similar variation trend was observed in leaf dry matter distribution however under eco2 conditions the dry matter proportion in fruit significantly decreased in both ri and fi treatments table 2 psb treatments showed greater dry matter distribution in roots and leaves but a lower stem proportion of dry matter additionally the elevated co2 concentration resulted in a significant reduction in the root shoot ratio under various irrigation amounts however the root shoot ratio significantly increased in psb treatments 3 3 plants nitrogen concentration and accumulation in different organs the nitrogen concentration and nitrogen accumulation in tomato organs are presented in table 3 generally eco2 significantly decreased the content of n in all organs and the interaction of eco2 and ri significantly decreased the n content in leaves as well table 3 however the results of n accumulation in organs showed a different trend elevated co2 significantly promoted n accumulation in the leaves stems and roots but n accumulation in ri treatment was lower compared to fi treatment under eco2 conditions overall compared with corresponding plants under aco2 conditions eco2 increased total n accumulation by 69 81 and 56 23 under ri and fi treatments respectively the n accumulation was further enhanced by psb in leaves and roots under eco2 conditions and the total n accumulation of combined psb and eco2 treatments was increased by 82 64 and 82 12 under ri and fi conditions compared with those grown under aco2 conditions furthermore fig 3 showed that the n uptake efficiency per unit root dry weight in eco2 concentration was lower than those in aco2 condition and fi treatment significantly decreased n uptake efficiency per unit root dry weight nevertheless the psb inoculation increased the uptake efficiency of plants grown both in co2 and water treatments a similar trend was also observed for n uptake efficiency on a root length basis 3 4 root morphological and physiological traits root average diameter total root length and root surface area were showed in table 4 plants with reduced irrigation had lower root length root volume surface area and root tip numbers in different co2 conditions greater values of these parameters were recorded in psb inoculated plants except for the average diameter of roots the interactive effect of eco2 and psb significantly influenced the total root volume root length and root surface area of plants it was shown that the combination of eco2 and psb treatment improved these root parameters of plants with fi treatment the most followed by ri treatment from root classification the largest tomato root lengths were observed in the 0 10 0 15 mm range of diameter fig 2 although the proportion of root length in ri and fi treatment was not affected by eco2 or psb treatment eco2 and psb inoculation and their combination significantly increased the root length of 0 10 0 15 mm diameters table 5 and this promoting effect was especially more pronounced in elevated eco2 conditions malondialdehyde mda content in tomato roots is shown in fig 3a both eco2 and psb inoculation significantly reduced mda content in plant roots in both water treatments especially combined treatment of eco2 and psb treatment showed a more evidently inhibitory effect on the concentration of mda in the ri treatment the amelioration of eco2 and psb to reactive oxygen species ros scavenging was possibly associated with regulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes so the activity of sod pod and cat in tomato roots were analyzed fig 3b c d elevated co2 or psb treatment significantly enhanced the activity of sod and their combination led to the maximum increase in sod activity in roots similarly pod content also increased in response to eco2 treatment and inoculation of psb further promoted the pod activity under eco2 conditions in contrast psb treatment and irrigation regimes on plants did not significantly regulate the cat activity as compared to control plants but cat activity increased in response to individual eco2 or combined treatment of eco2 and psb 3 5 tomato fruit yield and quality co2 levels irrigation regimes psb and the interaction between these factors did not affect the fruit shape index fruit numbers were solely affected by co2 levels and eco2 significantly increased the fruit number as expected eco2 increased the fruit yield of plants in all water treatments more importantly psb inoculation further enhanced tomato yield in those grown under eco2 conditions table 6 the highest yield was recorded in the plants treated with combined eco2 psb and fi treatments followed by the psb inoculated plants grown under eco2 and ri treatments the effect of co2 enrichment and psb on iwp was similar with yield eco2 led to greater iwp for all irrigation treatments and the increase was more pronounced for ri treatment it is worth note that the greatest irrigation water productivity was observed in ri treatments with combination of psb and eco2 conditions the vc and ta content of tomatoes were not affected by irrigation regimes but plants with reduced irrigation had higher tss lycopene and sar in both co2 concentrations greater lycopene tss and vc were observed in tomato fruits from plants grown under eco2 conditions compared with those in aco2 conditions in addition ri prominently promoted the chroma in fruits harvested from eco2 conditions except for the organic acid it was shown that the treatment with the highest flavor quality index tss and sar and nutritional indicators vc and lycopene content was the combination of psb and ri treated plants under eco2 conditions table 6 4 discussion 4 1 psb inoculation and eco2 enrichment improved the dry matter accumulation of the plants under reduced irrigation although plant biomass decreased under reduced irrigation compared with full irrigation treatment table 2 our study tested that eco2 could increase the crop biomass under water stress conditions similar observations are reported by balbinot et al 2021 and wei et al 2018 however response of dry matter to elevated co2 was not consistent in plants with different bacterial fertilizer treatments inoculation with psb improved the effectiveness of co2 stimulation of plant biomass by 10 89 and 15 93 under reduced water treatments and full irrigation treatments respectively table 2 meanwhile psb and eco2 treated plants have stronger root system which was partly reflected in their higher dry weight inoculation of psb further enhanced the eco2 stimulated effect on root dry weight by 12 83 and 25 89 under ri and fi conditions respectively accordingly advantages linked to roots were further promoted by psb under eco2 conditions to facilitate more nutrition and water absorption from the soil for photosynthesis stulen and den hertog 1993 however reduction of the root shoot ratio indicated that the stimulating effect of eco2 on the increase in root system was lower than that on shoots table 2 which was also reported by ziska and teramura 1992 considering that the tomato plants were potted in this experiment the reduced root shoot ratio may be partly due to the limitation of pots volume especially in the great roots of eco2 treatments studies have shown that root restriction caused by small containers may lead to reduction of straight roots in crops peterson et al 1991 van iersel 1997 from our root classification results the proportion of straight roots diameter 0 15 showed no significantly difference between aco2 and eco2 conditions but the root length of this grade was significantly increased by eco2 conditions fig 2 it is can be inferred that the growth of roots seemed to not be seriously limited by the volume of the pot while it is difficult to completely exclude whether restricted the root elongation therefore this still needs to be further verified in field experiments in future studies from the perspective of nutrient uptake although elevated co2 promoted root growth inhibition under reduced irrigation conditions more developed roots are necessary to meet increased nutrient requirements caused by the rapid growth of the aboveground under eco2 conditions houshmandfar et al 2015 mcgrath and lobell 2013 plants with psb inoculation were more conducive to investing more dry matter into roots the increased biomass allocation to roots might lead to enhanced potential for roots to acquire nutrients from the soil to further promote plant growth at elevated co2 de graaff et al 2006 iversen 2010 4 2 psb inoculation positively effects on nitrogen absorption under eco2 and reduced irrigation conditions it is suggested above that the increase of root dry matter was advantageous for plants for acquiring water and nutrient in elevated co2 and psb inoculation treatments especially under limiting water conditions however before this conclusion can be drawn the absorption capacity of roots under different treatments needs to be better considered in terms of nitrogen content and accumulation generally durative high co2 concentrations decrease nitrogen content in plants luo et al 2006 our results showed that the n content in different organs significantly decreased by elevated co2 conditions especially in ri treatment table 3 this observation is supported by a previous study that eco2 and water deficit have a synergistic effect on nitrogen reduction in plants due to limitation of no3 uptake with reduced transpiration rate kang et al 2002 therefore the lower nitrogen content may limit the stimulating effect of elevated co2 on crop growth and fruit nutrition under low water irrigation hong et al 2022 sun et al 2012 however we have observed that the reduction of n concentration was alleviated in leaves fruits and roots by psb fertilizer under reduced irrigation and eco2 conditions there is some evidence that an increase of n concentration in plants was observed in the psb treatments forde 2014 santi et al 2017 the increasing trend in n content may associate with the symbiosis between roots and photosynthesis bacteria lee et al 2008 ludden and roberts 2002 contrary to the effect of eco2 on nitrogen concentrations in the organs elevated co2 positively affected the n accumulation under reduced irrigation table 3 nevertheless like some results showed that elevated co2 decreased the efficiency of nitrogen uptake on a dry weight basis in root systems hocking and meyer 1985 o neill et al 1987 while the nitrogen uptake efficiency was positively affected by psb inoculation especially under the ri treatment fig 1 the promotion effect may attribute to the nitrogen fixation mechanism of psb which could transfer more n for host plants through root tips habte and alexander 1980 staddon et al 2002 on the other hand bacterial fluids are rich in amino acids and small molecule peptides which could be easily absorbed by the root system zeid 2009 however reduction in n concentration is also observed in psb inoculated plants in eco2 conditions it is reported that if the above ground production response under high co2 concentration was much greater than the root biomass response the n dilution effect could be inevitable lieffering et al 2004 nevertheless our study provided a possible way to mitigate the limitation of nitrogen absorption under eco2 conditions by improving root development thereby maximizing the stimulative effect of eco2 on the growth and yield of crops grown under low water supplement 4 3 combined psb and eco2 were propitious to the formation of root morphology and antioxidant activity under reduced irrigation conditions in consideration of highly variable responses of root dry weight and n concentration to water irrigation co2 concentration and psb fertilizer the root morphology needs to be studied because root morphology exerts a strong impact on the function of water transport and n absorption george et al 2003 iversen et al 2008 it has been suggested that plants with strong capacity of n absorption generally associate with larger root volume length and effective absorption area samejima et al 2005 there were obvious differences in root morphology between irrigation regimes co2 level and psb treatments table 4 it is known that water deficit could downregulate photosynthesis and consequently decrease roots development xu et al 2010 this conclusion was proved in our results that reduced irrigation negatively affected root morphology as indicated by the lower root s length and root tips table 4 the lower root length and tips or less branched roots reduces the ability of root system to utilize resources from the soil jia and gray 2007 jin and evans 2010 which is also illustrated by the lower root volume and root surface area in the ri treatments however additional photosynthesis assimilates produced under eco2 and psb would be provided for root establishment and maintenance in water stress conditions therefore greater root morphological parameters were observed in co2 and psb treatments table 4 our results show that many metabolites of psb were beneficial for the growth of roots under water stress conditions table 1 for instance photosynthetic bacteria improved lateral root growth and root hair formation by releasing indoleacetic acid dimkpa et al 2009 on the other hand it is reported that ethylene accumulation in roots induced by water stress reduced root hydraulic conductivity by inhibiting root elongation and inhibiting aquaporin activity li et al 2009 psb metabolites contain an acc deaminase enzyme that can inhibit ethylene synthesis thereby avoiding the cumulative excess of ethylene in the root tips to limit the root development under water limited conditions mayak et al 2004 another metabolite salicylic acid also has the function of alleviating cell membrane degradation and oxidative damage caused by abiotic stress wani et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 these advantages for root morphology allow the plant to obtain a root system with more interface for exchanging of resources stover et al 2010 thus strengthening the growth above ground parts from the view of root length classification eco2 and psb mainly increased fine roots which are considered the most active parts of roots for nutrient and water uptake nie et al 2013 since root tip numbers also reflect the lateral root emergence jia et al 2011 the higher root tip numbers in the combination of eco2 and psb treatments may explain more root growth in these treatments than individual eco2 treated plants however this effect of eco2 and psb on root length does not directly improve different class root proportion but only accelerates root elongation fig 2 table 5 it is worth mentioning that the root length induced by high co2 and psb at ri treatment even comparable to those corresponding control observed at fi treatment alone in particular their combination promoted greater advantages on root length of ri treatments table 4 although psb and elevated co2 seem to compensate for their lower root length in low water treated plants they were unable to absorb the same amount of nitrogen due to the decreased n uptake efficiency fig 1 complex mechanism of the difference in n uptake efficiency of roots might also involve root physiological characteristics except for morphology reactive oxygen species ros containing h2o2 and o2 also play a significant role in root growth huang et al 2020 when the ros substantially accumulate in root tips many oxidative injuries may occur in the root cell liszkay et al 2004 consequently resulting in the limitation of root development zhang et al 2015 the mda content is generally indicative of the degree of plant cell damage caused by adverse conditions li et al 2020 in our results as the water content decreases the cellular damage becomes more serious because maximum mda content was observed in ri treatment alone fig 3a it has been shown that mitotic activity in the cell may decrease and even cause membrane structure destruction with mda accumulation ma et al 2015 therefore restriction of cell proliferation in root tips as observed in ri treatments might be associated with the high concentration of mda t√ºt√ºnc√º et al 2019 however the mda contents in roots were substantially lower in psb and eco2 treated plants than those of the control plants fig 3a which is probably because psb and eco2 treatment initiate the activity of ros scavenging related enzymes including pod sod cat and in turn lessen the ros accumulation in root tissue basit et al 2021 in this study we showed that combined treatment of psb and eco2 had a more positive effect on enhancing tomato tolerance to moderate water stress by the promoted activity of antioxidant enzymes fig 3b c d among them sod could catalyze the conversion of o2 to h2o2 gill and tuteja 2010 while the h2o2 would be decomposed and converted to water by pod and cat asada 1992 hassinen et al 2011 therefore we suggested that psb could further induce the antioxidant release in roots under eco2 conditions alter h2o2 and o2 levels and consequently promote the primary root elongation in water stress conditions 4 4 combined psb and eco2 under reduced irrigation greatly improved the tomato yield and quality root system is closely associated with water and nutrition absorption these advantages in roots of psb and eco2 treated plants will ultimately increase tomato yield and quality moderate water deficit can improve crop quality van de wal et al 2017 however positive effect on quality in low water treated plants generally is related to single fruit yield reduction because the nutrients and ion were condensed in the fruit through reducing water content in fruits wu et al 2022 surprisingly eco2 and psb positively affected single fruit weight and their combination compensated for the yield penalty in ri treatments as well as promoted fruit quality table 6 although maximum fruit yield was recorded in psb inoculated plants under elevated co2 conditions with high water supplementation reduced irrigation combination with eco2 and psb produced yields with an acceptable reduction considering their higher quality and irrigation water productivity the increased photosynthesis in response to eco2 might be expected to increase carbohydrate flow to fruits thereby promoting the sugar accumulation ebrahim and saleem 2017 wei et al 2018 but decreasing the nitrogen and vc contents in the fruit our study revealed that psb inoculation further increased the fruit quality of eco2 treated plants including lycopene sugar and vc content and more importantly it makes up for the reduction of nitrogen content in fruit to some extent it is well documented that some hormones contained in psb fertilizer such as indole 3 acetic acid iaa cytokines and 5 aminolevulinic acid ala are major players in fruit development kumar et al 2014 mcatee et al 2013 and the psb used in this research were confirmed for containing the aforementioned hormones table 1 the combination of psb and eco2 also improved the apparent indicators such as fruit firmness and fruit chroma they are propitious to fruit storage during transportation and increased commodity value cherono and workneh 2019 takahashi et al 2014 hence psb fertilizer and eco2 promote plant growth in deficit irrigation and improve fruit quality thus the use of this combination in production practice can comprehensively improve crop yield and quality 5 conclusions collectively this study indicated that elevated co2 generates positive responses of tomato growth under reduced irrigation inoculation of psb further improved the stimulation effectiveness of eco2 on aboveground biomass and our results showed coherence in many root traits response combination of co2 enrichment and psb inoculation were propitious to increase nitrogen uptake efficiency of plant roots and plants nitrogen accumulation under reduced irrigation conditions through increasing the root morphological performance as well as antioxidant defense abilities in the root system elevated co2 and inoculation with psb individually or in combination not only ameliorated yield penalties induced by low irrigated water but their combination obtained the highest irrigation water productivity flavor quality sugar content and sugar acid rate nutritional quality vitamin c and lycopene content and extrinsic quality fruit firmness and fruit chroma which means better tomato fruit storage and transport as well as flavor in summary using the eco2 and psb combination with reduced irrigation regime might be a promising approach to comprehensively improve crop yield and quality in facilities cultivation funding this work was partially supported by national natural science foundation of china

9118,reduced irrigation generally induces the tomato fruit yield reduction but enhance the fruit quality elevated co2 eco2 injection is a common technique for alleviating water stress while eco2 could inevitably lead to the element concentration dilution in the plant organs inoculated with photosynthetic bacteria psb are confirmed to form a symbiotic relationship with crop roots thereby promoting root development and improving crop root nutrient and water uptake capacity yet it remains unknown whether psb could mitigate the adversely effect of nutrient dilution under eco2 condition and the yield decline under reduced irrigation to investigate that two water treatments including reduced irrigation ri plants were irrigated to 75 field water capacity and full irrigation fi plants were irrigated to 90 field water capacity of tomato plants were grown under normal ambient co2 aco2 400 ppm and elevated co2 eco2 800 ppm conditions respectively and photosynthetic bacteria were inoculated in half plants the results showed that inoculation of psb improved the effectiveness of co2 stimulation on biomass and yield in tomato plants grown under reduced irrigation conditions the stimulation effects have been associated with increased advantages linked to their root system we have observed that co2 and psb inoculation promoted the root development and antioxidant abilities these consequently increased nitrogen uptake efficiency under eco2 and reduced irrigation conditions and increased nitrogen accumulation in various organs furthermore eco2 and inoculation with psb individually or in combination ameliorated yield penalties under reduced irrigation conditions combined elevated co2 and inoculation with psb resulted in the highest fruit quality collectively the responses of tomato fruit yield and quality to water reduced irrigation regimes are further enhanced by the combination of eco2 and psb inoculation and this would be efficacious in greenhouse tomato

due to the greenhouse effect induced by rising global co2 levels ault 2020 trenberth 2011 although high co2 concentration is beneficial for agricultural production in terms of crop yield and quality long et al 2004 there still exists an inevitable challenge that crops have to use limited water resources to ensure high crop yields cao et al 2018 therefore it is essential to understand the response of plants with the limited water supplement to elevated co2 concentration to address the agricultural sustainability and food security in the future climate scenario deficit irrigation saves water and improves the water use efficiency of plants patan√® et al 2011 savic et al 2011 better fruit quality is also observed in moderate water stress treated plants murtic et al 2018 p√©k et al 2019 but these benefits were at the cost of reduced fruit yields it is reported that high co2 concentration can compensate for decreased crop yields under moderate water deficit kizildeniz et al 2015 lahive et al 2021 for instance co2 enrichment is generally used in greenhouse cultivation to improve the performance of plants long et al 2004 and mitigate the detrimental effect of water stress by increasing photosynthesis and productivity alonso et al 2012 porras et al 2017 nonetheless high co2 concentration curtails the mass flow of nutrition elements from the rhizosphere soil to plants root loladze 2014 the improvements of crop yield and quality in responses to long term co2 enrichment were worse than expected kant et al 2012 khan et al 2013 and that elevated co2 may not always be beneficial for fruit yield or quality when plants grow under adverse environmental conditions with insufficient nutritional status wang et al 2018 considering the positive effect of certain plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb on plants ge and zhang 2019 harada et al 2005 lee et al 2008 application of pgpb may provide an excellent opportunity for further improving crop yields and quality under eco2 condition as well as under reduced irrigation condition yadav et al 2020 these bacteria associated with roots may have profound effects on plant growth through several mechanisms such as improving the resistance to adverse conditions fixing nitrogen for the host plant and transforming nutrients to stimulate root growth ludden and roberts 2002 pieterse et al 2000 vacheron et al 2013 moreover the effect of pgpb on plant growth promotion are boosted under eco2 condition because photosynthesis in response to elevated co2 could be expected to release more root exudates for symbiotic bacteria drigo et al 2007 grover et al 2015 it has been reported that application of pgpb fertilizer and co2 enrichment acting synergistically may be more effective on crop growth than individual treatments in both optimal and water deficit conditions du et al 2021 therefore inoculation of pgpb possibly has the potential to assist plants in dealing with complex climate conditions in the future yang et al 2009 roots morphological and physiological characteristics significantly affects plants physiological activities larigauderie et al 1994 as the organ that directly participates in the absorption and transport of water and nutrient the greater root density and total root areas are important features associated with higher efficiency of nitrogen uptake in plants hodge 2004 zhou et al 2021 in general root development is directly affected by the environmental factors for instance water stress induces the accumulation of ethylene and reactive oxygen species in root tips thus suppressing the root tip cells division brunetti et al 2021 finally reducing the supply of water and nutrients for above ground growth besides the development of the root system seems unable to meet the nutrient absorption demand of plants due to the boost of above ground growth induced by eco2 conditions nie et al 2013 therefore the application of pgpb will possibly endow more advantages of plant roots under water shortage and eco2 conditions in the future thus providing more nutrients for plant growth among these bacteria photosynthetic bacteria psb as a nitrogen fixing microorganism could provide additional nitrogen supply to the roots of the host plant due to the symbiosis relationship ludden and roberts 2002 apart from the n2 fixation function photosynthetic bacteria significantly augment lateral roots and root hairs formation by secreting 3 indoleacetic acid iaa 5 aminolevulinic acid ala and cytokines ctk rae hyun and song 2007 sasikala and ramana 1998 which could assist plants to withstand abiotic stress egamberdieva and kucharova 2009 previous studies have confirmed either the promotion of psb on plant growth or the stimulation of photosynthesis to high co2 concentration whereas the interactive effects of eco2 psb biofertilizer and reduced irrigation regimes on roots and fruit development in tomato are not thoroughly studied to complement the mechanistic response of tomato plants solanum lycopersicum l with inoculated psb to eco2 and reduced irrigation conditions in this study a climate controlled chamber experiment was conducted the objectives of the study were to explore the interactive effects of psb with eco2 on dry matter distribution nitrogen accumulation root development fruit yield and quality characteristics of tomato plants under reduced irrigation conditions we hypothesized that i a combination of eco2 and psb will alleviate the yield penalties due to the reduction of water irrigation ii psb and eco2 would boost the absorption of water and nitrogen under reduced irrigation conditions by influencing the root morphology and physiology and iii psb inoculation and elevated co2 would further improve the performance of tomato quality to reduced irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and growth conditions the experiment was conducted in two climate controlled chambers at shiyanghe experimental station 37 52 n 102 50 e altitude 1581 m above sea level of china agricultural university wuwei city gansu province china from january to may 2021 the tomato variety cultivated was fortesa cherry tomato at the fourth leaf stage the seedlings were transplanted to a type of 19 l volume pot with a top diameter of 28 cm bottom diameter of 22 cm and a height of 30 cm each pot was filled with 14 kg sandy loam which was collected from the topsoil of local experimental field the soil bulk density of the pot was 1 52 0 08 g cm 3 with a field water capacity Œ∏f of 0 27 0 06 cm3 cm 3 on the 14th day after transplanting all plants were equally allocated to two adjacent climate chambers for cultivation one of the chambers was set with an elevated co2 concentration eco2 and the other was maintained at the average ambient co2 concentration aco2 our previous publication presents more information on the climate chambers other climatic factors in both chambers were set at 28 22 2 day night air temperature and 50 5 relative humidity a 14 hr photoperiod was operated in each chamber and 2000 lux light intensity supplied by two sets of led lamps du et al 2021 2 2 experiment treatments the experiment was conducted in two independent chambers one with eco2 800 ppm and the other with aco2 as control group 400 ppm in each chamber plants were subjected to two water treatments full irrigation treatments fi plants were irrigated to 90 field water capacity and reduced irrigation treatments ri plants were irrigated to 75 field water capacity the water content sensors em50 decagon devices inc usa continuously monitored water content of each treatment all plants were irrigated manually to the upper limit of different water treatments at 17 00 h daily plants were exposed to two sub treatments of bacterial fertilizer photosynthetic bacteria treatments p1 plants were inoculated with photosynthetic bacteria preparation 10 days once and 100 ml of photosynthetic bacteria preparation with approximately 3000 million colony forming units cfu rhodopseudomonas were drenched into soil with water each time and non inoculation of photosynthetic bacteria treatments p0 photosynthetic bacteria preparations were replaced with same amount of water information on photosynthetic bacteria preparations was reported in our previous study du et al 2021 each treatment was set 12 duplicates and total of 48 pots were placed in each chamber the water used for the irrigation was tap water and 5 hoagland solution was applied to satisfy the other nutrient requirements for plant growth in seedling and fruiting stages 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 the lc ms analysis of the photosynthetic bacteria components photosynthetic bacteria components were determined by metware biotechnology company wuhan china the photosynthetic bacteria liquid was separated into three duplicates and each sample 50 Œºl was mixed with 150 Œºl extract solution acetonitrile methanol 1 4 volume ratio after centrifuging at 12000 revolutions per minute rpm for 10 min under 4 c 150 Œºl supernatant was taken from the mixture and placed at 20 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 3 min 4 c again 120 Œºl aliquots of supernatant were transferred for lc ms analysis all samples were acquired by the lc ms system followed machine orders to determine their components the 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid deaminase acc deaminase was determined by the bacteria elisa method according to saleh and glick 2001 2 3 2 dry matter accumulation and nitrogen content after 80 days of cultivation three replicated plants with consistent growth were harvested in each treatment and then roots stems and leaves were separated and they were placed in the oven at 105 for deactivation of enzymes and dried at 80 until constant dry weight then the dry matter weight of these organs was measured and nitrogen content was determined by the kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer using dried samples song et al 2015 nitrogen accumulation mg plant 1 was described as the product of n concentration mg g 1 and dry matter weight g nitrogen uptake efficiency ne was calculated according to the eqs 1 and 2 described by larigauderie et al 1994 1 ne root weight n uptake root dry weight 2 ne root length n uptake root length where ne root weight is the nitrogen uptake efficiency based on root dry weight ne root length is the nitrogen uptake efficiency based on root length is the integral of n uptake quantity and root dry weight from the first sampling date 25 days after treatment to the fourth sampling date 70 days after treatment root dry weights and n accumulation values obtained from different treatments at each sampling date were used for the integration of root dry weight and n uptake respectively nitrogen uptake per unit root length was calculated from the second sampling date 40 days after treatment to the fourth sampling date because the root length was not measured at first and second sampling date root length at second sampling date was defined as a common initial root length of 1000 mm for all treatments 2 3 3 root morphology parameters to examine the root morphology index the whole roots of six plants for each treatment were washed with deionized water to remove impurities and ensure that the nutrition substance attached to the root surface was completely rinsed away after that three replicates were quickly placed in liquid nitrogen and stored in a 80 freezer for physiological indicators analysis the remaining three samples were used for the determination of the root morphological index roots were separated and placed into the transparent trays loaded with small amounts of water and root crowns were manually separated to ensure they do not overlap with each other the transparent tray was scanned using the epson scanner v700 usa and images were taken at 1200 dpi and analyzed with the winrhizo software to measure total root length total root volume total root surface area and average diameter 2 3 4 determination of malondialdehyde contents and antioxidant enzyme activity the malondialdehyde contents mda in roots were determined according to the thiobarbituric acid reaction method banerjee et al 2016 all measurements were performed with three replicates for each treatment superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat activity were assayed following the method of arora et al 2012 peroxidase pod activity was determined according to the method described by kole≈°ka et al 2017 2 3 5 fruit yield and quality parameters at the final harvest the yield was measured as the weight of all fruits for each plant and irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as the ratio of fruit yields g plant 1 and the total amount of irrigated water m3 plant 1 red matured fruits were picked from the first ear of plants for quality measurement quality parameters included single fruit weight fruit firmness total acid ta total soluble sugar tss vitamin c vc and lycopene single fruit weight was measured as the average of all fruit weights in the first ear of plants fruit firmness was measured by a fruit hardness meter hpeii fff bareiss germany subsequently the fruits of each treatment were cut into small pieces and mashed thoroughly with a fruit blender total soluble sugar was determined according to the anthrone colorimetric method described by yemm and wills 1954 the total organic acid concentration was determined by titration method kaur et al 2013 the sugar acid ratio sar was calculated as the ratio of tss to ta vitamin c concentrations were determined by dichloroindophenol titrimetric method zhai et al 2015 tomato lycopene contents were analyzed by uv 2500 spectrophotometer fish et al 2002 a portable colorimeter cm 23d konica minolta holdings inc japan was used to determine the fruit color parameters including l lightness a green red shade and b blue yellow shade four fruits per replicate were randomly sampled and fruit chroma was calculated by equation 3 richardson and hobson 1987 3 fruit chroma a l a 2 b 2 2 4 data analysis all data in this study were expressed as mean standard error sd a significance level of 0 05 was used for testing the treatment differences three way analysis of variance anova was performed for comparing the differences between means of variables co2 concentration c irrigation regime i and psb inoculation p the statistical analyses were conducted using spss software version 23 0 ibm corp 3 results 3 1 identification of photosynthetic bacteria and their metabolic components through lc ms analysis the amino acids and their derivatives vitamins and organic acids in the photosynthetic bacteria solution are shown in table 1 the photosynthetic bacteria solution is rich in variety of amino acids and vitamins besides growth promoting hormones such as 5 aminosalicylic acid indoleacetic acid and 5 aminolevulinic acid were identified in the photosynthetic bacteria solution an acc deaminase that can inhibit the synthesis of the ethylene precursor was also identified in the bacteria solution table 1 3 2 plant dry matter accumulation and distribution in different organs the dry matter accumulation and distribution in different organs are listed in table 2 both above and under ground dry matter were significantly increased in eco2 and high water treatments whereas the stem dry matter was not affected by psb inoculation the interaction of eco2 and water supply affected the dry matter in different organs and the high water treated plants under eco2 conditions had larger fruit yields with greater leaves and roots dry matter compared to the corresponding plants at aco2 levels elevated co2 increased the dry matter of aboveground by 98 98 and 89 57 in ri and fi treatments respectively and the roots dry matter were increased by 20 82 and 38 71 respectively the interaction between the irrigation regime eco2 and psb showed significant effects on the dry matter accumulation as well table 2 the eco2 and psb inoculation significantly increased the leaves roots and fruits dry matter accumulation besides this effect was more obvious with the increase of irrigation amount table 2 compared with the corresponding plants grown under aco2 conditions combination of eco2 and psb increased the dry weight of above ground biomass that was increased by 109 84 and 105 50 in the ri and fi treatments respectively and the root biomass was increased by 37 76 and 63 23 it is noteworthy that the greatest fruit dry weight was observed in psb inoculated plants subjected to high water treatment at eco2 conditions the distribution of dry matter in different organs was also significantly affected by the psb and irrigation regimes under different co2 concentrations the distribution of dry matter in the roots was significantly decreased under elevated co2 conditions but was not affected by irrigation amount a similar variation trend was observed in leaf dry matter distribution however under eco2 conditions the dry matter proportion in fruit significantly decreased in both ri and fi treatments table 2 psb treatments showed greater dry matter distribution in roots and leaves but a lower stem proportion of dry matter additionally the elevated co2 concentration resulted in a significant reduction in the root shoot ratio under various irrigation amounts however the root shoot ratio significantly increased in psb treatments 3 3 plants nitrogen concentration and accumulation in different organs the nitrogen concentration and nitrogen accumulation in tomato organs are presented in table 3 generally eco2 significantly decreased the content of n in all organs and the interaction of eco2 and ri significantly decreased the n content in leaves as well table 3 however the results of n accumulation in organs showed a different trend elevated co2 significantly promoted n accumulation in the leaves stems and roots but n accumulation in ri treatment was lower compared to fi treatment under eco2 conditions overall compared with corresponding plants under aco2 conditions eco2 increased total n accumulation by 69 81 and 56 23 under ri and fi treatments respectively the n accumulation was further enhanced by psb in leaves and roots under eco2 conditions and the total n accumulation of combined psb and eco2 treatments was increased by 82 64 and 82 12 under ri and fi conditions compared with those grown under aco2 conditions furthermore fig 3 showed that the n uptake efficiency per unit root dry weight in eco2 concentration was lower than those in aco2 condition and fi treatment significantly decreased n uptake efficiency per unit root dry weight nevertheless the psb inoculation increased the uptake efficiency of plants grown both in co2 and water treatments a similar trend was also observed for n uptake efficiency on a root length basis 3 4 root morphological and physiological traits root average diameter total root length and root surface area were showed in table 4 plants with reduced irrigation had lower root length root volume surface area and root tip numbers in different co2 conditions greater values of these parameters were recorded in psb inoculated plants except for the average diameter of roots the interactive effect of eco2 and psb significantly influenced the total root volume root length and root surface area of plants it was shown that the combination of eco2 and psb treatment improved these root parameters of plants with fi treatment the most followed by ri treatment from root classification the largest tomato root lengths were observed in the 0 10 0 15 mm range of diameter fig 2 although the proportion of root length in ri and fi treatment was not affected by eco2 or psb treatment eco2 and psb inoculation and their combination significantly increased the root length of 0 10 0 15 mm diameters table 5 and this promoting effect was especially more pronounced in elevated eco2 conditions malondialdehyde mda content in tomato roots is shown in fig 3a both eco2 and psb inoculation significantly reduced mda content in plant roots in both water treatments especially combined treatment of eco2 and psb treatment showed a more evidently inhibitory effect on the concentration of mda in the ri treatment the amelioration of eco2 and psb to reactive oxygen species ros scavenging was possibly associated with regulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes so the activity of sod pod and cat in tomato roots were analyzed fig 3b c d elevated co2 or psb treatment significantly enhanced the activity of sod and their combination led to the maximum increase in sod activity in roots similarly pod content also increased in response to eco2 treatment and inoculation of psb further promoted the pod activity under eco2 conditions in contrast psb treatment and irrigation regimes on plants did not significantly regulate the cat activity as compared to control plants but cat activity increased in response to individual eco2 or combined treatment of eco2 and psb 3 5 tomato fruit yield and quality co2 levels irrigation regimes psb and the interaction between these factors did not affect the fruit shape index fruit numbers were solely affected by co2 levels and eco2 significantly increased the fruit number as expected eco2 increased the fruit yield of plants in all water treatments more importantly psb inoculation further enhanced tomato yield in those grown under eco2 conditions table 6 the highest yield was recorded in the plants treated with combined eco2 psb and fi treatments followed by the psb inoculated plants grown under eco2 and ri treatments the effect of co2 enrichment and psb on iwp was similar with yield eco2 led to greater iwp for all irrigation treatments and the increase was more pronounced for ri treatment it is worth note that the greatest irrigation water productivity was observed in ri treatments with combination of psb and eco2 conditions the vc and ta content of tomatoes were not affected by irrigation regimes but plants with reduced irrigation had higher tss lycopene and sar in both co2 concentrations greater lycopene tss and vc were observed in tomato fruits from plants grown under eco2 conditions compared with those in aco2 conditions in addition ri prominently promoted the chroma in fruits harvested from eco2 conditions except for the organic acid it was shown that the treatment with the highest flavor quality index tss and sar and nutritional indicators vc and lycopene content was the combination of psb and ri treated plants under eco2 conditions table 6 4 discussion 4 1 psb inoculation and eco2 enrichment improved the dry matter accumulation of the plants under reduced irrigation although plant biomass decreased under reduced irrigation compared with full irrigation treatment table 2 our study tested that eco2 could increase the crop biomass under water stress conditions similar observations are reported by balbinot et al 2021 and wei et al 2018 however response of dry matter to elevated co2 was not consistent in plants with different bacterial fertilizer treatments inoculation with psb improved the effectiveness of co2 stimulation of plant biomass by 10 89 and 15 93 under reduced water treatments and full irrigation treatments respectively table 2 meanwhile psb and eco2 treated plants have stronger root system which was partly reflected in their higher dry weight inoculation of psb further enhanced the eco2 stimulated effect on root dry weight by 12 83 and 25 89 under ri and fi conditions respectively accordingly advantages linked to roots were further promoted by psb under eco2 conditions to facilitate more nutrition and water absorption from the soil for photosynthesis stulen and den hertog 1993 however reduction of the root shoot ratio indicated that the stimulating effect of eco2 on the increase in root system was lower than that on shoots table 2 which was also reported by ziska and teramura 1992 considering that the tomato plants were potted in this experiment the reduced root shoot ratio may be partly due to the limitation of pots volume especially in the great roots of eco2 treatments studies have shown that root restriction caused by small containers may lead to reduction of straight roots in crops peterson et al 1991 van iersel 1997 from our root classification results the proportion of straight roots diameter 0 15 showed no significantly difference between aco2 and eco2 conditions but the root length of this grade was significantly increased by eco2 conditions fig 2 it is can be inferred that the growth of roots seemed to not be seriously limited by the volume of the pot while it is difficult to completely exclude whether restricted the root elongation therefore this still needs to be further verified in field experiments in future studies from the perspective of nutrient uptake although elevated co2 promoted root growth inhibition under reduced irrigation conditions more developed roots are necessary to meet increased nutrient requirements caused by the rapid growth of the aboveground under eco2 conditions houshmandfar et al 2015 mcgrath and lobell 2013 plants with psb inoculation were more conducive to investing more dry matter into roots the increased biomass allocation to roots might lead to enhanced potential for roots to acquire nutrients from the soil to further promote plant growth at elevated co2 de graaff et al 2006 iversen 2010 4 2 psb inoculation positively effects on nitrogen absorption under eco2 and reduced irrigation conditions it is suggested above that the increase of root dry matter was advantageous for plants for acquiring water and nutrient in elevated co2 and psb inoculation treatments especially under limiting water conditions however before this conclusion can be drawn the absorption capacity of roots under different treatments needs to be better considered in terms of nitrogen content and accumulation generally durative high co2 concentrations decrease nitrogen content in plants luo et al 2006 our results showed that the n content in different organs significantly decreased by elevated co2 conditions especially in ri treatment table 3 this observation is supported by a previous study that eco2 and water deficit have a synergistic effect on nitrogen reduction in plants due to limitation of no3 uptake with reduced transpiration rate kang et al 2002 therefore the lower nitrogen content may limit the stimulating effect of elevated co2 on crop growth and fruit nutrition under low water irrigation hong et al 2022 sun et al 2012 however we have observed that the reduction of n concentration was alleviated in leaves fruits and roots by psb fertilizer under reduced irrigation and eco2 conditions there is some evidence that an increase of n concentration in plants was observed in the psb treatments forde 2014 santi et al 2017 the increasing trend in n content may associate with the symbiosis between roots and photosynthesis bacteria lee et al 2008 ludden and roberts 2002 contrary to the effect of eco2 on nitrogen concentrations in the organs elevated co2 positively affected the n accumulation under reduced irrigation table 3 nevertheless like some results showed that elevated co2 decreased the efficiency of nitrogen uptake on a dry weight basis in root systems hocking and meyer 1985 o neill et al 1987 while the nitrogen uptake efficiency was positively affected by psb inoculation especially under the ri treatment fig 1 the promotion effect may attribute to the nitrogen fixation mechanism of psb which could transfer more n for host plants through root tips habte and alexander 1980 staddon et al 2002 on the other hand bacterial fluids are rich in amino acids and small molecule peptides which could be easily absorbed by the root system zeid 2009 however reduction in n concentration is also observed in psb inoculated plants in eco2 conditions it is reported that if the above ground production response under high co2 concentration was much greater than the root biomass response the n dilution effect could be inevitable lieffering et al 2004 nevertheless our study provided a possible way to mitigate the limitation of nitrogen absorption under eco2 conditions by improving root development thereby maximizing the stimulative effect of eco2 on the growth and yield of crops grown under low water supplement 4 3 combined psb and eco2 were propitious to the formation of root morphology and antioxidant activity under reduced irrigation conditions in consideration of highly variable responses of root dry weight and n concentration to water irrigation co2 concentration and psb fertilizer the root morphology needs to be studied because root morphology exerts a strong impact on the function of water transport and n absorption george et al 2003 iversen et al 2008 it has been suggested that plants with strong capacity of n absorption generally associate with larger root volume length and effective absorption area samejima et al 2005 there were obvious differences in root morphology between irrigation regimes co2 level and psb treatments table 4 it is known that water deficit could downregulate photosynthesis and consequently decrease roots development xu et al 2010 this conclusion was proved in our results that reduced irrigation negatively affected root morphology as indicated by the lower root s length and root tips table 4 the lower root length and tips or less branched roots reduces the ability of root system to utilize resources from the soil jia and gray 2007 jin and evans 2010 which is also illustrated by the lower root volume and root surface area in the ri treatments however additional photosynthesis assimilates produced under eco2 and psb would be provided for root establishment and maintenance in water stress conditions therefore greater root morphological parameters were observed in co2 and psb treatments table 4 our results show that many metabolites of psb were beneficial for the growth of roots under water stress conditions table 1 for instance photosynthetic bacteria improved lateral root growth and root hair formation by releasing indoleacetic acid dimkpa et al 2009 on the other hand it is reported that ethylene accumulation in roots induced by water stress reduced root hydraulic conductivity by inhibiting root elongation and inhibiting aquaporin activity li et al 2009 psb metabolites contain an acc deaminase enzyme that can inhibit ethylene synthesis thereby avoiding the cumulative excess of ethylene in the root tips to limit the root development under water limited conditions mayak et al 2004 another metabolite salicylic acid also has the function of alleviating cell membrane degradation and oxidative damage caused by abiotic stress wani et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 these advantages for root morphology allow the plant to obtain a root system with more interface for exchanging of resources stover et al 2010 thus strengthening the growth above ground parts from the view of root length classification eco2 and psb mainly increased fine roots which are considered the most active parts of roots for nutrient and water uptake nie et al 2013 since root tip numbers also reflect the lateral root emergence jia et al 2011 the higher root tip numbers in the combination of eco2 and psb treatments may explain more root growth in these treatments than individual eco2 treated plants however this effect of eco2 and psb on root length does not directly improve different class root proportion but only accelerates root elongation fig 2 table 5 it is worth mentioning that the root length induced by high co2 and psb at ri treatment even comparable to those corresponding control observed at fi treatment alone in particular their combination promoted greater advantages on root length of ri treatments table 4 although psb and elevated co2 seem to compensate for their lower root length in low water treated plants they were unable to absorb the same amount of nitrogen due to the decreased n uptake efficiency fig 1 complex mechanism of the difference in n uptake efficiency of roots might also involve root physiological characteristics except for morphology reactive oxygen species ros containing h2o2 and o2 also play a significant role in root growth huang et al 2020 when the ros substantially accumulate in root tips many oxidative injuries may occur in the root cell liszkay et al 2004 consequently resulting in the limitation of root development zhang et al 2015 the mda content is generally indicative of the degree of plant cell damage caused by adverse conditions li et al 2020 in our results as the water content decreases the cellular damage becomes more serious because maximum mda content was observed in ri treatment alone fig 3a it has been shown that mitotic activity in the cell may decrease and even cause membrane structure destruction with mda accumulation ma et al 2015 therefore restriction of cell proliferation in root tips as observed in ri treatments might be associated with the high concentration of mda t√ºt√ºnc√º et al 2019 however the mda contents in roots were substantially lower in psb and eco2 treated plants than those of the control plants fig 3a which is probably because psb and eco2 treatment initiate the activity of ros scavenging related enzymes including pod sod cat and in turn lessen the ros accumulation in root tissue basit et al 2021 in this study we showed that combined treatment of psb and eco2 had a more positive effect on enhancing tomato tolerance to moderate water stress by the promoted activity of antioxidant enzymes fig 3b c d among them sod could catalyze the conversion of o2 to h2o2 gill and tuteja 2010 while the h2o2 would be decomposed and converted to water by pod and cat asada 1992 hassinen et al 2011 therefore we suggested that psb could further induce the antioxidant release in roots under eco2 conditions alter h2o2 and o2 levels and consequently promote the primary root elongation in water stress conditions 4 4 combined psb and eco2 under reduced irrigation greatly improved the tomato yield and quality root system is closely associated with water and nutrition absorption these advantages in roots of psb and eco2 treated plants will ultimately increase tomato yield and quality moderate water deficit can improve crop quality van de wal et al 2017 however positive effect on quality in low water treated plants generally is related to single fruit yield reduction because the nutrients and ion were condensed in the fruit through reducing water content in fruits wu et al 2022 surprisingly eco2 and psb positively affected single fruit weight and their combination compensated for the yield penalty in ri treatments as well as promoted fruit quality table 6 although maximum fruit yield was recorded in psb inoculated plants under elevated co2 conditions with high water supplementation reduced irrigation combination with eco2 and psb produced yields with an acceptable reduction considering their higher quality and irrigation water productivity the increased photosynthesis in response to eco2 might be expected to increase carbohydrate flow to fruits thereby promoting the sugar accumulation ebrahim and saleem 2017 wei et al 2018 but decreasing the nitrogen and vc contents in the fruit our study revealed that psb inoculation further increased the fruit quality of eco2 treated plants including lycopene sugar and vc content and more importantly it makes up for the reduction of nitrogen content in fruit to some extent it is well documented that some hormones contained in psb fertilizer such as indole 3 acetic acid iaa cytokines and 5 aminolevulinic acid ala are major players in fruit development kumar et al 2014 mcatee et al 2013 and the psb used in this research were confirmed for containing the aforementioned hormones table 1 the combination of psb and eco2 also improved the apparent indicators such as fruit firmness and fruit chroma they are propitious to fruit storage during transportation and increased commodity value cherono and workneh 2019 takahashi et al 2014 hence psb fertilizer and eco2 promote plant growth in deficit irrigation and improve fruit quality thus the use of this combination in production practice can comprehensively improve crop yield and quality 5 conclusions collectively this study indicated that elevated co2 generates positive responses of tomato growth under reduced irrigation inoculation of psb further improved the stimulation effectiveness of eco2 on aboveground biomass and our results showed coherence in many root traits response combination of co2 enrichment and psb inoculation were propitious to increase nitrogen uptake efficiency of plant roots and plants nitrogen accumulation under reduced irrigation conditions through increasing the root morphological performance as well as antioxidant defense abilities in the root system elevated co2 and inoculation with psb individually or in combination not only ameliorated yield penalties induced by low irrigated water but their combination obtained the highest irrigation water productivity flavor quality sugar content and sugar acid rate nutritional quality vitamin c and lycopene content and extrinsic quality fruit firmness and fruit chroma which means better tomato fruit storage and transport as well as flavor in summary using the eco2 and psb combination with reduced irrigation regime might be a promising approach to comprehensively improve crop yield and quality in facilities cultivation funding this work was partially supported by national natural science foundation of china

9119,accurate and comprehensive modelling aimed at investigating the impact of climate change on rainfed crop yields is of great importance due to the interconnected issues of water scarcity and food security because the process based and statistical approaches to simulating crop yields are different in nature a comparison between them is needed this study investigates the accuracy of crop yield simulations in the historical period as well as future projections using two modelling approaches 1 a process based approach employing the soil and water assessment tool swat model and 2 a statistical approach employing a data driven model feed forward back propagation neural network ffbpnn over a medium sized catchment in north western poland the application of two potential evapotranspiration methods penman monteith and hargreaves in swat permitted calibration 2004 2011 and validation 2012 2019 of runoff and yields of winter wheat and spring barley different combinations of climatic parameters with a drought index based on joint deficit index were applied to simulate and project rainfed crop yields winter wheat barley potato rye rapeseed sugar beets cereals maize for grain maize for green forage pulses with ffbpnn the results reveal that adding the new drought index helped increase the ffbpnn performance this approach showed that future yields of the studied crops would slightly increase under rcp8 5 by 2060 winter wheat and spring barley projections from swat showed very small changes using both the penman monteith and hargreaves method policy wise the results should be of interest to climate change adaptation practitioners and food security experts future studies should aim at more thorough investigation of the role of the downscaling technique and extreme events as well as the effect of elevated co2 on future crop yields graphical abstract ga1 keywords global warming oder river basin baltic sea basin machine learning artificial neural network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to an increase in anomalies in the atmosphere in recent years such as climate change several aspects of human life have been under threat this has a significant effect on water the most crucial material in the environment that all living things depend on zepeda 2001 salehnia et al 2020 global warming has been identified as a vital issue in the context of climate change during the current and future centuries zepeda 2001 pachauri et al 2014 tomczyk et al 2022 several studies have shown that lack of water is critical for life security food security and the economy world bank 2005 for example traore et al 2013 revealed that an increase in maximum temperature in mali leads to a reduction in cotton yield affecting the economy in northern thailand rainfed rice and corn production may be reduced under climate change conditions influencing food security and the economy amnuaylojaroen et al 2021 all of these factors are interlinked evaluation of the future and prevention of acute situations requires availability of a simulation of the future for scientists and authorities pachauri et al 2014 the accuracy of estimations plays a significant role here obtaining a robust and reliable estimate of these conditions involved the development of several methods in different fields of science general circulation models gcms have been developed and used for climate change projections over the last three decades pachauri et al 2014 chen et al 2021a gcms are numerical models capable of interpreting physical interactions of the atmosphere and ocean to simulate global climate response to rising greenhouse gas emissions different methods are developed in the realm of hydrology using different concepts such as the process based and statistical approaches gassman et al 2007 finally like in hydrology as a representative of food production crop yield modelling could be based on different approaches and concepts van klompenburg et al 2020 dinh and aires 2021 moreover both hydrological and crop models are commonly forced by gcms to project the future state of water resources and crop yields respectively tao et al 2020 some complex hydrological models also have their crop growth modules and can serve both purposes statistical approaches aim to find links between a set of meaningful and effective variables and crop yield chlingaryan et al 2018 leng and hall 2020 van klompenburg et al 2020 these approaches are based on data and long term datasets are needed for high estimation accuracy leng and hall 2020 the very nature of crop datasets is that they contain only one value per year for a given crop and spatial unit dinh and aires 2021 different numerical methods have been applied to address this observation of data scarcity with a robust model and projections for example machine learning ml a member of data driven and artificial intelligence ai methods focusing on learning is a useful method that can predict and simulate crop yields based on several features chlingaryan et al 2018 van klompenburg et al 2020 ml can discover patterns and similarities between inputs and outputs the models need to be trained using datasets the results are interpreted based on prior information and knowledge chlingaryan et al 2018 van klompenburg et al 2020 moreover several statistical regression based models such as the panel absolut and irma are employed to simulate crop yields hsiao 2014 conradt et al 2016 gornott and wechsung 2016 salehnia et al 2020 conradt 2021 several studies have used ai methods to simulate crop yields in different regions and climatic conditions for example ru√ü et al 2008 applied neural networks to predict wheat yield using nitrogen fertilizer red edge inflection point vegetation index and soil electrical conductivity everingham et al 2009 used forward stagewise algorithm to forecast regional sugarcane crop production in another study clustering methods random forest and support vector machine were employed to obtain a robust model for wheat yield prediction ru√ü and kruse 2010 in the studies weather parameters were directly applied as inputs in statistical models however a drought indicator based on precipitation or soil moisture data could also have substantial effects on the accuracy of statistical models peichl et al 2018 salehnia et al 2020 artificial neural networks anns have been employed more frequently than other ai methods due to their higher flexibility in crop yield simulations van klompenburg et al 2020 according to literature different inputs such as satellite datasets climatic variables soil properties and geographic information are included in anns to simulate crop yields ru√ü et al 2008 baral √ßakƒ±r et al 2011 2014 matsumura et al 2015 gandhi et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 crane droesch 2018 anns are a technique that identifies the underlying relationship between data by processing them neural network training aims to learn the process and provide an appropriate output for each input anns can detect complex nonlinear relationships between input and output vectors khatibi et al 2020 snieder et al 2020 abhishek et al 2021 kundu and sinha 2021 shinde et al 2021 in process based approaches crop simulation is based on physical or empirical equations gassman et al 2007 leng and hall 2020 in these models inputs could be remarkably simple or numerous datasets could be included in the modelling process williams et al 1989 gassman et al 2007 an example of widely used process based model with high input data requirements is the soil and water assessment tool swat recently extensively revised into the new version called swat bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 2018 nkwasa et al 2022 wagner et al 2022 swat has been used to model various agronomic practices assess the impact of climate change on hydrology and crop yields and project nutrient loads in basins gassman et al 2007 piniewski et al 2017 eini et al 2020 tan et al 2021 swat as an agro eco hydrological model has been widely used for crop yield simulations in regions with different climatic conditions worldwide sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 chen et al 2021b eini et al 2021a jeyrani et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 delavar et al 2022 in the aforementioned studies however only one of the potential evapotranspiration pet methods in the swat model was employed swat covers three pet methods including hargreaves temperature based method priestley taylor radiation based method and penman monteith temperature and radiation based method actual evapotranspiration in swat is controlled by the pet method and each of the aforementioned methods could provide different results under climate change scenarios the necessity of the comparisons between these methods is well described in lemaitre basset et al 2021 a comparison of the penman monteith and hargreaves methods under humid conditions was presented in trajkovic 2007 in this field of research different models have been shown to provide different results for the projections which shows the high level uncertainty in crop models tao et al 2020 major worldwide projects have attempted to assess and adjust crop simulators and measure control or decrease uncertainties from the crop simulator method in projecting climate effects on crop yield for example two large scale projects agmip ruane et al 2017 and macsur projects ewert et al 2015 focused on this objective tao et al 2018 tao et al 2020 this study s primary objective is to compare the statistical and process based modelling approaches in the simulation and projection of crop yields in the we≈Çna catchment located in the north western part of poland the study is based on the following three hypotheses a a high temperature increase projected under the rcp8 5 scenario would lead to a decline in crop yields projected by both types of models in north western poland b crop yields projected by process based models would depend on the selected pet method and c drought based indicators i e spi have advantages over direct use of weather parameters in statistical simulations of crop yields 2 methodology 2 1 case study a humid continental climate catchment in central europe was selected to simulate and project crop yields the we≈Çna catchment is a flat catchment located in poland and part of the oder river basin siniecki 2009 wira 2011 knoben 2013 eini et al 2022b the local agricultural activities are based on rainfed crops the catchment has relatively homogeneous climatic conditions more details on the catchment such as the applied data and weather conditions are available in eini et al 2022a fig 1 presents the position of the we≈Çna catchment land use stream network discharge stations and sub basin configuration for process based modelling the dominant agricultural crops in the study area include winter wheat 30 of the area 135 500 ha and spring barley 14 8 of the area 21 500 ha the growing period of the majority of spring crops starts in the second half of march or first half of april in this region of poland droughts are reported to happen most frequently and lead to largest crop losses in poland oleksiak et al 2022 2 2 the soil and water assessment tool and crop simulation the swat agro hydrological model an extensively modified version of the swat is a relatively new model used in this study as the process based model more details available in wagner et al 2022 nkwasa et al 2022 and bailey et al 2022 swat simulates the plant growth process by employing a basic version of the epic s generic crop growth method williams et al 1989 crop maturity is based on accumulating either days to maturity a new option in swat or potential heat units once the total heat units required to reach crop maturity or days to maturity are exceeded the crop growth ends daily biomass production is affected by static absorbed photosynthetically active radiation radiation use efficiency of the crop and lai leaf area index nair et al 2011 musyoka et al 2021 in swat evaporation and evapotranspiration are assessed by a preliminary computation of potential evaporation pet representing the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the penman monteith and hargreaves methods were used to calculate pet for a better understanding of crop yields in the future and to evaluate the influence of these methods on crop yields in the we≈Çna catchment hargreaves and samani 1985 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith method uses net radiation relative humidity 2 m wind speed and air temperature but the hargreaves method only uses air temperature considering 2001 2003 as the warm up period the swat model was calibrated for the period 2004 2011 and validated for the years 2012 2019 for daily runoff and crop yields winter wheat and spring barley the calibration and validation steps employed 20 parameters including soil parameters k bd awc hydrologic response unit parameters cn2 ovn lat ttime canmx esco epco perco surlag groundwater parameters alpha bf max deep seep flo min revap co revap min sp yld and channel parameters chn chk the ranges and optimal values of the calibrated parameters are available in the study by eini et al 2022a where the hydrological component of swat was applied for the first time to focus on crop yield simulations and reduce the duplication with the preceding study runoff modelling and its details are excluded from the results section readers can find more details about the model setup and runoff results in eini et al 2022a an important feature of the swat setup from the point of view of crop yield calibration is a crop specific land cover map and timing of key management operations for all crops in this study we used the same land use map that was prepared for the poland wide swat model marcinkowski et al 2021 table 1 presents sowing and harvest dates for six crops included in the swat setup for the we≈Çna catchment including two most dominant ones namely winter wheat and spring barley used in further assessments 2 3 artificial neural network structure due to the widespread use of anns as a simulation tool for earth s processes the feed forward back propagation neural network ffbpnn complete theoretical background available in shinde et al 2021 widely examined in earth process modelling and predicting was employed coulibaly et al 2000 samani et al 2007 zounemat kermani et al 2019 abhishek et al 2021 ffbpnn consists of one input one or more hidden layers where data are processed to build a model and the output layer where outputs are generated moreover ffbpnn can be categorised in multilayer perceptron mlp neural network models 2 3 1 feed forward back propagation neural network architecture some initial parameters should be fixed to start simulating with ffbpnn models the article provides brief information about these initialisations first by means of a trial and error process using all the inputs and outputs the levenberg marquardt backpropagation lmbp algorithm was found to be the best algorithm for ffbpnn training complete details of the lmbp algorithm are described by lv et al 2017 moreover lmbp has been used in several hydrological earth process studies and has been recognised as a reliable training algorithm with a more accurate curve fitting ability utilised in input output data coulibaly et al 2000 samani et al 2007 zounemat kermani et al 2019 khatibi et al 2020 snieder et al 2020 abhishek et al 2021 kundu and sinha 2021 additionally the sigmoid and linear activation functions commonly utilised for earth process modelling objectives were employed in the hidden and output layers deo and ≈üahin 2016 zounemat kermani 2017 zounemat kermani et al 2019 one hidden layer was chosen for ffbpnn topology based on several studies due to its sufficient ability to simulate complex systems such as earth or hydrological processes deo et al 2019 zounemat kermani et al 2019 and snieder et al 2020 the ideal number of neurons between 5 and 15 in the hidden layer was determined by means of the trial and error method in accordance with the mse and the value of 10 was selected fig 2 displays the ffbpnn schematic in our study in the current study 70 of data were used for train 15 for validation and 15 for test periods 2 4 meteorological drought index this study employs the joint deficit index jdi method for meteorological drought calculation jdi is developed based on the standardised precipitation index spi and its structure kao and govindaraju and mirabbasi et al 2010 2013 in this study we have applied gamma distribution to determine spi and because using the jdi method is different from the standard spi method it is called mod spi a derived monthly drought index mod spi based on jdi can simultaneously detect emerging and prolonged meteorological droughts mirabbasi et al 2013 jdi represents the overall precipitation deficiency situation regarding the joint accumulative probability jdi therefore presents a more sophisticated evaluation of the meteorological drought status moreover jdi can support monthly step meteorological drought evaluation the amount needed for rainfall to attain normal situations in the following months can be concluded by jdi kao and govindaraju 2010 mirabbasi et al 2013 the classification scale of mod spi is the same as spi the ranges and differences are described in bazrafshan et al 2015 because all crops in our case study are rainfed employing a robust method for determining the meteorological drought is necessary and could improve the trustworthiness and reliability of the results moreover jdi is sensitive to previous months droughts which is a good representer of drought monthly and seasonal and is effective in crop yield modelling crops such as winter wheat rye and winter barley are sensitive to precipitation during winter and spring other crops in our case study such as potato and maize are sensitive to the amount of precipitation during spring and summer piniewski et al 2020 yearly precipitation data are therefore inadequate and could increase statistical models error and uncertainty for crop yield simulations furthermore monthly precipitation indicates only the amount of precipitation in a particular month in other words it is independent of the previous month s precipitation we used 30 years 1990 2019 of precipitation data to obtain a robust statistical index for drought to determine mod spi 2 5 climate change scenarios in this study 19 gcms under the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were downscaled wilby and wigley 1997 to the rcp8 5 scenario the concentration of carbon dioxide that delivers global warming at an average of 8 5 watts m2 by 2100 which is the worst projection according to riahi et al 2011 and two different time horizons 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in the we≈Çna catchment this study employed lars wg 6 0 built in gcms table 2 lars wg 6 0 containing 19 gcms based on the ipcc fifth assessment report is a stochastic weather generator and downscaling tool for generating regional scale climate scenarios https sites google com view lars wg precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation are four weather parameters extracted from built in gcms in lars wg 6 0 chen et al 2021a https www ipcc ch the downscaling process as well as input for statistical modelling employed the lars wg 6 0 statistical downscaling model kolberg et al 2019 the performance of lars wg 6 0 in generating historical time series was statistically acceptable according to p value 0 05 for all the weather parameters the authors wrote a script in python to apply the climate change effect on the swat model inputs the script reads swat input pcp tmp slr and by using the delta change method applies the climatic changes to the input https github com mr eini swat plus climate change code table 2 shows all the considered climatic models and three climatic scenarios selected for further consideration based on average relative changes in precipitation pcp and average absolute temperature change tmp the first climatic scenario is the moderate scenario the second one is the warm and dry scenario and the third one is the warm and wet scenario the precipitation and temperature changes of the middle gcm for each time horizon average changes in precipitation and temperature relative to other gcms are selected as the moderate scenario considering the maximum increment in temperature and the maximum decrement in precipitation simultaneously the gcm of the warm and dry scenario was selected finally a gcm for the warm and wet scenario was chosen based on the maximum temperature increment and precipitation increment fig 3 presents the condition of these scenarios compared to other scenarios for the time horizon 2021 2040 ncar cesm1 cam5 moderate scenario hadgem2 es warm and dry scenario and gfdl cm3 warm and wet scenario were selected for climatic projections accordingly for the time horizon 2041 2060 cmcc cm moderate scenario hadgem2 es warm and dry scenario and gfdl cm3 warm and wet scenario were selected for climatic projections 2 6 data selection and statistical indices this study employed principal component analysis pca a 2d diagram analysis approach of pca was employed to 1 discover the relationship between weather inputs to ascertain how they correlated to or diverged from each other before starting using ffbpnn 2 identify the similarity between crops this step also helped select crops with higher divergencies from each other these steps lead to a more robust and reliable statistical model and avoid overtraining fitting the model by decreasing the number of vectors on both sides of the model the input and output vectors were normalised between 0 and 1 before applying them to pca so that all vectors have the same weight for evaluation and testing the accuracy of modelled datasets nse nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias percent bias mse mean square error cc coefficient of correlation mae mean absolute error rmse root mean square error and r square coefficient of determination were applied the indices are described in hydrogof r package moreover some examples of applications acceptable ranges and optimum values can be found in several studies such as eini et al 2021b eini et al 2019 duan et al 2016 moriasi et al 2015 and ritter and munoz carpena 2013 2 7 software packages and environments the employed approaches are presented in fig 4 in addition to the flow chart with consecutive study steps moreover the sources of the employed data software packages and environments are included in table 3 the crop yield data used for the calibration of the statistical model were extracted from the datasets mentioned in table 3 at the wielkopolska province level the wet weight yield data were corrected to the dry matter yield before calibration in swat 3 results 3 1 data pre processing time series datasets were normalised between 0 and 1 and pca was used to identify differences and similarities between input and output data individually the correlation coefficient matrices are shown in table 4 for inputs climatic parameters and mod spi and table 5 for crop yields as presented in table 4 a clear correlation between precipitation mm and mod spi is observed maximum and minimum temperature c and solar radiation mj m2 had no strong correlation to each other and had a negative correlation with precipitation and mod spi hence precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation were included as the major variables for inputs using mod spi vectors created a different structure for the ffbpnn model according to table 5 10 different crops were selected as output in ffbpnn we have excluded basic and mixed cereals basic cereals oats triticale mixed cereals oil seed and sunflower due to high correlation with other crops and incomplete time series in some of the crops i e sunflower winter wheat barley potato rye sugar beet rapeseed maize for grain maize for green forage and pulses show the most negligible correlation these can be counted as the major crops relative to other crops in the study area fig 5 the red and pink points in fig 5 depict the number of years i e 1999 is 1 2000 is 2 and so on fig 5 also shows that crops are clustered into three major groups in the pca plot 1 cereals 2 root crops and maize 3 rapeseed oil seed and pulses sunflower is an outlier possibly due to missing data according to table 5 almost all the crops have the least correlation with sunflower pulses and oil seed 3 2 process based approach based on the swat model next to runoff details described in eini et al 2022a crop yields of winter wheat and spring barley were calibrated by means of two different pet methods the outputs of the model and observed values are presented in table 6 the violin plot in fig 6 depicts the variation of swat results which is much higher than in the observed dataset according to fig 7 penman monteith method shows higher crop yields i e winter wheat and spring barley in the wet years with very wet 2010 being an exception while for lower crop yields both pet methods have rather close crop yields moreover in dry 2006 characterized by low crop yields both pet methods simulated considerably lower values than the observed ones in addition in 2015 a year with severe drought in central europe ionita et al 2017 laaha et al 2017 observed crop yields did not experience a considerable decrement but both pet methods had lower crop yields than the observed data the reason may be that drought conditions developed in august thus affecting mainly late harvest crops whereas winter wheat and spring barley are harvested early and suffer mostly from spring droughts piniewski et al 2020 oleksiak et al 2022 3 3 statistical approach the study involved testing of 14 different combinations of inputs in ffbpnn table 7 presents the combination of inputs and the result of training validation and test steps for all combinations in this approach all types of crops were added into the one ffbpnn model according to r2 and rmse in table 7 increasing the number of inputs improves the performance ffbpnn according to the results scenario m had comparatively superior performance to other scenarios and was selected as the best scenario moreover it can be seen that the drought indicator has significantly improved the result of the statistical approach in crop yield simulation we first compared all the generated crop yields in standardised values with the observed values for the final evaluation fig 8 shows the beeswarm plot and notched box plot of standardised values according to the beeswarm plot the ffbpnn model did not accurately simulate the maximum and minimum values but the density of points between 0 5 and 0 5 are close the notched box plot shows no considerable differences for the medians similarly the median and average of the ffbpnn model have the same values and the range between the first and third quartile of the box for ffbpnn is wider than the observed data the analysis of individual crops is presented in a half violin plot in fig 9 the half violin plot is useful for the assessment of the distribution of each dataset for example for spring barley both datasets ffbpnn and observed have a similar distribution but the generated datasets for pulses or maize for green forage show different distribution multimodal or more than one peak than the observed data fig 9 generally shows that the variation of the generated dataset and observed dataset are in the same range and there are no significant differences between the observed and generated values for each crop for a more detailed investigation standard statistical indices are presented in table 8 according to table 8 ffbpnn has simulated crop yields with high accuracy for whole period the average cc is 0 90 and mse for sugar beets and maize for green forage is higher than the other crops due to crop yield differences all nse values are above 0 70 and the average of this index is 0 78 which is an acceptable result finally mae shows less than 1 ton ha mean absolute error on average 3 4 effect of climate change on crop yield this section assesses the effect of climate change on crop yields first we evaluated swat results using two pet methods and the statistical approach 3 4 1 effect of climate change on crop yields based on the process based approach the effect of climate change on crops is evaluated by implementing the climatic scenarios changes in precipitation and temperature on the calibrated model table 9 shows no significant decrease or increase in winter wheat and barley crop yields on average penman monteith shows a slight decrease in crop yields in warm and dry situations results based on the hargreaves method show lower variations than the penman monteith method it could be concluded that under the selected scenarios and two time horizons crop yields are expected to not experience a notable change 3 4 2 effect of climate change on crop yield based on the statistical approach according to the result for three scenarios in two different time horizons using ffbpnn a the highest increases were observed in maize for green forage 9 5 and cereals 8 1 b this approach generally shows more increment in crop yield for the warm and dry scenario c on average an approximately 0 8 ton ha increase in crop yield is expected d pulses yield is estimated to decrease by approximately 2 5 in all scenarios table 10 presents the average changes in crop yield and percentage of change results show that the ffbpnn method has estimated an increment in crop yields for all crops excluding pulses only for the near period 2021 2040 under the moderate scenario the process based model using the penman monteith method showed an increase in winter wheat yields 0 66 in other scenarios the yield of this crop is expected to decrease the hargreaves method however shows a positive trend for winter wheat yield under all the scenarios and periods which is similar to ffbpnn results under the warm and dry scenario for both time horizons and pet methods barley yields are expected to decrease from 0 77 to 4 88 in other scenarios a rise in barley yields is projected 0 73 5 64 ffbpnn projects similar behaviour increment 4 discussion according to studies discussed in the introduction section different behaviour in crop yield projections is expected using different modelling approaches under climate change conditions in this regard we simulated crop yields with the application of the machine learning method ffbpn and a process based model swat the machine learning method employed not only weather parameters but also a modified spi index in several studies however soil information was critical in crop yield modelling based on a statistical approach followed by nutrients and field management chlingaryan et al 2018 modanesi et al 2020 tao et al 2020 van klompenburg et al 2020 these parameters however are still rare and largely inaccessible in many regions 4 1 improvements in statistical approach by drought indicators using climatic parameters such as precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation directly in statistical models is a common way of simulating crop yields conradt 2022 in addition to these parameters we employed spi as a drought indicator our results show that employing a metrological drought index as an input can increase the reliability of the statistical approach in crop yield modelling some studies in germany and india revealed that soil moisture anomalies are a good predictor of silage maize yields which supports our results peichl et al 2018 modanesi et al 2020 4 2 accuracy of swat model and ffbpnn we employed two different pet methods within the swat model for the process based approach this model proved to be a valuable tool for crop yield simulation and projections in several studies eini et al 2021a jeyrani et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 delavar et al 2022 our result proved that swat and ffbpnn can simulate crop yield reasonably well which is consistent with other studies eini et al 2021a jeyrani et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 it should be mentioned that swat simulates higher variability of crop yield compared to the observed data this could be explained by the fact that the observed data is an average of farm level data across an area wielkopolska province larger than the catchment making the spatially averaged yield statistics less variable swat has a reasonable crop yield estimation in years with normal precipitation but there are some opposite trends and correlations between observed data and models in some years 4 3 effect of climate change on crop yields the effect of climate change on crop yields showed no substantial changes in winter wheat and spring barley yields based on swat other research however revealed that the average total wheat yields could increase during the future period salehnia et al 2020 according to the results of three climatic projections ffbpnn shows an increment in crop yields for warm and dry scenarios approximately 0 8 tons ha different studies show that using different models and climatic scenarios can lead to different results of crop yield projections particularly based on machine learning methods for both an increase and decrease under similar conditions √ßakƒ±r et al 2014 ewert et al 2015 matsumura et al 2015 gandhi et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 chlingaryan et al 2018 crane droesch 2018 tao et al 2018 kolberg et al 2019 leng and hall 2020 tao et al 2020 van klompenburg et al 2020 chen et al 2021b eini et al 2021a studies on yield projections in poland have been scarce to date while there is a strong evidence on the effect of drought on decreasing yields in historical records ≈Çabƒôdzki and bƒÖk 2017 oleksiak et al 2022 this study is one of the first that provides quantitative estimates of future yields 4 4 limitations and outlook the aforementioned differences between these two approaches may result from the fact that ffbpnn is based on observed data and uses a statistical method to project crop yield in contrast swat as a process based model uses empirical equations to project crop yield unseen situations for precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperature c and solar radiation mj m2 under climate change scenarios could be a source of uncertainty in ffbpnn results and make the results inaccurate one of the hypotheses in this study was the negative effect of climate change on crop yields under rcp8 5 our results reveal that in this region the hypothesis could be rejected it should be mentioned however that both approaches could have uncertainties due to unseen climatic situations in the calibration period but this effect could be more critical in statistical modelling due to the fact that swat has been already implemented in areas with temperature higher than that in the current study area the pet method also does not considerably affect crop yield projections in the study area in the process based approach however we would like to recommend examining the process based approach in more arid climatic zones where irrigation is applied the last hypothesis was that adding a drought indicator could increase the accuracy of the statistical model the results of the employed statistical model show that adding spi as an additional input parameter increases the models accuracy and could lead to more reliable projection results 5 conclusion the study employed two different approaches to simulate and project rainfed crop yields in the we≈Çna catchment in poland over the historical period 2001 2019 and two future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 we found that adding a meteorological drought index as an additional input parameter improved the accuracy of our statistical approach we also found that winter wheat and spring barley yields are projected to change very little under future climate based on swat according to the results from ffbpnn yields of various studied crops were projected to increase in most cases and the highest increase was recorded for potato and grain maize in a wider context there is a concern that central europe currently faces increased frequency and severity of droughts piniewski et al 2022 strongly contributing to crop losses beillouin et al 2020 trnka et al 2020 br√°s et al 2021 while future warming is certain with its magnitude largely dependent on the emission scenario future precipitation change in central europe is much less certain our results from two independent approaches show no major crop losses in north western poland even under the warm and dry scenario although it is not in contrast with the existing research at the european level see e g meta analysis of knox et al 2016 this poses an interpretational challenge that future studies should address two issues are of particular interest 1 the role of downscaling techniques 2 the role of co2 effect in the case of the former the question is if future crop yield projections from process based models driven by more sophisticated downscaling techniques e g bias corrected rcms show a different pattern than those obtained using a simple delta change method failing to take into account changes in climate variability and extreme events fowler et al 2007 in the case of the latter the globally projected increase in atmospheric co2 concentration adds another layer of complexity to the already complex problem with impacts on transpiration photosynthesis and water use efficiency

9119,accurate and comprehensive modelling aimed at investigating the impact of climate change on rainfed crop yields is of great importance due to the interconnected issues of water scarcity and food security because the process based and statistical approaches to simulating crop yields are different in nature a comparison between them is needed this study investigates the accuracy of crop yield simulations in the historical period as well as future projections using two modelling approaches 1 a process based approach employing the soil and water assessment tool swat model and 2 a statistical approach employing a data driven model feed forward back propagation neural network ffbpnn over a medium sized catchment in north western poland the application of two potential evapotranspiration methods penman monteith and hargreaves in swat permitted calibration 2004 2011 and validation 2012 2019 of runoff and yields of winter wheat and spring barley different combinations of climatic parameters with a drought index based on joint deficit index were applied to simulate and project rainfed crop yields winter wheat barley potato rye rapeseed sugar beets cereals maize for grain maize for green forage pulses with ffbpnn the results reveal that adding the new drought index helped increase the ffbpnn performance this approach showed that future yields of the studied crops would slightly increase under rcp8 5 by 2060 winter wheat and spring barley projections from swat showed very small changes using both the penman monteith and hargreaves method policy wise the results should be of interest to climate change adaptation practitioners and food security experts future studies should aim at more thorough investigation of the role of the downscaling technique and extreme events as well as the effect of elevated co2 on future crop yields graphical abstract ga1 keywords global warming oder river basin baltic sea basin machine learning artificial neural network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to an increase in anomalies in the atmosphere in recent years such as climate change several aspects of human life have been under threat this has a significant effect on water the most crucial material in the environment that all living things depend on zepeda 2001 salehnia et al 2020 global warming has been identified as a vital issue in the context of climate change during the current and future centuries zepeda 2001 pachauri et al 2014 tomczyk et al 2022 several studies have shown that lack of water is critical for life security food security and the economy world bank 2005 for example traore et al 2013 revealed that an increase in maximum temperature in mali leads to a reduction in cotton yield affecting the economy in northern thailand rainfed rice and corn production may be reduced under climate change conditions influencing food security and the economy amnuaylojaroen et al 2021 all of these factors are interlinked evaluation of the future and prevention of acute situations requires availability of a simulation of the future for scientists and authorities pachauri et al 2014 the accuracy of estimations plays a significant role here obtaining a robust and reliable estimate of these conditions involved the development of several methods in different fields of science general circulation models gcms have been developed and used for climate change projections over the last three decades pachauri et al 2014 chen et al 2021a gcms are numerical models capable of interpreting physical interactions of the atmosphere and ocean to simulate global climate response to rising greenhouse gas emissions different methods are developed in the realm of hydrology using different concepts such as the process based and statistical approaches gassman et al 2007 finally like in hydrology as a representative of food production crop yield modelling could be based on different approaches and concepts van klompenburg et al 2020 dinh and aires 2021 moreover both hydrological and crop models are commonly forced by gcms to project the future state of water resources and crop yields respectively tao et al 2020 some complex hydrological models also have their crop growth modules and can serve both purposes statistical approaches aim to find links between a set of meaningful and effective variables and crop yield chlingaryan et al 2018 leng and hall 2020 van klompenburg et al 2020 these approaches are based on data and long term datasets are needed for high estimation accuracy leng and hall 2020 the very nature of crop datasets is that they contain only one value per year for a given crop and spatial unit dinh and aires 2021 different numerical methods have been applied to address this observation of data scarcity with a robust model and projections for example machine learning ml a member of data driven and artificial intelligence ai methods focusing on learning is a useful method that can predict and simulate crop yields based on several features chlingaryan et al 2018 van klompenburg et al 2020 ml can discover patterns and similarities between inputs and outputs the models need to be trained using datasets the results are interpreted based on prior information and knowledge chlingaryan et al 2018 van klompenburg et al 2020 moreover several statistical regression based models such as the panel absolut and irma are employed to simulate crop yields hsiao 2014 conradt et al 2016 gornott and wechsung 2016 salehnia et al 2020 conradt 2021 several studies have used ai methods to simulate crop yields in different regions and climatic conditions for example ru√ü et al 2008 applied neural networks to predict wheat yield using nitrogen fertilizer red edge inflection point vegetation index and soil electrical conductivity everingham et al 2009 used forward stagewise algorithm to forecast regional sugarcane crop production in another study clustering methods random forest and support vector machine were employed to obtain a robust model for wheat yield prediction ru√ü and kruse 2010 in the studies weather parameters were directly applied as inputs in statistical models however a drought indicator based on precipitation or soil moisture data could also have substantial effects on the accuracy of statistical models peichl et al 2018 salehnia et al 2020 artificial neural networks anns have been employed more frequently than other ai methods due to their higher flexibility in crop yield simulations van klompenburg et al 2020 according to literature different inputs such as satellite datasets climatic variables soil properties and geographic information are included in anns to simulate crop yields ru√ü et al 2008 baral √ßakƒ±r et al 2011 2014 matsumura et al 2015 gandhi et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 crane droesch 2018 anns are a technique that identifies the underlying relationship between data by processing them neural network training aims to learn the process and provide an appropriate output for each input anns can detect complex nonlinear relationships between input and output vectors khatibi et al 2020 snieder et al 2020 abhishek et al 2021 kundu and sinha 2021 shinde et al 2021 in process based approaches crop simulation is based on physical or empirical equations gassman et al 2007 leng and hall 2020 in these models inputs could be remarkably simple or numerous datasets could be included in the modelling process williams et al 1989 gassman et al 2007 an example of widely used process based model with high input data requirements is the soil and water assessment tool swat recently extensively revised into the new version called swat bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 2018 nkwasa et al 2022 wagner et al 2022 swat has been used to model various agronomic practices assess the impact of climate change on hydrology and crop yields and project nutrient loads in basins gassman et al 2007 piniewski et al 2017 eini et al 2020 tan et al 2021 swat as an agro eco hydrological model has been widely used for crop yield simulations in regions with different climatic conditions worldwide sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 chen et al 2021b eini et al 2021a jeyrani et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 delavar et al 2022 in the aforementioned studies however only one of the potential evapotranspiration pet methods in the swat model was employed swat covers three pet methods including hargreaves temperature based method priestley taylor radiation based method and penman monteith temperature and radiation based method actual evapotranspiration in swat is controlled by the pet method and each of the aforementioned methods could provide different results under climate change scenarios the necessity of the comparisons between these methods is well described in lemaitre basset et al 2021 a comparison of the penman monteith and hargreaves methods under humid conditions was presented in trajkovic 2007 in this field of research different models have been shown to provide different results for the projections which shows the high level uncertainty in crop models tao et al 2020 major worldwide projects have attempted to assess and adjust crop simulators and measure control or decrease uncertainties from the crop simulator method in projecting climate effects on crop yield for example two large scale projects agmip ruane et al 2017 and macsur projects ewert et al 2015 focused on this objective tao et al 2018 tao et al 2020 this study s primary objective is to compare the statistical and process based modelling approaches in the simulation and projection of crop yields in the we≈Çna catchment located in the north western part of poland the study is based on the following three hypotheses a a high temperature increase projected under the rcp8 5 scenario would lead to a decline in crop yields projected by both types of models in north western poland b crop yields projected by process based models would depend on the selected pet method and c drought based indicators i e spi have advantages over direct use of weather parameters in statistical simulations of crop yields 2 methodology 2 1 case study a humid continental climate catchment in central europe was selected to simulate and project crop yields the we≈Çna catchment is a flat catchment located in poland and part of the oder river basin siniecki 2009 wira 2011 knoben 2013 eini et al 2022b the local agricultural activities are based on rainfed crops the catchment has relatively homogeneous climatic conditions more details on the catchment such as the applied data and weather conditions are available in eini et al 2022a fig 1 presents the position of the we≈Çna catchment land use stream network discharge stations and sub basin configuration for process based modelling the dominant agricultural crops in the study area include winter wheat 30 of the area 135 500 ha and spring barley 14 8 of the area 21 500 ha the growing period of the majority of spring crops starts in the second half of march or first half of april in this region of poland droughts are reported to happen most frequently and lead to largest crop losses in poland oleksiak et al 2022 2 2 the soil and water assessment tool and crop simulation the swat agro hydrological model an extensively modified version of the swat is a relatively new model used in this study as the process based model more details available in wagner et al 2022 nkwasa et al 2022 and bailey et al 2022 swat simulates the plant growth process by employing a basic version of the epic s generic crop growth method williams et al 1989 crop maturity is based on accumulating either days to maturity a new option in swat or potential heat units once the total heat units required to reach crop maturity or days to maturity are exceeded the crop growth ends daily biomass production is affected by static absorbed photosynthetically active radiation radiation use efficiency of the crop and lai leaf area index nair et al 2011 musyoka et al 2021 in swat evaporation and evapotranspiration are assessed by a preliminary computation of potential evaporation pet representing the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the penman monteith and hargreaves methods were used to calculate pet for a better understanding of crop yields in the future and to evaluate the influence of these methods on crop yields in the we≈Çna catchment hargreaves and samani 1985 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith method uses net radiation relative humidity 2 m wind speed and air temperature but the hargreaves method only uses air temperature considering 2001 2003 as the warm up period the swat model was calibrated for the period 2004 2011 and validated for the years 2012 2019 for daily runoff and crop yields winter wheat and spring barley the calibration and validation steps employed 20 parameters including soil parameters k bd awc hydrologic response unit parameters cn2 ovn lat ttime canmx esco epco perco surlag groundwater parameters alpha bf max deep seep flo min revap co revap min sp yld and channel parameters chn chk the ranges and optimal values of the calibrated parameters are available in the study by eini et al 2022a where the hydrological component of swat was applied for the first time to focus on crop yield simulations and reduce the duplication with the preceding study runoff modelling and its details are excluded from the results section readers can find more details about the model setup and runoff results in eini et al 2022a an important feature of the swat setup from the point of view of crop yield calibration is a crop specific land cover map and timing of key management operations for all crops in this study we used the same land use map that was prepared for the poland wide swat model marcinkowski et al 2021 table 1 presents sowing and harvest dates for six crops included in the swat setup for the we≈Çna catchment including two most dominant ones namely winter wheat and spring barley used in further assessments 2 3 artificial neural network structure due to the widespread use of anns as a simulation tool for earth s processes the feed forward back propagation neural network ffbpnn complete theoretical background available in shinde et al 2021 widely examined in earth process modelling and predicting was employed coulibaly et al 2000 samani et al 2007 zounemat kermani et al 2019 abhishek et al 2021 ffbpnn consists of one input one or more hidden layers where data are processed to build a model and the output layer where outputs are generated moreover ffbpnn can be categorised in multilayer perceptron mlp neural network models 2 3 1 feed forward back propagation neural network architecture some initial parameters should be fixed to start simulating with ffbpnn models the article provides brief information about these initialisations first by means of a trial and error process using all the inputs and outputs the levenberg marquardt backpropagation lmbp algorithm was found to be the best algorithm for ffbpnn training complete details of the lmbp algorithm are described by lv et al 2017 moreover lmbp has been used in several hydrological earth process studies and has been recognised as a reliable training algorithm with a more accurate curve fitting ability utilised in input output data coulibaly et al 2000 samani et al 2007 zounemat kermani et al 2019 khatibi et al 2020 snieder et al 2020 abhishek et al 2021 kundu and sinha 2021 additionally the sigmoid and linear activation functions commonly utilised for earth process modelling objectives were employed in the hidden and output layers deo and ≈üahin 2016 zounemat kermani 2017 zounemat kermani et al 2019 one hidden layer was chosen for ffbpnn topology based on several studies due to its sufficient ability to simulate complex systems such as earth or hydrological processes deo et al 2019 zounemat kermani et al 2019 and snieder et al 2020 the ideal number of neurons between 5 and 15 in the hidden layer was determined by means of the trial and error method in accordance with the mse and the value of 10 was selected fig 2 displays the ffbpnn schematic in our study in the current study 70 of data were used for train 15 for validation and 15 for test periods 2 4 meteorological drought index this study employs the joint deficit index jdi method for meteorological drought calculation jdi is developed based on the standardised precipitation index spi and its structure kao and govindaraju and mirabbasi et al 2010 2013 in this study we have applied gamma distribution to determine spi and because using the jdi method is different from the standard spi method it is called mod spi a derived monthly drought index mod spi based on jdi can simultaneously detect emerging and prolonged meteorological droughts mirabbasi et al 2013 jdi represents the overall precipitation deficiency situation regarding the joint accumulative probability jdi therefore presents a more sophisticated evaluation of the meteorological drought status moreover jdi can support monthly step meteorological drought evaluation the amount needed for rainfall to attain normal situations in the following months can be concluded by jdi kao and govindaraju 2010 mirabbasi et al 2013 the classification scale of mod spi is the same as spi the ranges and differences are described in bazrafshan et al 2015 because all crops in our case study are rainfed employing a robust method for determining the meteorological drought is necessary and could improve the trustworthiness and reliability of the results moreover jdi is sensitive to previous months droughts which is a good representer of drought monthly and seasonal and is effective in crop yield modelling crops such as winter wheat rye and winter barley are sensitive to precipitation during winter and spring other crops in our case study such as potato and maize are sensitive to the amount of precipitation during spring and summer piniewski et al 2020 yearly precipitation data are therefore inadequate and could increase statistical models error and uncertainty for crop yield simulations furthermore monthly precipitation indicates only the amount of precipitation in a particular month in other words it is independent of the previous month s precipitation we used 30 years 1990 2019 of precipitation data to obtain a robust statistical index for drought to determine mod spi 2 5 climate change scenarios in this study 19 gcms under the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were downscaled wilby and wigley 1997 to the rcp8 5 scenario the concentration of carbon dioxide that delivers global warming at an average of 8 5 watts m2 by 2100 which is the worst projection according to riahi et al 2011 and two different time horizons 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in the we≈Çna catchment this study employed lars wg 6 0 built in gcms table 2 lars wg 6 0 containing 19 gcms based on the ipcc fifth assessment report is a stochastic weather generator and downscaling tool for generating regional scale climate scenarios https sites google com view lars wg precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation are four weather parameters extracted from built in gcms in lars wg 6 0 chen et al 2021a https www ipcc ch the downscaling process as well as input for statistical modelling employed the lars wg 6 0 statistical downscaling model kolberg et al 2019 the performance of lars wg 6 0 in generating historical time series was statistically acceptable according to p value 0 05 for all the weather parameters the authors wrote a script in python to apply the climate change effect on the swat model inputs the script reads swat input pcp tmp slr and by using the delta change method applies the climatic changes to the input https github com mr eini swat plus climate change code table 2 shows all the considered climatic models and three climatic scenarios selected for further consideration based on average relative changes in precipitation pcp and average absolute temperature change tmp the first climatic scenario is the moderate scenario the second one is the warm and dry scenario and the third one is the warm and wet scenario the precipitation and temperature changes of the middle gcm for each time horizon average changes in precipitation and temperature relative to other gcms are selected as the moderate scenario considering the maximum increment in temperature and the maximum decrement in precipitation simultaneously the gcm of the warm and dry scenario was selected finally a gcm for the warm and wet scenario was chosen based on the maximum temperature increment and precipitation increment fig 3 presents the condition of these scenarios compared to other scenarios for the time horizon 2021 2040 ncar cesm1 cam5 moderate scenario hadgem2 es warm and dry scenario and gfdl cm3 warm and wet scenario were selected for climatic projections accordingly for the time horizon 2041 2060 cmcc cm moderate scenario hadgem2 es warm and dry scenario and gfdl cm3 warm and wet scenario were selected for climatic projections 2 6 data selection and statistical indices this study employed principal component analysis pca a 2d diagram analysis approach of pca was employed to 1 discover the relationship between weather inputs to ascertain how they correlated to or diverged from each other before starting using ffbpnn 2 identify the similarity between crops this step also helped select crops with higher divergencies from each other these steps lead to a more robust and reliable statistical model and avoid overtraining fitting the model by decreasing the number of vectors on both sides of the model the input and output vectors were normalised between 0 and 1 before applying them to pca so that all vectors have the same weight for evaluation and testing the accuracy of modelled datasets nse nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias percent bias mse mean square error cc coefficient of correlation mae mean absolute error rmse root mean square error and r square coefficient of determination were applied the indices are described in hydrogof r package moreover some examples of applications acceptable ranges and optimum values can be found in several studies such as eini et al 2021b eini et al 2019 duan et al 2016 moriasi et al 2015 and ritter and munoz carpena 2013 2 7 software packages and environments the employed approaches are presented in fig 4 in addition to the flow chart with consecutive study steps moreover the sources of the employed data software packages and environments are included in table 3 the crop yield data used for the calibration of the statistical model were extracted from the datasets mentioned in table 3 at the wielkopolska province level the wet weight yield data were corrected to the dry matter yield before calibration in swat 3 results 3 1 data pre processing time series datasets were normalised between 0 and 1 and pca was used to identify differences and similarities between input and output data individually the correlation coefficient matrices are shown in table 4 for inputs climatic parameters and mod spi and table 5 for crop yields as presented in table 4 a clear correlation between precipitation mm and mod spi is observed maximum and minimum temperature c and solar radiation mj m2 had no strong correlation to each other and had a negative correlation with precipitation and mod spi hence precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation were included as the major variables for inputs using mod spi vectors created a different structure for the ffbpnn model according to table 5 10 different crops were selected as output in ffbpnn we have excluded basic and mixed cereals basic cereals oats triticale mixed cereals oil seed and sunflower due to high correlation with other crops and incomplete time series in some of the crops i e sunflower winter wheat barley potato rye sugar beet rapeseed maize for grain maize for green forage and pulses show the most negligible correlation these can be counted as the major crops relative to other crops in the study area fig 5 the red and pink points in fig 5 depict the number of years i e 1999 is 1 2000 is 2 and so on fig 5 also shows that crops are clustered into three major groups in the pca plot 1 cereals 2 root crops and maize 3 rapeseed oil seed and pulses sunflower is an outlier possibly due to missing data according to table 5 almost all the crops have the least correlation with sunflower pulses and oil seed 3 2 process based approach based on the swat model next to runoff details described in eini et al 2022a crop yields of winter wheat and spring barley were calibrated by means of two different pet methods the outputs of the model and observed values are presented in table 6 the violin plot in fig 6 depicts the variation of swat results which is much higher than in the observed dataset according to fig 7 penman monteith method shows higher crop yields i e winter wheat and spring barley in the wet years with very wet 2010 being an exception while for lower crop yields both pet methods have rather close crop yields moreover in dry 2006 characterized by low crop yields both pet methods simulated considerably lower values than the observed ones in addition in 2015 a year with severe drought in central europe ionita et al 2017 laaha et al 2017 observed crop yields did not experience a considerable decrement but both pet methods had lower crop yields than the observed data the reason may be that drought conditions developed in august thus affecting mainly late harvest crops whereas winter wheat and spring barley are harvested early and suffer mostly from spring droughts piniewski et al 2020 oleksiak et al 2022 3 3 statistical approach the study involved testing of 14 different combinations of inputs in ffbpnn table 7 presents the combination of inputs and the result of training validation and test steps for all combinations in this approach all types of crops were added into the one ffbpnn model according to r2 and rmse in table 7 increasing the number of inputs improves the performance ffbpnn according to the results scenario m had comparatively superior performance to other scenarios and was selected as the best scenario moreover it can be seen that the drought indicator has significantly improved the result of the statistical approach in crop yield simulation we first compared all the generated crop yields in standardised values with the observed values for the final evaluation fig 8 shows the beeswarm plot and notched box plot of standardised values according to the beeswarm plot the ffbpnn model did not accurately simulate the maximum and minimum values but the density of points between 0 5 and 0 5 are close the notched box plot shows no considerable differences for the medians similarly the median and average of the ffbpnn model have the same values and the range between the first and third quartile of the box for ffbpnn is wider than the observed data the analysis of individual crops is presented in a half violin plot in fig 9 the half violin plot is useful for the assessment of the distribution of each dataset for example for spring barley both datasets ffbpnn and observed have a similar distribution but the generated datasets for pulses or maize for green forage show different distribution multimodal or more than one peak than the observed data fig 9 generally shows that the variation of the generated dataset and observed dataset are in the same range and there are no significant differences between the observed and generated values for each crop for a more detailed investigation standard statistical indices are presented in table 8 according to table 8 ffbpnn has simulated crop yields with high accuracy for whole period the average cc is 0 90 and mse for sugar beets and maize for green forage is higher than the other crops due to crop yield differences all nse values are above 0 70 and the average of this index is 0 78 which is an acceptable result finally mae shows less than 1 ton ha mean absolute error on average 3 4 effect of climate change on crop yield this section assesses the effect of climate change on crop yields first we evaluated swat results using two pet methods and the statistical approach 3 4 1 effect of climate change on crop yields based on the process based approach the effect of climate change on crops is evaluated by implementing the climatic scenarios changes in precipitation and temperature on the calibrated model table 9 shows no significant decrease or increase in winter wheat and barley crop yields on average penman monteith shows a slight decrease in crop yields in warm and dry situations results based on the hargreaves method show lower variations than the penman monteith method it could be concluded that under the selected scenarios and two time horizons crop yields are expected to not experience a notable change 3 4 2 effect of climate change on crop yield based on the statistical approach according to the result for three scenarios in two different time horizons using ffbpnn a the highest increases were observed in maize for green forage 9 5 and cereals 8 1 b this approach generally shows more increment in crop yield for the warm and dry scenario c on average an approximately 0 8 ton ha increase in crop yield is expected d pulses yield is estimated to decrease by approximately 2 5 in all scenarios table 10 presents the average changes in crop yield and percentage of change results show that the ffbpnn method has estimated an increment in crop yields for all crops excluding pulses only for the near period 2021 2040 under the moderate scenario the process based model using the penman monteith method showed an increase in winter wheat yields 0 66 in other scenarios the yield of this crop is expected to decrease the hargreaves method however shows a positive trend for winter wheat yield under all the scenarios and periods which is similar to ffbpnn results under the warm and dry scenario for both time horizons and pet methods barley yields are expected to decrease from 0 77 to 4 88 in other scenarios a rise in barley yields is projected 0 73 5 64 ffbpnn projects similar behaviour increment 4 discussion according to studies discussed in the introduction section different behaviour in crop yield projections is expected using different modelling approaches under climate change conditions in this regard we simulated crop yields with the application of the machine learning method ffbpn and a process based model swat the machine learning method employed not only weather parameters but also a modified spi index in several studies however soil information was critical in crop yield modelling based on a statistical approach followed by nutrients and field management chlingaryan et al 2018 modanesi et al 2020 tao et al 2020 van klompenburg et al 2020 these parameters however are still rare and largely inaccessible in many regions 4 1 improvements in statistical approach by drought indicators using climatic parameters such as precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation directly in statistical models is a common way of simulating crop yields conradt 2022 in addition to these parameters we employed spi as a drought indicator our results show that employing a metrological drought index as an input can increase the reliability of the statistical approach in crop yield modelling some studies in germany and india revealed that soil moisture anomalies are a good predictor of silage maize yields which supports our results peichl et al 2018 modanesi et al 2020 4 2 accuracy of swat model and ffbpnn we employed two different pet methods within the swat model for the process based approach this model proved to be a valuable tool for crop yield simulation and projections in several studies eini et al 2021a jeyrani et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 delavar et al 2022 our result proved that swat and ffbpnn can simulate crop yield reasonably well which is consistent with other studies eini et al 2021a jeyrani et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 it should be mentioned that swat simulates higher variability of crop yield compared to the observed data this could be explained by the fact that the observed data is an average of farm level data across an area wielkopolska province larger than the catchment making the spatially averaged yield statistics less variable swat has a reasonable crop yield estimation in years with normal precipitation but there are some opposite trends and correlations between observed data and models in some years 4 3 effect of climate change on crop yields the effect of climate change on crop yields showed no substantial changes in winter wheat and spring barley yields based on swat other research however revealed that the average total wheat yields could increase during the future period salehnia et al 2020 according to the results of three climatic projections ffbpnn shows an increment in crop yields for warm and dry scenarios approximately 0 8 tons ha different studies show that using different models and climatic scenarios can lead to different results of crop yield projections particularly based on machine learning methods for both an increase and decrease under similar conditions √ßakƒ±r et al 2014 ewert et al 2015 matsumura et al 2015 gandhi et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 chlingaryan et al 2018 crane droesch 2018 tao et al 2018 kolberg et al 2019 leng and hall 2020 tao et al 2020 van klompenburg et al 2020 chen et al 2021b eini et al 2021a studies on yield projections in poland have been scarce to date while there is a strong evidence on the effect of drought on decreasing yields in historical records ≈Çabƒôdzki and bƒÖk 2017 oleksiak et al 2022 this study is one of the first that provides quantitative estimates of future yields 4 4 limitations and outlook the aforementioned differences between these two approaches may result from the fact that ffbpnn is based on observed data and uses a statistical method to project crop yield in contrast swat as a process based model uses empirical equations to project crop yield unseen situations for precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperature c and solar radiation mj m2 under climate change scenarios could be a source of uncertainty in ffbpnn results and make the results inaccurate one of the hypotheses in this study was the negative effect of climate change on crop yields under rcp8 5 our results reveal that in this region the hypothesis could be rejected it should be mentioned however that both approaches could have uncertainties due to unseen climatic situations in the calibration period but this effect could be more critical in statistical modelling due to the fact that swat has been already implemented in areas with temperature higher than that in the current study area the pet method also does not considerably affect crop yield projections in the study area in the process based approach however we would like to recommend examining the process based approach in more arid climatic zones where irrigation is applied the last hypothesis was that adding a drought indicator could increase the accuracy of the statistical model the results of the employed statistical model show that adding spi as an additional input parameter increases the models accuracy and could lead to more reliable projection results 5 conclusion the study employed two different approaches to simulate and project rainfed crop yields in the we≈Çna catchment in poland over the historical period 2001 2019 and two future periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 we found that adding a meteorological drought index as an additional input parameter improved the accuracy of our statistical approach we also found that winter wheat and spring barley yields are projected to change very little under future climate based on swat according to the results from ffbpnn yields of various studied crops were projected to increase in most cases and the highest increase was recorded for potato and grain maize in a wider context there is a concern that central europe currently faces increased frequency and severity of droughts piniewski et al 2022 strongly contributing to crop losses beillouin et al 2020 trnka et al 2020 br√°s et al 2021 while future warming is certain with its magnitude largely dependent on the emission scenario future precipitation change in central europe is much less certain our results from two independent approaches show no major crop losses in north western poland even under the warm and dry scenario although it is not in contrast with the existing research at the european level see e g meta analysis of knox et al 2016 this poses an interpretational challenge that future studies should address two issues are of particular interest 1 the role of downscaling techniques 2 the role of co2 effect in the case of the former the question is if future crop yield projections from process based models driven by more sophisticated downscaling techniques e g bias corrected rcms show a different pattern than those obtained using a simple delta change method failing to take into account changes in climate variability and extreme events fowler et al 2007 in the case of the latter the globally projected increase in atmospheric co2 concentration adds another layer of complexity to the already complex problem with impacts on transpiration photosynthesis and water use efficiency
