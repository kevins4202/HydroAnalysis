10860,the mechanical lateral move irrigation system has the capacity to achieve high irrigation efficiency when handled properly however during irrigation wind drift and evaporation losses wdel can occur that are caused by operational and meteorological factors thus the objectives of this study were to determine the wdel of a mechanical lateral move irrigation system fully equipped with oscillating plate sprinklers i wob under different meteorological conditions to evaluate the predictive capacity of eight published wdel models that were compared with field data of the full length mechanical lateral move irrigation system to develop a model for estimating the wdel of a mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with an oscillating plate and to compare the wdel and christiansen uniformity coefficient for fixed spray plate superspray and i wob under field conditions the study was conducted using 65 in field tests that were divided into two groups the first group of 35 in field tests used a full length lateral move irrigation system equipped with i wob sprinklers and the second group consisted of 30 in field tests that used only the span 2 superspray and the span 4 i wob sprinklers the wdel for the full length lateral move systems ranged from 4 4 to 25 2 with an average of 11 6 a pearson s correlation test found that wind speed was significant at a 5 significance level the proposed model performed better than the eight published models a comparison of the i wob and superspray sprinklers installed in the mechanical lateral move irrigation systems indicated that i wob performed better and had higher christiansen s uniformity coefficient values and lower wind drift and evaporation losses keywords sprinkler irrigation wind speed wdel superspray i wob 1 introduction brazil is considered one of the world s largest rice producers with rio grande do sul being the primary producing region in the country in rio grande do sul rice is traditionally irrigated by continuous flood systems however this irrigation system requires the continuous maintenance of water on the soil surface that results in water loss through evaporation and percolation which reduces water application efficiency thus water application systems that have lower efficiencies such as flood irrigation systems are being replaced by more efficient systems one alternative irrigation system that is being tested for rice crops are sprinkler irrigation systems as described by crusciol et al 2003 faria et al 2016 pinto et al 2016 and vories et al 2013 which are more efficient than flood irrigation systems and can reach higher uniformed rates of water application the distribution of water by sprinkler irrigation systems are usually obtained from in field tests which are the basis for calculating several important performance indicators such as the christiansen uniformity coefficient which is widely regarded as one of the most important efficiency parameters in the design and management of irrigation systems tarjuelo et al 1999 li et al 2015 yacoubi et al 2010 an important efficiency component in sprinkler irrigation systems is water moving through the air towards the crop canopy or the soil surface because some of the water does not reach the irrigated surface this water is not effectively used by the crop and is commonly known as wind drift and evaporation losses wdel al ghobari et al 2018 mclean et al 2000 playán et al 2005 sadeghi et al 2017 stambouli et al 2013 the magnitude of wdel depends on weather and operating conditions to estimate the magnitude of these losses knowledge of the factors influencing evaporation is important by determining these relationships the operating conditions of the sprinkler irrigation systems can be refined yazar 1984 tarjuelo et al 2000 found that sprinkler irrigation wdel are affected by direct factors droplet size and meteorological conditions among others and indirect factors including operating pressure and nozzle diameter wind is the primary factor affecting the sprinkler irrigation performance faria et al 2009 dechmi et al 2003b also found sprinkler irrigation management being largely influenced by wind conditions in the ebro valley spain where farmers concentrated irrigation operations on calm days to conserve water resources while maintaining an acceptable level of uniformity in water application however in windy conditions the farmers had to accept lower irrigation system performance with observed wdel values ranging from 6 0 to 40 during wind speeds between 0 6 to 6 5 m s 1 sanchez et al 2011 evaluated a solid set in tunisia and observed wdel averages of 24 which were caused by variations in meteorological factors air temperature relative humidity and wind speed the hydrological implications of these losses are very important when considering the drought conditions of the region the type of sprinkler system used is one of the operational factors that most influences wdel the most commonly used sprinkler types used in mechanical center pivot and lateral move irrigation systems are fixed spray rotating spray or oscillating plates each having a specific design and operating conditions according to kranz et al 2005 fixed spray plate sprinklers emit a jet of water that hits a deflector plate which does not move from the water flow impact the oscillating plate sprinklers are designed for water to be sprayed towards a plate that oscillates with water impact playán et al 2004 evaluated a center pivot irrigation system equipped with fixed spray plate sprinklers rotating spray plates and oscillating plates i wob to obtained mean wdel values of 3 6 7 2 and 4 4 respectively colombo et al 2015 found a mean wdel value for a center pivot equipped with i wob sprinkler equal to 3 38 when working at a mean wind speed of 1 28 m s 1 table 1 adapted from playán et al 2005 presents several studies that have quantified wdel in different regions of the world and the meteorological and operational variables that affected the wdel in the sprinkler irrigation systems although knowledge of wdel of sprinkler irrigation systems is of great importance for the sustainable management of irrigation water in brazil there are few scientific studies that have evaluated mechanical lateral move sprinkler irrigation systems operating in the meteorological conditions of southern rio grande do sul in addition there are no studies related to the engineering of these systems when specifically applied to rice cultivation the objectives of this study were i to determine the wdel of a mechanical lateral move irrigation system full equipped with oscillating plate sprinklers under different meteorological conditions ii to evaluate the predictive capacity of eight wdel estimation models applied to in field collected data of the full length mechanical lateral move irrigation system iii to develop a model for estimating the wdel of mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with oscillating plates and iv to compare the wdel and christiansen uniformity coefficient of the fixed spray plate and oscillating plate sprinkler under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 in field tests of the mechanical lateral move irrigation system the mechanical lateral move irrigation system used in the rice fields was installed

always humid a the temperature of the hottest month of the year being higher than 22 c classified as hot summer bamberg et al 2009 the valley mechanical lateral move irrigation system manufactured by the valmont company was evaluated and had a total length of 275 m in five spans fig 1 a the pressurizing system that supplies the equipment consisted of a ksb pump model meganorm 100 250 with a power of 18 16 kw that operated at a flow of 0 05 m³ s 1 with a pressure of 294 19 kpa and a capacity to irrigate approximately 600 000 m2 the operating pressure of the system was measured using lamon dmp 01 ddp manometers which had a varying reading range between 0 to 1 961 28 kpa with an accuracy of 0 1 fs the meteorological variables were monitored by means of a davis instruments automatic weather station vantage pro2 plus equipped with temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction sensors the weather station was installed 50 m from the irrigation system and 2 m above the soil surface the meteorological data were recorded by a data logger at one minute time intervals the in field tests of the lateral move irrigation system were conducted according to the procedures established in iso 11545 iso 2009 in total 65 in field tests divided into two groups were performed from 2014 to 2015 at different hours during daytime to cover a wider range of meteorological conditions in the study all in field tests carried out in the mechanical lateral move system had catch cans that were constructed by the fabrimar company and were 8 cm in diameter and 8 cm in depth the catch cans were installed 0 70 m above the soil surface separated by 3 m and arranged in two lines 5 m apart the volume of each catch can was measured with a graduated cylinder that had a measuring capacity of 100 ml and a precision of 1 ml besides the system travel speed was measured in each of the 65 field test the 65 in field tests were divided into two groups i the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was evaluated as originally designed with i wob sprinklers along the entire length and ii the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was evaluated only in span 2 superspray and span 4 i wob to better understand the differences between the two methodologies used in the in field tests the two groups were divided in two subsections with each subsection using the same methodology 2 1 1 full length mechanical lateral move system tests as shown in fig 1 the first group contains 35 in field tests with the mechanical lateral move irrigation system fully equipped with senninger s i wob oscillating plate sprinklers with nozzle number 16 6 35 mm and a 9 jet oscillating plate the i wob sprinklers were capable of delivering a flow rate of 1313 l h 1 and the irrigation system was equipped with pressure regulators working at 68 9 kpa 10 psi installed in flexible drop hoses to maintain a constant pressure in all sprinklers along the lateral line the sprinklers were spaced of 2 3 m apart placed 2 8 m above the soil surface and fitted with flexible pvc drop hoses with counterweights fig 1 one hundred and ninety six catch cans were installed to collect water applied by the sprinklers during the in field tests following the guidelines of iso 11545 iso 2009 2 1 2 two span mechanical lateral move system tests the second group consisted of 30 in field tests and evaluated two spans span 2 and span 4 of the mechanical lateral move system in span 2 the senninger s i wob sprinklers was substituted with a senninger s superspray fig 2 with nozzle number 16 6 35 mm and a fixed plate with 36 grooves span 4 used the i wob sprinklers with nozzle number 16 6 35 mm and a 9 jet oscillating plate the two spans were equipped with pressure regulators working of 68 9 kpa 10 psi installed in flexible drop hoses to maintain a constant pressure in all the sprinklers along the lateral line the sprinklers were installed with a spacing of 2 3 m placed 2 8 m above the soil surface and fitted with flexible pvc drop hoses fig 2 in the second group the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was evaluated only in spans 2 and 4 as recommended by iso 11545 iso 2009 to avoid the external influence of the sprinkler model on spans 2 and 4 were installed in half of span 1 and 3 the superspray sprinkler and in the rest of lateral move irrigation system was maintained the i wob sprinkler thirty six catch cans were installed to collect water applied by the superspray sprinklers on span 2 and thirty six catch cans were also used for the i wob sprinklers on span 4 to determine any differences between the i wob and the superspray sprinklers a tukey s test at a 5 probability level was calculated to compare the wdel and cu of the sprinklers for all in field tests of the mechanical lateral move irrigation system 2 2 determination of wind drift and evaporation losses and the christiansen uniformity coefficient the wdel were estimated by calculating the difference of the average depth applied ide by the sprinkler during the test and the average depth collected after the equipment passed over the collectors id according to the equation 1 w d e l ide id ide x 100 where wdel is the wind drift and evaporation losses id is the collected irrigation depth mm and ide is the application irrigation depth mm to estimate the ide applied by each sprinkler of the lateral move equipment the emitter flow and the displacement speed of the irrigation equipment were used in the equation 2 i d e q s x e where ide is application irrigation depth mm q is the water discharge l h 1 s is the machine speed m h 1 and e is the distance between the sprinklers along the lateral spans m the determination of the flow rate of the emitter q was calculated using the gravimetric method to estimate the mean flow applied by the mechanical lateral move irrigation system the flow was measured from five emitters randomly selected of each span with five repetitions for each emitter the flow measurement was recorded as follows the water sprinkled by an emitter was collected and the time for filling the entire container was recorded afterwards the mass of water collected in the container was measured with a digital scale water mass was calculated from the recorded collection time thus allowing the determination of flow following the recommendations in iso 11545 iso 2009 the water distribution uniformity of the lateral move irrigation system was calculated with the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu 3 cu 1 i 1 i n x i μ n μ 100 where cu is the christiansen uniformity coefficient xi is the depth measured in the catch cans μ is the arithmetic mean of the collected depths n is the number of catch cans 2 3 estimates wind drift and evaporation losses by different empirical models researchers have developed empirical equations for estimating wdel for different weather conditions countries and irrigation systems for the current study the equations listed in table 2 were evaluated the suitability of the wdel results for different models were statistically evaluated through the performance confidence index c proposed by camargo and sentelhas 1997 which relates the correlation coefficient for precision r and the willmott index for accuracy d the reliability and performance index c is a result of the multiplication of the correlation coefficient r and the wilmott index d according to the eqs 4 and 5 respectively camargo and sentelhas 1997 4 d 1 e i o i 2 e i o o i o 2 5 c r d where ei is the estimated wind drift and evaporation losses and oi is the observed wind drift and evaporation losses the performance confidence index was evaluated according to the classification of camargo and sentelhas 1997 optimal c 0 85 very good 0 76 c 0 85 good 0 66 c 0 75 average 0 61 c 0 65 tolerable 0 51 c 0 60 bad 0 41 c 0 50 and terrible c 0 40 2 4 modeling of wind drift and evaporation losses the observed wdel results and the meteorological variables monitored during the in field tests were used to model wind drift and evaporation losses of the lateral move system pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated at the 5 probability level to verify which meteorological variables wind speed relative humidity air temperature and solar radiation significantly influenced the observed wdel results a simple linear regression eq 6 was calculated between wdel and the significant meteorological variable s at the 5 level to generate a wdel estimation model following the general model of wind drift and evaporation losses recommended by ortíz et al 2009 playán et al 2005 2004 6 wdel m n w where wdel is wind drift and evaporation losses w is wind speed m and n are adjusted parameters 2 5 model validation the cross validation leave one out method was used to validate the generated model which presents advantages over other predictive error assessment techniques vezza et al 2010 the cross validation consists of the temporary removal of an observed value from the data set followed by estimating this value from the generated model this procedure was done for all observed values the results of the cross validation were analyzed applying the root mean squared error rmse eq 7 and coefficient of determination r² as recommended by vezza et al 2010 and laaha and blöschl 2006 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i o i ² where ei is the estimated wind drift and evaporation losses oi is the observed wind drift and evaporation losses n is the number of wind drift and evaporation loss observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 full length mechanical lateral move system tests 3 1 1 in field tests table 3 presents the wdel results obtained through the 35 in field tests performed with the mechanical lateral move irrigation system full equipped with i wob sprinklers plus wind speed w relative humidity rh air temperature t and solar radiation sr air temperature ranged from 15 2 c to 32 6 c with an average of 23 8 c the relative air humidity during the tests remained between 49 and 89 with an average value of 67 3 the wind speed ranged from 0 6 to 6 1 m s 1 with an average value of 2 8 m s 1 the solar radiation ranged from 141 to 952 w m 2 with an average of 571 w m 2 wdel values were between 4 4 to 25 2 with an average of 11 6 table 3 indicates that the irrigation system in question had low wdel in addition all wdel results varied according to the wind speed with increasing wind speed resulting in wdel increasing the highest wind speed values recorded during the in field tests were 5 9 and 6 1 m s 1 resulting in higher wdel of 25 2 and 21 1 respectively these results are in accordance with sadeghi et al 2017 who tested a linear move irrigation system and found a wdel of 25 for a wind speed of 6 3 m s 1 relative humidity temperature and solar radiation values were not related to wdel values which agree with the results of ortíz et al 2009 who tested a center pivot irrigation system and did not find any relationships between wdel and relative humidity or temperature the wdel values of the in field tests indicate that the mechanical lateral move irrigation system can be used in the meteorological conditions of the south of rio grande do sul but it is necessary to be cautious to operate this equipment in conditions of wind speeds above 4 m s 1 as can be seen the influence of wind speed on wdel and on cu tends to reduce the efficiency of the system 3 1 2 wind drift and evaporation losses estimated by different models fig 3 compares the observed wdel from the full length lateral move irrigation system equipped with i wob sprinkler with simulated wdel values from eight published models for different irrigation systems under various meteorological conditions these analyses were conducted to evaluate the applicability of the existing published models to the south region of rio grande do sul the models proposed by dechmi et al 2003a faci et al 2001 and playán et al 2004 received the bad 0 41 c 0 50 adjustment classification according to camargo and sentelhas 1997 the models proposed by ortíz et al 2009 and sanchez et al 2011 reached a tolerable 0 51 c 0 60 adjustment classification the model proposed by yacoubi et al 2010 was classified as an average 0 61 c 0 65 adjustment of the observed wdel the models proposed by colombo et al 2015 and playán et al 2005 achieved classifications equal to good 0 66 c 0 75 the model of playán et al 2005 was developed using an experimental machine that simulates a mechanical lateral move irrigation system operating under specific characteristics which were similar to the equipment evaluated in this present study in the playán et al 2005 experiments the wind speed ranged from 0 06 to 4 51 m s 1 a range that was close to the present study 0 64 to 6 09 m s 1 the models developed by dechmi et al 2003a and yacoubi et al 2010 overestimated the wdel observed in the present study this fact can be attributed to utilization of solid set irrigation systems to propose the models and according with keller and bliesner 1990 solid set systems produce smaller diameter drops and consequently higher wdel when compared with mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with low pressure sprinklers 3 1 3 meteorological variables fig 4 presents the wdel plots observed for the mechanical lateral move system as a function of the meteorological variables wind speed w relative humidity rh air temperature t and solar radiation sr wdel varied mainly as a function of wind speed with increasing wind speeds resulting in an increase in the wdel however relative humidity air temperature and solar radiation were not strongly related to the observed wdel which can be seen in the pearson s correlation coefficients between wdel and the analyzed meteorological variables table 4 among the monitored meteorological variables wind speed had the highest correlation with wdel p value 0 05 an indication that wdel is related to the wind speed for the region of this study therefore the relative humidity air temperature and solar radiation were not significantly related to wdel table 4 in a similar study ocampo et al 2003 testing different sprinklers packages in a center pivot georgia usa observed that relative humidity between 40 and 70 causes an evaporation loss of approximately 10 however in this study the relative humidity does not cause significative influence table 4 playán et al 2005 tested lateral move and solid set irrigation systems in zaragoza spain and monitored wind speed air temperature air humidity and solar radiation to determine water losses in their analyses was found that the wind speed is the significant variable affecting losses corroborating also with colombo et al 2015 dechmi et al 2003a ortíz et al 2009 and playán et al 2004 that have found the wind speed as the best variable for determining wdel these results indicate that wind speed is the best meteorological variable for explaining variation in wdel for different irrigation equipment sprinkler models and different study regions 3 1 4 model proposed for estimating evaporation and drift losses the analyses of the published models for different regions meteorological conditions irrigation equipment and sprinkler models found that the only the models of colombo et al 2015 and playán et al 2005 adequately estimated wdel however because none of these models were developed to predict the wdel from lateral move equipment in the meteorological conditions of rio grande do sul a new model was developed using in field test data observed in the present study statistical analyses using pearson s correlation coefficient indicated that wind speed was the best variable for explaining variation within wdel and was only variable used in the model the proposed model for estimating wdel was generated for mechanical lateral move irrigation equipment equipped with i wob sprinklers operating at a pressure of 68 9 kpa and under the meteorological conditions of southern rio grande do sul 8 w d e l 2 52 w 4 46 where wdel is wind drift and evaporation losses and w is wind speed m s ¹ the model has a coefficient of determination of r² 0 70 which is considered high and indicates that the model is properly adjusted the analysis of the coefficient of determination as a parameter indicative of goodness of fit was based on the methodology of ortíz et al 2009 and playán et al 2005 2004 who evaluated the applicability of their models through the result of this coefficient and obtained values r² of 0 57 0 60 and 0 58 respectively 3 1 5 validation of the proposed model fig 5 presents the 35 wdel values observed during the in field tests and the 35 values estimated of wdel by the cross validation method using the model proposed in eq 8 the data estimated by the cross validation method were similar to the data observed in the in field tests indicated by close linear relationship shown in fig 5 in addition the r2 value of 0 70 and the root mean square error rmse value of 2 89 demonstrate that these values are acceptable for estimating wdel in sprinkler irrigation practices furthermore the results of the reliability and performance index c camargo and sentelhas 1997 shows a very good 0 76 c 0 85 classification capacity of the presented model for representing the in field data the model is also better when compared with other published models which had reliability and performance indices equal to or lesser than 0 70 as such the model proposed in this study can be used to estimate wdel of the mechanical lateral move irrigation system operating under the meteorological conditions of south rio grande do sul 3 2 two spans mechanical lateral move system tests table 5 contains wdel values obtained from 30 in field tests using the mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with superspray sprinklers ss in the span 2 and i wob sprinklers in the span 4 together with the meteorological variables wind speed w relative humidity rh air temperature t and solar radiation sr air temperature t ranged from 14 5 c to 30 2 c relative air humidity rh remained between 48 and 86 wind speed w ranged from 0 1 to 5 1 m s 1 and solar radiation sr varied between 53 to 916 w m 2 span 2 superspray sprinkler had wdel values that ranged from 5 0 to 17 7 with an average value of 9 3 span 4 i wob sprinkler had wdel values that ranged from 1 8 to 14 2 with an average value of 6 6 both sprinklers had low wdel values and high christiansen uniformity coefficient cu in addition the wdel and the cu values varied according to wind speed with increasing wind speeds resulting in increased wdel values but reduced cu furthermore the wdel was lower for the i wob sprinkler and cu for the i wob sprinkler was higher than that for the superspray sprinkler fig 6 fig 6 shows a comparison of the observed wdel from the i wob and superspray sprinklers most of the values figured out below the 1 1 line indicating higher wdel values when the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was equipped with superspray sprinklers this finding is corroborated by the results by ortíz et al 2009 who found a higher wdel when a center pivot irrigation system was equipped with fixed spray plate sprinklers a comparison of the cu values from the i wob and superspray sprinklers shows greater cu values obtained for the mechanical lateral move irrigation system when equipped with i wob sprinklers these results are in accordance with the findings of faci et al 2001 who compared fixed spray plate sprinklers with rotating spray plate sprinklers and found wind speed having a smaller influence on rotating plate sprinklers table 6 shows the results of a tukey statistical test of the average wdel and cu values for the i wob and superspray sprinklers the superspray sprinkler model had higher wdel averages than did the i wob sprinkler the difference between the averages is significant p value 0 05 indicating that use of i wob sprinklers operating in the meteorological conditions of the southern rio grande do sul can reduce water loss by wind drift and evaporation the tukey test table 6 was also used to compare average cu values obtained from the mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with i wob and superspray sprinklers the i wob values were higher than the superspray values p value 0 05 indicating a better uniformity in water distribution of the mechanical lateral move irrigation system when equipped with i wob sprinklers the better performance of the i wob sprinkler is in accordance with results found by playán et al 2004 where the average cu for the superspray sprinklers was 76 6 and 92 7 for the i wob sprinklers it is important to highlight that these results do not indicate which sprinkler system is more cost effective to know which sprinkler has a better cost efficiency it will be needed an economic analysis evolving all the sprinkler performance and their influence in the crop yield water and energy price environmental impacts and everything else that influence on a cost efficiency analysis to confirm which sprinkler system is financially recommended for using 4 conclusions the mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with i wob sprinklers had wdel values that ranged from 4 4 to 25 1 with an average value of 11 6 wind speed was the only significant variable at the 5 significance level in explaining variations in wdel from the meteorological conditions of the southern rio grande do sul the air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation did not significantly affect the wdel in a mechanical lateral move irrigation system operating in southern of brazil the model proposed in this study reached a good capacity to predict the wdel of the mechanical lateral move system equipped with i wob sprinklers operating in rio grande do sul meteorological conditions the proposed model can be used as an important tool to estimate wdel for these irrigation systems operating under similar conditions the comparison of i wob and superspray sprinklers installed in the mechanical lateral move irrigation system indicated that i wob performed better having greater cu values and lower wdel values acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária

the valmont company was evaluated and had a total length of 275 m in five spans fig 1 a the pressurizing system that supplies the equipment consisted of a ksb pump model meganorm 100 250 with a power of 18 16 kw that operated at a flow of 0 05 m³ s 1 with a pressure of 294 19 kpa and a capacity to irrigate approximately 600 000 m2 the operating pressure of the system was measured using lamon dmp 01 ddp manometers which had a varying reading range between 0 to 1 961 28 kpa with an accuracy of 0 1 fs the meteorological variables were monitored by means of a davis instruments automatic weather station vantage pro2 plus equipped with temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction sensors the weather station was installed 50 m from the irrigation system and 2 m above the soil surface the meteorological data were recorded by a data logger at one minute time intervals the in field tests of the lateral move irrigation system were conducted according to the procedures established in iso 11545 iso 2009 in total 65 in field tests divided into two groups were performed from 2014 to 2015 at different hours during daytime to cover a wider range of meteorological conditions in the study all in field tests carried out in the mechanical lateral move system had catch cans that were constructed by the fabrimar company and were 8 cm in diameter and 8 cm in depth the catch cans were installed 0 70 m above the soil surface separated by 3 m and arranged in two lines 5 m apart the volume of each catch can was measured with a graduated cylinder that had a measuring capacity of 100 ml and a precision of 1 ml besides the system travel speed was measured in each of the 65 field test the 65 in field tests were divided into two groups i the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was evaluated as originally designed with i wob sprinklers along the entire length and ii the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was evaluated only in span 2 superspray and span 4 i wob to better understand the differences between the two methodologies used in the in field tests the two groups were divided in two subsections with each subsection using the same methodology 2 1 1 full length mechanical lateral move system tests as shown in fig 1 the first group contains 35 in field tests with the mechanical lateral move irrigation system fully equipped with senninger s i wob oscillating plate sprinklers with nozzle number 16 6 35 mm and a 9 jet oscillating plate the i wob sprinklers were capable of delivering a flow rate of 1313 l h 1 and the irrigation system was equipped with pressure regulators working at 68 9 kpa 10 psi installed in flexible drop hoses to maintain a constant pressure in all sprinklers along the lateral line the sprinklers were spaced of 2 3 m apart placed 2 8 m above the soil surface and fitted with flexible pvc drop hoses with counterweights fig 1 one hundred and ninety six catch cans were installed to collect water applied by the sprinklers during the in field tests following the guidelines of iso 11545 iso 2009 2 1 2 two span mechanical lateral move system tests the second group consisted of 30 in field tests and evaluated two spans span 2 and span 4 of the mechanical lateral move system in span 2 the senninger s i wob sprinklers was substituted with a senninger s superspray fig 2 with nozzle number 16 6 35 mm and a fixed plate with 36 grooves span 4 used the i wob sprinklers with nozzle number 16 6 35 mm and a 9 jet oscillating plate the two spans were equipped with pressure regulators working of 68 9 kpa 10 psi installed in flexible drop hoses to maintain a constant pressure in all the sprinklers along the lateral line the sprinklers were installed with a spacing of 2 3 m placed 2 8 m above the soil surface and fitted with flexible pvc drop hoses fig 2 in the second group the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was evaluated only in spans 2 and 4 as recommended by iso 11545 iso 2009 to avoid the external influence of the sprinkler model on spans 2 and 4 were installed in half of span 1 and 3 the superspray sprinkler and in the rest of lateral move irrigation system was maintained the i wob sprinkler thirty six catch cans were installed to collect water applied by the superspray sprinklers on span 2 and thirty six catch cans were also used for the i wob sprinklers on span 4 to determine any differences between the i wob and the superspray sprinklers a tukey s test at a 5 probability level was calculated to compare the wdel and cu of the sprinklers for all in field tests of the mechanical lateral move irrigation system 2 2 determination of wind drift and evaporation losses and the christiansen uniformity coefficient the wdel were estimated by calculating the difference of the average depth applied ide by the sprinkler during the test and the average depth collected after the equipment passed over the collectors id according to the equation 1 w d e l ide id ide x 100 where wdel is the wind drift and evaporation losses id is the collected irrigation depth mm and ide is the application irrigation depth mm to estimate the ide applied by each sprinkler of the lateral move equipment the emitter flow and the displacement speed of the irrigation equipment were used in the equation 2 i d e q s x e where ide is application irrigation depth mm q is the water discharge l h 1 s is the machine speed m h 1 and e is the distance between the sprinklers along the lateral spans m the determination of the flow rate of the emitter q was calculated using the gravimetric method to estimate the mean flow applied by the mechanical lateral move irrigation system the flow was measured from five emitters randomly selected of each span with five repetitions for each emitter the flow measurement was recorded as follows the water sprinkled by an emitter was collected and the time for filling the entire container was recorded afterwards the mass of water collected in the container was measured with a digital scale water mass was calculated from the recorded collection time thus allowing the determination of flow following the recommendations in iso 11545 iso 2009 the water distribution uniformity of the lateral move irrigation system was calculated with the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu 3 cu 1 i 1 i n x i μ n μ 100 where cu is the christiansen uniformity coefficient xi is the depth measured in the catch cans μ is the arithmetic mean of the collected depths n is the number of catch cans 2 3 estimates wind drift and evaporation losses by different empirical models researchers have developed empirical equations for estimating wdel for different weather conditions countries and irrigation systems for the current study the equations listed in table 2 were evaluated the suitability of the wdel results for different models were statistically evaluated through the performance confidence index c proposed by camargo and sentelhas 1997 which relates the correlation coefficient for precision r and the willmott index for accuracy d the reliability and performance index c is a result of the multiplication of the correlation coefficient r and the wilmott index d according to the eqs 4 and 5 respectively camargo and sentelhas 1997 4 d 1 e i o i 2 e i o o i o 2 5 c r d where ei is the estimated wind drift and evaporation losses and oi is the observed wind drift and evaporation losses the performance confidence index was evaluated according to the classification of camargo and sentelhas 1997 optimal c 0 85 very good 0 76 c 0 85 good 0 66 c 0 75 average 0 61 c 0 65 tolerable 0 51 c 0 60 bad 0 41 c 0 50 and terrible c 0 40 2 4 modeling of wind drift and evaporation losses the observed wdel results and the meteorological variables monitored during the in field tests were used to model wind drift and evaporation losses of the lateral move system pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated at the 5 probability level to verify which meteorological variables wind speed relative humidity air temperature and solar radiation significantly influenced the observed wdel results a simple linear regression eq 6 was calculated between wdel and the significant meteorological variable s at the 5 level to generate a wdel estimation model following the general model of wind drift and evaporation losses recommended by ortíz et al 2009 playán et al 2005 2004 6 wdel m n w where wdel is wind drift and evaporation losses w is wind speed m and n are adjusted parameters 2 5 model validation the cross validation leave one out method was used to validate the generated model which presents advantages over other predictive error assessment techniques vezza et al 2010 the cross validation consists of the temporary removal of an observed value from the data set followed by estimating this value from the generated model this procedure was done for all observed values the results of the cross validation were analyzed applying the root mean squared error rmse eq 7 and coefficient of determination r² as recommended by vezza et al 2010 and laaha and blöschl 2006 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i o i ² where ei is the estimated wind drift and evaporation losses oi is the observed wind drift and evaporation losses n is the number of wind drift and evaporation loss observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 full length mechanical lateral move system tests 3 1 1 in field tests table 3 presents the wdel results obtained through the 35 in field tests performed with the mechanical lateral move irrigation system full equipped with i wob sprinklers plus wind speed w relative humidity rh air temperature t and solar radiation sr air temperature ranged from 15 2 c to 32 6 c with an average of 23 8 c the relative air humidity during the tests remained between 49 and 89 with an average value of 67 3 the wind speed ranged from 0 6 to 6 1 m s 1 with an average value of 2 8 m s 1 the solar radiation ranged from 141 to 952 w m 2 with an average of 571 w m 2 wdel values were between 4 4 to 25 2 with an average of 11 6 table 3 indicates that the irrigation system in question had low wdel in addition all wdel results varied according to the wind speed with increasing wind speed resulting in wdel increasing the highest wind speed values recorded during the in field tests were 5 9 and 6 1 m s 1 resulting in higher wdel of 25 2 and 21 1 respectively these results are in accordance with sadeghi et al 2017 who tested a linear move irrigation system and found a wdel of 25 for a wind speed of 6 3 m s 1 relative humidity temperature and solar radiation values were not related to wdel values which agree with the results of ortíz et al 2009 who tested a center pivot irrigation system and did not find any relationships between wdel and relative humidity or temperature the wdel values of the in field tests indicate that the mechanical lateral move irrigation system can be used in the meteorological conditions of the south of rio grande do sul but it is necessary to be cautious to operate this equipment in conditions of wind speeds above 4 m s 1 as can be seen the influence of wind speed on wdel and on cu tends to reduce the efficiency of the system 3 1 2 wind drift and evaporation losses estimated by different models fig 3 compares the observed wdel from the full length lateral move irrigation system equipped with i wob sprinkler with simulated wdel values from eight published models for different irrigation systems under various meteorological conditions these analyses were conducted to evaluate the applicability of the existing published models to the south region of rio grande do sul the models proposed by dechmi et al 2003a faci et al 2001 and playán et al 2004 received the bad 0 41 c 0 50 adjustment classification according to camargo and sentelhas 1997 the models proposed by ortíz et al 2009 and sanchez et al 2011 reached a tolerable 0 51 c 0 60 adjustment classification the model proposed by yacoubi et al 2010 was classified as an average 0 61 c 0 65 adjustment of the observed wdel the models proposed by colombo et al 2015 and playán et al 2005 achieved classifications equal to good 0 66 c 0 75 the model of playán et al 2005 was developed using an experimental machine that simulates a mechanical lateral move irrigation system operating under specific characteristics which were similar to the equipment evaluated in this present study in the playán et al 2005 experiments the wind speed ranged from 0 06 to 4 51 m s 1 a range that was close to the present study 0 64 to 6 09 m s 1 the models developed by dechmi et al 2003a and yacoubi et al 2010 overestimated the wdel observed in the present study this fact can be attributed to utilization of solid set irrigation systems to propose the models and according with keller and bliesner 1990 solid set systems produce smaller diameter drops and consequently higher wdel when compared with mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with low pressure sprinklers 3 1 3 meteorological variables fig 4 presents the wdel plots observed for the mechanical lateral move system as a function of the meteorological variables wind speed w relative humidity rh air temperature t and solar radiation sr wdel varied mainly as a function of wind speed with increasing wind speeds resulting in an increase in the wdel however relative humidity air temperature and solar radiation were not strongly related to the observed wdel which can be seen in the pearson s correlation coefficients between wdel and the analyzed meteorological variables table 4 among the monitored meteorological variables wind speed had the highest correlation with wdel p value 0 05 an indication that wdel is related to the wind speed for the region of this study therefore the relative humidity air temperature and solar radiation were not significantly related to wdel table 4 in a similar study ocampo et al 2003 testing different sprinklers packages in a center pivot georgia usa observed that relative humidity between 40 and 70 causes an evaporation loss of approximately 10 however in this study the relative humidity does not cause significative influence table 4 playán et al 2005 tested lateral move and solid set irrigation systems in zaragoza spain and monitored wind speed air temperature air humidity and solar radiation to determine water losses in their analyses was found that the wind speed is the significant variable affecting losses corroborating also with colombo et al 2015 dechmi et al 2003a ortíz et al 2009 and playán et al 2004 that have found the wind speed as the best variable for determining wdel these results indicate that wind speed is the best meteorological variable for explaining variation in wdel for different irrigation equipment sprinkler models and different study regions 3 1 4 model proposed for estimating evaporation and drift losses the analyses of the published models for different regions meteorological conditions irrigation equipment and sprinkler models found that the only the models of colombo et al 2015 and playán et al 2005 adequately estimated wdel however because none of these models were developed to predict the wdel from lateral move equipment in the meteorological conditions of rio grande do sul a new model was developed using in field test data observed in the present study statistical analyses using pearson s correlation coefficient indicated that wind speed was the best variable for explaining variation within wdel and was only variable used in the model the proposed model for estimating wdel was generated for mechanical lateral move irrigation equipment equipped with i wob sprinklers operating at a pressure of 68 9 kpa and under the meteorological conditions of southern rio grande do sul 8 w d e l 2 52 w 4 46 where wdel is wind drift and evaporation losses and w is wind speed m s ¹ the model has a coefficient of determination of r² 0 70 which is considered high and indicates that the model is properly adjusted the analysis of the coefficient of determination as a parameter indicative of goodness of fit was based on the methodology of ortíz et al 2009 and playán et al 2005 2004 who evaluated the applicability of their models through the result of this coefficient and obtained values r² of 0 57 0 60 and 0 58 respectively 3 1 5 validation of the proposed model fig 5 presents the 35 wdel values observed during the in field tests and the 35 values estimated of wdel by the cross validation method using the model proposed in eq 8 the data estimated by the cross validation method were similar to the data observed in the in field tests indicated by close linear relationship shown in fig 5 in addition the r2 value of 0 70 and the root mean square error rmse value of 2 89 demonstrate that these values are acceptable for estimating wdel in sprinkler irrigation practices furthermore the results of the reliability and performance index c camargo and sentelhas 1997 shows a very good 0 76 c 0 85 classification capacity of the presented model for representing the in field data the model is also better when compared with other published models which had reliability and performance indices equal to or lesser than 0 70 as such the model proposed in this study can be used to estimate wdel of the mechanical lateral move irrigation system operating under the meteorological conditions of south rio grande do sul 3 2 two spans mechanical lateral move system tests table 5 contains wdel values obtained from 30 in field tests using the mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with superspray sprinklers ss in the span 2 and i wob sprinklers in the span 4 together with the meteorological variables wind speed w relative humidity rh air temperature t and solar radiation sr air temperature t ranged from 14 5 c to 30 2 c relative air humidity rh remained between 48 and 86 wind speed w ranged from 0 1 to 5 1 m s 1 and solar radiation sr varied between 53 to 916 w m 2 span 2 superspray sprinkler had wdel values that ranged from 5 0 to 17 7 with an average value of 9 3 span 4 i wob sprinkler had wdel values that ranged from 1 8 to 14 2 with an average value of 6 6 both sprinklers had low wdel values and high christiansen uniformity coefficient cu in addition the wdel and the cu values varied according to wind speed with increasing wind speeds resulting in increased wdel values but reduced cu furthermore the wdel was lower for the i wob sprinkler and cu for the i wob sprinkler was higher than that for the superspray sprinkler fig 6 fig 6 shows a comparison of the observed wdel from the i wob and superspray sprinklers most of the values figured out below the 1 1 line indicating higher wdel values when the mechanical lateral move irrigation system was equipped with superspray sprinklers this finding is corroborated by the results by ortíz et al 2009 who found a higher wdel when a center pivot irrigation system was equipped with fixed spray plate sprinklers a comparison of the cu values from the i wob and superspray sprinklers shows greater cu values obtained for the mechanical lateral move irrigation system when equipped with i wob sprinklers these results are in accordance with the findings of faci et al 2001 who compared fixed spray plate sprinklers with rotating spray plate sprinklers and found wind speed having a smaller influence on rotating plate sprinklers table 6 shows the results of a tukey statistical test of the average wdel and cu values for the i wob and superspray sprinklers the superspray sprinkler model had higher wdel averages than did the i wob sprinkler the difference between the averages is significant p value 0 05 indicating that use of i wob sprinklers operating in the meteorological conditions of the southern rio grande do sul can reduce water loss by wind drift and evaporation the tukey test table 6 was also used to compare average cu values obtained from the mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with i wob and superspray sprinklers the i wob values were higher than the superspray values p value 0 05 indicating a better uniformity in water distribution of the mechanical lateral move irrigation system when equipped with i wob sprinklers the better performance of the i wob sprinkler is in accordance with results found by playán et al 2004 where the average cu for the superspray sprinklers was 76 6 and 92 7 for the i wob sprinklers it is important to highlight that these results do not indicate which sprinkler system is more cost effective to know which sprinkler has a better cost efficiency it will be needed an economic analysis evolving all the sprinkler performance and their influence in the crop yield water and energy price environmental impacts and everything else that influence on a cost efficiency analysis to confirm which sprinkler system is financially recommended for using 4 conclusions the mechanical lateral move irrigation system equipped with i wob sprinklers had wdel values that ranged from 4 4 to 25 1 with an average value of 11 6 wind speed was the only significant variable at the 5 significance level in explaining variations in wdel from the meteorological conditions of the southern rio grande do sul the air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation did not significantly affect the wdel in a mechanical lateral move irrigation system operating in southern of brazil the model proposed in this study reached a good capacity to predict the wdel of the mechanical lateral move system equipped with i wob sprinklers operating in rio grande do sul meteorological conditions the proposed model can be used as an important tool to estimate wdel for these irrigation systems operating under similar conditions the comparison of i wob and superspray sprinklers installed in the mechanical lateral move irrigation system indicated that i wob performed better having greater cu values and lower wdel values acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária

10861,the water deficit wd is one of the severe problems in agriculture resulting in yield loss the understating of crops behavior face to this condition becomes of great importance and the use of biostimulants may act as a vegetal growth promoting considering its capacity of attenuate the impacts of wd on plants this study aimed at evaluating the common bean changes in biometric parameters and its yield supplemented with biostimulants as a response to the imposition of wd the assay was conducted in a protected environment in botucatu brazil with common bean cv iac imperador disposed in

common bean is a very water dependable crop with wd imposition interfering in all the studied variables with growth decrease biomass accumulation and yield the applied biostimulants b2 and b3 presented low capacity to attenuate the wd effects in common bean under the cultivation conditions adopted keywords drought stress growth promoting bacteria irrigation management phaseolus vulgaris l 1 introduction the common bean phaseolus vulgaris l is one of the main crops produced in the world the expectation for the total brazilian grain production in the 2018 2019 harvest is of 3 07 million tons conab 2019 one of the primordial factors to the common bean crop development and acquisition of high productivity is the ideal water supply in the different phenological stages kobayashi et al 2016 the stress caused by the lack of water in the soil has considerable impacts in the growth and productivity of the common bean however the effects are highly variable according to the exposure time the stress intensity imposed to the plants characteristics of the cultivar used and plants ability to adapt to this adverse condition rosales et al 2012 emam et al 2010 this way like a big part of agricultural crops it is known that the common bean is very sensitive to the water deficit wd especially when this condition is imposed in the phenological stages of flowering and during pod filling mathobo et al 2017 therefore it is of big importance the study of plants behavior under water stress in the conditions and way of conventional cultivation because of the development of new cultivation technologies some alternatives have been presented in the rural field in order to attenuate the effects of biotic and abiotic stress in the growth and yield of crops among the most widespread alternatives we highlight the use of biostimulants to promote the vegetal growth these natural compounds may be grouped as beneficial microorganisms such as the plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb and mycorrhizae besides extracts from different sources like the ones obtained from brown algae grover et al 2014 kasim et al 2013 the action of biostimulants seems to be related to the production of phytohormones improving the nutrients contribution induction of root growth besides helping in the osmotic adjustment through the synthesis of organic compounds and in the induction of antioxidant response systems kumar and verma 2018 ngumbi and kloepper 2016 vurukonda et al 2016 guiry 2012 this essay aimed at evaluating the effects of water deficiency on biometric parameters and common bean production from treatments with the biostimulants we have studied a possible attenuation in the impacts of water deficiency on the vegetal growing and development 2 materials and methods

management and irrigation the irrigation system was by drip in which self compensating medium flow button type emitters were used 2 0 l h 1 and operation pressure at 10 mca the distribution uniformity coefficient was calculated and the result found was 98 classified as excellent according to classification proposed by bernardo et al 2006 the irrigation management was via soil through the use of six tensiometers per experimental plot installed in the depth of 0 15 m the monitoring of water tension in the soil was performed daily with the assistance from a puncture digital tensiometer and the tension values converted in volumetric humidity based on the adjustment equation of soil water retention curve the adjustment of soil water retention curve was performed through the pattern proposed by van genuchten 1980 initially all the treatment combinations receive the same water depth increasing the soil humidity to the tension 10 kpa near field capacity the differentiation of irrigation depths in the plots occurred in corresponding stage to the beginning of crop flowering at 35 days after emergency dae for phytosanitary treatment it was performed only one application of the insecticide orthene 750 br and two applications of the fungicide cerconil wp in doses according to the manufacturer recommendations zinc deficiency was detected in the phenological stage v4 which was corrected with the application of 1 kg ha 1 of zinc sulfate diluted in water via soil before the harvest the irrigation was suspended in both treatments in order to dry the grains in the plant the harvest of the treatments submitted to wd occurred at 77 dae and of the treatment of the control irrigation depth at 84 dae 2 4 date of evaluations the biometric evaluations were performed at 56 dae when the plants were in the grain filling stage phenological stage corresponding to r8 to which one plant for repetition was used the collecting occurred in the beginning of the morning at the end of the experiment the pods collecting was performed and the yield estimate for the treatments for which the average of six plants for repetition was used the analyzed variables were stem diameter leaf number leaf area leaf dry matter stem root and total length diameter and root volume and production parameters 2 5 biometric parameters the stem diameter determination was performed with the assistance of a digital caliper mm at approximately 1 5 cm from the soil surface to leaf number and leaf area all the leaves from a plant were collected counted and later the leaf area was measured with the assistance of the integrative model li cor li 3000 the results were expressed as cm2 plant 1 the dry matter was determined by putting samples in the greenhouse with forced air circulation at 60 c 5 until constant weight and later they were weighed in a precision scale 2 6 root morphology in order to evaluate the root morphology we ve used the root system of a plant for repetition in each treatment the roots were washed and placed in glass jars with 70 alcohol solution and stored in a fridge to later evaluation of root structures with the assistance of the software winrhizo 2 7 yield and yield components after the harvest the grains were manually separated from the pods counted and weighed the production parameters evaluated were pod and grain numbers per plant grain number per pod 100 grain weight mass of grains per plant g and yield estimate kg ha considering a population of 240 thousand plants per hectare and the grain humidity corrected to 13 the grain humidity after the harvest was obtained by the greenhouse method at 105 3 c for 24 h and the data expressed in percentage wet basis brasil 2009 2 8 statistical analysis to perform the statistical analysis the obtained data were initially submitted to the kolmogorov smirnov normality test with the assistance of the software minitab 17 and when the normality of the data was confirmed they were submitted to the variance analysis and when significant the tukey s test was applied to compare the averages at the depth 5 of probability using the software agrostat 3 results 3 1 stem diameter to the stem diameter variable table 1 after the differentiation of irrigation depths significant effect was observed only for the water treatment the moderate water deficiency mwd depth 40 kpa presented plants with stem diameter around 15 smaller when compared to plants with normal irrigation control 10 kpa these results show that the wd caused damage to the stem growing and the use of biostimulants was not efficient to mitigate the stress effect 3 2 leaf number and leaf area the total leaf number were measured table 2 and significant effect was not detected for the evaluation period in relation to the leaf area variable table 3 significance was found only for the principal effect in the irrigation depths it was found then that the wd resulted in decrease of 37 in the leaf area when compared to the condition of full irrigation the treatments with biostimulants did not influence this variable however it was possible to observe that the treatments b2 and b3 presented reductions of approximately 6 and 13 respectively when compared to treatment b1 3 3 dry matter the evaluations of plant dry biomass accumulation are summarized in table 4 the leaf dry matter analysis denotes significant difference only for the irrigation depths treatments where the wd caused a decrease of 42 in this parameter compared to the control plants the treatments b1 b2 and b3 did not differ statistically the stem dry matter was influenced by the irrigation depths treatments with the control depth being 42 superior to the wd treatment it is observed that the biostimulants did not influence the stem dry mass of the common bean also in table 4 it was observed that the root dry matter did not present significant difference for none of the treatments to the total dry matter obtainment it was counted the green pod dry mass completely formed until the harvest period the presented results indicate that there was a significant effect only for the water treatments with a decrease of 45 in the total biomass accumulation when the plants were submitted to the condition of wd 3 4 root morphology the root morphology evaluation is presented in table 5 after the root scanning and image treatment using the software winrhizo it is possible to evaluate that the root length did not change in a significant way due to the applied treatments there was effect to the irrigation depths in relation to the root diameter and volume to these measurements the control plants where the soil humidity was kept near field capacity presented higher averages differing from the deficit depth in relation to the treatments with biostimulants there was not significant effect to none of the variables however in general it was possible to observe that the highest averages correspond to treatment b3 highlighting the root volume which was approximately 18 superior to the control b1 and 20 superior to b2 3 5 yield and yield components the production components and the yield are presented in table 6 there was not significant effect with application of the treatments to the grains per pod number and 100 grain weight for the pod per plant number grains per plant grain mass per plant it was observed that the irrigation depths influenced significantly to these variables the deficit irrigation depth was responsible for a decrease of 45 46 and 50 respectively when compared to the control treatment on the other hand the treatments with biostimulants did not present effect to these measurements these results can affect the yield considering that the wd treatment induced a decrease of 50 in the total yield average 4 discussion the imposition of the water deficit resulted in significant decrease in stem diameter table 1 the decrease of water availability may affect the physiological and metabolic activities in plants which modify morphologic characteristics especially in the ones related to growth chai et al 2016 according to padilha et al 2016 the growth decrease occurs due to the cell turgor decrease which is a factor directly related to the cell expansion thus globally wd events induce to the lowest growth rates although a significant difference for leaf number was not found it was possible to notice a reduction tendency as a response to stress table 2 this reduction was observed in a significant manner for leaf area when the irrigation depths differentiation was established the reduction was 37 lower when compared to the control plot table 3 these results show that a smaller water availability in the soil may affect the development of new leaves accelerating leaf senescence besides slowing down the growth of remaining leaves emam et al 2010 mathobo et al 2017 observed a decrease in the leaf area in common bean submitted to different conditions of water stress the same effect was found by soureshjani et al 2019 in common bean kept on wd the plants perform this morphological artifice as a strategy to decrease the transpiration area and as a consequence mitigate the water loss to the environment when the stress is too severe the plants in prolonged dehydration stage cannot keep or recuperate their leaf area this way they reduce the light interception area and the essential metabolic activities which eventually results in plant death sahoo et al 2013 in this essay the decrease in leaf number and leaf area with the imposition of wd reflected on the leaf dry matter table 4 which presented decrease of 42 compared to the irrigation depth of control plants 10 kpa a similar behavior was observed to stem dry matter also with a significant decrease of 42 and 40 to root dry matter the total dry matter presented decrease of 45 in the deficit irrigation depth the results show that the wd affected the biomass accumulation in a very significant way the lowest dry matter production can be related to the total leaf area decrease thus changing the light interception surface as a consequence resulting in the decline of photosynthetic activity mathobo et al 2017 several authors have related the decrease of biomass accumulation and growth in common bean submitted to wd being this morphological variable one of the most affected by this adverse condition these effects vary due to the genetic material cultivar phenological stage and stress intensity chacón et al 2019 soureshjani et al 2019 mathobo et al 2017 based on the root morphology evaluations table 5 it was possible to observe that the treatments under wd did not differ significantly from the control treatments to the length variable among the many adaptative characteristics developed by the plants to handle adverse conditions changes in the root architecture are considered one of the most important huang et al 2014 the plants when submitted to stress conditions use the mechanism of inducing the root growth aiming to explore a larger soil area and seek for water in deeper regions therefore this variable tends to present equal or higher values when they are submitted to ideal conditions of soil humidity khonghintaisong et al 2018 mittal et al 2015 the root volume and diameter were smaller in the deficit depths showing that the cultivar in study uses this mechanism as a way to adapt to the drought thus the plants start to put more energy and photoassimilates to the length in detriment of the diameter and volume with a consequent increase in the capacity of exploration to the soil profile although there is not a significant difference due to the use of biostimulants and root development in general the averages of these treatments were higher when compared to the control especially in relation to treatment b3 several authors discuss that the plant associations rhizobacteria and algae extract seem to be beneficial and induce the root growth as a response to the environmental stress especially the water stress vurukonda et al 2016 ngumbi and kloepper 2016 kasim et al 2013 the irrigation depths differentiation and the imposition of water deficit conditions to the applied treatments occurred in the phenological stage r6 corresponding to the beginning of the crop flowering stage the wd at this moment reduce the production parameters such as the pod per plant and grains per plant when compared to the control condition table 6 this decrease can be a result of the senescence process and flower abortion once the plants under stress reduce the photosynthetic metabolism and photoassimilate accumulation these events can induce to the viability loss and flower senescence similar behavior was observed by several authors ghassemi et al 2018 mathobo et al 2017 rezene et al 2013 also to the common bean crop the yield components such as grain number per pod and 100 grain weight were not affected by the water deficit the variable grain number per pod is an inherent characteristic to the cultivar and can be little affected by moderated environmental variations gohari 2013 argues that the 100 grain weight can present decrease when the common bean plants are submitted to more severe stresses since these conditions are responsible for accelerating the grain maturity besides that resulting in small grains and smaller mass in this study the harvest difference was of only seven days and the imposed stress was moderated not causing significant decrease for the 100 grain weight all the observed variables in the common bean yield components under water deficit reflected in the grain mass per plant and consequently in the total yield which had a decrease of approximately 50 for the deficit depth the quantity of yield loss because of stress is variable according to the genotype the intensity and the exposure time in which the plants get exposed to the stressing condition the common bean decrease yield due to water deficit was reported by several authors and they reinforced that the flowering and grain filling are the most sensitive phenological stages in case the irrigation depth is imposed in stage corresponding to the grain maturing the yield loss is smaller providing to the producers the choice of adopting strategies for the irrigation management to save water and energy chacón et al 2019 soureshjani et al 2019 ghassemi et al 2018 mathobo et al 2017 in this study there was not significant effect of the biostimulants treatments to the variables related to the growth biomass accumulation and common bean yield kept under water deficit the stress intensity the application manner characteristics of the microorganism used concentration and the doses may influence the possible benefits of the biostimulants to the growth and yield of agricultural crops some authors report that certain beneficial microorganisms respond better to the environmental conditions and present higher capacity of promoting the growth and stimulate the plants when they are associated with other microorganisms singh et al 2014 the lineage in this paper bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 neither in the isolated treatment nor associated to the algae extract was capable of stimulate the plants in control conditions or water deficit therefore the species used was not effective as growth promoting even when associated to algae extract kumar et al 2016 studied the synergetic effect of pseudomonas putidaand bacillus amyloliquefaciens in chickpea plants submitted to water stress in that study the authors noticed that the synergetic application of biostimulants has a better potential to promote the plant growth under water stress conditions when compared to the use of lineages individually yet kasim et al 2013 studied the inoculation effect of bacillus amyloliquefaciens 5113 and azospirillum brasilense no40 in wheat plant submitted to wd the authors noticed that the bacterial inoculation improved the wheat growth under drought conditions besides better survival fresh and dry weight and water content the authors also reported that the rhizobacteria has been used mainly to promote the growth because they stimulate the plants through different means such as the production of growth regulators which interfere in the crop production similar results were found by naveed et al 2014 to the corn crop and sarma and saikia 2014 to the common bean such reports found in the literature reinforce that knowledge about the species to be used and the isolated lineage is of great importance to reach the expected results and bring return to the development and yield of crops with the use of this technology 5 conclusions it was not possible to correlate the use of biostimulants rhizobacteria and algae extract with the mitigation of water deficit effects in common bean plants the isolated application way or in association with other bioestimulant did not result in improvement to the rhizobacteria efficiency as a general objective it was observed the crop dependency to the water availability and even in moderated intensity this physical stress changed all the parameters evaluated in common bean plants 
10861,the water deficit wd is one of the severe problems in agriculture resulting in yield loss the understating of crops behavior face to this condition becomes of great importance and the use of biostimulants may act as a vegetal growth promoting considering its capacity of attenuate the impacts of wd on plants this study aimed at evaluating the common bean changes in biometric parameters and its yield supplemented with biostimulants as a response to the imposition of wd the assay was conducted in a protected environment in botucatu brazil with common bean cv iac imperador disposed in split plot in randomized blocks with 4 repetitions the treatments in the plots correspond to the irrigation depths 10 kpa and 40 kpa and in the subplots the treatment b1 control b2 bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 and b3 bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 brown algae extract ascophyllum nodosum the irrigation was by drip and the management using a tensiometer the biometric variables included stem diameter leaf number and leaf area leaf dry mass stem root and total root length diameter and volume and yield parameters discussing the results it was possible to conclude that the common bean is a very water dependable crop with wd imposition interfering in all the studied variables with growth decrease biomass accumulation and yield the applied biostimulants b2 and b3 presented low capacity to attenuate the wd effects in common bean under the cultivation conditions adopted keywords drought stress growth promoting bacteria irrigation management phaseolus vulgaris l 1 introduction the common bean phaseolus vulgaris l is one of the main crops produced in the world the expectation for the total brazilian grain production in the 2018 2019 harvest is of 3 07 million tons conab 2019 one of the primordial factors to the common bean crop development and acquisition of high productivity is the ideal water supply in the different phenological stages kobayashi et al 2016 the stress caused by the lack of water in the soil has considerable impacts in the growth and productivity of the common bean however the effects are highly variable according to the exposure time the stress intensity imposed to the plants characteristics of the cultivar used and plants ability to adapt to this adverse condition rosales et al 2012 emam et al 2010 this way like a big part of agricultural crops it is known that the common bean is very sensitive to the water deficit wd especially when this condition is imposed in the phenological stages of flowering and during pod filling mathobo et al 2017 therefore it is of big importance the study of plants behavior under water stress in the conditions and way of conventional cultivation because of the development of new cultivation technologies some alternatives have been presented in the rural field in order to attenuate the effects of biotic and abiotic stress in the growth and yield of crops among the most widespread alternatives we highlight the use of biostimulants to promote the vegetal growth these natural compounds may be grouped as beneficial microorganisms such as the plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb and mycorrhizae besides extracts from different sources like the ones obtained from brown algae grover et al 2014 kasim et al 2013 the action of biostimulants seems to be related to the production of phytohormones improving the nutrients contribution induction of root growth besides helping in the osmotic adjustment through the synthesis of organic compounds and in the induction of antioxidant response systems kumar and verma 2018 ngumbi and kloepper 2016 vurukonda et al 2016 guiry 2012 this essay aimed at evaluating the effects of water deficiency on biometric parameters and common bean production from treatments with the biostimulants we have studied a possible attenuation in the impacts of water deficiency on the vegetal growing and development 2 materials and methods the experiment was conducted in an agricultural greenhouse with 60 m² of area in botucatu brazil the climate of the city according to koppen is classified as hot tempered mesothermal with average of annual precipitation of 1 428 mm the average of annual temperature in this region is 20 5 c and relative humidity between 70 and 20 alvares et al 2013 cunha and martins 2009v 2 1 weather data in order to monitor the weather conditions during the experiment temperature and relative humidity measurement were performed with the assistance of an automatic datalogger installed at the central region of the greenhouse and programmed to execute readings at each 30 min the temperature average during all the period was 26 c and relative humidity was 63 5 appropriate values to the common bean development 2 2 treatments and experimental design the treatments with common bean plants phaseolus vulgaris l cv iac imperador were disposed in split plot being allotted two irrigation depths in the plots control 10 kpa and moderate water deficiency mwd 40 kpa and three combinations of biostimulants in the subplots b1 control b2 bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 3 109 ufc ml 1 b3 bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 brown algae extract ascophyllum nodosum in experimental design in randomized blocks with 4 repetitions and 10 plants for repetition the experimental units were constituted of polyethylene pots with capacity of 30 liters in dystrophic red latosol in sandy loam soil with the following characteristics organic matter 7 g dm 3 ph cacl2 4 2 p resin 2 mg dm 3 k 0 4 ca2 12 mg 2 2

bean crop according to aguiar et al 2014 the application of treatments with biostimulants was performed through seed inoculation si one hour before the planting for treatment b1 the si was performed with distilled water with dose of 2 ml kg 1 seeds b2 biostimulant bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 with the dose of 2 ml kg 1 seeds b3 bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 algae extract ascophyllum nodosum in the dosage of 2 ml kg 1 seeds each after the inoculation the planting was performed on 23 08 2018 with four seeds per pot predicting subsequent roughing leading 2 plants per pot 2 3 crop management and irrigation the irrigation system was by drip in which self compensating medium flow button type emitters were used 2 0 l h 1 and operation pressure at 10 mca the distribution uniformity coefficient was calculated and the result found was 98 classified as excellent according to classification proposed by bernardo et al 2006 the irrigation management was via soil through the use of six tensiometers per experimental plot installed in the depth of 0 15 m the monitoring of water tension in the soil was performed daily with the assistance from a puncture digital tensiometer and the tension values converted in volumetric humidity based on the adjustment equation of soil water retention curve the adjustment of soil water retention curve was performed through the pattern proposed by van genuchten 1980 initially all the treatment combinations receive the same water depth increasing the soil humidity to the tension 10 kpa near field capacity the differentiation of irrigation depths in the plots occurred in corresponding stage to the beginning of crop flowering at 35 days after emergency dae for phytosanitary treatment it was performed only one application of the insecticide orthene 750 br and two applications of the fungicide cerconil wp in doses according to the manufacturer recommendations zinc deficiency was detected in the phenological stage v4 which was corrected with the application of 1 kg ha 1 of zinc sulfate diluted in water via soil before the harvest the irrigation was suspended in both treatments in order to dry the grains in the plant the harvest of the treatments submitted to wd occurred at 77 dae and of the treatment of the control irrigation depth at 84 dae 2 4 date of evaluations the biometric evaluations were performed at 56 dae when the plants were in the grain filling stage phenological stage corresponding to r8 to which one plant for repetition was used the collecting occurred in the beginning of the morning at the end of the experiment the pods collecting was performed and the yield estimate for the treatments for which the average of six plants for repetition was used the analyzed variables were stem diameter leaf number leaf area leaf dry matter stem root and total length diameter and root volume and production parameters 2 5 biometric parameters the stem diameter determination was performed with the assistance of a digital caliper mm at approximately 1 5 cm from the soil surface to leaf number and leaf area all the leaves from a plant were collected counted and later the leaf area was measured with the assistance of the integrative model li cor li 3000 the results were expressed as cm2 plant 1 the dry matter was determined by putting samples in the greenhouse with forced air circulation at 60 c 5 until constant weight and later they were weighed in a precision scale 2 6 root morphology in order to evaluate the root morphology we ve used the root system of a plant for repetition in each treatment the roots were washed and placed in glass jars with 70 alcohol solution and stored in a fridge to later evaluation of root structures with the assistance of the software winrhizo 2 7 yield and yield components after the harvest the grains were manually separated from the pods counted and weighed the production parameters evaluated were pod and grain numbers per plant grain number per pod 100 grain weight mass of grains per plant g and yield estimate kg ha considering a population of 240 thousand plants per hectare and the grain humidity corrected to 13 the grain humidity after the harvest was obtained by the greenhouse method at 105 3 c for 24 h and the data expressed in percentage wet basis brasil 2009 2 8 statistical analysis to perform the statistical analysis the obtained data were initially submitted to the kolmogorov smirnov normality test with the assistance of the software minitab 17 and when the normality of the data was confirmed they were submitted to the variance analysis and when significant the tukey s test was applied to compare the averages at the depth 5 of probability using the software agrostat 3 results 3 1 stem diameter to the stem diameter variable table 1 after the differentiation of irrigation depths significant effect was observed only for the water treatment the moderate water deficiency mwd depth 40 kpa presented plants with stem diameter around 15 smaller when compared to plants with normal irrigation control 10 kpa these results show that the wd caused damage to the stem growing and the use of biostimulants was not efficient to mitigate the stress effect 3 2 leaf number and leaf area the total leaf number were measured table 2 and significant effect was not detected for the evaluation period in relation to the leaf area variable table 3 significance was found only for the principal effect in the irrigation depths it was found then that the wd resulted in decrease of 37 in the leaf area when compared to the condition of full irrigation the treatments with biostimulants did not influence this variable however it was possible to observe that the treatments b2 and b3 presented reductions of approximately 6 and 13 respectively when compared to treatment b1 3 3 dry matter the evaluations of plant dry biomass accumulation are summarized in table 4 the leaf dry matter analysis denotes significant difference only for the irrigation depths treatments where the wd caused a decrease of 42 in this parameter compared to the control plants the treatments b1 b2 and b3 did not differ statistically the stem dry matter was influenced by the irrigation depths treatments with the control depth being 42 superior to the wd treatment it is observed that the biostimulants did not influence the stem dry mass of the common bean also in table 4 it was observed that the root dry matter did not present significant difference for none of the treatments to the total dry matter obtainment it was counted the green pod dry mass completely formed until the harvest period the presented results indicate that there was a significant effect only for the water treatments with a decrease of 45 in the total biomass accumulation when the plants were submitted to the condition of wd 3 4 root morphology the root morphology evaluation is presented in table 5 after the root scanning and image treatment using the software winrhizo it is possible to evaluate that the root length did not change in a significant way due to the applied treatments there was effect to the irrigation depths in relation to the root diameter and volume to these measurements the control plants where the soil humidity was kept near field capacity presented higher averages differing from the deficit depth in relation to the treatments with biostimulants there was not significant effect to none of the variables however in general it was possible to observe that the highest averages correspond to treatment b3 highlighting the root volume which was approximately 18 superior to the control b1 and 20 superior to b2 3 5 yield and yield components the production components and the yield are presented in table 6 there was not significant effect with application of the treatments to the grains per pod number and 100 grain weight for the pod per plant number grains per plant grain mass per plant it was observed that the irrigation depths influenced significantly to these variables the deficit irrigation depth was responsible for a decrease of 45 46 and 50 respectively when compared to the control treatment on the other hand the treatments with biostimulants did not present effect to these measurements these results can affect the yield considering that the wd treatment induced a decrease of 50 in the total yield average 4 discussion the imposition of the water deficit resulted in significant decrease in stem diameter table 1 the decrease of water availability may affect the physiological and metabolic activities in plants which modify morphologic characteristics especially in the ones related to growth chai et al 2016 according to padilha et al 2016 the growth decrease occurs due to the cell turgor decrease which is a factor directly related to the cell expansion thus globally wd events induce to the lowest growth rates although a significant difference for leaf number was not found it was possible to notice a reduction tendency as a response to stress table 2 this reduction was observed in a significant manner for leaf area when the irrigation depths differentiation was established the reduction was 37 lower when compared to the control plot table 3 these results show that a smaller water availability in the soil may affect the development of new leaves accelerating leaf senescence besides slowing down the growth of remaining leaves emam et al 2010 mathobo et al 2017 observed a decrease in the leaf area in common bean submitted to different conditions of water stress the same effect was found by soureshjani et al 2019 in common bean kept on wd the plants perform this morphological artifice as a strategy to decrease the transpiration area and as a consequence mitigate the water loss to the environment when the stress is too severe the plants in prolonged dehydration stage cannot keep or recuperate their leaf area this way they reduce the light interception area and the essential metabolic activities which eventually results in plant death sahoo et al 2013 in this essay the decrease in leaf number and leaf area with the imposition of wd reflected on the leaf dry matter table 4 which presented decrease of 42 compared to the irrigation depth of control plants 10 kpa a similar behavior was observed to stem dry matter also with a significant decrease of 42 and 40 to root dry matter the total dry matter presented decrease of 45 in the deficit irrigation depth the results show that the wd affected the biomass accumulation in a very significant way the lowest dry matter production can be related to the total leaf area decrease thus changing the light interception surface as a consequence resulting in the decline of photosynthetic activity mathobo et al 2017 several authors have related the decrease of biomass accumulation and growth in common bean submitted to wd being this morphological variable one of the most affected by this adverse condition these effects vary due to the genetic material cultivar phenological stage and stress intensity chacón et al 2019 soureshjani et al 2019 mathobo et al 2017 based on the root morphology evaluations table 5 it was

especially in relation to treatment b3 several authors discuss that the plant associations rhizobacteria and algae extract seem to be beneficial and induce the root growth as a response to the environmental stress especially the water stress vurukonda et al 2016 ngumbi and kloepper 2016 kasim et al 2013 the irrigation depths differentiation and the imposition of water deficit conditions to the applied treatments occurred in the phenological stage r6 corresponding to the beginning of the crop flowering stage the wd at this moment reduce the production parameters such as the pod per plant and grains per plant when compared to the control condition table 6 this decrease can be a result of the senescence process and flower abortion once the plants under stress reduce the photosynthetic metabolism and photoassimilate accumulation these events can induce to the viability loss and flower senescence similar behavior was observed by several authors ghassemi et al 2018 mathobo et al 2017

inherent characteristic to the cultivar and can be little affected by moderated environmental variations gohari 2013 argues that the 100 grain weight can present decrease when the common bean plants are submitted to more severe stresses since these conditions are responsible for accelerating the grain maturity besides that resulting in small grains and smaller mass in this study the harvest difference was of only seven days and the imposed stress was moderated not causing significant decrease for the 100 grain weight all the observed variables in the common bean yield components under water deficit reflected in the grain mass per plant and consequently in the total yield which had a decrease of approximately 50 for the deficit depth the quantity of yield loss because of stress is variable according to the genotype the intensity and the exposure time in which the plants get exposed to the stressing condition the common bean decrease yield due to water deficit was reported by several authors and they reinforced that the flowering and grain filling are the most sensitive phenological stages in case the irrigation depth is imposed in stage corresponding to the grain maturing the yield loss is smaller providing to the producers the choice of adopting strategies for the irrigation management to save water and energy chacón et al 2019 soureshjani et al 2019 ghassemi et al 2018 mathobo et al 2017 in this study there was not significant effect of the biostimulants treatments to the variables related to the growth biomass accumulation and common bean yield kept under water deficit the stress intensity the application manner characteristics of the microorganism used concentration and the doses may influence the possible benefits of the biostimulants to the growth and yield of agricultural crops some authors report that certain beneficial microorganisms respond better to the environmental conditions and present higher capacity of promoting the growth and stimulate the plants when they are associated with other microorganisms singh et al 2014 the lineage in this paper bacillus amyloliquefaciens bv 03 neither in the isolated treatment nor associated to the algae extract was capable of stimulate the plants in control conditions or water deficit therefore the species used was not effective as growth promoting even when associated to algae extract kumar et al 2016 studied the synergetic effect of pseudomonas putidaand bacillus amyloliquefaciens in chickpea plants submitted to water stress in that study the authors noticed that the synergetic application of biostimulants has a better potential to promote the plant growth under water stress conditions when compared to the use of lineages individually yet kasim et al 2013 studied the inoculation effect of bacillus amyloliquefaciens 5113 and azospirillum brasilense no40 in wheat plant submitted to wd the authors noticed that the bacterial inoculation improved the wheat growth under drought conditions besides better survival fresh and dry weight and water content the authors also reported that the rhizobacteria has been used mainly to promote the growth because they stimulate the plants through different means such as the production of growth regulators which interfere in the crop production similar results were found by naveed et al 2014 to the corn crop and sarma and saikia 2014 to the common bean such reports found in the literature reinforce that knowledge about the species to be used and the isolated lineage is of great importance to reach the expected results and bring return to the development and yield of crops with the use of this technology 5 conclusions it was not possible to correlate the use of biostimulants rhizobacteria and algae extract with the mitigation of water deficit effects in common bean plants the isolated application way or in association with other bioestimulant did not result in improvement to the rhizobacteria efficiency as a general objective it was observed the crop dependency to the water availability and even in moderated intensity this physical stress changed all the parameters evaluated in common bean plants 
10862,water scarcity in the north china plain ncp is threatening irrigation of predominant winter wheat summer maize rotation and thus rotation yield to maximally reduce irrigation input while maintaining relatively high yield is urgently needed and an enduring challenge here we present an innovative practice that considers the water use of the entire rotation system i e application of presowing irrigation to reach 85 of the field capacity for wheat w0 compared with the common practice of applying twice more irrigation with each 750 m3 ha 1 during the wheat season w2 after sowing maize 750 m3 ha 1 irrigation was applied for both practices the main hypothesis was that reducing wheat irrigation would lead to lower water content in the soil which would in turn preserve more rain in the maize season and that earlier maturity of wheat caused by reduced irrigation would advance earlier maize sowing to utilize more radiation and thermal inputs resulting in higher maize yield which would compensate for decreased wheat yield from 2012 to 2016 the 0 200 cm soil water contents as well the yield and its components were monitored at key growth stages of wheat and maize there was consistently lower water content under w0 than under w2 from flowering to maturity of wheat making 4 5 days earlier maturity under the w0 practice and led to a higher accumulated temperature of maize relative to the w2 practice the grain yields of wheat maize and rotation were 6694 to 9218 kg ha 1 7284 to 12 843 kg ha 1 16 336 to 20 605 kg ha 1 respectively the temperature accumulated after silking well explained the interannual variation in maize yield in contrast to temperature rainfall during the maize season explained the yield difference between two practices the maize yield was 6 4 higher under the w0 practice than under the w2 practice in a year with sufficient rainfall above 451 mm and this trend was unpronounced under rare drought stress below 250 mm of rainfall leading to a 7 5 lower yield the average yield of the four rotation rounds under w0 was equal to that under w2 nevertheless the w0 practice significantly increased the water use efficiency under rotation by 12 9 on average the irrigated amount in each rotation under w0 was significantly reduced by 1126 m3 ha 1 relative to w2 therefore the w0 practice is a simple and promising water management strategy for addressing shortages of water and labor while maintaining relatively high rotation yield in the ncp keywords precipitation yield gap evapotranspiration reduced irrigation underground water 1 introduction winter wheat summer maize rotation is the main crop system in the north china plain ncp and its productivity accounts for 21 6 of the mass grain yield gy in china sun et al 2010 the water requirement of winter wheat is similar to that of summer maize approximately 430 mm sun et al 2010 rainfall during the growing season of summer maize generally meets the growth requirement therefore irrigation is only given right after planting maize to ensure the success of germination fang et al 2010 compared with maize the rainfall in the winter wheat season was much lower ranging from less than 50 mm in dry years to approximately 200 mm in wet years and showing a probability of being below 100 mm of 75 according to historical data from 1960 to 2005 sun et al 2006 furthermore because potential evapotranspiration et largely exceeds precipitation during the wheat growing season winter wheat primarily depends on irrigation to produce a high yield zhang et al 2004 ground water is the main water resource exploited for wheat irrigation farmers historically irrigated winter wheat fields 5 6 times during the growing season and wheat water use efficiency wue and gy were not improved sun et al 2006 qiu et al 2008 chen et al 2014 as a result excessive water exploitation caused the ground water table to gradually decrease with a falling rate of approximately 1 m per year during the last 20 years jia and liu 2002 the water shortage has greatly threatened sustainable wheat production in the ncp zhang et al 2013 consequently efficient and sustainable water management is urgently needed to maintain gys lopezcastaneda and richards 1994 zhang et al 2006 tardieu 2013 the current recommended water management practice of implementing 2 3 irrigation events has to a large extent reduced the extraction of groundwater and maintained a high wheat yield however farmers are often in danger of lacking water to irrigate wheat due to consistently decreasing groundwater levels in some regions of the ncp thus improved requirement for water use management in terms of reducing irrigation events or amounts is needed to cope with intensifying water shortages while maintaining the sustainable grain production needed for food security previous studies in ncp on irrigation management focused on wheat or maize alone rarely considering integrative rotation system characteristics the altered irrigation management in wheat may influence the later maize first under insufficient irrigation or drought stress the roots of wheat can go deeper to utilize the water in deeper soil xu et al 2016 which therefore enlarges the water reserving pool of the soil system and allows it to preserve more rainfall during the later maize season in addition studies have shown that rain fed wheat can promote the maturity of winter wheat asseng et al 2004 xu et al 2018 and that shortening the wheat growing season may provide benefits for summer maize since the grain filling stage of maize has often been constrained in the ncp due to decreased temperatures during the late season limiting the gy wang et al 2012a planting maize earlier can to some extent advance the maize grain filling stage in the ncp because radiation and thermal input conditions at the reproductive stage are better earlier than later grassini et al 2009 wang et al 2012b however there is limited evidence that maize and rotation yields can be increased by decreasing irrigation during the wheat season in this study we investigate and discuss the rotation yield potential of a water saving practice based on a field experiment i e only one round of irrigation was applied to prior to sowing wheat considering that irrigation is essential for stable and high yields and wue zhang et al 2004 lawes et al 2009 li et al 2010 benjamin et al 2015 we hypothesized that this water saving practice would enhance maize production under earlier planting which would compensate for the reduced gy of winter wheat under limited irrigation and this trend would vary with rainfall amount across years the objectives of the study were 1 to compare the gy and wue of wheat maize and the whole rotation system between a new water saving practice and a current water management practice and 2 to explore the potential factors affecting rotation gy among years and between the two practices e g differences in precipitation or

order 2016 2013 2015 2014 and it was 11 2 and 131 7 higher in 2016 than in 2015 and 2014 respectively the mean air temperature of the winter wheat season was 6 3 for 2012 2013 7 8 for 2013 2014 7 4 for 2014 2015 and 6 1 for 2015 2016 fig 1 the mean air temperature for the summer maize season was 25 3 24 2 23 4 and 25 3 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 1 the w0 practice had a consistently shorter wheat growth period than the w2 practice table 2 briefly the times of flowering and maturity were 1 2 days and 4 5 days earlier respectively under w0 than under w2 table 2 for the late summer maize the sowing date was 4 5 days earlier under w0 than under w2 the 12th leaf and silking started 2 3 days earlier under w0 than under w2 3 2 temporal and spatial distributions of soil moisture in the 0 200 cm layer and the rotation irrigation amount the soil moisture dynamics of the 0 200 cm soil layer from 2012 to 2016 are shown in fig 2 from the flowering to maturity of wheat water content of the 0 200 cm soil layer decreased except in 2013 exhibiting an increasing trend from the maturity of wheat to the 12th leaf stage of maize the water content of 0 100 cm soil layer increased in all the years and the water contents of 100 200 cm soil layer did not change in any years except 2016 from the 12th leaf to silking stages of maize water content of the 0 200 cm soil layer did not apparently change except in 2016 exhibiting an apparent increasing trend under w0 from the silking to maturity of maize water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased in all the years while water content of the 100 200 cm soil layer under w0 clearly increased in 2016 among the treatments at the wheat flowering stage in the four wheat seasons the water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer under w0 was lower than that under w2 and no difference in the water content of the 100 200 cm soil layer was observed at wheat maturity the water content difference between w0 and w2 expanded to a deeper soil layer except in 2012 2013 briefly the water content under w0 w2 was 5 8 24 6 9 4 25 3 in 2013 2014 7 3 24 7 9 7 24 8 in 2014 2015 and 6 5 26 6 9 2 26 1 in 2015 2016 during the maize seasons at the 12th leaf stage the water contents of the 0 180 cm soil layer except for the surface 0 20 cm under w0 were lower than those under w2 from 2014 to 2016 fig 2 in the 20 200 cm soil layer the water contents in w0 w2 were 10 9 24 6 13 1 25 3 in 2014 10 6 24 5 14 8 24 4 in 2015 and 14 1 23 3 20 2 27 0 in 2016 at silking water contents of the 0 200 cm layer under w0 were lower than those under w2 in 2014 and 2015 under w0 w2 they were 10 6 24 3 11 3 24 6 in 2014 and 13 5 24 6 19 0 24 3 in 2015 however in 2016 the water contents above 100 cm were similar between w0 and w2 which were 20 2 22 0 and 20 6 22 2 respectively and a difference was found in 100 200 cm soil layer with 18 9 23 7 for w0 and 22 1 28 5 for w2 at maturity the difference in water content between w0 and w2 was observed only below 100 cm from 2014 to 2016 in this study the irrigation amount in each rotation was consistently and significantly lower under w0 than under w2 p 0 05 fig 3 during the four rotation rounds the average irrigation amount was 1126 m3 ha 1 lower under w0 than under w2 fig 3 3 3 grain yield seasonal evapotranspiration and water use efficiency the gys of wheat maize and their rotation were 6694 to 9218 kg ha 1 7284 to 12 843 kg ha 1 and 16 336 to 20 605 kg ha 1 respectively during the four year study table 3 the gys of winter wheat during the four seasons followed the order 2012 2013 2013 2014 2015 2016 2014 2015 and the gys under w0 in the four seasons were consistently lower than those under w2 table 3 for summer maize the gys during the four years followed the order 2016 2015 2014 2013 the gy level of maize in 2013 was generally lower than that in other years since the natural lodging the rotation gy was 7 4 and 5 0 lower under w0 than under w2 in 2014 and 2015 p 0 05 respectively while the gy of w0 was 12 1 and 6 4 higher under w0 than under w2 in 2013 and 2016 p 0 05 respectively taking the average of the four seasons the gy of wheat was lower under w0 than under w2 while no significant difference was found in the rotation yields the gy of winter wheat as well as the yields of maize and the rotation system was significantly p 0 05 affected by irrigation year and the irrigation year interaction the et of wheat maize or the rotation system was consistently lower under w0 than under w2 during the four year experiment during the maize growing seasons the mean et of the summer maize under w2 in 2014 2015 and 2016 was 66 mm 55 mm and 67 mm greater than that under w0 respectively the et of winter wheat in 2015 2016 was higher than that in other years the irrigation regime and year had a significant effect on et p 0 05 table 3 the et of the rotation system under w2 was 5 7 15 4 14 4 and 12 0 higher than that under w0 in 2012 2013 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively the wue of winter wheat as well as summer maize was significantly affected p 0 01 by year and irrigation but not by the year and irrigation practice interaction the wue of wheat under w0 was not different from that under w2 in contrast the maize under w0 had 10 1 to 12 9 higher wue than that under w2 during the four seasons the wue of the rotation system was significantly affected by year and irrigation but not by the interaction between year and irrigation practice p 0 05 among the irrigation practices w0 had a consistently higher wue than w2 with significant differences in 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 in which the wue under w0 was 4 7 6 0 and 9 1 higher than that under w2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil water dynamics during the wheat season the soil water content difference between w0 and w2 expanded from 0 to 100 cm at flowering to the deeper soil layer of 0 200 cm at maturity and this agrees with previous findings that rain fed wheat extracted more water from the deeper soil layers in the ncp zhang et al 2004 2006 this result is potentially due to differences in root depth among different irrigation strategies zhang et al 2006 xu et al 2016 for instance xu et al 2016 conducted a field study in the same region and found that compared with sufficient irrigation i e 600 m3 ha 1 water applied after the turning green jointing and flowering stages a lack of irrigation increased the extraction of deeper soil water by wheat due to the higher root length density in this study at the time of wheat maturity the water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer was lower under w0 than that under w2 fig 2 showing the larger capacity for w0 to conserve rainfall during the summer maize season across the different years however there was high variability in precipitation during the summer maize seasons which had a notable effect on the soil water content figs 1 and 2 during the maize season the rainfall in 2014 was notably lower according to the recorded amounts sun et al 2006 in 2014 and 2015 when rainfall in the maize season was less abundant than that in the other years at the jointing and silking stages there was lower water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer under w0 than under w2 drought stress during the silking stage as the critical period determining maize yield can cause ovaries to fail to expose their silks and pollen shedding eventually affecting the kernel number per spike otegui et al 1995 the lower water contents under w0 than under w2 in 2014 and 2015 coincided with the lower yield under w0 on the other hand in the year with more rainfall 2016 the water contents of w0 and w2 at silking were similar in the 0 100 cm soil layer which is the maize root dominated zone thus during the maize season the water content difference between w0 and w2 can be eliminated with sufficient rainfall 4 2 grain yield and benefit analysis across the four winter wheat seasons the consistently lower gy under w0 than under w2 illustrated that irrigation is an important limiting factor for maintaining winter wheat yield the lower wheat yield under w0 than under w2 was associated with significant decreases in spike number and kernel number per spike table 4 and this finding agrees with the result from a recent study showing decreased wheat productivity under limited irrigation xu et al 2018 as a consequence of drought stress created by reduced irrigation in wheat the w0 practice led to 4 5 days earlier wheat maturity than w2 across the four wheat seasons the earlier maturity of wheat likely provided benefits to later maize in the ncp the decreases in temperature and solar radiation during the later stages of the maize season are the critical factors constraining the grain filling stage and the final yield gao et al 2018 earlier maturity of wheat can leave time for early sown maize to utilize more solar radiation and thermal resources which in turn is beneficial for increasing maize yield in this study a higher maize yield under w0 than under w2 was observed in 2013 in 2014 and 2015 the maize yield under w0 was lower than that under w2 potentially due to the low precipitation in the maize season in 2014 and 2015 fig 1 especially in 2014 which rarely occurred in the past three decades in the ncp sun et al 2006 such low precipitation appeared to be more harmful to the maize yield of w0 than to that of w2 as shown by the lower water content at the 12th leaf stage and silking stage the key periods for maize yield establishment and the lower spike or kernel number under w0 than under w2 in contrast sufficient rainfall during maize growth for instance in 2016 appeared to be the critical factor for eliminating the difference in maize yield between w0 and w2 as well as the difference in yield components i e spike number kernel number per spike and thousand kernel weight between the w0 and w2 practices fig 4 in addition the accumulated temperature during the maize season is also an important factor for the gy grassini et al 2009 urban et al 2012 this relationship was found under each practice in our study but was not pronounced if considering all the practices together fig 5 in contrast there was a clear relationship between the temperature accumulated after silking and the gy under all the practices fig 5 the early sowing of maize under w0 can facilitate the temperature accumulated during the whole maize season or after silking while the higher maize gy of w0 than w2 was only seen in 2016 fig 5 although meteorological conditions varied among the years including the rare drought occurring during the maize season in one year taking into account the rotation yields of the four years there appeared to be no significant difference in the average gy between w0 and w2 thus the increased yield of maize under w0 relative to w2 offset the decrease in the wheat yield and eventually maintained a rotation yield comparable to that under w2 our results show that reduced irrigation during the winter wheat season has the potential to advance maize sowing and increase yield on the other hand maize as a c4 crop can accumulate more biomass promote dry matter remobilization and produce a higher gy if it grows under a suitable temperature and obtains more light energy than if these conditions are not met kucharik 2008 tsimba et al 2013 maize yield can be increased by postponing harvest time in the ncp wang et al 2012b the harvest time of maize under w0 can be postponed for 4 5 days and may have the potential to improve maize yield in addition the average irrigation amount applied in one rotation under w0 was 1126 m3 ha 1 smaller than that applied under the w2 practice the current water saving irrigation practices of applying one round of irrigation at jointing zhang et al 2013 or two rounds of irrigation at jointing and heading flowering li et al 2010 chen et al 2014 were recommended to maintain high wheat yield and wue in the ncp however considering the water use of the whole rotation system which experiences a discordant rainfall distribution the wue of maize as well as the wue of the rotation system was significantly increased under w0 compared with w2 showing the promising potential of the w0 practice to cope with the increasing water shortage challenge in the ncp in the ncp in addition to the decreasing groundwater depth presenting intensive challenges for irrigating fields insufficient laborers is a critical issue constraining field management since young people prefer working in cities and earning high incomes thus simpler field management is needed in terms of eliminating labor input and maintaining yield based on the four year experiment our results illustrated that the w0 practice is highly cost effective in terms of directly reducing the input of laborers electricity and transportation and dramatically reducing the extraction of the groundwater resource for irrigation furthermore the w0 practice can result in a comparable rotation yield to that under the w2 practice additionally with the time saved by reducing irrigation event farmers can earn income from other activities the w0 practice thus appears to be a win win strategy in terms of saving water and improving profits in the ncp 5 conclusion using a field experiment from 2012 to 2016 we examined the winter wheat summer maize rotation yield potential under the w0 practice which involved applying irrigation only before wheat was sown relative to the w2 practice with two times more irrigation 750 m3 ha 1 at the jointing and flowering stages during the wheat season compared with the w2 practice the w0 practice extracted more water from the 0 200 cm soil layer during the wheat season and increased the wue of subsequent maize additionally wheat matured 4 5 days under the w0 practice earlier than under the w2 practice and maize yield was significantly enhanced by w0 relative to w2 while receiving sufficient rainfall likely more than 451 mm although precipitation had highly variable effects on the summer maize and a significant influence on maize yield under the w0 practice considering the whole rotation system the mean yield of the four rotation rounds under w0 was comparable to that under w2 similar to precipitation during the maize seasons the temperature accumulated after silking had a determinant effect on the interannual variation in maize gy but this effect did not explain the difference in maize gy between w0 and w2 the w0 practice showed promising potential to maintain a high rotation yield while saving irrigation water 1126 m3 ha 1 per rotation round in addition the simple w0 practice to some extent reduced the input of labor which is sharply deficient in villages due to the income imbalance between rural areas and cities in conclusion the results of this four rotation experiment verify that the w0 practice is a promising simplified field management method in terms of saving water saving labor and maintaining yield that provides a solution for coping with the intensive water and labor deficit challenge in the ncp and in other similar areas acknowledgements this

10862,water scarcity in the north china plain ncp is threatening irrigation of predominant winter wheat summer maize rotation and thus rotation yield to maximally reduce irrigation input while maintaining relatively high yield is urgently needed and an enduring challenge here we present an innovative practice that considers the water use of the entire rotation system i e application of presowing irrigation to reach 85 of the field capacity for wheat w0 compared with the common practice of applying twice more irrigation with each 750 m3 ha 1 during the wheat season w2 after sowing maize 750 m3 ha 1 irrigation was applied for both practices the main hypothesis was that reducing wheat irrigation would lead to lower water content in the soil which would in turn preserve more rain in the maize season and that earlier maturity of wheat caused by reduced irrigation would advance earlier maize sowing to utilize more radiation and thermal inputs resulting in higher maize yield which would compensate for decreased wheat yield from 2012 to 2016 the 0 200 cm soil water contents as well the yield and its components were monitored at key growth stages of wheat and maize there was consistently lower water content under w0 than under w2 from flowering to maturity of wheat making 4 5 days earlier maturity under the w0 practice and led to a higher accumulated temperature of maize relative to the w2 practice the grain yields of wheat maize and rotation were 6694 to 9218 kg ha 1 7284 to 12 843 kg ha 1 16 336 to 20 605 kg ha 1 respectively the temperature accumulated after silking well explained the interannual variation in maize yield in contrast to temperature rainfall during the maize season explained the yield difference between two practices the maize yield was 6 4 higher under the w0 practice than under the w2 practice in a year with sufficient rainfall above 451 mm and this trend was unpronounced under rare drought stress below 250 mm of rainfall leading to a 7 5 lower yield the average yield of the four rotation rounds under w0 was equal to that under w2 nevertheless the w0 practice significantly increased the water use efficiency under rotation by 12 9 on average the irrigated amount in each rotation under w0 was significantly reduced by 1126 m3 ha 1 relative to w2 therefore the w0 practice is a simple and promising water management strategy for addressing shortages of water and labor while maintaining relatively high rotation yield in the ncp keywords precipitation yield gap evapotranspiration reduced irrigation underground water 1 introduction winter wheat summer maize rotation is the main crop system in the north china plain ncp and its productivity accounts for 21 6 of the mass grain yield gy in china sun et al 2010 the water requirement of winter wheat is similar to that of summer maize approximately 430 mm sun et al 2010 rainfall during the growing season of summer maize generally meets the growth requirement therefore irrigation is only given right after planting maize to ensure the success of germination fang et al 2010 compared with maize the rainfall in the winter wheat season was much lower ranging from less than 50 mm in dry years to approximately 200 mm in wet years and showing a probability of being below 100 mm of 75 according to historical data from 1960 to 2005 sun et al 2006 furthermore because potential evapotranspiration et largely exceeds precipitation during the wheat growing season winter wheat primarily depends on irrigation to produce a high yield zhang et al 2004 ground water is the main water resource exploited for wheat irrigation farmers historically irrigated winter wheat fields 5 6 times during the growing season and wheat water use efficiency wue and gy were not improved sun et al 2006 qiu et al 2008 chen et al 2014 as a result excessive water exploitation caused the ground water table to gradually decrease with a falling rate of approximately 1 m per year during the last 20 years jia and liu 2002 the water shortage has greatly threatened sustainable wheat production in the ncp zhang et al 2013 consequently efficient and sustainable water management is urgently needed to maintain gys lopezcastaneda and richards 1994 zhang et al 2006 tardieu 2013 the current recommended water management practice of implementing 2 3 irrigation events has to a large extent reduced the extraction of groundwater and maintained a high wheat yield however farmers are often in danger of lacking water to irrigate wheat due to consistently decreasing groundwater levels in some regions of the ncp thus improved requirement for water use management in terms of reducing irrigation events or amounts is needed to cope with intensifying water shortages while maintaining the sustainable grain production needed for food security previous studies in ncp on irrigation management focused on wheat or maize alone rarely considering integrative rotation system characteristics the altered irrigation management in wheat may influence the later maize first under insufficient irrigation or drought stress the roots of wheat can go deeper to utilize the water in deeper soil xu et al 2016 which therefore enlarges the water reserving pool of the soil system and allows it to preserve more rainfall during the later maize season in addition studies have shown that rain fed wheat can promote the maturity of winter wheat asseng et al 2004 xu et al 2018 and that shortening the wheat growing season may provide benefits for summer maize since the grain filling stage of maize has often been constrained in the ncp due to decreased temperatures during the late season limiting the gy wang et al 2012a planting maize earlier can to some extent advance the maize grain filling stage in the ncp because radiation and thermal input conditions at the reproductive stage are better earlier than later grassini et al 2009 wang et al 2012b however there is limited evidence that maize and rotation yields can be increased by decreasing irrigation during the wheat season in this study we investigate and discuss the rotation yield potential of a water saving practice based on a field experiment i e only one round of irrigation was applied to prior to sowing wheat considering that irrigation is essential for stable and high yields and wue zhang et al 2004 lawes et al 2009 li et al 2010 benjamin et al 2015 we hypothesized that this water saving practice would enhance maize production under earlier planting which would compensate for the reduced gy of winter wheat under limited irrigation and this trend would vary with rainfall amount across years the objectives of the study were 1 to compare the gy and wue of wheat maize and the whole rotation system between a new water saving practice and a current water management practice and 2 to explore the potential factors affecting rotation gy among years and between the two practices e g differences in precipitation or temperature accumulated during the maize season 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil characteristics the experiment was carried out from october 2012 to october 2016 encompassing

691 mm for 2015 2016 respectively fig 1 over 70 of the annual precipitation was distributed in the summer maize growing season among the years the precipitation during the maize season followed the order 2016 2013 2015 2014 and it was 11 2 and 131 7 higher in 2016 than in 2015 and 2014 respectively the mean air temperature of the winter wheat season was 6 3 for 2012 2013 7 8 for 2013 2014 7 4 for 2014 2015 and 6 1 for 2015 2016 fig 1 the mean air temperature for the summer maize season was 25 3 24 2 23 4 and 25 3 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 1 the w0 practice had a consistently shorter wheat growth period than the w2 practice table 2 briefly the times of flowering and maturity were 1 2 days and 4 5 days earlier respectively under w0 than under w2 table 2 for the late summer maize the sowing date was 4 5 days earlier under w0 than under w2 the 12th leaf and silking started 2 3 days earlier under w0 than under w2 3 2 temporal and spatial distributions of soil moisture in the 0 200 cm layer and the rotation irrigation amount the soil moisture dynamics of the 0 200 cm soil layer from 2012 to 2016 are shown in fig 2 from the flowering to maturity of wheat water content of the 0 200 cm soil layer decreased except in 2013 exhibiting an increasing trend from the maturity of wheat to the 12th leaf stage of maize the water content of 0 100 cm soil layer increased in all the years and the water contents of 100 200 cm soil layer did not change in any years except 2016 from the 12th leaf to silking stages of maize water content of the 0 200 cm soil layer did not apparently change except in 2016 exhibiting an apparent increasing trend under w0 from the silking to maturity of maize water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased in all the years while water content of the 100 200 cm soil layer under w0 clearly increased in 2016 among the treatments at the wheat flowering stage in the four wheat seasons the water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer under w0 was lower than that under w2 and no difference in the water content of the 100 200 cm soil layer was observed at wheat maturity the water content difference between w0 and w2 expanded to a deeper soil layer except in 2012 2013 briefly the water content under w0 w2 was 5 8 24 6 9 4 25 3 in 2013 2014 7 3 24 7 9 7 24 8 in 2014 2015 and 6 5 26 6 9 2 26 1 in 2015 2016 during the maize seasons at the 12th leaf stage the water contents of the 0 180 cm soil layer except for the surface 0 20 cm under w0 were lower than those under w2 from 2014 to 2016 fig 2 in the 20 200 cm soil layer the water contents in w0 w2 were 10 9 24 6 13 1 25 3 in 2014 10 6 24 5 14 8 24 4 in 2015 and 14 1 23 3 20 2 27 0 in 2016 at silking water contents of the 0 200 cm layer under w0 were lower than those under w2 in 2014 and 2015 under w0 w2 they were 10 6 24 3 11 3 24 6 in 2014 and 13 5 24 6 19 0 24 3 in 2015 however in 2016 the water contents above 100 cm were similar between w0 and w2 which were 20 2 22 0 and 20 6 22 2 respectively and a difference was found in 100 200 cm soil layer with 18 9 23 7 for w0 and 22 1 28 5 for w2 at maturity the difference in water content between w0 and w2 was observed only below 100 cm from 2014 to 2016 in this study the irrigation amount in each rotation was consistently and significantly lower under w0 than under w2 p 0 05 fig 3 during the four rotation rounds the average irrigation amount was 1126 m3 ha 1 lower under w0 than under w2 fig 3 3 3 grain yield seasonal evapotranspiration and water use efficiency the gys of wheat maize and their rotation were 6694 to 9218 kg ha 1 7284 to 12 843 kg ha 1 and 16 336 to 20 605 kg ha 1 respectively during the four year study table 3 the gys of winter wheat during the four seasons followed the order 2012 2013 2013 2014 2015 2016 2014 2015 and the gys under w0 in the four seasons were consistently lower than those under w2 table 3 for summer maize the gys during the four years followed the order 2016 2015 2014 2013 the gy level of maize in 2013 was generally lower than that in other years since the natural lodging the rotation gy was 7 4 and 5 0 lower under w0 than under w2 in 2014 and 2015 p 0 05 respectively while the gy of w0 was 12 1 and 6 4 higher under w0 than under w2 in 2013 and 2016 p 0 05 respectively taking the average of the four seasons the gy of wheat was lower under w0 than under w2 while no significant difference was found in the rotation yields the gy of winter wheat as well as the yields of maize and the rotation system was significantly p 0 05 affected by irrigation year and the irrigation year interaction the et of wheat maize or the rotation system was consistently lower under w0 than under w2 during the four year experiment during the maize growing seasons the mean et of the summer maize under w2 in 2014 2015 and 2016 was 66 mm 55 mm and 67 mm greater than that under w0 respectively the et of winter wheat in 2015 2016 was higher than that in other years the irrigation regime and year had a significant effect on et p 0 05 table 3 the et of the rotation system under w2 was 5 7 15 4 14 4 and 12 0 higher than that under w0 in 2012 2013 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively the wue of winter wheat as well as summer maize was significantly affected p 0 01 by year and irrigation but not by the year and irrigation practice interaction the wue of wheat under w0 was not different from that under w2 in contrast the maize under w0 had 10 1 to 12 9 higher wue than that under w2 during the four seasons the wue of the rotation system was significantly affected by year and irrigation but not by the interaction between year and irrigation practice p 0 05 among the irrigation practices w0 had a consistently higher wue than w2 with significant differences in 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 in which the wue under w0 was 4 7 6 0 and 9 1 higher than that under w2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil water dynamics during the wheat season the soil water content difference between w0 and w2 expanded from 0 to 100 cm at flowering to the deeper soil layer of 0 200 cm at maturity and this agrees with previous findings that rain fed wheat extracted more water from the deeper soil layers in the ncp zhang et al 2004 2006 this result is potentially due to differences in root depth among different irrigation strategies zhang et al 2006 xu et al 2016 for instance xu et al 2016 conducted a field study in the same region and found that compared with sufficient irrigation i e 600 m3 ha 1 water applied after the turning green jointing and flowering stages a lack of irrigation increased the extraction of deeper soil water by wheat due to the higher root length density in this study at the time of wheat maturity the water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer was lower under w0 than that under w2 fig 2 showing the larger capacity for w0 to conserve rainfall during the summer maize season across the different years however there was high variability in precipitation during the summer maize seasons which had a notable effect on the soil water content figs 1 and 2 during the maize season the rainfall in 2014 was notably lower according to the recorded amounts sun et al 2006 in 2014 and 2015 when rainfall in the maize season was less abundant than that in the other years at the jointing and silking stages there was lower water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer under w0 than under w2 drought stress during the silking stage as the critical period determining maize yield can cause ovaries to fail to expose their silks and pollen shedding eventually affecting the kernel number per spike otegui et al 1995 the lower water contents under w0 than under w2 in 2014 and 2015 coincided with the lower yield under w0 on the other hand in the year with more rainfall 2016 the water contents of w0 and w2 at silking were similar in the 0 100 cm soil layer which is the maize root dominated zone thus during the maize season the water content difference between w0 and w2 can be eliminated with sufficient rainfall 4 2 grain yield and benefit analysis across the four winter wheat seasons the consistently lower gy under w0 than under w2 illustrated that irrigation is an important limiting factor for maintaining winter wheat yield the lower wheat yield under w0 than under w2 was associated with significant decreases in spike number and kernel number per spike table 4 and this finding agrees with the result from a recent study showing decreased wheat productivity under limited irrigation xu et al 2018 as a consequence of drought stress created by reduced irrigation in wheat the w0 practice led to 4 5 days earlier wheat maturity than w2 across the four wheat seasons the earlier maturity of wheat likely provided benefits to later maize in the ncp the decreases in temperature and solar radiation during the later stages of the maize season are the critical factors constraining the grain filling stage and the final yield gao et al 2018 earlier maturity of wheat can leave time for early sown maize to utilize more solar radiation and thermal resources which in turn is beneficial for increasing maize yield in this study a higher maize yield under w0 than under w2 was observed in 2013 in 2014 and 2015 the maize yield under w0 was lower than that under w2 potentially due to the low precipitation in the maize season in 2014 and 2015 fig 1 especially in 2014 which rarely occurred in the past three decades in the ncp sun et al 2006 such low precipitation appeared to be more harmful to the maize yield of w0 than to that of w2 as shown by the lower water content at the 12th leaf stage and silking stage the key periods for maize yield establishment and the lower spike or kernel number under w0 than under w2 in contrast sufficient rainfall during maize growth for instance in 2016 appeared to be the critical factor for eliminating the difference in maize yield between w0 and w2 as well as the difference in yield components i e spike number kernel number per spike and thousand kernel weight between the w0 and w2 practices fig 4 in addition the accumulated temperature during the maize season is also an important factor for the gy grassini et al 2009 urban et al 2012 this relationship was found under each practice in our study but was not pronounced if considering all the practices together fig 5 in contrast there was a clear relationship between the temperature accumulated after silking and the gy under all the practices fig 5 the early sowing of maize under w0 can facilitate the temperature accumulated during the whole maize season or after silking while the higher maize gy of w0 than w2 was only seen in 2016 fig 5 although meteorological conditions varied among the years including the rare drought occurring during the maize season in one year taking into account the rotation yields of the four years there appeared to be no significant difference in the average gy between w0 and w2 thus the increased yield of maize under w0 relative to w2 offset the decrease in the wheat yield and eventually maintained a rotation yield comparable to that under w2 our results show that reduced irrigation during the winter wheat season has the potential to advance maize sowing and increase yield on the other hand maize as a c4 crop can accumulate more biomass promote dry matter remobilization and produce a higher gy if it grows under a suitable temperature and obtains more light energy than if these conditions are not met kucharik 2008 tsimba et al 2013 maize yield can be increased by postponing harvest time in the ncp wang et al 2012b the harvest time of maize under w0 can be postponed for 4 5 days and may have the potential to improve maize yield in addition the average irrigation amount applied in one rotation under w0 was 1126 m3 ha 1 smaller than that applied under the w2 practice the current water saving irrigation practices of applying one round of irrigation at jointing zhang et al 2013 or two rounds of irrigation at jointing and heading flowering li et al 2010 chen et al 2014 were recommended to maintain high wheat yield and wue in the ncp however considering the water use of the whole rotation system which experiences a discordant rainfall distribution the wue of maize as well as the wue of the rotation system was significantly increased under w0 compared with w2 showing the promising potential of the w0 practice to cope with the increasing water shortage challenge in the ncp in the ncp in addition to the decreasing groundwater depth presenting intensive challenges for irrigating fields insufficient laborers is a critical issue constraining field management since young people prefer working in cities and earning high incomes thus simpler field management is needed in terms of eliminating labor input and maintaining yield based on the four year experiment our results illustrated that the w0 practice is highly cost effective in terms of directly reducing the input of laborers electricity and transportation and dramatically reducing the extraction of the groundwater resource for irrigation furthermore the w0 practice can result in a comparable rotation yield to that under the w2 practice additionally with the time saved by reducing irrigation event farmers can earn income from other activities the w0 practice thus appears to be a win win strategy in terms of saving water and improving profits in the ncp 5 conclusion using a field experiment from 2012 to 2016 we examined the winter wheat summer maize rotation yield potential under the w0 practice which involved applying irrigation only before wheat was sown relative to the w2 practice with two times more irrigation 750 m3 ha 1 at the jointing and flowering stages during the wheat season compared with the w2 practice the w0 practice extracted more water from the 0 200 cm soil layer during the wheat season and increased the wue of subsequent maize additionally wheat matured 4 5 days under the w0 practice earlier than under the w2 practice and maize yield was significantly enhanced by w0 relative to w2 while receiving sufficient rainfall likely more than 451 mm although precipitation had highly variable effects on the summer maize and a significant influence on maize yield under the w0 practice considering the whole rotation system the mean yield of the four rotation rounds under w0 was comparable to that under w2 similar to precipitation during the maize seasons the temperature accumulated after silking had a determinant effect on the interannual variation in maize gy but this effect did not explain the difference in maize gy between w0 and w2 the w0 practice showed promising potential to maintain a high rotation yield while saving irrigation water 1126 m3 ha 1 per rotation round in addition the simple w0 practice to some extent reduced the input of labor which is sharply deficient in villages due to the income imbalance between rural areas and cities in conclusion the results of this four rotation experiment verify that the w0 practice is a promising simplified field management method in terms of saving water saving labor and maintaining yield that provides a solution for coping with the intensive water and labor deficit challenge in the ncp and in other similar areas acknowledgements this

10863,plastic film mulching in combination with high plant density is a common practice for rain fed maize production especially in northeastern china to explore effects of plant density and plastic film mulching on the evapotranspiration of maize during its different growth periods a two year split plot field experiment with non mulching m0 and plastic film mulching m1 and three plant densities 60 000 d1 75 000 d2 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d3 was conducted at a site of shenyang located in the northeast china in 2016 and 2017 based on the field experimental data of spring maize water balance equation and dual crop coefficient method were adopted to explore effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on evapotranspiration of maize at different growing stages the results showed that compared with non mulching treatment the plastic film mulching increased maize transpiration by about 20 0 32 0 and 3 5 15 4 and reduced soil evaporation by 51 8 63 0 and 21 5 39 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively overall the mulching treatment significantly reduced maize water consumption by about 12 4 and 6 2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the mulching treatment also increased the basic maize crop coefficient by 0 03 0 07 and reduced the average evaporation coefficient by 0 14 compared with non mulching treatment in addition compared with non mulching plastic film mulching increased ratio of transpiration by 19 32 and 5 12 in 2016 and 2017 respectively for effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration higher plant density resulted in more evapotranspiration during the whole growth season of maize except for its initial growth stage the average evapotranspiration of d1 d3 treatments from two growing seasons of maize were 469 2 509 6 and 534 1 mm respectively for evaporation and transpiration the maize transpiration increased with the increase of planting density and the maize evaporation increased with the increase of planting density under plastic film mulching conditions but decreased with non mulching treatment keywords plastic film mulching plant density dual crop coefficient maize evapotranspiration 1 introduction changing climate and growing globe population in recent decades have resulted in higher risk of drought and a higher demand of food tilman et al 2011 misra 2014 wu et al 2017 therefore increasing crop yield with less water is an essential issue which needs to be taken seriously for sustainable crop production especially in rain fed area where precipitation is the major limiting resource for maize growth in china the northeastern plain is mainly dominated by rain fed farming systems and is one of the most important maize production areas in the whole country where scarce precipitation and low air temperatures in april and may often cause poor plant establishment deng et al 2006 chen et al 2015 thus one of the best ways to improve maize yields and rainfall use efficiency is making full use of limited precipitation and increasing soil temperature by using effective agronomic methods some previous studies have suggested that plastic film mulching and increasing plant density are two common agronomic activities that can augment rainfall use efficiency and soil temperature thereby improving maize yield bu et al 2013 mo et al 2017 jia et al 2018 yu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 previous experiments have shown that plastic film mulch can increase the soil temperature and decrease soil evaporation gan et al 2013 yin et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 reported that film mulching is an effective agricultural technique to eliminate the negative effects of water scarcity on crop growth in the recent decades the maize yield has continued to improve with the increase of maize plant density duvick 2005 some researchers have been reporting that high plant density can augment leaf area index lai establish an optimum canopy structure and increase number of maize ears per unit area li et al 2013 jia et al 2018 thus it improves maize yield and water use efficiency however a too high plant density possibly results in maize yield loss the reason for this negative effect of higher plant density on maize yield is that over high density planting can lead to adverse effects including excessively high lai causing self shading more barrenness higher plant to plant variability and fierce interplant competition for soil water fertilizer and radiation nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 trachsel et al 2016 jia et al 2018 the negative effects mentioned above of plant density on maize growth can be relieved by keeping field soil moisture considering that plastic film mulching has advantage of decreasing soil evaporation thus combination of plant density and plastic film mulching is an effective way to improve maize yield and water use efficiency ren et al 2017 presented a research on effecting of plastic film mulching and plant density on maize growth and water consumption and reported that plant density under plastic film mulching was higher than that under non mulching chen et al 2017 also reported that plastic film mulching can alleviate competition for limited water resources among maize plants and then increase maize yield although plethora of studied have been carried out to evaluate the efficacy of plant density and plastic film mulching on maize growth and water use the influence of these two combined agronomy measurements on water consumption and crop coefficient during different growth stages of maize has rarely been reported in previous literature above all the aims of this study were to determine the effects of plant density and plastic film mulching on actual evapotranspiration and its components of soil evaporation and maize transpiration at different maize growth stages and to quantify soil evaporation reduced and maize transpiration increased by plastic film mulching and higher plant density 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design experiments were conducted at the agricultural experimental field of shenyang agricultural university in the city of shenyang 41 44 n 123 27 e 44 7 m a s l liaoning province china in 2016 and 2017 there is a small meteorological station about fifty meters from the experimental field the experimental site is characterized by a continental monsoon climate from 1961 to 2017 the average annual air temperature was 8 0 with a frost free period of 155 to 180 days and average annual precipitation of 702 9 mm and with 79 of the rain falling in the spring maize growing season may to september the soil in the experimental area was humid loam with average soil bulk of 1 41 g cm 3 which was distributed evenly and is also typical in this area during the growing seasons of maize the field average depth to groundwater was 4 2 m with minimum and maximum depths to groundwater of 2 2 and 5 1 m respectively rainfall and daily average temperature during the experimental period 2016 and 2017 are illustrated in fig 1 the total precipitation in 2016 and 2017 were 874 4 mm and 398 9 mm with a frequency of 12 03 and 98 1 respectively making 2016 a moderate wet and 2017 an extreme dry year the experimental design was a split plot block experiment with two factors the main plot included two treatments non mulching m0 and black plastic film mulching m1 the split plot included three plant densities 60 000 d1 75 000 d2 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d3 thus six combinations of mulching and plant density treatments were tested each treatment had three replications respectively the area of each plot was 23 4 m2 3 9 m 6 m with three ridges and two furrows to achieve the different plant densities different plant spaces were designed the plant space was 26 cm 21 cm and 17 cm for d1 d2 and d3 respectively details about the experimental design are listed in table 1 this experiment used the traditional large ridge double lines planting method fig 2 on the average the topsoil 0 20 cm had ph of 7 28 and contained about 20 8 g kg 1 organic matter 0 87 g kg 1 of total nitrogen 8 9 g kg 1 of available phosphorous and 75 6 g kg 1 of available potassium 2 2 sampling and measurements soil water content was measured by a time domain reflectometer tdr sensor imko micromodultechnik gmbh germany system with an accuracy of 98 ren et al 2016 measurements were taken every 10 cm soil layer from 10 cm to 60 cm depth which is the main root zone for maize the leaf width and length were measured by ruler with five replications in each plot every 15 days and then the lai was calculated by following equation 1 lai 0 75 n l d a where lai is leaf area index n is amount number of plants per plot a is area of plot m2 l is length of maize leaf m and d is width of maize leaf m the height of maize was measured by tape with five replications in each plot every 15 days to get daily plant height the growth model named logistic model was used to fitting measured plant height fig 3 fig 3 showed that the r2 of models were all higher than 0 99 indicating that logistic model can be used to fit maize plant height 2 3 field water balance equation the water balance representing the balance of input and output soil water storage in maize root zone is expressed as follows wen et al 2017 2 w i 1 w i p i e t a q r where eta is actual evapotranspiration mm p is rainfall during maize growing season mm i is the irrigation mm q is the soil flow at bottom of root zone r is the surface runoff mm and wi 1 and wi are the soil water storages in maize root zone 0 60 cm at i 1 th and ith day respectively for this study irrigation was zero in pure rainfed region when wi 1 was larger than field capacity we assigned wi 1 to field capacity shang et al 2009 therefore the r did not play a role in the study eta and q are clarified in the following section when the initial soil water storage w0 was given the daily soil water storage during maize growth period can be calculated by eq 2 considering the effects of plant density and plastic film mulching on soil evaporation and maize transpiration the dual crop coefficient approach recommended by fao was used for this study eta is calculated from 3 e t a k c b k s k e e t o where

season and the late season stage the recommended values of kcb tab for different growth stages are given by fao 56 however in this study the kcb tab was estimated by genetic algorithm method which can effectively escape from local minima and then the actual kcb in the mid season and the late season stage were modified by following equation 4 k c b k c b t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where kcb is daily basal crop coefficient kcb tab is estimated basic crop coefficient u2 is wind speed rhmin is minimum relative humidity and h is the height of maize m soil evaporation coefficient

the soil that is both exposed and wetted kcmax estimated by equation as follows 6 k c max max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 k c b 0 05 where kcmax rhmin h and kcb are the same as mentioned above kr is calculated by following equation 7 k r t e w d e i 1 t e w r e w where tew is maximum depth of water evaporated from the soil when the topsoil has been initially completely wetted mm rew is readily evaporable water mm according to fao 56 recommended values of tew and rew are 20 mm and 10 mm respectively de cumulative depth of evaporation from the soil surface was calculated by following equation 8 d e i d e i 1 p i r i i i f w e i f e w t e w i d p e i where de i and de i 1 are cumulative depth on evaporation of day i and day i 1 respectively fw is fraction of soil surface

by the dataset of 2017 the calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 fraction of soil surface wetted by irrigation or rainfall fw of each plant density calculated by eq 11 were illustrated in table 3 adjustment coefficient of plant density acm estimated by eq 17 using lai fig 3 in 2016 and 2017 are listed in table 4 the performance of the modelled field water balance equation is given in table 5 results show that rmse for treatments in 2016 was 8 4 mm 21 4 mm with nrmse of 4 6 10 9 in 2017 an extreme dry year the rmse 14 3 mm to 18 2 mm and nrmse 8 3 to 11 2 were slightly higher than those in 2016 a moderately wet year nevertheless all nrmse were within acceptable ranges less than 20 wen et al 2017 and crms in two years were near zero indicating that the field water balance equation correctly estimates the soil water storage in 0 60 cm depth 3 2 effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on maize evapotranspiration maize evapotranspiration of plant density and plastic film mulching in different growth stages are listed in table 6 the results indicate that in the initial stage maize evapotranspiration of non mulching treatment was 3 9 and 2 2 times higher than that of plastic film mulching treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively in development stage the maize evapotranspiration of non mulching treatment was still 31 1 mm and 13 4 mm higher than that of mulching treatments in 2016 and 2017 respectively in contrast in mid season and late season stage plastic film mulching treatment increased maize evapotranspiration by 12 7 mm 15 1 mm and 0 4 mm and 14 5 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with non mulching treatment collectively plastic film mulching treatment decreased total maize evapotranspiration by 60 5 and 29 7 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 6 also showed that in maize four growth stages except initial stage maize water consumption was increasing with the increase of plant density in initial stage maize evapotranspiration for three plant density treatments were almost the same whereas in development mid season and late season stage average maize evapotranspiration of d3 was 19 0 52 0 and 28 0 mm and 13 0 4 3 and 11 9 greater than that of d1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively as a result compared with d1 and d2 treatments d3 treatment increased total maize evapotranspiration by 100 2 and 37 6 mm and 29 7 and 11 3 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on kcb ks and transpiration values of kcb and ks under film mulching and non mulching treatments are illustrated in fig 5 the results of fig 5 show that two years average kcb in maize initial development mid season and late season stage for mulching and non mulching treatment are 0 18 0 43 0 67 and 0 44 and 0 15 0 38 0 62 and 0 37 respectively indicating that plastic film mulching increased basal crop coefficient compared with non mulching treatment in addition in development stage the speed of kc under mulching treatment was faster than that under non mulching treatment fig 5a and d showing that plastic film mulching fastened the process of maize development the duration of mid season stage was also longer than that of non mulching treatment indicating that plastic film mulching can prolong the duration of maize vigorous time which was a key period of maize yield formation fig 5c shows that in 2016 during maize whole growth period ks was 1 00 which indicates that maize under plastic film mulching did not suffer from soil water depletion however under non mulching treatment the ks value during mid season stage in which the maize needed more water was lower than 1 0 which demonstrated that maize growth was suffering water stress during that stage this result proved that highest plant density with plastic film mulching can alleviate soil water stress for maize growth and then promote maize yield however the ks values under mulching treatment was higher than that non mulching treatment in 2017 when the precipitation was less than half of the precipitation in 2016 as to impacts of plastic mulching on maize transpiration in initial stage maize transpiration under mulching was 5 6 and 6 1 mm lower than that without mulching in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 in development stage maize transpiration under mulching was almost the same with that of non mulching in 2016 and 16 5 mm lower than that without mulching in 2017 however in mid and late season stages plastic film mulching improved maize transpiration by 50 2 and 48 9 mm in 2016 and 12 5 21 3 mm in 2017 respectively the values of kcb and ks of d1 d2 and d3 treatment under plastic film mulching are illustrated in fig 6 the results show that the value of kcb increased with increasing plant density fig 6a the highest average value of kcb was 0 52 and 0 54 observed from d3 treatment which was 0 15 and 0 04 and 0 11 and 0 06 higher than kcb of d1 and d2 treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively moreover the ks value were 1 0 for all cases in 2016 which indicated that under mulching treatment maize growth was free from soil water stress in 2016 but in 2017 during the development and mid season stage the ks less than 1 0 indicating that the maize suffered soil water stress in 2017 which has been an extreme dry year under non mulching condition the effects of plant density on kcb value was similar with effects under plastic film mulching condition fig 7 a and d nevertheless fig 7c illustrates that ks for d3 treatment was lower than 1 0 in mid season growth stage in 2016 and was decreasing as plant density increased in 2017 which demonstrated that higher plant density may increase risk for suffering water stress especially in key growing stages of maize for maize transpiration the results in table 7 indicated that in the two growing seasons of experiment maize transpiration under different plant density treatments were almost the same in maize initial stage however after maize initial stage the higher plant density resulted in more maize transpiration whether it was under mulching or non mulching treatment compared with d1 treatment d3 augmented maize transpiration by 22 3 66 8 and 34 9 mm in development mid season and late season stage in 2016 respectively those values in 2017 were 15 1 14 1 and 12 mm which were lower than those in 2016 overall an obviously increasing trend of total maize transpiration in whole maize growth season was observed with the increasing of plant density compared with d1 treatment d3 treatment increased maize total transpiration by 93 8 and 21 3 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 also shows that maize total transpiration under plastic film mulching treatment was ranging from 305 9 mm to 421 9 mm and from 293 4 to 320 5 mm almost 20 32 and 3 5 to 15 4 higher than that of non mulching treatment ranging from 214 3 mm to 346 3 mm and from 254 3 to 309 7 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively in addition ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration was 74 78 and 42 to 59 for mulching and non mulching treatment respectively in 2016 and was 64 to 65 and 52 to 60 for mulching and non mulching treatment respectively in 2017 verifying that plastic film mulching increased maize ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration and then obtained higher maize yield 3 4 effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on ke and evaporation fig 5b and e illustrates that during whole maize growth period ke under mulching treatment was keeping low level with maximum ke of 0 37 and 0 32 with average ke of 0 16 and 0 26 in 2016 and 2017 respectively whereas for non mulching treatment maximum and average ke was 0 97 and 0 35 and 0 94 and 0 36 in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with d1 treatment d3 increased ke by 6 9 and 2 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively under plastic film mulching however under non mulching treatment ke was decreasing with increasing plant density fig 7b and e under plastic film mulching soil evaporation increased slightly with the increase of plant density in initial development mid season and late season stage maize evaporation of d3 was 0 8 1 7 3 6 and 0 9 mm higher than that of d1 respectively in 2016 in 2017 d3 increased maize evaporation by 1 0 and 3 2 mm in initial and late growth stages respectively and in development and mid season stages soil evaporation among different plant densities were almost the same in contrast under non mulching treatment soil evaporation of d3 was 8 2 33 1 and 14 5 mm lower than that of d1 in development mid season and late season stage respectively in 2016 in 2017 those values were 3 6 19 3 and 3 5 mm overall concerning the effect of increasing plant density on total soil evaporation under mulching treatment d3 slightly increased soil evaporation by 7 0 and 3 2 mm compared with d1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively whereas under non mulching treatment d3 significantly decreased evaporation by 54 7 and 26 3 mm compared with d1 in 2016 and 2017 in addition total soil evaporation of mulching treatment was 109 6 mm 116 6 mm and 168 1 mm 171 3 mm almost 51 8 63 and 21 5 39 5 lower than that of non mulching treatment which was 241 9 mm 296 6 mm and 208 2 mm 234 5 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize evapotranspiration research on effects of plastic film mulching on maize evapotranspiration received much attention from researchers most studies found that plastic film mulching can significantly reduce maize water consumption ren et al 2017 who studied the influence of plastic film mulching and plant density on maize water consumption in the semi humid region of north china and found that compared with non mulching treatment plastic film mulching increased maize evapotranspiration by 21 4 mm similarly li et al 2013 explored the impacts of plastic film mulching and straw mulching on maize water consumption and found that plastic film mulching considerably decreased soil evaporation and then reduced maize total evapotranspiration the results in this study also indicated that plastic film mulching significantly reduced maize evapotranspiration by 60 5 and 29 7 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with non mulching treatment which was in good agreement with previous researches gan et al 2013 yin et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 however the result that plastic film mulching can markedly reduce maize water consumption was not consistent bu et al 2013 who assessed the effects of mulching on maize water use efficiency in the semi arid rain fed region of loess plateau in china found that plastic film mulching did not significantly influence maize evapotranspiration the reason for this result was that although plastic film mulching markedly decreased soil evaporation it also significantly increased the maize transpiration in this study the maize transpiration of plastic film mulching treatment was higher than that of non mulching treatment in mid season and late season stages a few studies have provided evidence that the reason for decreasing eta under plastic mulching is that plastic film mulching significantly reduces the eta in initial stage ren et al 2017 demonstrated that plastic film mulching decreased eta before maize jolting stage similarly in our study the response of eta to plastic film mulching differed in four different growing stages in initial and development stage film mulching decreased eta by 57 1 and 31 1 mm in 2016 and 31 2 and 13 3 mm in 2017 respectively whereas it increased eta by 12 7 and 15 1 mm in mid season and late season stage in 2016 and 0 4 and 14 5 mm in 2017 respectively compared with non mulching this was mainly because in mid season and late season stage the maize plants fully covered the surface of soil reducing impacts of plastic film mulching on decreasing soil evaporation in addition maize under mulching treatment had more transpiration than that of no mulching in literature effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration varied widely by environment and region ren et al 2016 for example ren et al 2016 reported that the eta was considerably increased by the increase of plant density in normal and extreme wet years jiang et al 2016 also reported that the eta was markedly influenced by the plant density but barbieri et al 2012 found that the eta was not affected by plant density in this study the eta was significantly increased with the increase of the plant density from 60 000 to 90 000 plants ha 1 in general compared with d1 and d2 d3 increased maize evapotranspiration by 100 2 and 37 6 mm and 30 0 and 11 9 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively it is mainly because the reduction of soil evaporation is lower than the increase of the maize transpiration we agree with ren et al 2016 who concluded that the difference between the reduction of the soil evaporation and increase of the transpiration determines whether higher plant density can reduce maize eta 4 2 evaporation and transpiration generally mulching plastic film and fitting plant density according to the soil properties could not only increase maize transpiration but also decrease maize evaporation in this work compared with non mulching treatment plastic film mulching increased maize transpiration and reduced soil evaporation which were similar with the reference value listed in fao 56 document page 196 allan et al 1998 the reasonable explanation for this result was that plastic film mulching increased maize plant height and lai and then increased basic crop coefficient and decreased soil evaporation coefficient figs 3 and 4 in addition the transpiration ratio to evapotranspiration of mulching and non mulching treatment indicated that plastic film mulching can obviously augment maize transpiration ratio to evapotranspiration and then improve maize growth and water use efficiency this result was consistent with that obtained by wen et al 2017 who explored the impacts of plastic film mulching on wheat water use and found that plastic film mulching significantly improved wheat transpiration ratio and water use efficiency ren et al 2016 assessed the impact of plant density on maize transpiration and soil evaporation for different hydrological years who found that increasing plant density ranging from 52 500 to 97 500 plants ha 1 results in higher transpiration and lower soil evaporation for this study the experimental results indicated that under mulching treatment soil evaporation increased with increasing plant density whereas under non mulching treatment soil evaporation decreased with the increase of plant density the response of soil evaporation coefficient to plant density was the same as the response of evaporation to plant density this was mainly because under non mulching condition higher plant density contributed to more shade for soil surface resulting in lower soil evaporation coefficient and under plastic film mulching treatment more plants per area resulted in more vent holes on plastic film causing higher soil evaporation coefficient for maize transpiration higher plant density resulted in more maize transpiration under both film mulching and non mulching treatment in addition in 2016 as a moderate wet year the maize under plastic film mulching was free from soil water stress whereas under non mulching and d3 treatment maize growth was constrained by soil water this indicated that plastic film mulching can increase soil moisture and then alleviate the stress of soil water on maize growth under high plant density in wet year however in 2017 as an extreme dry year the maize under mulching treatment suffered more soil water stress than the non mulching treatment in mid season stage the reasons for this result might have been that during the extreme dry and warm year the water consumption increased in mid season while the plastic film partly prevented rainfall from infiltrating into subsoil layer 5 conclusion this work has adopted the dual crop coefficient method and field water balance model to assess the impact of plant density and plastic film mulch on maize transpiration soil evaporation maize crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient the results showed that plastic film mulching increased maize transpiration by 20 0 32 0 and 3 5 15 4 and reduced soil evaporation by 51 8 63 0 and 21 5 39 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively ultimately reducing maize total evapotranspiration by 12 4 and 6 2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared to non mulching treatment higher maize crop coefficient and lower soil evaporation coefficient were obtained under plastic film mulching moreover in initial and development stage maize water consumption of mulching treatment was lower than that of non mulching treatment whereas in mid season and late season stage mulching treatment resulted in more maize water consumption than non mulching treatment additionally maize evapotranspiration increased with the increase of plant density under plastic film mulching soil evaporation and soil evaporation coefficient increased with the increase of plant density whereas under non mulching it reversed generally speaking according to our work we suggest the plant density of maize fitting high plant density breed ranging from 75 000 to 90 000 plants ha 1 with plastic film mulching for best water use practices in our research area or similar region acknowledgements this research was financially supported by natural science foundation of liaoning province

10863,plastic film mulching in combination with high plant density is a common practice for rain fed maize production especially in northeastern china to explore effects of plant density and plastic film mulching on the evapotranspiration of maize during its different growth periods a two year split plot field experiment with non mulching m0 and plastic film mulching m1 and three plant densities 60 000 d1 75 000 d2 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d3 was conducted at a site of shenyang located in the northeast china in 2016 and 2017 based on the field experimental data of spring maize water balance equation and dual crop coefficient method were adopted to explore effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on evapotranspiration of maize at different growing stages the results showed that compared with non mulching treatment the plastic film mulching increased maize transpiration by about 20 0 32 0 and 3 5 15 4 and reduced soil evaporation by 51 8 63 0 and 21 5 39 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively overall the mulching treatment significantly reduced maize water consumption by about 12 4 and 6 2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the mulching treatment also increased the basic maize crop coefficient by 0 03 0 07 and reduced the average evaporation coefficient by 0 14 compared with non mulching treatment in addition compared with non mulching plastic film mulching increased ratio of transpiration by 19 32 and 5 12 in 2016 and 2017 respectively for effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration higher plant density resulted in more evapotranspiration during the whole growth season of maize except for its initial growth stage the average evapotranspiration of d1 d3 treatments from two growing seasons of maize were 469 2 509 6 and 534 1 mm respectively for evaporation and transpiration the maize transpiration increased with the increase of planting density and the maize evaporation increased with the increase of planting density under plastic film mulching conditions but decreased with non mulching treatment keywords plastic film mulching plant density dual crop coefficient maize evapotranspiration 1 introduction changing climate and growing globe population in recent decades have resulted in higher risk of drought and a higher demand of food tilman et al 2011 misra 2014 wu et al 2017 therefore increasing crop yield with less water is an essential issue which needs to be taken seriously for sustainable crop production especially in rain fed area where precipitation is the major limiting resource for maize growth in china the northeastern plain is mainly dominated by rain fed farming systems and is one of the most important maize production areas in the whole country where scarce precipitation and low air temperatures in april and may often cause poor plant establishment deng et al 2006 chen et al 2015 thus one of the best ways to improve maize yields and rainfall use efficiency is making full use of limited precipitation and increasing soil temperature by using effective agronomic methods some previous studies have suggested that plastic film mulching and increasing plant density are two common agronomic activities that can augment rainfall use efficiency and soil temperature thereby improving maize yield bu et al 2013 mo et al 2017 jia et al 2018 yu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 previous experiments have shown that plastic film mulch can increase the soil temperature and decrease soil evaporation gan et al 2013 yin et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 reported that film mulching is an effective agricultural technique to eliminate the negative effects of water scarcity on crop growth in the recent decades the maize yield has continued to improve with the increase of maize plant density duvick 2005 some researchers have been reporting that high plant density can augment leaf area index lai establish an optimum canopy structure and increase number of maize ears per unit area li et al 2013 jia et al 2018 thus it improves maize yield and water use efficiency however a too high plant density possibly results in maize yield loss the reason for this negative effect of higher plant density on maize yield is that over high density planting can lead to adverse effects including excessively high lai causing self shading more barrenness higher plant to plant variability and fierce interplant competition for soil water fertilizer and radiation nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 trachsel et al 2016 jia et al 2018 the negative effects mentioned above of plant density on maize growth can be relieved by keeping field soil moisture considering that plastic film mulching has advantage of decreasing soil evaporation thus combination of plant density and plastic film mulching is an effective way to improve maize yield and water use efficiency ren et al 2017 presented a research on effecting of plastic film mulching and plant density on maize growth and water consumption and reported that plant density under plastic film mulching was higher than that under non mulching chen et al 2017 also reported that plastic film mulching can alleviate competition for limited water resources among maize plants and then increase maize yield although plethora of studied have been carried out to evaluate the efficacy of plant density and plastic film mulching on maize growth and water use the influence of these two combined agronomy measurements on water consumption and crop coefficient during different growth stages of maize has rarely been reported in previous literature above all the aims of this study were to determine the effects of plant density and plastic film mulching on actual evapotranspiration and its components of soil evaporation and maize transpiration at different maize growth stages and to quantify soil evaporation reduced and maize transpiration increased by plastic film mulching and higher plant density 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design experiments were conducted at the agricultural experimental field of shenyang agricultural university in the city of shenyang 41 44 n 123 27 e 44 7 m a s l liaoning province china in 2016 and 2017 there is a small meteorological station about fifty meters from the experimental field the experimental site is characterized by a continental monsoon climate from 1961 to 2017 the average annual air temperature was 8 0 with a frost free period of 155 to 180 days and average annual precipitation of 702 9 mm and with 79 of the rain falling in the spring maize growing season may to september the soil in the experimental area was humid loam with average soil bulk of 1 41 g cm 3 which was distributed evenly and is also typical in this area during the growing seasons of maize the field average depth to groundwater was 4 2 m with minimum and maximum depths to groundwater of 2 2 and 5 1 m respectively rainfall and daily average temperature during the experimental period 2016 and 2017 are illustrated in fig 1 the total precipitation in 2016 and 2017 were 874 4 mm and 398 9 mm with a frequency of 12 03 and 98 1 respectively making 2016 a moderate wet and 2017 an extreme dry year the experimental design was a split plot block experiment with two factors the main plot included two treatments non mulching m0 and black plastic film mulching m1 the split plot included three plant densities 60 000 d1 75 000 d2 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d3 thus six combinations of mulching and plant density treatments were tested each treatment had three replications respectively the area of each plot was 23 4 m2 3 9 m 6 m with three ridges and two furrows to achieve the different plant densities different plant spaces were designed the plant space was 26 cm 21 cm and 17 cm for d1 d2 and d3 respectively details about the experimental design are listed in table 1 this experiment used the traditional large ridge double lines planting method fig 2 on the average the topsoil 0 20 cm had ph of 7 28 and contained about 20 8 g kg 1 organic matter 0 87 g kg 1 of total nitrogen 8 9 g kg 1 of available phosphorous and 75 6 g kg 1 of available potassium 2 2 sampling and measurements soil water content was measured by a time domain reflectometer tdr sensor imko micromodultechnik gmbh germany system with an accuracy of 98 ren et al 2016 measurements were taken every 10 cm soil layer from 10 cm to 60 cm depth which is the main root zone for maize the leaf width and length were measured by ruler with five replications in each plot every 15 days and then the lai was calculated by following equation 1 lai 0 75 n l d a where lai is leaf area index n is amount number of plants per plot a is area of plot m2 l is length of maize leaf m and d is width of maize leaf m the height of maize was measured by tape with five replications in each plot every 15 days to get daily plant height the growth model named logistic model was used to fitting measured plant height fig 3 fig 3 showed that the r2 of models were all higher than 0 99 indicating that logistic model can be used to fit maize plant height 2 3 field water balance equation the water balance representing the balance of input and output soil water storage in maize root zone is expressed as follows wen et al 2017 2 w i 1 w i p i e t a q r where eta is actual evapotranspiration mm p is rainfall during maize growing season mm i is the irrigation mm q is the soil flow at bottom of root zone r is the surface runoff mm and wi 1 and wi are the soil water storages in maize root zone 0 60 cm at i 1 th and ith day respectively for this study irrigation was zero in pure rainfed region when wi 1 was larger than field capacity we assigned wi 1 to field capacity shang et al 2009 therefore the r did not play a role in the study eta and q are clarified in the following section when the initial soil water storage w0 was given the daily soil water storage during maize growth period can be calculated by eq 2 considering the effects of plant density and plastic film mulching on soil evaporation and maize transpiration the dual crop coefficient approach recommended by fao was used for this study eta is calculated from 3 e t a k c b k s k e e t o where eta is actual maize evapotranspiration mm eto is reference evapotranspiration mm calculated by penman monteith equation allan et al 1998 k cb is basal crop coefficient k s is soil water stress coefficient and k e is soil water evaporation coefficient according to the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 the growth period of maize is divided into four stages the initial the development the mid season and the late season stage the recommended values of kcb tab for different growth stages are given by fao 56 however in this study the kcb tab was estimated by genetic algorithm method which can effectively escape from local minima and then the actual kcb in the mid season and the late season stage were modified by following equation 4 k c b k c b t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where kcb is daily basal crop coefficient kcb tab is estimated basic crop coefficient u2 is wind speed rhmin is minimum relative humidity and h is the height of maize m soil evaporation coefficient represents the evaporation component of eta if the soil is wet following rain or irrigation ke may be large however the sum of kcb and ke can never exceed a maximum value kcmax determined by the energy available for evapotranspiration at the soil surface allan et al 1998 in this work ke was calculated by following equation 5 k e min k r k c max k c b f e w k c max where kcmax is maximum of kc following rain or irrigation kr is dimensionless evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on the cumulative depth of water depleted evaporated from the topsoil allan et al 1998 few is fraction of the soil that is both exposed and wetted kcmax estimated by equation as follows 6 k c max max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 k c b 0 05 where kcmax rhmin h and kcb are the same as mentioned

by the dataset of 2017 the calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 fraction of soil surface wetted by irrigation or rainfall fw of each plant density calculated by eq 11 were illustrated in table 3 adjustment coefficient of plant density acm estimated by eq 17 using lai fig 3 in 2016 and 2017 are listed in table 4 the performance of the modelled field water balance equation is given in table 5 results show that rmse for treatments in 2016 was 8 4 mm 21 4 mm with nrmse of 4 6 10 9 in 2017 an extreme dry year the rmse 14 3 mm to 18 2 mm and nrmse 8 3 to 11 2 were slightly higher than those in 2016 a moderately wet year nevertheless all nrmse were within acceptable ranges less than 20 wen et al 2017 and crms in two years were near zero indicating that the field water balance equation correctly estimates the soil water storage in 0 60 cm depth 3 2 effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on maize evapotranspiration maize evapotranspiration of plant density and plastic film mulching in different growth stages are listed in table 6 the results indicate that in the initial stage maize evapotranspiration of non mulching treatment was 3 9 and 2 2 times higher than that of plastic film mulching treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively in development stage the maize evapotranspiration of non mulching treatment was still 31 1 mm and 13 4 mm higher than that of mulching treatments in 2016 and 2017 respectively in contrast in mid season and late season stage plastic film mulching treatment increased maize evapotranspiration by 12 7 mm 15 1 mm and 0 4 mm and 14 5 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with non mulching treatment collectively plastic film mulching treatment decreased total maize evapotranspiration by 60 5 and 29 7 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 6 also showed that in maize four growth stages except initial stage maize water consumption was increasing with the increase of plant density in initial stage maize evapotranspiration for three plant density treatments were almost the same whereas in development mid season and late season stage average maize evapotranspiration of d3 was 19 0 52 0 and 28 0 mm and 13 0 4 3 and 11 9 greater than that of d1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively as a result compared with d1 and d2 treatments d3 treatment increased total maize evapotranspiration by 100 2 and 37 6 mm and 29 7 and 11 3 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on kcb ks and transpiration values of kcb and ks under film mulching and non mulching treatments are illustrated in fig 5 the results of fig 5 show that two years average kcb in maize initial development mid season and late season stage for mulching and non mulching treatment are 0 18 0 43 0 67 and 0 44 and 0 15 0 38 0 62 and 0 37 respectively indicating that plastic film mulching increased basal crop coefficient compared with non mulching treatment in addition in development stage the speed of kc under mulching treatment was faster than that under non mulching treatment fig 5a and d showing that plastic film mulching fastened the process of maize development the duration of mid season stage was also longer than that of non mulching treatment indicating that plastic film mulching can prolong the duration of maize vigorous time which was a key period of maize yield formation fig 5c shows that in 2016 during maize whole growth period ks was 1 00 which indicates that maize under plastic film mulching did not suffer from soil water depletion however under non mulching treatment the ks value during mid season stage in which the maize needed more water was lower than 1 0 which demonstrated that maize growth was suffering water stress during that stage this result proved that highest plant density with plastic film mulching can alleviate soil water stress for maize growth and then promote maize yield however the ks values under mulching treatment was higher than that non mulching treatment in 2017 when the precipitation was less than half of the precipitation in 2016 as to impacts of plastic mulching on maize transpiration in initial stage maize transpiration under mulching was 5 6 and 6 1 mm lower than that without mulching in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 in development stage maize transpiration under mulching was almost the same with that of non mulching in 2016 and 16 5 mm lower than that without mulching in 2017 however in mid and late season stages plastic film mulching improved maize transpiration by 50 2 and 48 9 mm in 2016 and 12 5 21 3 mm in 2017 respectively the values of kcb and ks of d1 d2 and d3 treatment under plastic film mulching are illustrated in fig 6 the results show that the value of kcb increased with increasing plant density fig 6a the highest average value of kcb was 0 52 and 0 54 observed from d3 treatment which was 0 15 and 0 04 and 0 11 and 0 06 higher than kcb of d1 and d2 treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively moreover the ks value were 1 0 for all cases in 2016 which indicated that under mulching treatment maize growth was free from soil water stress in 2016 but in 2017 during the development and mid season stage the ks less than 1 0 indicating that the maize suffered soil water stress in 2017 which has been an extreme dry year under non mulching condition the effects of plant density on kcb value was similar with effects under plastic film mulching condition fig 7 a and d nevertheless fig 7c illustrates that ks for d3 treatment was lower than 1 0 in mid season growth stage in 2016 and was decreasing as plant density increased in 2017 which demonstrated that higher plant density may increase risk for suffering water stress especially in key growing stages of maize for maize transpiration the results in table 7 indicated that in the two growing seasons of experiment maize transpiration under different plant density treatments were almost the same in maize initial stage however after maize initial stage the higher plant density resulted in more maize transpiration whether it was under mulching or non mulching treatment compared with d1 treatment d3 augmented maize transpiration by 22 3 66 8 and 34 9 mm in development mid season and late season stage in 2016 respectively those values in 2017 were 15 1 14 1 and 12 mm which were lower than those in 2016 overall an obviously increasing trend of total maize transpiration in whole maize growth season was observed with the increasing of plant density compared with d1 treatment d3 treatment increased maize total transpiration by 93 8 and 21 3 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 also shows that maize total transpiration under plastic film mulching treatment was ranging from 305 9 mm to 421 9 mm and from 293 4 to 320 5 mm almost 20 32 and 3 5 to 15 4 higher than that of non mulching treatment ranging from 214 3 mm to 346 3 mm and from 254 3 to 309 7 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively in addition ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration was 74 78 and 42 to 59 for mulching and non mulching treatment respectively in 2016 and was 64 to 65 and 52 to 60 for mulching and non mulching treatment respectively in 2017 verifying that plastic film mulching increased maize ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration and then obtained higher maize yield 3 4 effects of plant density and plastic film mulch on ke and evaporation fig 5b and e illustrates that during whole maize growth period ke under mulching treatment was keeping low level with maximum ke of 0 37 and 0 32 with average ke of 0 16 and 0 26 in 2016 and 2017 respectively whereas for non mulching treatment maximum and average ke was 0 97 and 0 35 and 0 94 and 0 36 in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with d1 treatment d3 increased ke by 6 9 and 2 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively under plastic film mulching however under non mulching treatment ke was decreasing with increasing plant density fig 7b and e under plastic film mulching soil evaporation increased slightly with the increase of plant density in initial development mid season and late season stage maize evaporation of d3 was 0 8 1 7 3 6 and 0 9 mm higher than that of d1 respectively in 2016 in 2017 d3 increased maize evaporation by 1 0 and 3 2 mm in initial and late growth stages respectively and in development and mid season stages soil evaporation among different plant densities were almost the same in contrast under non mulching treatment soil evaporation of d3 was 8 2 33 1 and 14 5 mm lower than that of d1 in development mid season and late season stage respectively in 2016 in 2017 those values were 3 6 19 3 and 3 5 mm overall concerning the effect of increasing plant density on total soil evaporation under mulching treatment d3 slightly increased soil evaporation by 7 0 and 3 2 mm compared with d1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively whereas under non mulching treatment d3 significantly decreased evaporation by 54 7 and 26 3 mm compared with d1 in 2016 and 2017 in addition total soil evaporation of mulching treatment was 109 6 mm 116 6 mm and 168 1 mm 171 3 mm almost 51 8 63 and 21 5 39 5 lower than that of non mulching treatment which was 241 9 mm 296 6 mm and 208 2 mm 234 5 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize evapotranspiration research on effects of plastic film mulching on maize evapotranspiration received much attention from researchers most studies found that plastic film mulching can significantly reduce maize water consumption ren et al 2017 who studied the influence of plastic film mulching and plant density on maize water consumption in the semi humid region of north china and found that compared with non mulching treatment plastic film mulching increased maize evapotranspiration by 21 4 mm similarly li et al 2013 explored the impacts of plastic film mulching and straw mulching on maize water consumption and found that plastic film mulching considerably decreased soil evaporation and then reduced maize total evapotranspiration the results in this study also indicated that plastic film mulching significantly reduced maize evapotranspiration by 60 5 and 29 7 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with non mulching treatment which was in good agreement with previous researches gan et al 2013 yin et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 however the result that plastic film mulching can markedly reduce maize water consumption was not consistent bu et al 2013 who assessed the effects of mulching on maize water use efficiency in the semi arid rain fed region of loess plateau in china found that plastic film mulching did not significantly influence maize evapotranspiration the reason for this result was that although plastic film mulching markedly decreased soil evaporation it also significantly increased the maize transpiration in this study the maize transpiration of plastic film mulching treatment was higher than that of non mulching treatment in mid season and late season stages a few studies have provided evidence that the reason for decreasing eta under plastic mulching is that plastic film mulching significantly reduces the eta in initial stage ren et al 2017 demonstrated that plastic film mulching decreased eta before maize jolting stage similarly in our study the response of eta to plastic film mulching differed in four different growing stages in initial and development stage film mulching decreased eta by 57 1 and 31 1 mm in 2016 and 31 2 and 13 3 mm in 2017 respectively whereas it increased eta by 12 7 and 15 1 mm in mid season and late season stage in 2016 and 0 4 and 14 5 mm in 2017 respectively compared with non mulching this was mainly because in mid season and late season stage the maize plants fully covered the surface of soil reducing impacts of plastic film mulching on decreasing soil evaporation in addition maize under mulching treatment had more transpiration than that of no mulching in literature effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration varied widely by environment and region ren et al 2016 for example ren et al 2016 reported that the eta was considerably increased by the increase of plant density in normal and extreme wet years jiang et al 2016 also reported that the eta was markedly influenced by the plant density but barbieri et al 2012 found that the eta was not affected by plant density in this study the eta was significantly increased with the increase of the plant density from 60 000 to 90 000 plants ha 1 in general compared with d1 and d2 d3 increased maize evapotranspiration by 100 2 and 37 6 mm and 30 0 and 11 9 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively it is mainly because the reduction of soil evaporation is lower than the increase of the maize transpiration we agree with ren et al 2016 who concluded that the difference between the reduction of the soil evaporation and increase of the transpiration determines whether higher plant density can reduce maize eta 4 2 evaporation and transpiration generally mulching plastic film and fitting plant density according to the soil properties could not only increase maize transpiration but also decrease maize evaporation in this work compared with non mulching treatment plastic film mulching increased maize transpiration and reduced soil evaporation which were similar with the reference value listed in fao 56 document page 196 allan et al 1998 the reasonable explanation for this result was that plastic film mulching increased maize plant height and lai and then increased basic crop coefficient and decreased soil evaporation coefficient figs 3 and 4 in addition the transpiration ratio to evapotranspiration of mulching and non mulching treatment indicated that plastic film mulching can obviously augment maize transpiration ratio to evapotranspiration and then improve maize growth and water use efficiency this result was consistent with that obtained by wen et al 2017 who explored the impacts of plastic film mulching on wheat water use and found that plastic film mulching significantly improved wheat transpiration ratio and water use efficiency ren et al 2016 assessed the impact of plant density on maize transpiration and soil evaporation for different hydrological years who found that increasing plant density ranging from 52 500 to 97 500 plants ha 1 results in higher transpiration and lower soil evaporation for this study the experimental results indicated that under mulching treatment soil evaporation increased with increasing plant density whereas under non mulching treatment soil evaporation decreased with the increase of plant density the response of soil evaporation coefficient to plant density was the same as the response of evaporation to plant density this was mainly because under non mulching condition higher plant density contributed to more shade for soil surface resulting in lower soil evaporation coefficient and under plastic film mulching treatment more plants per area resulted in more vent holes on plastic film causing higher soil evaporation coefficient for maize transpiration higher plant density resulted in more maize transpiration under both film mulching and non mulching treatment in addition in 2016 as a moderate wet year the maize under plastic film mulching was free from soil water stress whereas under non mulching and d3 treatment maize growth was constrained by soil water this indicated that plastic film mulching can increase soil moisture and then alleviate the stress of soil water on maize growth under high plant density in wet year however in 2017 as an extreme dry year the maize under mulching treatment suffered more soil water stress than the non mulching treatment in mid season stage the reasons for this result might have been that during the extreme dry and warm year the water consumption increased in mid season while the plastic film partly prevented rainfall from infiltrating into subsoil layer 5 conclusion this work has adopted the dual crop coefficient method and field water balance model to assess the impact of plant density and plastic film mulch on maize transpiration soil evaporation maize crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient the results showed that plastic film mulching increased maize transpiration by 20 0 32 0 and 3 5 15 4 and reduced soil evaporation by 51 8 63 0 and 21 5 39 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively ultimately reducing maize total evapotranspiration by 12 4 and 6 2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared to non mulching treatment higher maize crop coefficient and lower soil evaporation coefficient were obtained under plastic film mulching moreover in initial and development stage maize water consumption of mulching treatment was lower than that of non mulching treatment whereas in mid season and late season stage mulching treatment resulted in more maize water consumption than non mulching treatment additionally maize evapotranspiration increased with the increase of plant density under plastic film mulching soil evaporation and soil evaporation coefficient increased with the increase of plant density whereas under non mulching it reversed generally speaking according to our work we suggest the plant density of maize fitting high plant density breed ranging from 75 000 to 90 000 plants ha 1 with plastic film mulching for best water use practices in our research area or similar region acknowledgements this research was financially supported by natural science foundation of liaoning province

10864,winter wheat is one of the major crops in the texas high plains thp region which is facing challenges from climate change cc and exhausting irrigation water supplies from the ogallala aquifer the goal of this study was to assess the impacts of cc on winter wheat production in the thp and evaluate potential adaptation strategies using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat ceres wheat model a thorough calibration of the model against field data resulted in a satisfactory simulation of phenology leaf area index grain yield percent error pe 4 7 biomass pe 7 1 and evapotranspiration pe 11 9 the evaluated model was then used for i predicting winter wheat yield and irrigation water use and ii evaluating six potential winter wheat cultivars under cc at three sites in the thp mixed trends were found for irrigated yield in the future across the study sites due to differences in climate and soils irrigation water use of winter wheat is expected to decrease in the future due to improved water use efficiency at elevated atmospheric co2 concentration and reduced growing season length due to temperature rise dryland yield is expected to increase due to improved crop water use efficiency among the virtual cultivars tested for cc adaptation increasing potential number of grains and vigorous root system were found to be the most desirable traits since these cultivars had higher yield and lower or comparable irrigation water use than the reference cultivar long maturity and stay green cultivars were found to be not advisable due to significantly higher irrigation water use than the reference cultivar overall the results showed that winter wheat production in the thp could benefit from cc under milder climatic conditions mean growing season temperature 13 c enhancing yield potential traits and root architecture should be considered for screening cultivars for cc adaptation keywords ceres wheat genetic traits stay green yield potential 1 introduction climate change cc could potentially affect crop productivity and food supply wheeler and von braun 2013 and hence there is a need to evaluate strategies for adapting agriculture to future cc howden et al 2007 wheat triticum aestivum l is a widely grown cereal crop covering 22 of the total agricultural land in the world leff et al 2004 developing adaptation strategies on global and regional scales to enhance cc resilience of wheat production could ameliorate food insecurity the response of crops to cc is primarily governed by the atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration co2 air temperature and precipitation hatfield et al 2011 wheat response to changes in these climatic variables has been documented in several controlled environment experiments and simulation studies kimball et al 1999 wall et al 2000 asseng et al 2014 free air co2 enrichment face systems allow exposure of growing plants to elevated co2 levels under open air conditions ainsworth and long 2004 wheat growth and development in face systems has been monitored in various parts of the world including australia o leary et al 2014 germany högy et al 2009 and the united states us kimball et al 1999 wall et al 2000 these face studies have shown that under elevated co2 wheat grain yield leaf area index lai biomass water use efficiency and accumulation of carbon increased whereas stomatal conductance seasonal crop water use and daily evapotranspiration decreased in majority of the face studies the effects of changes in temperature were not considered however only a few researchers dias de oliveira et al 2015 tan et al 2018 have studied the effects of changes in co2 and temperature simultaneously using field experiments using natural light controlled temperature co2 and irrigation n ctci field facilities in australia dias de oliveira et al 2015 showed that grain filling rate increased and time to physiological maturity reduced at higher temperature ambient temperature 3 c the enhanced understanding of crop climate relation as a result of physical experiments can be extrapolated to a wider range of climatic conditions using crop simulation models asseng et al 2015 studying wheat production under a wide range of co2 temperature and rainfall patterns as projected under cc scenarios ipcc 2014 will be instrumental in selecting strategies to adapt wheat production to cc results from different simulation studies have shown mixed trends in wheat grain yield under cc results from recent studies ahmed et al 2017 dixit et al 2018 tang et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 kapur et al 2019 indicated that grain yield is expected to increase due to increase in co2 however negative effects of cc on wheat yield have also been simulated in some studies due to the combined effect of changes in co2 temperature and rainfall simulated dryland grain yield decreased in the us plains tubiello et al 2002 and in south australia luo et al 2005 due to projected reduction in precipitation in the future irrigated grain yield decreased at some sites in a global study due to temperature stress balkovič et al 2014 similarly wheat yield responses to cc varied at different locations in australia with increasing trends in colder regions and decreasing trends in warmer regions wang et al 2017 in a multi model global study considering the effects of temperature alone researchers asseng et al 2014 estimated a 6 reduction in wheat yield for each degree rise in temperature in summary these simulation studies demonstrated that projected increase in co2 and temperature in the future would likely have positive and negative effects on wheat production respectively overall cc may benefit colder regions while temperature stress would offset beneficial effects from elevated co2 in warmer regions as wheat response to cc depends on local climatic conditions cc impact and potential adaptation analysis in major wheat producing regions that have not been studied in the past could contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance climate resilience of wheat production the us high plains region which is termed as the grain basket of the us scanlon et al 2012 accounted for about 47 of us wheat production between 1965 to 2010 grassini et al 2013 the texas high plains thp region is a key part of the us high plains with 1 1 million ha of winter wheat grown annually 2007 2017 out of which 34 area was irrigated usda nass 2018 irrigation water in the thp region comes from the southern portion of the exhaustible ogallala aquifer colaizzi et al 2009 therefore crop production in the thp region not only faces challenges from cc but also from diminishing irrigation water supplies it is therefore imperative to consider irrigation water constraints while studying the implications of cc and analyzing potential adaptation for wheat production in the thp potential strategies considered by researchers to adapt wheat production to cc have included alternate management practices nouri et al 2017 and identifying critical genetic traits better suited under cc semenov and stratonovitch 2015 wang et al 2019 using the sirius model researchers semenov et al 2014 semenov and stratonovitch 2015 stratonovitch and semenov 2015 senapati et al 2018 identified longer grain filling period maintaining green leaf area stay green and heat tolerance around flowering as desirable traits for adapting wheat to cc in europe using the apsim model wang et al 2019 identified longer grain filling period shorter vegetative period greater radiation use efficiency and bigger grain size compared to historic cultivar as desirable traits for adapting wheat to cc in australia a similar model aided evaluation of genetic traits for the thp region could assist producers in this region in better preparing for the anticipated future climatic conditions although the ceres wheat model has been widely used in the cc impact analysis tubiello et al 2002 eitzinger et al 2003 yang et al 2017 it was rarely used for testing genetic traits of wheat for cc adaptation in this study genetic traits were not only evaluated based on wheat grain yield but also on seasonal irrigation which is important for the thp region the overarching goal of this study was to assess the impacts of cc on wheat production in the thp region and evaluate potential cc adaptive genetic traits the specific goals of this study were to a evaluate the ceres wheat model for the thp region b assess the impacts of cc on winter wheat production i e irrigated and dryland yield and seasonal irrigation and c identify optimum

al 2010 the co2 response functions in ceres wheat were based on field experiments which are summarized in kimball et al 1999 the capability of ceres wheat to simulate changes in climatic variables and its widespread use makes it an ideal choice for this study the minimum input data required for simulating crop growth and development using dssat includes daily weather data soil properties and crop management e g planting date seeding rate fertilizer jones et al 2003 2 3 model calibration and evaluation 2 3 1 field experiments crop management inputs used for setting the ceres wheat model came from three separate field experiments conducted at bushland texas over four growing seasons for model calibration field experimental data collected from winter wheat field studies conducted at bushland during 1992 1993 xue et al 2003 2006 was used winter wheat was planted on october 1 at 70 kg ha 1 seeding density and 0 25 m row spacing in these experiments irrigation water was applied at eight levels based on different growth stages i e jointing booting anthesis and grain filling in addition a rainfed treatment was also studied all the nine treatments received a starter irrigation of about 25 mm before planting a 140 kg n ha 1 fertilizer was applied to all the plots one week prior to planting the observed data used for calibration included dates of onset of growth stages lai grain yield biomass yield and seasonal evapotranspiration etc seasonal etc was calculated by adding rainfall irrigation and the difference between soil moisture at planting and harvest detailed information about these experiments can be found in previous studies xue et al 2003 2006 for model evaluation data from the field experiments conducted at bushland during 1980 1981 eck 1988 and 1997 1999 schneider and howell 2001 were used in the first set of experiments eck 1988 winter wheat was planted on october 15 1980 at 50 kg ha 1 seeding rate irrigation was applied at four levels fall irrigation only and fall irrigation plus one two three spring irrigations fertilizer treatments were 0 kg n ha 1 70 kg n ha 1 140 kg n ha 1 and 210 kg n ha 1 in the second set of experiments schneider and howell 2001 winter wheat was planted on october 2 1997 and september 29 1998 at a seeding rate of 67 kg ha 1 with 0 1 m row width irrigation was applied at five levels to meet 100 75 50 25 and 0 etc fertilizer was applied before planting at 123 kg n ha 1 and 140 kg n ha 1 in 1997 and 1998 respectively the observed data used for model evaluation from these experiments included grain yield biomass yield and seasonal etc 2 3 2 calibration methodology ceres wheat model was calibrated systematically based on the approach described in thorp et al 2010 parameters were adjusted manually by targeting in sequence the observed phenology in season lai and end of season biomass and yield the adjustments were made by keeping the parameter values within the range of values used for existing cultivars in the dssat database first the parameters related to crop development or phenology were adjusted to get a good match between observed and simulated dates of onset of growth stages parameters representing the duration between different growth stages p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 were adjusted sequentially to improve the simulation of phenological stages in this process the observed xue et al 2003 and simulated dates of onset of growth stages expressed as zadoks number zadoks et al 1974 and day of year doy were compared after simulating phenology adequately parameters related to crop growth were adjusted to improve the simulation of in season lai finally the parameters were adjusted to get a good match between measured and simulated end of season biomass and grain yield after fine tuning genotype parameters during calibration using the measured data from xue et al 2006 experiments model was evaluated against the remaining experimental data eck 1988 schneider and howell 2001 without further adjusting the genotype parameters lastly model performance in simulating seasonal etc was evaluated using data from all three field experiments the indicators used to test the model performance included graphical comparison and commonly used performance statistics adhikari et al 2016 index of agreement d willmott 1981 percent error pe and percent root mean squared error rmse model calibration was continued until a good calibration rmse 20 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 was achieved 2 4 crop management data used for future scenarios winter wheat was planted on october 1st at a seeding rate of 200 seeds m 2 which is the widely recommended seeding rate for central u s great plains paulsen 1987 initial conditions set up in the top 210 cm soil profile were soil water at field capacity attia et al 2016 and soil nitrogen at 50 kg n ha 1 which is within the range of values reported at bushland tx eck 1988 for irrigated and dryland winter wheat production 140 kg n ha 1 nitrate nitrogen fertilizer was applied one week prior to planting in accordance with the irrigated experiments at bushland tx schneider and howell 2001 xue et al 2006 irrigation was simulated using auto irrigation feature of dssat irrigation was applied to replenish soil water in the top 30 cm soil profile default auto irrigation depth to field capacity whenever plant available water content dropped to 50 these settings for auto irrigation were used in several previous studies thaler et al 2012 wu et al 2014 kothari et al 2019 irrigation water use estimated for different scenarios by the dssat model based on the above auto irrigation criteria were obtained from the model output and used for interpreting simulation results 2 5 climate change cc scenarios simulated cc scenarios were based on two trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the numeral in the pathway represents the projected radiative forcing w m 2 which is defined as the difference between total incoming and outgoing atmospheric solar radiation procopio et al 2004 rcp 8 5 is a high emission scenario with greater increase in projected co2 in the future compared to rcp 4 5 in this study co2 was varied annually fig 1 based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projections ipcc 2014 using environment modification functionality in dssat other climate variables solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity were varied daily according to the projected climate data climate forcing from nine global climate models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 taylor et al 2012 were drawn from the macav2 metdata dataset abatzoglou and brown 2012 and used in this study table s1 the maca dataset contains daily climate projections at 4 6 km spatial resolution which were statistically downscaled and bias corrected using the multivariate adapted constructed analogs maca method abatzoglou and brown 2012 with observed training data from abatzoglou 2013 the maca dataset includes daily data for the historic 1950 2005 and future until 2099 period in this study simulations were run for the entire duration 1950 2099 and the results from three 30 year periods representing historic 1976 2005 mid century 2036 2065 and late century 2066 2095 were used for cc impact and adaptation analysis the simulations were run with projected climate data from each gcm and the difference between historic and future yield for each gcm was initially calculated the yield differences for the 9 gcms were then averaged to get ensemble averages and compared for the historic versus future climate periods a combination of two rcps and nine gcms resulted in a total of 18 climate change scenarios 2 6 climate change adaptation virtual cultivars the set of genotype parameters obtained after model calibration is referred to as the reference cultivar a total of six alternate cultivars were tested for cc adaptation these alternate cultivars were created by changing one or more parameter s from the reference cultivar it may be noted that we altered a wide range of parameters to create the virtual cultivars including maximum root water uptake grain filling phase duration soil root growth factor and potential number of kernels parameter values were altered in such a way that the values adjusted in our study were within the range of literature values whenever available 2 6 1 denser roots changes in root architecture could lead to winter wheat yield benefits especially under water deficit conditions manschadi et al 2006 among the reported changes in root architectural characteristics for enhancing drought tolerance increased root density was chosen in this study because previous modeling studies carretero et al 2014 singh et al 2014c robinson et al 2015 have shown that increasing root density at different soil depths could enhance access to stored soil water increase soil water extraction and improve crop productivity in this study a potential cultivar with denser roots than the reference cultivar was created by increasing root density at different soil depths this was done by changing soil root growth factor srgf in the soil file from e 0 02 z to 1 z 500 6 where z is the soil depth in cm this methodology is similar to the approach used for sorghum singh et al 2014c chickpea singh et al 2014a groundnut singh et al 2014b and maize tesfaye et al 2018 in which srgf was increased and drained lower limit was decreased however in this study only srgf was increased and drained lower limit was kept the same for both reference and virtual cultivars 2 6 2 stay green delayed senescence stay green or delayed leaf senescence has been identified as one of the important drought tolerant traits of wheat cossani and reynolds 2012 stratonovitch and semenov 2015 senapati et al 2018 in this study stay green trait was incorporated by modifying the parameters related to leaf senescence in the ecotype file parameter lsphs final leaf senescence starts growth stage was increased from 4 2 to 4 7 and lsphe final leaf senescence ends growth stage was increased from 5 5 to 6 to delay leaf senescence these parameter values were within the range of values tested by li et al 2018 2 6 3 higher root water uptake positive effects of increased root water uptake on wheat yield have been demonstrated in many field studies xue et al 2003 manschadi et al 2006 using the sirius wheat model senapati et al 2018 have shown that increasing root water uptake could increase yield potential under cc in the present study a second drought tolerant cultivar was created by increasing the rwumx maximum water uptake rate cm3 cm root 1 day 1 in the species file from its default value of 0 03 to 0 04 root hydraulic properties have not been studied using the ceres wheat model before and hence the range of rwumx parameter values was not available in the literature it should be noted that the virtual cultivar with denser roots affects root water uptake by modifying physical properties or density of the roots and the virtual cultivar with high root water uptake increase water uptake directly without modifying physical characteristics of the roots testing both types of characteristics for cc adaptation could be useful for future modeling studies or breeding programs 2 6 4 heat tolerant i and ii longer grain filling period heat stress due to rising temperature under cc could affect winter wheat yield by shortening grain filling duration and hastening crop maturity therefore extended grain filling duration has been identified as one of the important heat tolerant traits stratonovitch and semenov 2015 lopes et al 2018 in this study two virtual cultivars with longer grain filling duration than the reference cultivar were created these cultivars are referred to as heat tolerant cultivars heat tolerant i winter wheat cultivar was created by increasing the parameter p5 grain filling phase duration c d from 500 to 550 or by 10 in the cultivar file changing p5 from 500 to 550 resulted in about 2 days longer grain filling period another heat tolerant cultivar ii was created by increasing p5 from 500 to 700 based on literature value for the thp region attia et al 2016 which resulted in 8 days longer grain filling period 2 6 5 high yield potential more number of kernels per head a high yield potential wheat cultivar was created by increasing the potential number of kernels g1 by 10 from 16 to 18 this was in accordance with a controlled environment study dias de oliveira et al 2015 in which researchers emphasized the need for developing wheat varieties with greater number of potential grains they found that number of grains were not affected by climate variables and therefore increasing potential number of grains could increase grain yield under cc 2 6 6 short vegetative phase early flowering early flowering has been shown to ameliorate yield loss due to cc in a face study early sown wheat had higher biomass leaf area and yield because early flowering prevented exposure to hotter temperature late in the season o leary et al 2014 exposure to higher temperature in the late season could also reduce the duration of grain filling period which could reduce grain yield lopes et al 2018 in this study one virtual cultivar was created by reducing the vegetative phase or time to flowering parameters p1 p2 and p3 which affect earliness per se herndl et al 2008 were reduced to reduce the pre anthesis period these values were reduced by 10 from their calibrated values p1 from 350 to 315 p2 from 250 to 225 and p3 from 180 to 162 these changes in parameters reduced the number of days to anthesis by about 7 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the genotype parameters adjusted during the ceres wheat model calibration are presented in table 1 the parameter p1v days required to complete vernalization under optimum vernalizing temperature was adjusted to 21 which is within the range of typically observed values 5 45 days for winter wheat in texas neely et al 2014 adjustment of parameters related to crop development resulted in a close match between observed and simulated dates of onset of growth stages fig 2 a the observed and simulated days to physiological maturity were very close at 263 and 265 days after planting dap respectively simulated onset of anthesis 225 dap was also within the range of observed days to anthesis 222 225 dap adjustment of crop growth related parameters resulted in a good match between the measured and simulated in season lai values fig 2b in the final phase of calibration the measured and simulated end of season grain yield and biomass yield were compared model performance was satisfactory during calibration fig 3 a b as indicated by the performance statistics rmse 18 8 pe 7 1 and d 0 66 while the simulated and measured yields on average were close yield of the highest irrigation level treatments were underestimated this was because of multiple single applications of 100 mm irrigation which resulted in greater nitrogen leaching and lower nitrogen uptake as compared to other irrigation level treatments dryland yield was also overestimated potentially due to underestimation of water stress and not accounting for other stressors such as pests disease and extreme weather by the model during evaluation measured data from treatments with a wider range of irrigation and nitrogen levels was considered in general yield under no fertilization treatments was underestimated while the dryland yield was slightly overestimated by the model a poorer model performance under unfertilized treatment compared to fertilized treatment has also been reported previously popova and kercheva 2005 biomass prediction was better compared to the prediction of grain yield an underestimation of biomass in the highest irrigation treatments translated to underestimation of seasonal etc for those treatments overall there was a reasonable match between the observed and simulated grain yield and biomass during the model evaluation fig 3c d as indicated by the model performance statistics rmse 26 2 pe 4 8 and d 0 77 based on rmse model performance in prediction of grain yield and biomass was considered good during calibration 18 8 and fair during evaluation 26 2 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 during the evaluation of model performance for seasonal etc prediction the measured and simulated etc under rainfed and low irrigation treatment were in good agreement as indicated by rmse of 26 9 and pe of 11 9 fig 4 calibration of ceres wheat for a wide range of irrigation and nitrogen treatments manually proved to be challenging and hence it is recommended to use an auto calibration method in the future studies summarizing the ceres wheat model was evaluated against data from three separate field experiments the field dataset included four winter wheat growing seasons 1980 81 1992 93 1997 98 and 1998 99 five fertilizer levels between 0 kg n ha 1 to 210 kg n ha 1 and 18 different irrigation levels from three different irrigation scheduling methods based on growth stage combination of fall and spring irrigation and wheat etc based methods an adequate model performance under a wide range of water fertilizer and environment conditions suggests that model could be used for testing environment and management scenarios with reasonable confidence 3 2 climate change impacts on winter wheat production 3 2 1 climate change impacts on irrigated winter wheat yield simulated changes in irrigated grain yield under cc expressed as ensemble averages based on nine gcm projections are presented in table 2 the irrigated grain yield increased at bushland and halfway in the future as compared to the historic period whereas it decreased at lamesa this change was statistically significant for both rcps and future periods for all three sites except for rcp 8 5 in the late century at bushland the percent change in irrigated grain yield in the future compared to the historic period considering individual gcm projections varied between 20 rcp 8 5 2080s at lamesa under cnrm cm5 1 and 10 rcp 8 5 2080s at halfway under bcc csm1 1 fig 5 while temperature increase was the main driver of irrigated yield decline in the future increased biomass accumulation due to co2 fertilization was the primary reason for yield increase in the future unlike at bushland and halfway the positive effects of co2 fertilization were suppressed by temperature rise at lamesa and therefore grain yield decreased the coefficient of variation cv was about the same in the historic and future time periods at all three sites the magnitude of irrigated grain yield was the lowest at lamesa when compared to bushland and halfway table 2 possible reasons for the lowest irrigated grain yield at lamesa could be the differences in growing season length soil types and temperature regimes the historic average growing season length at bushland halfway and lamesa was 250 244 and 231 days respectively a shorter growing season at lamesa implied lesser time for biomass accumulation and grain filling hence the lower grain yields as compared to other sites another reason for lower grain yield at lamesa could be the coarser soil at lamesa which allowed greater nitrogen leaching than other two locations data not shown this is consistent with a simulation study conducted on three soil types and six locations in australia milroy et al 2008 in which the risk of drainage and leaching was higher in coarser soils with low water and nutrient holding capacity than it was at finer soils in addition the lower nitrogen uptake at lamesa as a result of higher leaching than other two sites could be another reason for the contrasting trend in irrigated yield under cc i e reduction in yield at lamesa and increase in yield at bushland and halfway the lower nitrogen uptake at lamesa due to higher leaching has further added to the negative effects of temperature stress this is consistent with a glasshouse chamber study in the united kingdom mitchell et al 1993 in which elevated co2 did not increase grain yield at low nitrogen supply level this trend is also similar to the trend observed in a face and simulation study at maricopa in arizona where yield gains associated with elevated co2 were smaller at low nitrogen supply than at higher nitrogen supply jamieson et al 2000 the differences in temperature regimes at the three sites was another reason for the differences in projected yield under cc the historic period growing season mean temperature for bushland halfway and lamesa was 9 c 10 c and 12 c respectively a comparison between irrigated grain yield and growing season planting harvest mean temperature for individual simulations 149 years 9 rcps 3 locations is presented in fig 6 which shows that grain yield tended to decline when the growing season mean temperature increased beyond 11 13 c future growing season temperature projected by most gcms at lamesa fell outside the threshold of 11 13 c which explains the decline in grain yield at lamesa under cc whereas the other two locations were benefitted from increased vegetative biomass due to co2 fertilization it may be noted that the ceres model uses nine temperature functions to account for temperature stress at nine different growth stages alderman et al 2014 but analyzing temperature stress at different growth stages was beyond the scope of the present study 3 2 2 climate change impacts on dryland winter wheat yield the dryland grain yield expressed as ensemble average based on nine gcm projections increased at all three sites in the future compared to the historic period table 2 this change was statistically significant for most rcps and future periods for all three sites except for both future periods under rcp 4 5 at bushland and for late century under both rcps at lamesa the percent change in dryland grain yield in the future compared to the historic period considering individual gcm projections varied between 34 rcp 8 5 2080s at lamesa under ipsl cm5a lr and 71 rcp 8 5 2080s at halfway under gfdl esm2m fig 5 the greatest reduction in yield of 34 at lamesa was the result of 26 lower oct may rainfall 4 6 c warmer growing season planting harvest 35 lower biomass at the end of vegetative phase and 20 days shorter crop cycle compared to the historic period on the other hand the maximum increase in yield 71 at halfway was simulated under 2 higher oct may rainfall 2 2 c warmer growing season planting harvest 98 higher biomass at the end of vegetative phase and 17 days shorter crop cycle than the historic period changes in dryland yield were highly correlated with changes in biomass at the end of vegetative phase fig 7 a the reasons behind increased dryland yield and vegetative biomass under cc were improved water use efficiency of the plant and increased rainfall in case of some gcms especially in december and february fig 7b winter wheat was planted in october and the months of december and february corresponded with the growth stages between end of dormancy and terminal spikelet the correlation between water stress during early growth stages until booting and dryland yield was greater than the correlation between water stress during reproductive stages and dryland yield there was a negative correlation between water stress at different growth stages and dryland yield except for the grain filling phase these results are consistent with the findings from field experiments conducted at bushland tx xue et al 2006 in which water stress during grain filling led to an increase in grain yield they also reported that deficit irrigation during early growth stages jointing and booting increased grain yield by a greater amount than applying irrigation at later stages anthesis and grain filling such a large window of expected change in dryland yield under cc was also reported in previous studies using the dssat model tubiello et al 2002 simulated yield increase between 6 20 under one gcm and yield decrease between 50 to 10 under another gcm in the 2030s using the epic crop model and hadcm2 gcm izaurralde et al 2003 simulated a 7 80 increase in dryland yield in the late century compared to historic period 1961 1990 stöckle et al 2018 simulated up to 85 increase in dryland yield in the late century compared to the historic period 1980 2010 using the cropsyst model and maca climate projections xiao et al 2018 simulated a change in dryland yield between 45 to 50 under rcp 8 5 in 2080s with the apsim model the range of changes in dryland yield projected under different gcms was much larger than the future projections of change in irrigated yield larger uncertainty in dryland yield projections is expected due to the uncertainty in water availability which is compensated for in case of irrigated production consequently the cv for dryland yield was much greater compared to the cv for irrigated yield tubiello et al 2002 also reported a higher cv for dryland winter wheat yield 30 50 compared to irrigated yield 10 15 for different locations in the us another interesting finding is that the magnitude of percent yield increase under dryland conditions was greater than the percent increase under irrigated conditions this was especially prominent in case of lamesa where irrigated yield was projected to decrease whereas dryland yield was projected to increase under cc this is likely due to the differential effect of co2 fertilization under well watered and limited water conditions using the apsim n wheat model ludwig and asseng 2006 showed that increase in grain yield due to co2 fertilization was more under water limited conditions than under well watered conditions similar results were reported by ahmed et al 2017 in a multi model simulation study for the us pacific northwest their results are also consistent with the findings of a face study in maricopa az pinter et al 2000 and a closed top field chamber study in manhattan ks chaudhuri et al 1990 in which yield gain under elevated co2 was higher under water stress however opposite trends have also been shown in other studies as summarized in a review by amthor 2001 in general dryland grain yield increased at all locations under most gcms the magnitude of increase was the highest at halfway and lowest at lamesa table 2 one reason behind greater increase in dryland yield at halfway could be the change in grain yield transpiration productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 under cc fig 7c the grain yield transpiration productivity at halfway increased under most cases and by a larger margin than other two sites the primary reason for increased yield water productivity in the future was co2 fertilization which increased plant growth and reduced transpiration per unit area especially under soils with low water holding capacity thaler et al 2012 the differences in growing season length and temperature regimes among the three sites as explained in section 3 3 also contributed to the differences in cc impacts on dryland yield differences in rainfall projections among the sites and resultant water stress at different growth stages also likely contributed to differences in dryland yield projections among the three sites in summary changes in dryland grain yield under cc were due to the interactive effects of growing season length rainfall projections temperature and soil type 3 2 3 climate change impacts on irrigation water use the irrigation water use expressed as ensemble average based on nine gcm projections decreased at all three sites in the future compared to the historic period for both rcps and future periods except at bushland under rcp 4 5 in the mid century table 2 this change was statistically significant for lamesa under both rcps and future periods and under rcp 8 5 in the late century for all three sites the percent change in irrigation water use in the future compared to the historic period considering individual gcm projections varied between 16 rcp 8 5 2080s at bushland under gfdl esm2m and 10 rcp 4 5 2050s at bushland under ipsl cm5a lr fig 5 the reduction in seasonal irrigation was more under rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 similar to the findings of xiao et al 2018 possible reasons for reduced irrigation water use were improved water use efficiency under elevated co2 reduced growing season or period for which irrigation was required and increased rainfall in some cases seasonal etc also decreased under cc data not shown reduction in etc despite an increase in irrigated yield under cc on doubling co2 has been also reported in a ceres wheat study in austria eitzinger et al 2003 out of 36 scenarios 9 gcms 2 rcps 2 future periods for each location increase in seasonal irrigation was projected under 12 13 and 4 scenarios at bushland halfway and lamesa respectively fig 5g i in other words a reduction in seasonal irrigation under cc was simulated under a greater number of scenarios at lamesa than at other two sites this is because beneficial effects of co2 fertilization on grain yield and vegetative biomass were suppressed at lamesa due to higher temperatures and coarser soils than at other two sites these results suggest that the irrigated wheat grain yield in the thp can be maintained at historic level even with slightly lower irrigation amounts than the historic levels due to the beneficial effects of co2 fertilization and high water holding capacity of soils provided seasonal mean temperatures remain under optimum levels 13 c 3 3 climate change adaptation site specific 3 3 1 climate change adaptation bushland simulated changes in grain yield and irrigation water use between the virtual and reference cultivars are presented in table 3 for these estimates yield and irrigation water use under a specific cultivar were averaged over nine global climate models for irrigated wheat production all modifications in genetic traits tested in this study resulted in yield gain under cc except early flowering trait under rcp 4 5 in 2050s table 3 yield gain refers to the percent increase in grain yield under a virtual cultivar compared to the reference cultivar the yield gain was highest with stay green trait up to 6 1 followed by high yield potential trait up to 4 2 both of these yield gains were significant yield gain with other genetic traits under different cc scenarios was marginal 2 6 irrigation water use for virtual cultivar with stay green trait was significantly higher up to 10 than the reference cultivar increasing duration of grain filling period by 8 days resulted in an increase in irrigation water use by 3 4 and yield gain of about 1 irrigation water use did not change with high yield potential trait i e increasing potential kernel numbers per unit canopy weight on the other hand irrigation water use was significantly lower with short vegetative period up to 5 1 and with denser roots up to 4 3 compared to the reference cultivar irrigation water use for other virtual cultivars was about the same as the reference cultivar considering irrigated yield and irrigation water use together high yield potential increased potential kernel number per unit canopy weight trait seems to be the best strategy for bushland making roots denser could be the second desirable trait as it reduced irrigation water use while the irrigated yield was about the same as the reference cultivar for dryland production yield gain was simulated under all virtual cultivars except the early flowering cultivar thus early flowering appears to be an unsuitable trait for cc adaptation under dryland conditions in near future for dryland production increasing yield potential trait and using denser roots were found to be equally desirable traits for bushland 3 3 2 climate change adaptation halfway yield gain in irrigated wheat production was significant at halfway and the highest gain was found with high yield potential trait up to 8 4 followed by stay green trait up to 3 7 table 4 yield gain with other genetic traits was negligible and a yield loss was simulated with early flowering trait except under rcp 8 5 in 2080s differences in seasonal irrigation under a virtual cultivar compared to the reference cultivar at halfway were similar to those at bushland similar to bushland high yield potential was found to be the most desirable trait followed by denser roots for the halfway site for dryland wheat production the highest yield gain was simulated with high yield potential up to 10 7 followed by denser roots up to 8 4 other genetic traits had minor effect on dryland yield early flowering cultivar had lower yield than the reference cultivar therefore the most desirable traits for dryland wheat production at halfway were found to be high yield potential trait followed by denser root system trait 3 3 3 cc adaptation lamesa the response of irrigated wheat production to different genetic traits was different at lamesa than at other two sites the highest and significant yield gain was simulated with stay green up to 7 8 early flowering up to 5 0 and denser root up to 3 1 traits table 5 high yield potential trait which resulted in the highest yield gain at other two sites resulted in a significant yield gain 2 4 at lamesa only under rcp 8 5 in 2080s yield gain with other genetic traits was marginal 1 6 minor yield reduction was simulated with high root water uptake trait although genetic traits had a different effect on irrigated yield at different sites their effect on seasonal irrigation water use was similar at the three sites irrigation water use at lamesa was increased significantly with stay green up to 12 7 and longer grain filling duration up to 3 6 traits in contrast irrigation water use was reduced significantly with early flowering up to 5 6 and denser root system up to 3 traits the irrigation water use for the remaining virtual cultivars was comparable to that with the reference cultivar the most desirable trait for irrigated wheat production at lamesa was found to be early flowering followed by dense roots both of these traits resulted in significant yield gain and significant reduction in irrigation water use compared to the baseline period dryland grain yield gains were maximum with high yield potential trait up to 9 3 followed by the dense roots trait up to 6 8 stay green trait also resulted in a marginal yield gain up to 2 5 minor yield loss was simulated with early flowering trait under rcp 4 5 and with high root water uptake trait similar to bushland and halfway dryland wheat production at lamesa could benefit from incorporating high yield potential and dense root system traits 3 4 discussion climate change adaptive genetic traits it is not surprising that increasing soil root growth factor srgf increased grain yield and reduced seasonal irrigation water use increasing srgf has likely led to greater soil water extraction at different depths compared to the reference cultivar similar beneficial effects of increasing srgf have been reported on yield of other crops such as sorghum in india and africa singh et al 2014c and soybean in brazil battisti and sentelhas 2017 yield gain due to dense root system was higher at lamesa coarser soil than other two sites clay loam soil tables 3 5 the yield gain with dense roots was more for dryland production than for irrigated production this could be explained by a better utilization of stored soil water which is more important for dryland production stay green trait increased water use and irrigated yield at all three sites in all cc scenarios tables 3 5 a possible explanation could be that stay green trait and co2 fertilization effects due to elevated co2 in the future had a beneficial effect on leaf area and vegetative biomass the increased vegetative biomass and green leaf area likely increased crop consumptive use water was not limited for irrigated production in this study due to the use of auto irrigation tool which led to increased seasonal irrigation as well as increased grain yield however dryland wheat yield did not increase substantially with stay green trait due to the limitation of water supply therefore stay green trait may not be a suitable cc adaptation strategy for the thp region for both dryland and irrigation wheat production in general possible benefits of co2 fertilization should be accounted for while considering stay green trait for cc adaption another interesting finding is that yield gain with stay green trait was more prominent at lamesa than at other two sites this is likely because maintaining green area compensated for reduced carbon accumulation rate due to temperature stress which was more sever at lamesa than the other two sites increasing maximum water uptake rate by 0 01 cm3 cm root 1 day 1 did not show substantial effect on either yield or seasonal irrigation interestingly increasing root water uptake had slight positive yield gain at bushland and halfway and some yield loss at lamesa the minor yield loss at lamesa could be attributed to the soil properties low water holding capacity and high water uptake rate might have led to faster depletion of soil water at lamesa using root chamber experiments in australia manschadi et al 2006 showed that modifying root traits may penalize wheat yield due to early exhaustion of stored soil water and lack of water during grain filling season although increasing grain fill duration by about 8 days increased irrigated and dryland grain yield the increase in yield 3 was not significant on the other hand seasonal irrigation increased by a greater percent than irrigated yield with longer grain filling duration compared to the reference cultivar the marginal increase in grain yield and associated greater increase in seasonal irrigation demand makes longer grain fill duration a less desirable cc adaptive trait for the thp region however other researchers have proposed longer grain filling duration as a potential strategy to combat cc at other locations using sirius model in europe semenov and stratonovitch 2015 and apsim model in australia wang et al 2019 researchers showed that grain fill duration parameter reached its maximum value in order to maximize grain yield high yield potential increasing potential kernel number per unit canopy weight increased grain yield in all cases while irrigation water use was the same as the reference cultivar therefore high yield potential appears to be the most suitable cc adaptive trait for the thp and other locations early flowering trait showed great potential for irrigated production at lamesa with significant yield gain and reduced irrigation water use for other sites and water treatments there was a mixed trend it should be noted that early flowering meant shorter length of vegetative phase since the planting date was the same for all scenarios shorter vegetative phase could potentially reduce grain yield by limiting the time for biomass accumulation he et al 2015 however early anthesis could mean advancing crop cycle and shifting reproductive phase into cooler parts of the season ludwig and asseng 2010 the mixed effect of early flowering on grain yield makes it a risky trait for the thp region however a positive aspect of early flowering and shorter vegetative phase is the significant reduction in irrigation water use perhaps in the hotter southern regions of the thp early flowering could help in wheat production by avoiding heat stress later in the season 4 conclusions the ceres wheat model was evaluated using in season phenology and lai and end of season grain yield biomass and evapotranspiration data from field experiments at bushland tx after obtaining a satisfactory model performance the calibrated model parameters were used to simulate cc scenarios and adaptation strategies the cc scenarios were based on daily weather projections from nine gcms and two rcps for three sites in the thp bushland halfway and lamesa simulated irrigated grain yield increased up to 10 at bushland and halfway due to beneficial effects of co2 fertilization on biomass and yield however irrigated grain yield decreased up to 20 at lamesa where temperature rise suppressed the positive effects of elevated co2 unlike the projections of irrigated grain yield projections for seasonal irrigation were in the same direction at all three sites i e reduced in the future compared to the historic period this was attributed to improved water use efficiency reduced length of growing season and projected increase in rainfall under some scenarios this suggests that the historic irrigation levels at the thp could maintain historic irrigated grain yield levels in the future or even produce more yield in the milder temperature northern regions projected changes in dryland grain yield in the late century compared to the historic period fell between 34 and 71 however average projection of nine gcms indicated an increase in dryland grain yields at all three sites dryland grain yield increased by a greater extent than irrigated yield this was likely because the beneficial effects of co2 fertilization on yield and water use efficiency were greater under limited water conditions than under ample water conditions based on water use and yield high yield potential and denser roots were identified as the most suitable cc adaptive traits for both irrigated and dryland production longer grain filling duration trait increased seasonal irrigation by a greater extent than it increased yield therefore it was not recommended for the thp region similarly due to significant increase in seasonal irrigation stay green trait delayed senescence was not suggested early flowering trait benefitted irrigated production at lamesa likely due to heat stress avoidance while mixed trends were simulated across sites and cc scenarios nonetheless seasonal irrigation was lower with early flowering trait compared to the reference cultivar therefore early flowering could be recommended for warmer regions within the thp irrigated yield responses to changes in different traits were different across sites whereas seasonal irrigation water use responses to these traits were similar across the three sites

10864,winter wheat is one of the major crops in the texas high plains thp region which is facing challenges from climate change cc and exhausting irrigation water supplies from the ogallala aquifer the goal of this study was to assess the impacts of cc on winter wheat production in the thp and evaluate potential adaptation strategies using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat ceres wheat model a thorough calibration of the model against field data resulted in a satisfactory simulation of phenology leaf area index grain yield percent error pe 4 7 biomass pe 7 1 and evapotranspiration pe 11 9 the evaluated model was then used for i predicting winter wheat yield and irrigation water use and ii evaluating six potential winter wheat cultivars under cc at three sites in the thp mixed trends were found for irrigated yield in the future across the study sites due to differences in climate and soils irrigation water use of winter wheat is expected to decrease in the future due to improved water use efficiency at elevated atmospheric co2 concentration and reduced growing season length due to temperature rise dryland yield is expected to increase due to improved crop water use efficiency among the virtual cultivars tested for cc adaptation increasing potential number of grains and vigorous root system were found to be the most desirable traits since these cultivars had higher yield and lower or comparable irrigation water use than the reference cultivar long maturity and stay green cultivars were found to be not advisable due to significantly higher irrigation water use than the reference cultivar overall the results showed that winter wheat production in the thp could benefit from cc under milder climatic conditions mean growing season temperature 13 c enhancing yield potential traits and root architecture should be considered for screening cultivars for cc adaptation keywords ceres wheat genetic traits stay green yield potential 1 introduction climate change cc could potentially affect crop productivity and food supply wheeler and von braun 2013 and hence there is a need to evaluate strategies for adapting agriculture to future cc howden et al 2007 wheat triticum aestivum l is a widely grown cereal crop covering 22 of the total agricultural land in the world leff et al 2004 developing adaptation strategies on global and regional scales to enhance cc resilience of wheat production could ameliorate food insecurity the response of crops to cc is primarily governed by the atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration co2 air temperature and precipitation hatfield et al 2011 wheat response to changes in these climatic variables has been documented in several controlled environment experiments and simulation studies kimball et al 1999 wall et al 2000 asseng et al 2014 free air co2 enrichment face systems allow exposure of growing plants to elevated co2 levels under open air conditions ainsworth and long 2004 wheat growth and development in face systems has been monitored in various parts of the world including australia o leary et al 2014 germany högy et al 2009 and the united states us kimball et al 1999 wall et al 2000 these face studies have shown that under elevated co2 wheat grain yield leaf area index lai biomass water use efficiency and accumulation of carbon increased whereas stomatal conductance seasonal crop water use and daily evapotranspiration decreased in majority of the face studies the effects of changes in temperature were not considered however only a few researchers dias de oliveira et al 2015 tan et al 2018 have studied the effects of changes in co2 and temperature simultaneously using field experiments using natural light controlled temperature co2 and irrigation n ctci field facilities in australia dias de oliveira et al 2015 showed that grain filling rate increased and time to physiological maturity reduced at higher temperature ambient temperature 3 c the enhanced understanding of crop climate relation as a result of physical experiments can be extrapolated to a wider range of climatic conditions using crop simulation models asseng et al 2015 studying wheat production under a wide range of co2 temperature and rainfall patterns as projected under cc scenarios ipcc 2014 will be instrumental in selecting strategies to adapt wheat production to cc results from different simulation studies have shown mixed trends in wheat grain yield under cc results from recent studies ahmed et al 2017 dixit et al 2018 tang et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 kapur et al 2019 indicated that grain yield is expected to increase due to increase in co2 however negative effects of cc on wheat yield have also been simulated in some studies due to the combined effect of changes in co2 temperature and rainfall simulated dryland grain yield decreased in the us plains tubiello et al 2002 and in south australia luo et al 2005 due to projected reduction in precipitation in the future irrigated grain yield decreased at some sites in a global study due to temperature stress balkovič et al 2014 similarly wheat yield responses to cc varied at different locations in australia with increasing trends in colder regions and decreasing trends in warmer regions wang et al 2017 in a multi model global study considering the effects of temperature alone researchers asseng et al 2014 estimated a 6 reduction in wheat yield for each degree rise in temperature in summary these simulation studies demonstrated that projected increase in co2 and temperature in the future would likely have positive and negative effects on wheat production respectively overall cc may benefit colder regions while temperature stress would offset beneficial effects from elevated co2 in warmer regions as wheat response to cc depends on local climatic conditions cc impact and potential adaptation analysis in major wheat producing regions that have not been studied in the past could contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance climate resilience of wheat production the us high plains region which is termed as the grain basket of the us scanlon et al 2012 accounted for about 47 of us wheat production between 1965 to 2010 grassini et al 2013 the texas high plains thp region is a key part of the us high plains with 1 1 million ha of winter wheat grown annually 2007 2017 out of which 34 area was irrigated usda nass 2018 irrigation water in the thp region comes from the southern portion of the exhaustible ogallala aquifer colaizzi et al 2009 therefore crop production in the thp region not only faces challenges from cc but also from diminishing irrigation water supplies it is therefore imperative to consider irrigation water constraints while studying the implications of cc and analyzing potential adaptation for wheat production in the thp potential strategies considered by researchers to adapt wheat production to cc have included alternate management practices nouri et al 2017 and identifying critical genetic traits better suited under cc semenov and stratonovitch 2015 wang et al 2019 using the sirius model researchers semenov et al 2014 semenov and stratonovitch 2015 stratonovitch and semenov 2015 senapati et al 2018 identified longer grain filling period maintaining green leaf area stay green and heat tolerance around flowering as desirable traits for adapting wheat to cc in europe using the apsim model wang et al 2019 identified longer grain filling period shorter vegetative period greater radiation use efficiency and bigger grain size compared to historic cultivar as desirable traits for adapting wheat to cc in australia a similar model aided evaluation of genetic traits for the thp region could assist producers in this region in better preparing for the anticipated future climatic conditions although the ceres wheat model has been widely used in the cc impact analysis tubiello et al 2002 eitzinger et al 2003 yang et al 2017 it was rarely used for testing genetic traits of wheat for cc adaptation in this study genetic traits were not only evaluated based on wheat grain yield but also on seasonal irrigation which is important for the thp region the overarching goal of this study was to assess the impacts of cc on wheat production in the thp region and evaluate potential cc adaptive genetic traits the specific goals of this study were to a evaluate the ceres wheat model for the thp region b assess the impacts of cc on winter wheat production i e irrigated and dryland yield and seasonal irrigation and c identify optimum cc adaptation strategies for irrigated and dryland winter wheat production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study locations three sites within the thp region were selected for this study the selected sites bushland 35 11 n 102 6 w halfway 34 11 n 101 56 w and lamesa 32 46 n 101 56 w are located in the northern middle and southern parts of the thp region respectively for the calibration and evaluation of the ceres wheat model data from field experiments conducted at bushland xue et al 2006 were used the evaluated model parameters were used for developing cc scenarios for all three sites during the 1980 2010 period mean annual rainfall at bushland 494 mm and halfway 515 mm was comparable and that at lamesa 478 mm was slightly lower for the same period mean annual air temperature at bushland 14 2 c was lower than that at halfway 15 1 c and lamesa 16 1 c noaa 2017 the daily historic weather data used during model evaluation came from the texas high plains evapotranspiration network weather stations porter et al 2005 the missing values were filled with agmerra climate data ruane et al 2015 the daily climate variables used included solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity soil data files were created using the sbuild tool uryasev et al 2004 within the dssat model the data used for populating soil profile and generating soil characteristics were based on field measurements and published studies adhikari et al 2016 data from field measurements included soil texture organic carbon ph cation exchange capacity and total nitrogen while soil at bushland and halfway sites is pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustolls the soil at lamesa site is amarillo fine sandy loam fine loamy mixed superactive thermic aridic paleustalf average clay content in the top 180 cm soil profile at bushland halfway and lamesa is 36 29 and 10 respectively average sand content in the top 180 cm soil profile at bushland halfway and lamesa is 22 47 and 75 respectively 2 2 dssat csm ceres wheat model the ceres wheat ritchie et al 1998 module within the dssat v4 6 hoogenboom et al 2015 cropping system model was used in this study it is one of the most widely used models for studying wheat tubiello and ewert 2002 and the detailed information about the model is available in other published studies ritchie and otter 1984 ritchie et al 1998 white et al 2008 the ceres wheat model uses radiation use efficiency based approach to calculate biomass the biomass is partitioned into different components of plant according to growth stages the simulated biomass is modified in case of nutrient water stress plant development rate increases linearly with the increase in temperature up to 26 c above which the growth rate is plateaued white et al 2008 to compensate for the effect of elevated co2 on stomatal conductance plant transpiration is reduced by a multiplier as co2 is increased tubiello and ewert 2002 grain yield is increased by 27 when co2 is doubled boote et al 2010 a greater grain yield response 40 45 increase to doubling co2 is simulated under drought conditions boote et al 2010 the co2 response functions in ceres wheat were based on field experiments which are summarized in kimball et al 1999 the capability of ceres wheat to simulate changes in climatic variables and its widespread use makes it an ideal choice for this study the minimum input data required for simulating crop growth and development using dssat includes daily weather data soil properties and crop management e g planting date seeding rate fertilizer jones et al 2003 2 3 model calibration and evaluation 2 3 1 field experiments crop management inputs used for setting the ceres wheat model came from three separate field experiments conducted at bushland texas over four growing seasons for model calibration field experimental data collected from winter wheat field studies conducted at bushland during 1992 1993 xue et al 2003 2006 was used winter wheat was planted on october 1 at 70 kg ha 1 seeding density and 0 25 m row spacing in these experiments irrigation water was applied at eight levels based on different growth stages i e jointing booting anthesis and grain filling in addition a rainfed treatment was also studied all the nine treatments received a starter irrigation of about 25 mm before planting a 140 kg n ha 1 fertilizer was applied to all the plots one week prior to planting the observed data used for calibration included dates of onset of growth stages lai grain yield biomass yield and seasonal evapotranspiration etc seasonal etc was calculated by adding rainfall irrigation and the difference between soil moisture at planting and harvest detailed information about these experiments can be found in previous studies xue et al 2003 2006 for model evaluation data from the field experiments conducted at bushland during 1980 1981 eck 1988 and 1997 1999 schneider and howell 2001 were used in the first set of experiments eck 1988 winter wheat was planted on october 15 1980 at 50 kg ha 1 seeding rate irrigation was applied at four levels fall irrigation only and fall irrigation plus one two three spring irrigations fertilizer treatments were 0 kg n ha 1 70 kg n ha 1 140 kg n ha 1 and 210 kg n ha 1 in the second set of experiments schneider and howell 2001 winter wheat was planted on october 2 1997 and september 29 1998 at a seeding rate of 67 kg ha 1 with 0 1 m row width irrigation was applied at five levels to meet 100 75 50 25 and 0 etc fertilizer was applied before planting at 123 kg n ha 1 and 140 kg n ha 1 in 1997 and 1998 respectively the observed data used for model evaluation from these experiments included grain yield biomass yield and seasonal etc 2 3 2 calibration methodology ceres wheat model was calibrated systematically based on the approach described in thorp et al 2010 parameters were adjusted manually by targeting in sequence the observed phenology in season lai and end of season biomass and yield the adjustments were made by keeping the parameter values within the range of values used for existing cultivars in the dssat database first the parameters related to crop development or phenology were adjusted to get a good match between observed and simulated dates of onset of growth stages parameters representing the duration between different growth stages p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 were adjusted sequentially to improve the simulation of phenological stages in this process the observed xue et al 2003 and simulated dates of onset of growth stages expressed as zadoks number zadoks et al 1974 and day of year doy were compared after simulating phenology adequately parameters related to crop growth were adjusted to improve the simulation of in season lai finally the parameters were adjusted to get a good match between measured and simulated end of season biomass and grain yield after fine tuning genotype parameters during calibration using the measured data from xue et al 2006 experiments model was evaluated against the remaining experimental data eck 1988 schneider and howell 2001 without further adjusting the genotype parameters lastly model performance in simulating seasonal etc was evaluated using data from all three field experiments the indicators used to test the model performance included graphical comparison and commonly used performance statistics adhikari et al 2016 index of agreement d willmott 1981 percent error pe and percent root mean squared error rmse model calibration was continued until a good calibration rmse 20 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 was achieved 2 4 crop management data used for future scenarios winter wheat was planted on october 1st at a seeding rate of 200 seeds m 2 which is the widely recommended seeding rate for central u s great plains paulsen 1987 initial conditions set up in the top 210 cm soil profile were soil water at field capacity attia et al 2016 and soil nitrogen at 50 kg n ha 1 which is within the range of values reported at bushland tx eck 1988 for irrigated and dryland winter wheat production 140 kg n ha 1 nitrate nitrogen fertilizer was applied one week prior to planting in accordance with the irrigated experiments at bushland tx schneider and howell 2001 xue et al 2006 irrigation was simulated using auto irrigation feature of dssat irrigation was applied to replenish soil water in the top 30 cm soil profile default auto irrigation depth to field capacity whenever plant available water content dropped to 50 these settings for auto irrigation were used in several previous studies thaler et al 2012 wu et al 2014 kothari et al 2019 irrigation water use estimated for different scenarios by the dssat model based on the above auto irrigation criteria were obtained from the model output and used for interpreting simulation results 2 5 climate change cc scenarios simulated cc scenarios were based on two trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the numeral in the pathway represents the projected radiative forcing w m 2 which is defined as the difference between total incoming and outgoing atmospheric solar radiation procopio et al 2004 rcp 8 5 is a high emission scenario with greater increase in projected co2 in the future compared to rcp 4 5 in this study co2 was varied annually fig 1 based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projections ipcc 2014 using environment modification functionality in dssat other climate variables solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity were varied daily according to the projected climate data climate forcing from nine global climate models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 taylor et al 2012 were drawn from the macav2 metdata dataset abatzoglou and brown 2012 and used in this study table s1 the maca dataset contains daily climate projections at 4 6 km spatial resolution which were statistically downscaled and bias corrected using the multivariate adapted constructed analogs maca method abatzoglou and brown 2012 with observed training data from abatzoglou 2013 the maca dataset includes daily data for the historic 1950 2005 and future until 2099 period in this study simulations were run for the entire duration 1950 2099 and the results from three 30 year periods representing historic 1976 2005 mid century 2036 2065 and late century 2066 2095 were used for cc impact and adaptation analysis the simulations were run with projected climate data from each gcm and the difference between historic and future yield for each gcm was initially calculated the yield differences for the 9 gcms were then averaged to get ensemble averages and compared for the historic versus future climate periods a combination of two rcps and nine gcms resulted in a total of 18 climate change scenarios 2 6 climate change adaptation virtual cultivars the set of genotype parameters obtained after model calibration is referred to as the reference cultivar a total of six alternate cultivars were tested for cc adaptation these alternate cultivars were created by changing one or more parameter s from the reference cultivar it may be noted that we altered a wide range of parameters to create the virtual cultivars including maximum root water uptake grain filling phase duration soil root growth factor and potential number of kernels parameter values were altered in such a way that the values adjusted in our study were within the range of literature values whenever available 2 6 1 denser roots changes in root architecture could lead to winter wheat yield benefits especially under water deficit conditions manschadi et al 2006 among the reported changes in root architectural characteristics for enhancing drought tolerance increased root density was chosen in this study because previous modeling studies carretero et al 2014 singh et al 2014c robinson et al 2015 have shown that increasing root density at different soil depths could enhance access to stored soil water increase soil water extraction and improve crop productivity in this study a potential cultivar with denser roots than the reference cultivar was created by increasing root density at different soil depths this was done by changing soil root growth factor srgf in the soil file from e 0 02 z to 1 z 500 6 where z is the soil depth in cm this methodology is similar to the approach used for sorghum singh et al 2014c chickpea singh et al 2014a groundnut singh et al 2014b and maize tesfaye et al 2018 in which srgf was increased and drained lower limit was decreased however in this study only srgf was increased and drained lower limit was kept the same for both reference and virtual cultivars 2 6 2 stay green delayed senescence stay green or delayed leaf senescence has been identified as one of the important drought tolerant traits of wheat cossani and reynolds 2012 stratonovitch and semenov 2015 senapati et al 2018 in this study stay green trait was incorporated by modifying the parameters related to leaf senescence in the ecotype file parameter lsphs final leaf senescence starts growth stage was increased from 4 2 to 4 7 and lsphe final leaf senescence ends growth stage was increased from 5 5 to 6 to delay leaf senescence these parameter values were within the range of values tested by li et al 2018 2 6 3 higher root water uptake positive effects of increased root water uptake on wheat yield have been demonstrated in many field studies xue et al 2003 manschadi et al 2006 using the sirius wheat model senapati et al 2018 have shown that increasing root water uptake could increase yield potential under cc in the present study a second drought tolerant cultivar was created by increasing the rwumx maximum water uptake rate cm3 cm root 1 day 1 in the species file from its default value of 0 03 to 0 04 root hydraulic properties have not been studied using the ceres wheat model before and hence the range of rwumx parameter values was not available in the literature it should be noted that the virtual cultivar with denser roots affects root water uptake by modifying physical properties or density of the roots and the virtual cultivar with high root water uptake increase water uptake directly without modifying physical characteristics of the roots testing both types of characteristics for cc adaptation could be useful for future modeling studies or breeding programs 2 6 4 heat tolerant i and ii longer grain filling period heat stress due to rising temperature under cc could affect winter wheat yield by shortening grain filling duration and hastening crop maturity therefore extended grain filling duration has been identified as one of the important heat tolerant traits stratonovitch and semenov 2015 lopes et al 2018 in this study two virtual cultivars with longer grain filling duration than the reference cultivar were created these cultivars are referred to as heat tolerant cultivars heat tolerant i winter wheat cultivar was created by increasing the parameter p5 grain filling phase duration c d from 500 to 550 or by 10 in the cultivar file changing p5 from 500 to 550 resulted in about 2 days longer grain filling period another heat tolerant cultivar ii was created by increasing p5 from 500 to 700 based on literature value for the thp region attia et al 2016 which resulted in 8 days longer grain filling period 2 6 5 high yield potential more number of kernels per head a high yield potential wheat cultivar was created by increasing the potential number of kernels g1 by 10 from 16 to 18 this was in accordance with a controlled environment study dias de oliveira et al 2015 in which researchers emphasized the need for developing wheat varieties with greater number of potential grains they found that number of grains were not affected by climate variables and therefore increasing potential number of grains could increase grain yield under cc 2 6 6 short vegetative phase early flowering early flowering has been shown to ameliorate yield loss due to cc in a face study early sown wheat had higher biomass leaf area and yield because early flowering prevented exposure to hotter temperature late in the season o leary et al 2014 exposure to higher temperature in the late season could also reduce the duration of grain filling period which could reduce grain yield lopes et al 2018 in this study one virtual cultivar was created by reducing the vegetative phase or time to flowering parameters p1 p2 and p3 which affect earliness per se herndl et al 2008 were reduced to reduce the pre anthesis period these values were reduced by 10 from their calibrated values p1 from 350 to 315 p2 from 250 to 225 and p3 from 180 to 162 these changes in parameters reduced the number of days to anthesis by about 7 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the genotype parameters adjusted during the ceres wheat model calibration are presented in table 1 the parameter p1v days required to complete vernalization under optimum vernalizing temperature was adjusted to 21 which is within the range of typically observed values 5 45 days for winter wheat in texas neely et al 2014 adjustment of parameters related to crop development resulted in a close match between observed and simulated dates of onset of growth stages fig 2 a the observed and simulated days to physiological maturity were very close at 263 and 265 days after planting dap respectively simulated onset of anthesis 225 dap was also within the range of observed days to anthesis 222 225 dap adjustment of crop growth related parameters resulted in a good match between the measured and simulated in season lai values fig 2b in the final phase of calibration the measured and simulated end of season grain yield and biomass yield were compared model performance was satisfactory during calibration fig 3 a b as indicated by the performance statistics rmse 18 8 pe 7 1 and d 0 66 while the simulated and measured yields on average were close yield of the highest irrigation level treatments were underestimated this was because of multiple single applications of 100 mm irrigation which resulted in greater nitrogen leaching and lower nitrogen uptake as compared to other irrigation level treatments dryland yield was also overestimated potentially due to underestimation of water stress and not accounting for other stressors such as pests disease and extreme weather by the model during evaluation measured data from treatments with a wider range of irrigation and nitrogen levels was considered in general yield under no fertilization treatments was underestimated while the dryland yield was slightly overestimated by the model a poorer model performance under unfertilized treatment compared to fertilized treatment has also been reported previously popova and kercheva 2005 biomass prediction was better compared to the prediction of grain yield an underestimation of biomass in the highest irrigation treatments translated to underestimation of seasonal etc for those treatments overall there was a reasonable match between the observed and simulated grain yield and biomass during the model evaluation fig 3c d as indicated by the model performance statistics rmse 26 2 pe 4 8 and d 0 77 based on rmse model performance in prediction of grain yield and biomass was considered good during calibration 18 8 and fair during evaluation 26 2 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 during the evaluation of model performance for seasonal etc prediction the measured and simulated etc under rainfed and low irrigation treatment were in good agreement as indicated by rmse of 26 9 and pe of 11 9 fig 4 calibration of ceres wheat for a wide range of irrigation and nitrogen treatments manually proved to be challenging and hence it is recommended to use an auto calibration method in the future studies summarizing the ceres wheat model was evaluated against data from three separate field experiments the field dataset included four winter wheat growing seasons 1980 81 1992 93 1997 98 and 1998 99 five fertilizer levels between 0 kg n ha 1 to 210 kg n ha 1 and 18 different irrigation levels from three different irrigation scheduling methods based on growth stage combination of fall and spring irrigation and wheat etc based methods an adequate model performance under a wide range of water fertilizer and environment conditions suggests that model could be used for testing environment and management scenarios with reasonable confidence 3 2 climate change impacts on winter wheat production 3 2 1 climate change impacts on irrigated winter wheat yield simulated changes in irrigated grain yield under cc expressed as ensemble averages based on nine gcm projections are presented in table 2 the irrigated grain yield increased at bushland and halfway in the future as compared to the historic period whereas it decreased at lamesa this change was statistically significant for both rcps and future periods for all three sites except for rcp 8 5 in the late century at bushland the percent change in irrigated grain yield in the future compared to the historic period considering individual gcm projections varied between 20 rcp 8 5 2080s at lamesa under cnrm cm5 1 and 10 rcp 8 5 2080s at halfway under bcc csm1 1 fig 5 while temperature increase was the main driver of irrigated yield decline in the future increased biomass accumulation due to co2 fertilization was the primary reason for yield increase in the future unlike at bushland and halfway the positive effects of co2 fertilization were suppressed by temperature rise at lamesa and therefore grain yield decreased the coefficient of variation cv was about the same in the historic and future time periods at all three sites the magnitude of irrigated grain yield was the lowest at lamesa when compared to bushland and halfway table 2 possible reasons for the lowest irrigated grain yield at lamesa could be the differences in growing season length soil types and temperature regimes the historic average growing season length at bushland halfway and lamesa was 250 244 and 231 days respectively a shorter growing season at lamesa implied lesser time for biomass accumulation and grain filling hence the lower grain yields as compared to other sites another reason for lower grain yield at lamesa could be the coarser soil at lamesa which allowed greater nitrogen leaching than other two locations data not shown this is consistent with a simulation study conducted on three soil types and six locations in australia milroy et al 2008 in which the risk of drainage and leaching was higher in coarser soils with low water and nutrient holding capacity than it was at finer soils in addition the lower nitrogen uptake at lamesa as a result of higher leaching than other two sites could be another reason for the contrasting trend in irrigated yield under cc i e reduction in yield at lamesa and increase in yield at bushland and halfway the lower nitrogen uptake at lamesa due to higher leaching has further added to the negative effects of temperature stress this is consistent with a glasshouse chamber study in the united kingdom mitchell et al 1993 in which elevated co2 did not increase grain yield at low nitrogen supply level this trend is also similar to the trend observed in a face and simulation study at maricopa in arizona where yield gains associated with elevated co2 were smaller at low nitrogen supply than at higher nitrogen supply jamieson et al 2000 the differences in temperature regimes at the three sites was another reason for the differences in projected yield under cc the historic period growing season mean temperature for bushland halfway and lamesa was 9 c 10 c and 12 c respectively a comparison between irrigated grain yield and growing season planting harvest mean temperature for individual simulations 149 years 9 rcps 3 locations is presented in fig 6 which shows that grain yield tended to decline when the growing season mean temperature increased beyond 11 13 c future growing season temperature projected by most gcms at lamesa fell outside the threshold of 11 13 c which explains the decline in grain yield at lamesa under cc whereas the other two locations were benefitted from increased vegetative biomass due to co2 fertilization it may be noted that the ceres model uses nine temperature functions to account for temperature stress at nine different growth stages alderman et al 2014 but analyzing temperature stress at different growth stages was beyond the scope of the present study 3 2 2 climate change impacts on dryland winter wheat yield the dryland grain yield expressed as ensemble average based on nine gcm projections increased at all three sites in the future compared to the historic period table 2 this change was statistically significant for most rcps and future periods for all three sites except for both future periods under rcp 4 5 at bushland and for late century under both rcps at lamesa the percent change in dryland grain yield in the future compared to the historic period considering individual gcm projections varied between 34 rcp 8 5 2080s at lamesa under ipsl cm5a lr and 71 rcp 8 5 2080s at halfway under gfdl esm2m fig 5 the greatest reduction in yield of 34 at lamesa was the result of 26 lower oct may rainfall 4 6 c warmer growing season planting harvest 35 lower biomass at the end of vegetative phase and 20 days shorter crop cycle compared to the historic period on the other hand the maximum increase in yield 71 at halfway was simulated under 2 higher oct may rainfall 2 2 c warmer growing season planting harvest 98 higher biomass at the end of vegetative phase and 17 days shorter crop cycle than the historic period changes in dryland yield were highly correlated with changes in biomass at the end of vegetative phase fig 7 a the reasons behind increased dryland yield and vegetative biomass under cc were improved water use efficiency of the plant and increased rainfall in case of some gcms especially in december and february fig 7b winter wheat was planted in october and the months of december and february corresponded with the growth stages between end of dormancy and terminal spikelet the correlation between water stress during early growth stages until booting and dryland yield was greater than the correlation between water stress during reproductive stages and dryland yield there was a negative correlation between water stress at different growth stages and dryland yield except for the grain filling phase these results are consistent with the findings from field experiments conducted at bushland tx xue et al 2006 in which water stress during grain filling led to an increase in grain yield they also reported that deficit irrigation during early growth stages jointing and booting increased grain yield by a greater amount than applying irrigation at later stages anthesis and grain filling such a large window of expected change in dryland yield under cc was also reported in previous studies using the dssat model tubiello et al 2002 simulated yield increase between 6 20 under one gcm and yield decrease between 50 to 10 under another gcm in the 2030s using the epic crop model and hadcm2 gcm izaurralde et al 2003 simulated a 7 80 increase in dryland yield in the late century compared to historic period 1961 1990 stöckle et al 2018 simulated up to 85 increase in dryland yield in the late century compared to the historic period 1980 2010 using the cropsyst model and maca climate projections xiao et al 2018 simulated a change in dryland yield between 45 to 50 under rcp 8 5 in 2080s with the apsim model the range of changes in dryland yield projected under different gcms was much larger than the future projections of change in irrigated yield larger uncertainty in dryland yield projections is expected due to the uncertainty in water availability which is compensated for in case of irrigated production consequently the cv for dryland yield was much greater compared to the cv for irrigated yield tubiello et al 2002 also reported a higher cv for dryland winter wheat yield 30 50 compared to irrigated yield 10 15 for different locations in the us another interesting finding is that the magnitude of percent yield increase under dryland conditions was greater than the percent increase under irrigated conditions this was especially prominent in case of lamesa where irrigated yield was projected to decrease whereas dryland yield was projected to increase under cc this is likely due to the differential effect of co2 fertilization under well watered and limited water conditions using the apsim n wheat model ludwig and asseng 2006 showed that increase in grain yield due to co2 fertilization was more under water limited conditions than under well watered conditions similar results were reported by ahmed et al 2017 in a multi model simulation study for the us pacific northwest their results are also consistent with the findings of a face study in maricopa az pinter et al 2000 and a closed top field chamber study in manhattan ks chaudhuri et al 1990 in which yield gain under elevated co2 was higher under water stress however opposite trends have also been shown in other studies as summarized in a review by amthor 2001 in general dryland grain yield increased at all locations under most gcms the magnitude of increase was the highest at halfway and lowest at lamesa table 2 one reason behind greater increase in dryland yield at halfway could be the change in grain yield transpiration productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 under cc fig 7c the grain yield transpiration productivity at halfway increased under most cases and by a larger margin than other two sites the primary reason for increased yield water productivity in the future was co2 fertilization which increased plant growth and reduced transpiration per unit area especially under soils with low water holding capacity thaler et al 2012 the differences in growing season length and temperature regimes among the three sites as explained in section 3 3 also contributed to the differences in cc impacts on dryland yield differences in rainfall projections among the sites and resultant water stress at different growth stages also likely contributed to differences in dryland yield projections among the three sites in summary changes in dryland grain yield under cc were due to the interactive effects of growing season length rainfall projections temperature and soil type 3 2 3 climate change impacts on irrigation water use the irrigation water use expressed as ensemble average based on nine gcm projections decreased at all three sites in the future compared to the historic period for both rcps and future periods except at bushland under rcp 4 5 in the mid century table 2 this change was statistically significant for lamesa under both rcps and future periods and under rcp 8 5 in the late century for all three sites the percent change in irrigation water use in the future compared to the historic period considering individual gcm projections varied between 16 rcp 8 5 2080s at bushland under gfdl esm2m and 10 rcp 4 5 2050s at bushland under ipsl cm5a lr fig 5 the reduction in seasonal irrigation was more under rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 similar to the findings of xiao et al 2018 possible reasons for reduced irrigation water use were improved water use efficiency under elevated co2 reduced growing season or period for which irrigation was required and increased rainfall in some cases seasonal etc also decreased under cc data not shown reduction in etc despite an increase in irrigated yield under cc on doubling co2 has been also reported in a ceres wheat study in austria eitzinger et al 2003 out of 36 scenarios 9 gcms 2 rcps 2 future periods for each location increase in seasonal irrigation was projected under 12 13 and 4 scenarios at bushland halfway and lamesa respectively fig 5g i in other words a reduction in seasonal irrigation under cc was simulated under a greater number of scenarios at lamesa than at other two sites this is because beneficial effects of co2 fertilization on grain yield and vegetative biomass were suppressed at lamesa due to higher temperatures and coarser soils than at other two sites these results suggest that the irrigated wheat grain yield in the thp can be maintained at historic level even with slightly lower irrigation amounts than the historic levels due to the beneficial effects of co2 fertilization and high water holding capacity of soils provided seasonal mean temperatures remain under optimum levels 13 c 3 3 climate change adaptation site specific 3 3 1 climate change adaptation bushland simulated changes in grain yield and irrigation water use between the virtual and reference cultivars are presented in table 3 for these estimates yield and irrigation water use under a specific cultivar were averaged over nine global climate models for irrigated wheat production all modifications in genetic traits tested in this study resulted in yield gain under cc except early flowering trait under rcp 4 5 in 2050s table 3 yield gain refers to the percent increase in grain yield under a virtual cultivar compared to the reference cultivar the yield gain was highest with stay green trait up to 6 1 followed by high yield potential trait up to 4 2 both of these yield gains were significant yield gain with other genetic traits under different cc scenarios was marginal 2 6 irrigation water use for virtual cultivar with stay green trait was significantly higher up to 10 than the reference cultivar increasing duration of grain filling period by 8 days resulted in an increase in irrigation water use by 3 4 and yield gain of about 1 irrigation water use did not change with high yield potential trait i e increasing potential kernel numbers per unit canopy weight on the other hand irrigation water use was significantly lower with short vegetative period up to 5 1 and with denser roots up to 4 3 compared to the reference cultivar irrigation water use for other virtual cultivars was about the same as the reference cultivar considering irrigated yield and irrigation water use together high yield potential increased potential kernel number per unit canopy weight trait seems to be the best strategy for bushland making roots denser could be the second desirable trait as it reduced irrigation water use while the irrigated yield was about the same as the reference cultivar for dryland production yield gain was simulated under all virtual cultivars except the early flowering cultivar thus early flowering appears to be an unsuitable trait for cc adaptation under dryland conditions in near future for dryland production increasing yield potential trait and using denser roots were found to be equally desirable traits for bushland 3 3 2 climate change adaptation halfway yield gain in irrigated wheat production was significant at halfway and the highest gain was found with high yield potential trait up to 8 4 followed by stay green trait up to 3 7 table 4 yield gain with other genetic traits was negligible and a yield loss was simulated with early flowering trait except under rcp 8 5 in 2080s differences in seasonal irrigation under a virtual cultivar compared to the reference cultivar at halfway were similar to those at bushland similar to bushland high yield potential was found to be the most desirable trait followed by denser roots for the halfway site for dryland wheat production the highest yield gain was simulated with high yield potential up to 10 7 followed by denser roots up to 8 4 other genetic traits had minor effect on dryland yield early flowering cultivar had lower yield than the reference cultivar therefore the most desirable traits for dryland wheat production at halfway were found to be high yield potential trait followed by denser root system trait 3 3 3 cc adaptation lamesa the response of irrigated wheat production to different genetic traits was different at lamesa than at other two sites the highest and significant yield gain was simulated with stay green up to 7 8 early flowering up to 5 0 and denser root up to 3 1 traits table 5 high yield potential trait which resulted in the highest yield gain at other two sites resulted in a significant yield gain 2 4 at lamesa only under rcp 8 5 in 2080s yield gain with other genetic traits was marginal 1 6 minor yield reduction was simulated with high root water uptake trait although genetic traits had a different effect on irrigated yield at different sites their effect on seasonal irrigation water use was similar at the three sites irrigation water use at lamesa was increased significantly with stay green up to 12 7 and longer grain filling duration up to 3 6 traits in contrast irrigation water use was reduced significantly with early flowering up to 5 6 and denser root system up to 3 traits the irrigation water use for the remaining virtual cultivars was comparable to that with the reference cultivar the most desirable trait for irrigated wheat production at lamesa was found to be early flowering followed by dense roots both of these traits resulted in significant yield gain and significant reduction in irrigation water use compared to the baseline period dryland grain yield gains were maximum with high yield potential trait up to 9 3 followed by the dense roots trait up to 6 8 stay green trait also resulted in a marginal yield gain up to 2 5 minor yield loss was simulated with early flowering trait under rcp 4 5 and with high root water uptake trait similar to bushland and halfway dryland wheat production at lamesa could benefit from incorporating high yield potential and dense root system traits 3 4 discussion climate change adaptive genetic traits it is not surprising that increasing soil root growth factor srgf increased grain yield and reduced seasonal irrigation water use increasing srgf has likely led to greater soil water extraction at different depths compared to the reference cultivar similar beneficial effects of increasing srgf have been reported on yield of other crops such as sorghum in india and africa singh et al 2014c and soybean in brazil battisti and sentelhas 2017 yield gain due to dense root system was higher at lamesa coarser soil than other two sites clay loam soil tables 3 5 the yield gain with dense roots was more for dryland production than for irrigated production this could be explained by a better utilization of stored soil water which is more important for dryland production stay green trait increased water use and irrigated yield at all three sites in all cc scenarios tables 3 5 a possible explanation could be that stay green trait and co2 fertilization effects due to elevated co2 in the future had a beneficial effect on leaf area and vegetative biomass the increased vegetative biomass and green leaf area likely increased crop consumptive use water was not limited for irrigated production in this study due to the use of auto irrigation tool which led to increased seasonal irrigation as well as increased grain yield however dryland wheat yield did not increase substantially with stay green trait due to the limitation of water supply therefore stay green trait may not be a suitable cc adaptation strategy for the thp region for both dryland and irrigation wheat production in general possible benefits of co2 fertilization should be accounted for while considering stay green trait for cc adaption another interesting finding is that yield gain with stay green trait was more prominent at lamesa than at other two sites this is likely because maintaining green area compensated for reduced carbon accumulation rate due to temperature stress which was more sever at lamesa than the other two sites increasing maximum water uptake rate by 0 01 cm3 cm root 1 day 1 did not show substantial effect on either yield or seasonal irrigation interestingly increasing root water uptake had slight positive yield gain at bushland and halfway and some yield loss at lamesa the minor yield loss at lamesa could be attributed to the soil properties low water holding capacity and high water uptake rate might have led to faster depletion of soil water at lamesa using root chamber experiments in australia manschadi et al 2006 showed that modifying root traits may penalize wheat yield due to early exhaustion of stored soil water and lack of water during grain filling season although increasing grain fill duration by about 8 days increased irrigated and dryland grain yield the increase in yield 3 was not significant on the other hand seasonal irrigation increased by a greater percent than irrigated yield with longer grain filling duration compared to the reference cultivar the marginal increase in grain yield and associated greater increase in seasonal irrigation demand makes longer grain fill duration a less desirable cc adaptive trait for the thp region however other researchers have proposed longer grain filling duration as a potential strategy to combat cc at other locations using sirius model in europe semenov and stratonovitch 2015 and apsim model in australia wang et al 2019 researchers showed that grain fill duration parameter reached its maximum value in order to maximize grain yield high yield potential increasing potential kernel number per unit canopy weight increased grain yield in all cases while irrigation water use was the same as the reference cultivar therefore high yield potential appears to be the most suitable cc adaptive trait for the thp and other locations early flowering trait showed great potential for irrigated production at lamesa with significant yield gain and reduced irrigation water use for other sites and water treatments there was a mixed trend it should be noted that early flowering meant shorter length of vegetative phase since the planting date was the same for all scenarios shorter vegetative phase could potentially reduce grain yield by limiting the time for biomass accumulation he et al 2015 however early anthesis could mean advancing crop cycle and shifting reproductive phase into cooler parts of the season ludwig and asseng 2010 the mixed effect of early flowering on grain yield makes it a risky trait for the thp region however a positive aspect of early flowering and shorter vegetative phase is the significant reduction in irrigation water use perhaps in the hotter southern regions of the thp early flowering could help in wheat production by avoiding heat stress later in the season 4 conclusions the ceres wheat model was evaluated using in season phenology and lai and end of season grain yield biomass and evapotranspiration data from field experiments at bushland tx after obtaining a satisfactory model performance the calibrated model parameters were used to simulate cc scenarios and adaptation strategies the cc scenarios were based on daily weather projections from nine gcms and two rcps for three sites in the thp bushland halfway and lamesa simulated irrigated grain yield increased up to 10 at bushland and halfway due to beneficial effects of co2 fertilization on biomass and yield however irrigated grain yield decreased up to 20 at lamesa where temperature rise suppressed the positive effects of elevated co2 unlike the projections of irrigated grain yield projections for seasonal irrigation were in the same direction at all three sites i e reduced in the future compared to the historic period this was attributed to improved water use efficiency reduced length of growing season and projected increase in rainfall under some scenarios this suggests that the historic irrigation levels at the thp could maintain historic irrigated grain yield levels in the future or even produce more yield in the milder temperature northern regions projected changes in dryland grain yield in the late century compared to the historic period fell between 34 and 71 however average projection of nine gcms indicated an increase in dryland grain yields at all three sites dryland grain yield increased by a greater extent than irrigated yield this was likely because the beneficial effects of co2 fertilization on yield and water use efficiency were greater under limited water conditions than under ample water conditions based on water use and yield high yield potential and denser roots were identified as the most suitable cc adaptive traits for both irrigated and dryland production longer grain filling duration trait increased seasonal irrigation by a greater extent than it increased yield therefore it was not recommended for the thp region similarly due to significant increase in seasonal irrigation stay green trait delayed senescence was not suggested early flowering trait benefitted irrigated production at lamesa likely due to heat stress avoidance while mixed trends were simulated across sites and cc scenarios nonetheless seasonal irrigation was lower with early flowering trait compared to the reference cultivar therefore early flowering could be recommended for warmer regions within the thp irrigated yield responses to changes in different traits were different across sites whereas seasonal irrigation water use responses to these traits were similar across the three sites
