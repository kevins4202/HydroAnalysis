10030,as the planting acreage has been expanding on salinized soils of arid and semiarid regions of northwest china it is important to understand how alfalfa dry matter dm and water use efficiency wue respond to soil salinity stress under deficit irrigation a test pit experiment with a total of twelve treatments combing three water levels of full w1 medium w2 and low irrigation w3 and four salinity levels was conducted in northwest china in 2016 and 2017 for salinity treatments salt addition rate was 0 2 4 and 6 of 0 60 cm soil dry weight referred as s0 s3 respectively soil water content swc and soil electrical conductivity ec e were measured regularly during the growth period and dm and wue for cut 2 and cut 3 of each year were presented for alfalfa dm and wue for both individual cut and the combination of the two cuts each year both water and salinity stress were found significant while the interaction was consistently insignificant dry matter and wue decreased continuously with less irrigation water and greater salinity stress in both years on average dm reduction was about 20 30 and 58 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively relative to s0 while the reduction was 21 and 34 for w2 and w2 relative to w1 simultaneous water and salinity stress had more negative effects on dm and wue than a single stress total alfalfa dm was found linearly correlated with average ec e over the growth period with r 2 larger than 0 8 suggesting that ec e is an effective predictor for estimating alfalfa yield on saline soils in the area the results are valuable in evaluating the productivity of saline soils in the region and the performance of some remedy measures keywords soil electrical conductivity soil water content deficit irrigation saline soils actual evapotranspiration 1 introduction drought is one of the most important abiotic factors limiting agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions and supplementary irrigation is often necessary to maintain a certain level of food and forage production in those regions passioura 2007 the continuous improvement of irrigated agriculture is essential to meet food demand from a rapidly growing population worldwide and is also important to ensure the sustainability of irrigated agriculture xie et al 2018 however salt accumulation in the soil is a common and serious problem faced by irrigated agriculture all over the world and land salinization would have a severe impact on the long term sustainable development of agriculture singh 2015 2016 zhang et al 2008 it has been reported that more than one third of the world s irrigated farmland is affected by land salinization or rising groundwater levels singh 2018 at present approximately 20 30mha irrigated lands are severely compromised by salt accumulation and about 0 25 0 5mha of farming land has been lost from land salinization every year tyagi 2014 for arid and semiarid regions one of the great challenges for the coming decades is to maintain or even increase food production while reducing the risk of soil salinization alfalfa medicago sativa l one of the widely grown perennial forage crops in the world is considered as a high value cash crop mainly for livestock feed because of its high protein content digestibility palatability and milk production qualities díaz et al 2018 scasta et al 2012 due to quick regrowth potential drought and cold tolerance and deep tap root system alfalfa is able to achieve high yield in arid regions bagavathiannan and van acker 2009 in addition alfalfa roots could establish a symbiotic relationship with a n2 fixing bacterium which could provide an extra source of n for the soil and plant and help increase soil organic matter and improve soil structure bourgeois et al 1990 as a result alfalfa planting acreage has been rapidly increasing in arid and semiarid regions of northwest china due to the expansion of the dairy industry in recent years at present alfalfa is the most cultivated forage crop in china with approximately 3 77 106 ha zhang et al 2018 however soil salinization and water shortage in the region are still the two most severely abiotic factors in restricting the growth of alfalfa in general saline soils can affect crop growth negatively through osmotic effects and ion toxicity parihar et al 2015 presence of salts in the soil can reduce the soil water potential which in turn adds difficulties for roots to absorb water and inhibits plant growth meanwhile excess amounts of certain ions may enter the roots which could be toxic for root development and lead to a reduction in crop productivity bernstein 1975 koyro 2006 previous studies have shown that salinity stress adversely affects growth and yield of alfalfa ashrafi et al 2018 lei et al 2018 wang et al 2017 maas and grattan 1999 reported that a 7 decline in alfalfa relative yield with each unit of salinity increase dsm 1 when soil salinity exceeded the tolerance threshold díaz et al 2018 indicated that alfalfa yield reduction was significant when soil salinity was above 5 0dsm 1 for irrigation with saline water of different salinity levels based on a 2 year study on a calcic haplosalids soil from the island of lanzarote earlier studies have reported that deficit irrigation i e application of water below full crop water requirements evapotranspiration can increase irrigation efficiency by reducing water consumption but without significantly decreasing agricultural yield when applied at an appropriate level ali et al 2017 fereres and soriano 2007 jiang et al 2012b kang et al 2000 the effects of deficit irrigation or water stress on alfalfa yield and water use efficiency wue have been widely studied for example liu et al 2018 reported that dry matter dm of two types of alfalfa cultivars was reduced by about 27 for the rain fed treatment relative to the full irrigation treatment bouizgaren et al 2013 also reported that water stress significantly decreased aboveground dm in all alfalfa varieties in their study with the reduction percentage between 24 and 43 when compared with fully irrigated treatment in terms of wue of alfalfa previous studies have shown that appropriately reducing the irrigation amount could reduce crop evapotranspiration and improve alfalfa wue hanson et al 2007 xiong et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 stated that reducing irrigation water by 11 and 22 led to the increase in the 2 year average wue of alfalfa by 13 and 23 respectively however kuslu et al 2010 indicated that alfalfa wue declined continuously with the decreasing water application with water amounts of 100 80 60 40 20 and 0 of full irrigation other studies indicated that both dm and wue of alfalfa had a curvilinear relationship with the decrease of irrigation level djaman et al 2020 found that both dm and wue were increased first and then decreased with the continuous reduction of irrigation therefore how dm or wue of alfalfa changes with the water stress level depends on the water level and other experimental conditions there were studies on the effect of the combined water and salinity stress on crop yield and wue and the results showed that the combined stress would have further adverse effects when compared to individual water or salinity stress at the same level hanci and cebeci 2015 khan et al 2016a sahin et al 2018 for instance water and salinity stress combined had more negative effects than individual stress conditions on fresh and dry weights of tomato ors et al 2021 as well as plant height leaf area and number fresh and dry root weights of cabbage sahin et al 2018 similarly sun et al 2015 reported that maize fresh and dry weights both decreased by about 30 and 35 for the combined stress treatments compared with water only and salinity only stress treatment respectively meanwhile several studies have evaluated the interaction of water and salinity stress in affecting crop yield and the results were inconsistent katerji et al 2011 ors and suarez 2017 yuan et al 2019 for example yuan et al 2019 reported there was no interaction between water and salinity stress on dry matter weight of maize when irrigation was applied with saline water at three salinity levels 0 71 3 and 6 g l 1 and three water levels 100 66 7 and 50 crop water consumption on the contrary ors et al 2021 reported that the interaction of these two stresses was significant affecting tomato fresh and dry yield when irrigation was applied every 3 days until harvest with saline water of 0 100 and 150 mm of nacl at 100 75 and 50 water consumption level apparently whether water and salinity stress were found interactive is largely depending on crop species and the range of water and salinity levels used in the study for example katerji et al 2009 reported that there was no interaction of water and salinity stress on the yield of barley when soil salinity was in the range of 0 9 9 5dsm 1 while the interaction of the two stresses was significant on faba bean productivity when salinity in the range of 1 0 10 4dsm 1 katerji et al 2011 yang et al 2019a reported that there was no interaction of water and salinity stress on tomato fresh yield when soil salinity was in the range of 0 0 4 of soil dry weight in northwest china while the interaction became significant when soil salinity range was widened to between 0 and 0 9 as mentioned above the results on the relationship between alfalfa dm or wue with water or salinity stress were mostly obtained from studies on individual water or salinity stress and whether the relationship could hold under conditions with simultaneous water and salinity stress which is common in arid and semiarid regions remains unclear also many previous studies on water stress effects on alfalfa focused on the seedling stage and salinity stress was mainly from saline water irrigation ma et al 2016 tani et al 2018 but few studies have examined the deficit irrigation effect on alfalfa growth on saline soils which is a common practice in northwest china the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of different soil salinity levels on dm and wue of alfalfa under deficit irrigation and to explore whether there was an interaction between water and salinity stress on alfalfa dm and wue and evaluate the relationship between alfalfa dm and wue with soil salinity in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university gansu province northwest china 37 52 20 n 102 50 50 e and altitude of 1581 m from may to september in 2016 and 2017 a typical continental and temperate climate is dominant in the region with cold windy winters and dry hot summers the mean annual temperature in the region is about 8 and the annual frost free period is 150 d solar radiation is plentiful in the region with a mean annual sunshine duration over 3000 h the site is limited in water resources with mean annual precipitation about 164 mm and the mean annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm the mean groundwater table is below 30 m ding et al 2013 yuan et al 2018 2 2 crop management and experimental design the experiment was conducted in test pits with each being 2 0 m wide 3 3 m long and 3 0 m deep each test pit was sealed by a 20 cm thick concrete layer at the sides and bottom to prevent mass change with the environment and the other test pits the test pit was filled with a sandy loam soil with a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 the average field capacity fc and saturated water content for 0 100 cm soil was 0 30 cm³ cm 3 and 0 37 cm³ cm 3 respectively prior to the experiment soil ec e was about 1 45 0 65dsm 1 and soil ph was about 8 1 across all pits for the experiment there were a total of 12 treatments combining three irrigation levels and four salinity levels three irrigation levels included full irrigation w1 medium irrigation w2 and low irrigation level w3 irrigation was applied when the soil water content swc averaged over 0 60 cm soil of w1 treatments reached about 65 70 fc for w1 treatment water amount applied for each irrigation event equaled the difference between the mean swc to the average fc over 0 60 cm soil for w2 and w3 treatments water was applied at the same time and the amount was two thirds 66 7 and one third 33 3 of w1 treatments respectively to maintain alfalfa survival rate irrigation treatment was not exerted until after cut 1 in both years and before that irrigation was applied uniformly for each treatment after cut 1 irrigation was applied three and four times respectively during 2016 and 2017 table 1 total irrigation amount during cut 2 period was slightly different for treatments of different salinity levels at the same water level to reflex the variation in swc between the treatments at the start of the period groundwater used for irrigation had an electrical conductivity of the saturated paste ec e around 0 65dsm 1 and the major ions in the groundwater were k na mg2 ca2 cl co3 2 so4 2 with concentrations of 9 222 61 194 138 74 919 mg kg 1 respectively jiang et al 2016a for salinity treatments the combination of nacl mgso4 and caso4 was mixed thoroughly into the 0 60 cm soil of each test pit with a mass ratio of 2 2 1 to represent the chemical composition of local soils hu et al 2012 the addition rate was 0 2 4 and 6 of dry weight of 0 60 cm soil referred as s0 s1 s2 and s3 treatment respectively hereafter to add salts into soil the specific amount of salts was dissolved in fresh water according to the salinity level for each pit 0 60 cm soil was removed and the designated amount of salt solution was mixed thoroughly with the soil before backfilling with the same bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 the mixing and backfilling were done layer by layer for each pit for each treatment there were two replicates which led to a total of 24 test pits the variety used in the study was golden empress which has strong cold tolerance with fall dormancy grades of 2 3 drought tolerance and regeneration ability shi et al 2017 the variety is considered suitable and commonly planted in arid and semiarid regions of northwest china alfalfa seed was sown in the test pits in may of 2016 with a seeding rate of 30 kg ha 1 the row spacing was 25 cm and the plant spacing was 10 cm after the planting the seeds were covered with a thin layer of fine sand a common local practice to improve the emergence rate alfalfa was replanted in 2017 with the same protocol since some alfalfa did not survive the cold winter of 2016 due to unusual weather in the winter the freeze during 2016 winter came particularly late following unusual warm days which made soil moisture content much lower than needed to prevent alfalfa from freezing to death in this experiment the emergence rate varied between different salinity treatments with 95 80 60 and 35 or so for s0 s1 s2 and s3 respectively as a result partial transplantation was carried out for s1 s3 treatments to have the same plant density as s0 treatment and seedling was transplanted when three leaves were grown chemical fertilizers were not applied in the study given that the pits had been fertilized with 375 kgha 1 of n p2o5 of 225 kgha 1 and k2o of 300 kgha 1 each year over the last 4 years before the experiment in both years soils were covered with plastic film during the first month after planting alfalfa in both years was harvested three times on july 13 august 27 and september 30 in 2016 and july 7 august 14 and september 30 in 2017 given that the irrigation treatment did not start until after cut 1 only dm and wue from cut 2 and cut 3 were presented in the study alfalfa was cut at the initial flowering period stage each time except for cut 3 in 2016 when the harvest was carried out during the late squaring stage due to the low temperature at the time 2 3 data collection the daily meteorological parameters including solar radiation rs air temperature t relative humidity rh and precipitation p were measured from a standard automatic weather station hobo onest cumputerdata corp usa at the experimental station the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the monthly average of rs t rh along with the monthly total p and et0 for each month during the growth periods in 2016 2017 was shown in fig 1 during the growth period of alfalfa in 2016 total precipitation was 109 mm 24 mm lower than in 2017 and the difference occurred mainly in july and august the other meteorological parameters including t rh rs and et0 were similar between the 2 years during the growing period of the 2 years soil samples were collected every 7 10 days from 0 to 100 cm soil at a 20 cm interval and the hole was quickly backfilled with the same type of soil one part of soil samples was used to measure swc using the gravimetric method and the other part was for measuring soil salinity specifically a 10 g air dried soil sample was ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve and then diluted with 50 ml distilled water soil electrical conductivity of 1 5 soil water extract ec 1 5 µscm 1 was measured by an electrical conductivity meter fe32 mettler toledo international inc switzerland and then converted to ec e dsm 1 with the following equation obtained from the same test pits jiang et al 2012b 1 ec e 12 04 10 3 ec 1 5 1 35 r 2 9 474 actual evapotranspiration et a for different growth periods of alfalfa was calculated based on water balance equation as 2 et a i p k d r δ w where et a was the crop actual evapotranspiration mm i was the irrigation amount mm p was precipitation mm k was the groundwater influx into the root zone mm d was the drainage mm r was surface runoff mm δw was the change of soil storage during the start and end of a growth period mm in the study k d and r were negligible therefore eq 2 was simplified as 3 et a i p δ w 4 δ w 1000 z θ 2 θ 1 where z is the measured soil depth m 0 6 m in the study θ 1 cm3 cm 3 and θ 2 cm3 cm 3 were swc in 0 60 cm soil at the start and end of a growth period at interest respectively alfalfa was harvested from two randomly selected rows from the middle six rows for each pit the harvested alfalfa was oven dried at 70 c until constant weight as dm water use efficiency wue kgm 3 was obtained for cut 2 cut 3 and the sum of two cuts separately via dividing dm kgha 1 of cut 2 cut 3 and the sum by the total et a mm during the corresponding growing period 5 wue 0 1 dm et a irrigation water use efficiency iwue kgm 3 was calculated by dividing the sum of two cuts of alfalfa dm kgha 1 by the total irrigation amount mm during the two growth periods 6 iwue 0 1 dm i 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed to compare the difference in dm and wue for each cut of the 2 years between treatments with irrigation level salinity level and the interaction between them included as the factors in the model a similar anova analysis was also conducted for comparing the difference in mean swc and ec e between treatments means were compared using duncan multiple comparison test at the significance level of 0 05 linear regression was conducted between dm and wue of cut 2 and cut 3 as well as the combined two cuts with the averaged ec e over the growth period statistical analyses were carried out using spss 25 0 spss inc usa 2011 3 results 3 1 evolution of soil water content and soil salinity over the sampling period fig 2 shows the comparisons of mean swc in 0 100 cm soil over the two cut periods between different treatments in the 2 years apparently the pattern of swc change between different treatments was similar between the 2 years for the two periods in both years water and salinity treatments were found consistently significant in affecting swc while the interaction between them was found insignificant during cut 2 and significant during cut 3 in both years p 0 05 during cut 2 in both years w1 led to higher swc than w2 and w3 for low salinity treatment of s0 and s1 while swc was similar between the three irrigation treatments for s2 and s3 the difference in swc between w1 w2 and w3 became greater during cut 3 period than cut 2 period with w1 having significantly higher swc than w3 for all cases except for s3 during 2016 meanwhile swc tended to increase with higher salinity treatments at the same irrigation level with exceptions of w1 during the two periods of 2017 when swc was highest for s0 the comparisons of the mean ec e over the 0 100 cm soil between different treatments during the two cut periods in the 2 years are presented in fig 3 water and salinity treatments consistently significantly affected ec e while the interaction between them was consistently insignificant during the two period in both years as expected soil ec e was significantly different between different salinity treatments and high salinity stress treatment had larger soil ec e during each cut of the 2 years on average during the cut 2 and cut 3 period soil ec e was 4 01 7 76 10 88 and 12 40dsm 1 in 2016 1 52 6 60 8 30 and 10 37dsm 1 in 2017 for s0 s1 s2 and s3 respectively meanwhile low irrigation level treatments led to higher soil ec e with the same salinity treatments and the difference of ec e between different irrigation levels became greater for salinity treatments of s2 and s3 during the later period in both years in both years w2 and w3 had significantly larger ec e than w1 for s3 treatment during cut 3 period 3 2 effects of water and salinity stress on dry matter actual evapotranspiration and water use efficiency total dm of alfalfa from cut 2 and cut 3 ranged from 1 86 to 7 58mgha 1 in 2016 table 2 and 2 30 7 73 mgha 1 in 2017 table 3 across different treatments and the mean total dm in 2017 was about 16 higher than in 2016 in both years dm was higher for cut 2 than cut 3 mainly due to the longer duration and higher temperature during the period the percentage of cut 2 dm to the total dm was similar for both years about 60 on average over different treatments anova results indicated that water levels and salinity levels were both consistently significant while the interaction between them was consistently not significant in affecting dm for each cut and the totals in both years tables 2 3 as a result tables 2 3 displays the comparisons of mean dm between different water levels and different salinity levels separately reducing irrigation water levels and increasing salinity levels both tended to reduce alfalfa dm for each cut and total dm in both years dry matter of w1 was significantly higher for each cut and the total than that of w2 and w3 in both years while w2 had significantly higher dm than w3 for all cases except for cut 3 dm in 2016 when dm was similar for w2 and w3 treatments on average the total dm of w1 was 28 and 43 higher in 2016 25 and 62 higher in 2017 than that of w2 and w3 respectively dry matter decreased consistently with increasing salinity levels which was true for both individual cut and the total dm dry matter was found significantly different for all pairwise comparisons of salinity treatments of s0 s3 for each cut and total dm in both years with the exception for cut 3 in 2016 when there was no significant difference in dm between s1 and s2 the salinity effect on dm was found less pronounced for the later cut in both years relative to s0 the dm reduction percentage was about 41 52 and 72 for cut 2 and 17 26 and 56 for cut 3 of s1 s2 and s3 respectively in 2017 the reduction was about 35 43 and 57 for cut 2 and 14 27 and 34 for cut 3 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively in general et a increased with higher irrigation levels and decreased with increasing salinity levels in both years tables 2 3 the water level was found consistently significant in affecting et a with the exception for cut 2 in 2016 and cut 3 in 2017 while the interaction between water and salinity levels was found insignificant for all cases in both years the sum of et a during cut 2 and cut 3 periods was significantly larger for w1 than that of w2 and w3 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference between w2 and w3 on average et a of w2 and w3 treatments was 14 and 19 lower in 2016 and 11 and 14 lower in 2017 respectively than that of w1 treatments salinity level was found significantly affecting et a only for the total et a in 2016 when s3 had significantly lower et a than s0 and s1 p 0 05 in terms of wue both water and salinity levels had significant effects for each cut and the combination of the two cuts except for cut 3 dm in 2016 when wue was similar for the three irrigation levels tables 2 3 the interaction between irrigation and salinity was found insignificant affecting wue for all cases in both years wue increased with increasing water levels and decreasing salinity levels and the pattern was similar to dm and et a in both years w1 had significantly larger wue for the whole two cut periods than w3 while the difference between either w1 and w2 or w2 and w3 was insignificant in 2016 relative to the water level salinity effects on wue were more pronounced with a much smaller p value in anova analysis treatment with no additional salt s0 consistently resulted in significantly larger wue than the other salinity treatments while there was no significant difference between s0 and s1 for cut 3 in both years high salinity treatment of s3 consistently led to smaller wue than the other treatments compared to s0 wue was reduced by 36 41 62 in 2016 and 27 38 and 49 in 2017 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively noticeably wue for cut 3 was found mostly larger than that for cut 2 for treatments of s1 s2 and s3 while for s0 the opposite was true 3 3 correlation of alfalfa dry matter and water use efficiency with mean soil electrical conductivity alfalfa dm was found linearly related to the mean ec e over the respective growth period with r 2 of linear regression larger than 0 58 for each cut in both years fig 4 the regression slope of dm with mean ec e was similar between the 2 years for both cuts and the r 2 for the regression of the total dm with mean ec e over the sampling period using the combined 2 year data was 0 84 indicating that the relationship between ec e and dm was fairly stable over the 2 years the absolute value of the regression slope was apparently larger for cut 2 than cut 3 period for both years with dm decreased by 0 30 and 0 26mgha 1 for cut 2 and 0 11 and 0 16mgha 1 for cut 3 with ec e increase of 1dsm 1 for 2016 and 2017 respectively the r 2 for the regression was also larger for cut 2 than cut 3 for both years with 0 83 and 0 85 for cut 2 and 0 72 and 0 58 for cut 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the pattern of wue changing with ec e mirrored the changing pattern of dm with ec e fig 4 water use efficiency was found linearly decreasing with increasing ec e with absolute values of the slopes and r 2 for cut 2 substantially greater than those for cut 3 regression slopes were found similar between the 2 years for each cut with ec e increase by 1dsm 1 wue would be reduced by about 0 17 kg m 3 with the combined 2 year data fig 5 displays the overall relationship of ec e and i with the relative dm and iwue defined as the ratio of dm or iwue of different treatments over the respective value from the treatment with the highest irrigation and the lowest salinity w1s0 during the sampling periods in the 2 years when ec e was lower than 5dsm 1 relative dm ranged from 0 7 to 1 0 with i ranging from 50 to 240 mm while relative dm was within the similar range of 0 7 1 0 when ec e changed from 0 to 12dsm 1 and irrigation amount was larger than 180 mm meanwhile irrigation water use efficiency changed from 0 4 to 1 0 with ec e decreasing from 12 to 0dsm 1 it appeared that reduction of i by 100 mm or increasing mean ec e by 6dsm 1 during the sampling period would have a similar effect on dm similarly the effect on iwue by increasing ec e by 6dsm 1 was similar to that by reducing i by 100 mm 4 discussion 4 1 dry matter and water use efficiency of alfalfa under different water and salinity stress as mentioned above alfalfa had to be replanted in 2017 due to unusual weather in 2016 winter and consequently the results obtained in this study were from the establishment year of alfalfa however we believe that the main conclusions e g no interaction between water and salinity stress the good relationship between dry matter with soil ec e hold for the later years of alfalfa considering that the second and third cut data rather than the first cut were used indeed the results from the same pits in the following 2 years with alfalfa planted in 2017 confirmed our main conclusions in this study unpublished which were not included in the manuscript mainly because that the treatment setup has been changed in 2018 soil water and salinity are two of the most crucial and common abiotic factors that influence plant growth and development in arid and semiarid regions worldwide alfalfa dm has not been found always declining with the increase in water or salinity stress for example ismail and almarshadi 2013 reported that alfalfa dm at cut 1 3 of the first year establishment was not significantly reduced for 85 and 70 full irrigation treatments compared to full irrigation treatment and the treatment with irrigation of about 70 full irrigation even slightly increased dm relative to the full irrigation in the study reducing irrigation amount and higher soil salinity always reduced alfalfa yield which was consistent with the results of yang et al 2019b they found that dm was significantly lower for irrigation at 60 and 30 of full irrigation level the apparent inconsistency could be attributed to the water stress level alfalfa suffered alfalfa dm might not be severely affected or even be higher with light water stress i e irrigation amount was above 70 of the full irrigation amount when irrigation level was less than 70 of full irrigation as in this study alfalfa dm was most likely reduced with the increase in water stress our results showed that dm of alfalfa decreased continuously with the increase in soil salinity level which agreed to previous results on alfalfa bertrand et al 2015 mezni et al 2012 sahin et al 2018 in addition wue in this study was found to decrease constantly with greater water and salinity stress which was likely the result from the reduction in alfalfa dm by water and salinity stress was more severe than the reduction in crop water use in arid and semiarid regions for instance relative to w1 in 2016 w2 and w3 led to the reduction of et a by 14 and 19 while dm was reduced by 22 and 30 respectively the results were consistent with those from the previous study conducted in arid regions guo et al 2016 when plants suffer the two stresses simultaneously the combined effects of water and salinity stress were showed to be more detrimental than the individual effects of single stress on crops growth and yield caliskan et al 2017 ge et al 2012 our results indicated that water and salinity stress had an additive adverse effect on alfalfa dm and wue i e alfalfa dm or wue was further reduced for treatments with both water and salinity stress relatively to treatments with either water or salinity stress at the same level for example the total dm of w3s3 was 1 15mgha 1 lower than w1s3 and 4 34mgha 1 lower than w3s0 in 2016 the result was in agreement with those from previous studies khan et al 2016b sun et al 2015 khan et al 2016b reported that soybean dm decreased sharply under the combined water and salinity stress relative to individual water or salinity stress many studies have examined whether water and salinity stress have an interactive effect on crop growth parameters and yield and the conclusions are inconsistent some studies have demonstrated that the effect from salinity stress would be more pronounced for plants suffering a greater level of water stress katerji et al 2011 ors et al 2021 while others have shown that there was no interaction between water and salinity stress on melon and alfalfa shani and dudley 2001 and maize yield yuan et al 2019 we reasoned that whether water and salinity stress were found to have significant interaction for a given crop largely depends on the range of water and salinity levels used in the study for a typical response of a crop to soil salinity without water stress crop yield likely remains unchanged or slightly increases with the soil ec e increase from 0 to a certain threshold value then starts to decline with ec e continuous increase and becomes stable at a much lower level with a further increase of ec e as shown in fig 6 groenveld et al 2013 katerji et al 2009 2011 when a crop is exposed to water and salinity stress simultaneously it is likely that the threshold value of ec e at which crop yield starts to decline becomes smaller and the yield reduction rate with the increase of ec e becomes faster fig 6 as a result the interaction of water and salinity stress is more likely found significant with a wider range of both water and salinity stress the decreasing trend of tomato fresh and dry weights under two relatively higher water level treatments 100 and 75 of water consumption was basically the same with the increase of salt stress i e there was no significant interaction between water and salinity stress ors et al 2021 in the same study the decreasing trend was significantly different for greater water stress treatment of 50 of water consumption relative to 75 and 100 water consumption treatments in other words the interaction became significant when a wide range of water stress level was included in the study 50 75 and 100 vs 75 and 100 water consumption level similarly the interaction was found insignificant on tomato fresh yield when soil salinity ranged between 0 and 0 4 but it became significant when salinity range was widened to 0 0 9 yang et al 2019a naturally the threshold value of ec e and the range within which the interaction is significant is crop specific related to the salt tolerance of the crop for instance the threshold value was about 8 0 and 1 6dsm 1 for barley and faba respectively and the reduction percentage of relative yield with the one unit dsm 1 increase in ec e was about 5 0 and 9 6 respectively allen et al 1998 for barley there was no significant interaction of water and salinity stress on yield when soil salinity was in the range of 0 9 9 5dsm 1 katerji et al 2009 while for faba the interaction was found significant with the soil salinity ranging from 1 0 to 10 4dsm 1 katerji et al 2011 we noticed that either additive or multiplicative form commonly used in crop models or soil water and solute transport models assumed that there is no interaction between water and salinity stress on root water uptake jiang et al 2016a lyu et al 2019 yang et al 2019c however the assumption was only true for a certain range of water and salinity stress to a given crop caution needs to be taken when the simulated circumstance involves severe drought and salinity conditions 4 2 responses of alfalfa dry matter and water use efficiency to soil electrical conductivity alfalfa as a moderate salinity tolerant crop was reported to be able to tolerate up to 2dsm 1 ec e on average during the entire growth period when saline water was used for irrigation with ec e above this threshold value alfalfa dm declined by about 7 3 with each unit increase of ec e maas and grattan 1999 the relationship between dm with ec e has been often used as a guideline for evaluating salinity effect on alfalfa yield however in our study alfalfa dm declined at a lower rate of about 6 6 5 1 and 6 1 with one unit increase in ec e for cut 2 3 and the total of the two cuts respectively and there was no clear evidence that the threshold value was approximately 2dsm 1 similar results have been reported by previous studies hu et al 2020 reported a similar dm decline of 6 0 with one unit increase of ec e based on a 2 year field study using the simdualkc model on saline soils with different salinity levels in northwest china the difference in the reduction percentage was partially due to the different experimental setup used in the two studies soil salt content in the study of maas and grattan 1999 was mainly from saline water used for irrigation while in this study it was mainly from added salt into the soil we suspected that soil ec e in the root zone would be relatively higher for a longer time when irrigation was applied with saline water for several times during the growing period relative to the case that salt has been added at the start of a growing period although the two scenarios lead to the similar mean ec e during the entire growing period the regression of either dm or wue with ec e had a fairly large r 2 greater than 0 58 for any cut and the r 2 was actually larger than 0 8 for total dm in both years the large r 2 suggested that ec e is a good indicator for estimating alfalfa yield on saline soils in northwest china given that there was largely no significant interaction between water and salinity stress on alfalfa dm and wue in the region either increasing irrigation level or reducing ec e to a certain level would achieve an equivalent impact on alfalfa yield or wue 5 conclusions both water and salinity stress have significant effects on dm and wue of alfalfa while the interaction between them was found insignificant both dm and wue were found consistently decreasing with an increase in soil salinity and a decrease in applied irrigation amount simultaneous water and salinity stress led to a further reduction in alfalfa dm and wue relative to individual water or salinity stress at the same level alfalfa dm and wue were negatively and linearly related to mean soil ec e during the growth period with r 2 0 5 indicating that soil ec e could be used to estimate alfalfa yield and wue on saline soils of northwest china the findings would be helpful for evaluating the performance of some proposed management measures for alfalfa yield or wue improvement on saline soils in the region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10030,as the planting acreage has been expanding on salinized soils of arid and semiarid regions of northwest china it is important to understand how alfalfa dry matter dm and water use efficiency wue respond to soil salinity stress under deficit irrigation a test pit experiment with a total of twelve treatments combing three water levels of full w1 medium w2 and low irrigation w3 and four salinity levels was conducted in northwest china in 2016 and 2017 for salinity treatments salt addition rate was 0 2 4 and 6 of 0 60 cm soil dry weight referred as s0 s3 respectively soil water content swc and soil electrical conductivity ec e were measured regularly during the growth period and dm and wue for cut 2 and cut 3 of each year were presented for alfalfa dm and wue for both individual cut and the combination of the two cuts each year both water and salinity stress were found significant while the interaction was consistently insignificant dry matter and wue decreased continuously with less irrigation water and greater salinity stress in both years on average dm reduction was about 20 30 and 58 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively relative to s0 while the reduction was 21 and 34 for w2 and w2 relative to w1 simultaneous water and salinity stress had more negative effects on dm and wue than a single stress total alfalfa dm was found linearly correlated with average ec e over the growth period with r 2 larger than 0 8 suggesting that ec e is an effective predictor for estimating alfalfa yield on saline soils in the area the results are valuable in evaluating the productivity of saline soils in the region and the performance of some remedy measures keywords soil electrical conductivity soil water content deficit irrigation saline soils actual evapotranspiration 1 introduction drought is one of the most important abiotic factors limiting agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions and supplementary irrigation is often necessary to maintain a certain level of food and forage production in those regions passioura 2007 the continuous improvement of irrigated agriculture is essential to meet food demand from a rapidly growing population worldwide and is also important to ensure the sustainability of irrigated agriculture xie et al 2018 however salt accumulation in the soil is a common and serious problem faced by irrigated agriculture all over the world and land salinization would have a severe impact on the long term sustainable development of agriculture singh 2015 2016 zhang et al 2008 it has been reported that more than one third of the world s irrigated farmland is affected by land salinization or rising groundwater levels singh 2018 at present approximately 20 30mha irrigated lands are severely compromised by salt accumulation and about 0 25 0 5mha of farming land has been lost from land salinization every year tyagi 2014 for arid and semiarid regions one of the great challenges for the coming decades is to maintain or even increase food production while reducing the risk of soil salinization alfalfa medicago sativa l one of the widely grown perennial forage crops in the world is considered as a high value cash crop mainly for livestock feed because of its high protein content digestibility palatability and milk production qualities díaz et al 2018 scasta et al 2012 due to quick regrowth potential drought and cold tolerance and deep tap root system alfalfa is able to achieve high yield in arid regions bagavathiannan and van acker 2009 in addition alfalfa roots could establish a symbiotic relationship with a n2 fixing bacterium which could provide an extra source of n for the soil and plant and help increase soil organic matter and improve soil structure bourgeois et al 1990 as a result alfalfa planting acreage has been rapidly increasing in arid and semiarid regions of northwest china due to the expansion of the dairy industry in recent years at present alfalfa is the most cultivated forage crop in china with approximately 3 77 106 ha zhang et al 2018 however soil salinization and water shortage in the region are still the two most severely abiotic factors in restricting the growth of alfalfa in general saline soils can affect crop growth negatively through osmotic effects and ion toxicity parihar et al 2015 presence of salts in the soil can reduce the soil water potential which in turn adds difficulties for roots to absorb water and inhibits plant growth meanwhile excess amounts of certain ions may enter the roots which could be toxic for root development and lead to a reduction in crop productivity bernstein 1975 koyro 2006 previous studies have shown that salinity stress adversely affects growth and yield of alfalfa ashrafi et al 2018 lei et al 2018 wang et al 2017 maas and grattan 1999 reported that a 7 decline in alfalfa relative yield with each unit of salinity increase dsm 1 when soil salinity exceeded the tolerance threshold díaz et al 2018 indicated that alfalfa yield reduction was significant when soil salinity was above 5 0dsm 1 for irrigation with saline water of different salinity levels based on a 2 year study on a calcic haplosalids soil from the island of lanzarote earlier studies have reported that deficit irrigation i e application of water below full crop water requirements evapotranspiration can increase irrigation efficiency by reducing water consumption but without significantly decreasing agricultural yield when applied at an appropriate level ali et al 2017 fereres and soriano 2007 jiang et al 2012b kang et al 2000 the effects of deficit irrigation or water stress on alfalfa yield and water use efficiency wue have been widely studied for example liu et al 2018 reported that dry matter dm of two types of alfalfa cultivars was reduced by about 27 for the rain fed treatment relative to the full irrigation treatment bouizgaren et al 2013 also reported that water stress significantly decreased aboveground dm in all alfalfa varieties in their study with the reduction percentage between 24 and 43 when compared with fully irrigated treatment in terms of wue of alfalfa previous studies have shown that appropriately reducing the irrigation amount could reduce crop evapotranspiration and improve alfalfa wue hanson et al 2007 xiong et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 stated that reducing irrigation water by 11 and 22 led to the increase in the 2 year average wue of alfalfa by 13 and 23 respectively however kuslu et al 2010 indicated that alfalfa wue declined continuously with the decreasing water application with water amounts of 100 80 60 40 20 and 0 of full irrigation other studies indicated that both dm and wue of alfalfa had a curvilinear relationship with the decrease of irrigation level djaman et al 2020 found that both dm and wue were increased first and then decreased with the continuous reduction of irrigation therefore how dm or wue of alfalfa changes with the water stress level depends on the water level and other experimental conditions there were studies on the effect of the combined water and salinity stress on crop yield and wue and the results showed that the combined stress would have further adverse effects when compared to individual water or salinity stress at the same level hanci and cebeci 2015 khan et al 2016a sahin et al 2018 for instance water and salinity stress combined had more negative effects than individual stress conditions on fresh and dry weights of tomato ors et al 2021 as well as plant height leaf area and number fresh and dry root weights of cabbage sahin et al 2018 similarly sun et al 2015 reported that maize fresh and dry weights both decreased by about 30 and 35 for the combined stress treatments compared with water only and salinity only stress treatment respectively meanwhile several studies have evaluated the interaction of water and salinity stress in affecting crop yield and the results were inconsistent katerji et al 2011 ors and suarez 2017 yuan et al 2019 for example yuan et al 2019 reported there was no interaction between water and salinity stress on dry matter weight of maize when irrigation was applied with saline water at three salinity levels 0 71 3 and 6 g l 1 and three water levels 100 66 7 and 50 crop water consumption on the contrary ors et al 2021 reported that the interaction of these two stresses was significant affecting tomato fresh and dry yield when irrigation was applied every 3 days until harvest with saline water of 0 100 and 150 mm of nacl at 100 75 and 50 water consumption level apparently whether water and salinity stress were found interactive is largely depending on crop species and the range of water and salinity levels used in the study for example katerji et al 2009 reported that there was no interaction of water and salinity stress on the yield of barley when soil salinity was in the range of 0 9 9 5dsm 1 while the interaction of the two stresses was significant on faba bean productivity when salinity in the range of 1 0 10 4dsm 1 katerji et al 2011 yang et al 2019a reported that there was no interaction of water and salinity stress on tomato fresh yield when soil salinity was in the range of 0 0 4 of soil dry weight in northwest china while the interaction became significant when soil salinity range was widened to between 0 and 0 9 as mentioned above the results on the relationship between alfalfa dm or wue with water or salinity stress were mostly obtained from studies on individual water or salinity stress and whether the relationship could hold under conditions with simultaneous water and salinity stress which is common in arid and semiarid regions remains unclear also many previous studies on water stress effects on alfalfa focused on the seedling stage and salinity stress was mainly from saline water irrigation ma et al 2016 tani et al 2018 but few studies have examined the deficit irrigation effect on alfalfa growth on saline soils which is a common practice in northwest china the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of different soil salinity levels on dm and wue of alfalfa under deficit irrigation and to explore whether there was an interaction between water and salinity stress on alfalfa dm and wue and evaluate the relationship between alfalfa dm and wue with soil salinity in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university gansu province northwest china 37 52 20 n 102 50 50 e and altitude of 1581 m from may to september in 2016 and 2017 a typical continental and temperate climate is dominant in the region with cold windy winters and dry hot summers the mean annual temperature in the region is about 8 and the annual frost free period is 150 d solar radiation is plentiful in the region with a mean annual sunshine duration over 3000 h the site is limited in water resources with mean annual precipitation about 164 mm and the mean annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm the mean groundwater table is below 30 m ding et al 2013 yuan et al 2018 2 2 crop management and experimental design the experiment was conducted in test pits with each being 2 0 m wide 3 3 m long and 3 0 m deep each test pit was sealed by a 20 cm thick concrete layer at the sides and bottom to prevent mass change with the environment and the other test pits the test pit was filled with a sandy loam soil with a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 the average field capacity fc and saturated water content for 0 100 cm soil was 0 30 cm³ cm 3 and 0 37 cm³ cm 3 respectively prior to the experiment soil ec e was about 1 45 0 65dsm 1 and soil ph was about 8 1 across all pits for the experiment there were a total of 12 treatments combining three irrigation levels and four salinity levels three irrigation levels included full irrigation w1 medium irrigation w2 and low irrigation level w3 irrigation was applied when the soil water content swc averaged over 0 60 cm soil of w1 treatments reached about 65 70 fc for w1 treatment water amount applied for each irrigation event equaled the difference between the mean swc to the average fc over 0 60 cm soil for w2 and w3 treatments water was applied at the same time and the amount was two thirds 66 7 and one third 33 3 of w1 treatments respectively to maintain alfalfa survival rate irrigation treatment was not exerted until after cut 1 in both years and before that irrigation was applied uniformly for each treatment after cut 1 irrigation was applied three and four times respectively during 2016 and 2017 table 1 total irrigation amount during cut 2 period was slightly different for treatments of different salinity levels at the same water level to reflex the variation in swc between the treatments at the start of the period groundwater used for irrigation had an electrical conductivity of the saturated paste ec e around 0 65dsm 1 and the major ions in the groundwater were k na mg2 ca2 cl co3 2 so4 2 with concentrations of 9 222 61 194 138 74 919 mg kg 1 respectively jiang et al 2016a for salinity treatments the combination of nacl mgso4 and caso4 was mixed thoroughly into the 0 60 cm soil of each test pit with a mass ratio of 2 2 1 to represent the chemical composition of local soils hu et al 2012 the addition rate was 0 2 4 and 6 of dry weight of 0 60 cm soil referred as s0 s1 s2 and s3 treatment respectively hereafter to add salts into soil the specific amount of salts was dissolved in fresh water according to the salinity level for each pit 0 60 cm soil was removed and the designated amount of salt solution was mixed thoroughly with the soil before backfilling with the same bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 the mixing and backfilling were done layer by layer for each pit for each treatment there were two replicates which led to a total of 24 test pits the variety used in the study was golden empress which has strong cold tolerance with fall dormancy grades of 2 3 drought tolerance and regeneration ability shi et al 2017 the variety is considered suitable and commonly planted in arid and semiarid regions of northwest china alfalfa seed was sown in the test pits in may of 2016 with a seeding rate of 30 kg ha 1 the row spacing was 25 cm and the plant spacing was 10 cm after the planting the seeds were covered with a thin layer of fine sand a common local practice to improve the emergence rate alfalfa was replanted in 2017 with the same protocol since some alfalfa did not survive the cold winter of 2016 due to unusual weather in the winter the freeze during 2016 winter came particularly late following unusual warm days which made soil moisture content much lower than needed to prevent alfalfa from freezing to death in this experiment the emergence rate varied between different salinity treatments with 95 80 60 and 35 or so for s0 s1 s2 and s3 respectively as a result partial transplantation was carried out for s1 s3 treatments to have the same plant density as s0 treatment and seedling was transplanted when three leaves were grown chemical fertilizers were not applied in the study given that the pits had been fertilized with 375 kgha 1 of n p2o5 of 225 kgha 1 and k2o of 300 kgha 1 each year over the last 4 years before the experiment in both years soils were covered with plastic film during the first month after planting alfalfa in both years was harvested three times on july 13 august 27 and september 30 in 2016 and july 7 august 14 and september 30 in 2017 given that the irrigation treatment did not start until after cut 1 only dm and wue from cut 2 and cut 3 were presented in the study alfalfa was cut at the initial flowering period stage each time except for cut 3 in 2016 when the harvest was carried out during the late squaring stage due to the low temperature at the time 2 3 data collection the daily meteorological parameters including solar radiation rs air temperature t relative humidity rh and precipitation p were measured from a standard automatic weather station hobo onest cumputerdata corp usa at the experimental station the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the monthly average of rs t rh along with the monthly total p and et0 for each month during the growth periods in 2016 2017 was shown in fig 1 during the growth period of alfalfa in 2016 total precipitation was 109 mm 24 mm lower than in 2017 and the difference occurred mainly in july and august the other meteorological parameters including t rh rs and et0 were similar between the 2 years during the growing period of the 2 years soil samples were collected every 7 10 days from 0 to 100 cm soil at a 20 cm interval and the hole was quickly backfilled with the same type of soil one part of soil samples was used to measure swc using the gravimetric method and the other part was for measuring soil salinity specifically a 10 g air dried soil sample was ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve and then diluted with 50 ml distilled water soil electrical conductivity of 1 5 soil water extract ec 1 5 µscm 1 was measured by an electrical conductivity meter fe32 mettler toledo international inc switzerland and then converted to ec e dsm 1 with the following equation obtained from the same test pits jiang et al 2012b 1 ec e 12 04 10 3 ec 1 5 1 35 r 2 9 474 actual evapotranspiration et a for different growth periods of alfalfa was calculated based on water balance equation as 2 et a i p k d r δ w where et a was the crop actual evapotranspiration mm i was the irrigation amount mm p was precipitation mm k was the groundwater influx into the root zone mm d was the drainage mm r was surface runoff mm δw was the change of soil storage during the start and end of a growth period mm in the study k d and r were negligible therefore eq 2 was simplified as 3 et a i p δ w 4 δ w 1000 z θ 2 θ 1 where z is the measured soil depth m 0 6 m in the study θ 1 cm3 cm 3 and θ 2 cm3 cm 3 were swc in 0 60 cm soil at the start and end of a growth period at interest respectively alfalfa was harvested from two randomly selected rows from the middle six rows for each pit the harvested alfalfa was oven dried at 70 c until constant weight as dm water use efficiency wue kgm 3 was obtained for cut 2 cut 3 and the sum of two cuts separately via dividing dm kgha 1 of cut 2 cut 3 and the sum by the total et a mm during the corresponding growing period 5 wue 0 1 dm et a irrigation water use

analysis of variance anova was performed to compare the difference in dm and wue for each cut of the 2 years between treatments with irrigation level salinity level and the interaction between them included as the factors in the model a similar anova analysis was also conducted for comparing the difference in mean swc and ec e between treatments means were compared using duncan multiple comparison test at the significance level of 0 05 linear regression was conducted between dm and wue of cut 2 and cut 3 as well as the combined two cuts with the averaged ec e over the growth period statistical analyses were carried out using spss 25 0 spss inc usa 2011 3 results 3 1 evolution of soil water content and soil salinity over the sampling period fig 2 shows the comparisons of mean swc in 0 100 cm soil over the two cut periods between different treatments in the 2 years apparently the pattern of swc change between different treatments was similar between the 2 years for the two periods in both years water and salinity treatments were found consistently significant in affecting swc while the interaction between them was found insignificant during cut 2 and significant during cut 3 in both years p 0 05 during cut 2 in both years w1 led to higher swc than w2 and w3 for low salinity treatment of s0 and s1 while swc was similar between the three irrigation treatments for s2 and s3 the difference in swc between w1 w2 and w3 became greater during cut 3 period than cut 2 period with w1 having significantly higher swc than w3 for all cases except for s3 during 2016 meanwhile swc tended to increase with higher salinity treatments at the same irrigation level with exceptions of w1 during the two periods of 2017 when swc was highest for s0 the comparisons of the mean ec e over the 0 100 cm soil between different treatments during the two cut periods in the 2 years are presented in fig 3 water and salinity treatments consistently significantly affected ec e while the interaction between them was consistently insignificant during the two period in both years as expected soil ec e was significantly different between different salinity treatments and high salinity stress treatment had larger soil ec e during each cut of the 2 years on average during the cut 2 and cut 3 period soil ec e was 4 01 7 76 10 88 and 12 40dsm 1 in 2016 1 52 6 60 8 30 and 10 37dsm 1 in 2017 for s0 s1 s2 and s3 respectively meanwhile low irrigation level treatments led to higher soil ec e with the same salinity treatments and the difference of ec e between different irrigation levels became greater for salinity treatments of s2 and s3 during the later period in both years in both years w2 and w3 had significantly larger ec e than w1 for s3 treatment during cut 3 period 3 2 effects of water and salinity stress on dry matter actual evapotranspiration and water use efficiency total dm of alfalfa from cut 2 and cut 3 ranged from 1 86 to 7 58mgha 1 in 2016 table 2 and 2 30 7 73 mgha 1 in 2017 table 3 across different treatments and the mean total dm in 2017 was about 16 higher than in 2016 in both years dm was higher for cut 2 than cut 3 mainly due to the longer duration and higher temperature during the period the percentage of cut 2 dm to the total dm was similar for both years about 60 on average over different treatments anova results indicated that water levels and salinity levels were both consistently significant while the interaction between them was consistently not significant in affecting dm for each cut and the totals in both years tables 2 3 as a result tables 2 3 displays the comparisons of mean dm between different water levels and different salinity levels separately reducing irrigation water levels and increasing salinity levels both tended to reduce alfalfa dm for each cut and total dm in both years dry matter of w1 was significantly higher for each cut and the total than that of w2 and w3 in both years while w2 had significantly higher dm than w3 for all cases except for cut 3 dm in 2016 when dm was similar for w2 and w3 treatments on average the total dm of w1 was 28 and 43 higher in 2016 25 and 62 higher in 2017 than that of w2 and w3 respectively dry matter decreased consistently with increasing salinity levels which was true for both individual cut and the total dm dry matter was found significantly different for all pairwise comparisons of salinity treatments of s0 s3 for each cut and total dm in both years with the exception for cut 3 in 2016 when there was no significant difference in dm between s1 and s2 the salinity effect on dm was found less pronounced for the later cut in both years relative to s0 the dm reduction percentage was about 41 52 and 72 for cut 2 and 17 26 and 56 for cut 3 of s1 s2 and s3 respectively in 2017 the reduction was about 35 43 and 57 for cut 2 and 14 27 and 34 for cut 3 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively in general et a increased with higher irrigation levels and decreased with increasing salinity levels in both years tables 2 3 the water level was found consistently significant in affecting et a with the exception for cut 2 in 2016 and cut 3 in 2017 while the interaction between water and salinity levels was found insignificant for all cases in both years the sum of et a during cut 2 and cut 3 periods was significantly larger for w1 than that of w2 and w3 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference between w2 and w3 on average et a of w2 and w3 treatments was 14 and 19 lower in 2016 and 11 and 14 lower in 2017 respectively than that of w1 treatments salinity level was found significantly affecting et a only for the total et a in 2016 when s3 had significantly lower et a than s0 and s1 p 0 05 in terms of wue both water and salinity levels had significant effects for each cut and the combination of the two cuts except for cut 3 dm in 2016 when wue was similar for the three irrigation levels tables 2 3 the interaction between irrigation and salinity was found insignificant affecting wue for all cases in both years wue increased with increasing water levels and decreasing salinity levels and the pattern was similar to dm and et a in both years w1 had significantly larger wue for the whole two cut periods than w3 while the difference between either w1 and w2 or w2 and w3 was insignificant in 2016 relative to the water level salinity effects on wue were more pronounced with a much smaller p value in anova analysis treatment with no additional salt s0 consistently resulted in significantly larger wue than the other salinity treatments while there was no significant difference between s0 and s1 for cut 3 in both years high salinity treatment of s3 consistently led to smaller wue than the other treatments compared to s0 wue was reduced by 36 41 62 in 2016 and 27 38 and 49 in 2017 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively noticeably wue for cut 3 was found mostly larger than that for cut 2 for treatments of s1 s2 and s3 while for s0 the opposite was true 3 3 correlation of alfalfa dry matter and water use efficiency with mean soil electrical conductivity alfalfa dm was found linearly related to the mean ec e over the respective growth period with r 2 of linear regression larger than 0 58 for each cut in both years fig 4 the regression slope of dm with mean ec e was similar between the 2 years for both cuts and the r 2 for the regression of the total dm with mean ec e over the sampling period using the combined 2 year data was 0 84 indicating that the relationship between ec e and dm was fairly stable over the 2 years the absolute value of the regression slope was apparently larger for cut 2 than cut 3 period for both years with dm decreased by 0 30 and 0 26mgha 1 for cut 2 and 0 11 and 0 16mgha 1 for cut 3 with ec e increase of 1dsm 1 for 2016 and 2017 respectively the r 2 for the regression was also larger for cut 2 than cut 3 for both years with 0 83 and 0 85 for cut 2 and 0 72 and 0 58 for cut 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the pattern of wue changing with ec e mirrored the changing pattern of dm with ec e fig 4 water use efficiency was found linearly decreasing with increasing ec e with absolute values of the slopes and r 2 for cut 2 substantially greater than those for cut 3 regression slopes were found similar between the 2 years for each cut with ec e increase by 1dsm 1 wue would be reduced by about 0 17 kg m 3 with the combined 2 year data fig 5 displays the overall relationship of ec e and i with the relative dm and iwue defined as the ratio of dm or iwue of different treatments over the respective value from the treatment with the highest irrigation and the lowest salinity w1s0 during the sampling periods in the 2 years when ec e was lower than 5dsm 1 relative dm ranged from 0 7 to 1 0 with i ranging from 50 to 240 mm while relative dm was within the similar range of 0 7 1 0 when ec e changed from 0 to 12dsm 1 and irrigation amount was larger than 180 mm meanwhile irrigation water use efficiency changed from 0 4 to 1 0 with ec e decreasing from 12 to 0dsm 1 it appeared that reduction of i by 100 mm or increasing mean ec e by 6dsm 1 during the sampling period would have a similar effect on dm similarly the effect on iwue by increasing ec e by 6dsm 1 was similar to that by reducing i by 100 mm 4 discussion 4 1 dry matter and water use efficiency of alfalfa under different water and salinity stress as mentioned above alfalfa had to be replanted in 2017 due to unusual weather in 2016 winter and consequently the results obtained in this study were from the establishment year of alfalfa however we believe that the main conclusions e g no interaction between water and salinity stress the good relationship between dry matter with soil ec e hold for the later years of alfalfa considering that the second and third cut data rather than the first cut were used indeed the results from the same pits in the following 2 years with alfalfa planted in 2017 confirmed our main conclusions in this study unpublished which were not included in the manuscript mainly because that the treatment setup has been changed in 2018 soil water and salinity are two of the most crucial and common abiotic factors that influence plant growth and development in arid and semiarid regions worldwide alfalfa dm has not been found always declining with the increase in water or salinity stress for example ismail and almarshadi 2013 reported that alfalfa dm at cut 1 3 of the first year establishment was not significantly reduced for 85 and 70 full irrigation treatments compared to full irrigation treatment and the treatment with irrigation of about 70 full irrigation even slightly increased dm relative to the full irrigation in the study reducing irrigation amount and higher soil salinity always reduced alfalfa yield which was consistent with the results of yang et al 2019b they found that dm was significantly lower for irrigation at 60 and 30 of full irrigation level the apparent inconsistency could be attributed to the water stress level alfalfa suffered alfalfa dm might not be severely affected or even be higher with light water stress i e irrigation amount was above 70 of the full irrigation amount when irrigation level was less than 70 of full irrigation as in this study alfalfa dm was most likely reduced with the increase in water stress our results showed that dm of alfalfa decreased continuously with the increase in soil salinity level which agreed to previous results on alfalfa bertrand et al 2015 mezni et al 2012 sahin et al 2018 in addition wue in this study was found to decrease constantly with greater water and salinity stress which was likely the result from the reduction in alfalfa dm by water and salinity stress was more severe than the reduction in crop water use in arid and semiarid regions for instance relative to w1 in 2016 w2 and w3 led to the reduction of et a by 14 and 19 while dm was reduced by 22 and 30 respectively the results were consistent with those from the previous study conducted in arid regions guo et al 2016 when plants suffer the two stresses simultaneously the combined effects of water and salinity stress were showed to be more detrimental than the individual effects of single stress on crops growth and yield caliskan et al 2017 ge et al 2012 our results indicated that water and salinity stress had an additive adverse effect on alfalfa dm and wue i e alfalfa dm or wue was further reduced for treatments with both water and salinity stress relatively to treatments with either water or salinity stress at the same level for example the total dm of w3s3 was 1 15mgha 1 lower than w1s3 and 4 34mgha 1 lower than w3s0 in 2016 the result was in agreement with those from previous studies khan et al 2016b sun et al 2015 khan et al 2016b reported that soybean dm decreased sharply under the combined water and salinity stress relative to individual water or salinity stress many studies have examined whether water and salinity stress have an interactive effect on crop growth parameters and yield and the conclusions are inconsistent some studies have demonstrated that the effect from salinity stress would be more pronounced for plants suffering a greater level of water stress katerji et al 2011 ors et al 2021 while others have shown that there was no interaction between water and salinity stress on melon and alfalfa shani and dudley 2001 and maize yield yuan et al 2019 we reasoned that whether water and salinity stress were found to have significant interaction for a given crop largely depends on the range of water and salinity levels used in the study for a typical response of a crop to soil salinity without water stress crop yield likely remains unchanged or slightly increases with the soil ec e increase from 0 to a certain threshold value then starts to decline with ec e continuous increase and becomes stable at a much lower level with a further increase of ec e as shown in fig 6 groenveld et al 2013 katerji et al 2009 2011 when a crop is exposed to water and salinity stress simultaneously it is likely that the threshold value of ec e at which crop yield starts to decline becomes smaller and the yield reduction rate with the increase of ec e becomes faster fig 6 as a result the interaction of water and salinity stress is more likely found significant with a wider range of both water and salinity stress the decreasing trend of tomato fresh and dry weights under two relatively higher water level treatments 100 and 75 of water consumption was basically the same with the increase of salt stress i e there was no significant interaction between water and salinity stress ors et al 2021 in the same study the decreasing trend was significantly different for greater water stress treatment of 50 of water consumption relative to 75 and 100 water consumption treatments in other words the interaction became significant when a wide range of water stress level was included in the study 50 75 and 100 vs 75 and 100 water consumption level similarly the interaction was found insignificant on tomato fresh yield when soil salinity ranged between 0 and 0 4 but it became significant when salinity range was widened to 0 0 9 yang et al 2019a naturally the threshold value of ec e and the range within which the interaction is significant is crop specific related to the salt tolerance of the crop for instance the threshold value was about 8 0 and 1 6dsm 1 for barley and faba respectively and the reduction percentage of relative yield with the one unit dsm 1 increase in ec e was about 5 0 and 9 6 respectively allen et al 1998 for barley there was no significant interaction of water and salinity stress on yield when soil salinity was in the range of 0 9 9 5dsm 1 katerji et al 2009 while for faba the interaction was found significant with the soil salinity ranging from 1 0 to 10 4dsm 1 katerji et al 2011 we noticed that either additive or multiplicative form commonly used in crop models or soil water and solute transport models assumed that there is no interaction between water and salinity stress on root water uptake jiang et al 2016a lyu et al 2019 yang et al 2019c however the assumption was only true for a certain range of water and salinity stress to a given crop caution needs to be taken when the simulated circumstance involves severe drought and salinity conditions 4 2 responses of alfalfa dry matter and water use efficiency to soil electrical conductivity alfalfa as a moderate salinity tolerant crop was reported to be able to tolerate up to 2dsm 1 ec e on average during the entire growth period when saline water was used for irrigation with ec e above this threshold value alfalfa dm declined by about 7 3 with each unit increase of ec e maas and grattan 1999 the relationship between dm with ec e has been often used as a guideline for evaluating salinity effect on alfalfa yield however in our study alfalfa dm declined at a lower rate of about 6 6 5 1 and 6 1 with one unit increase in ec e for cut 2 3 and the total of the two cuts respectively and there was no clear evidence that the threshold value was approximately 2dsm 1 similar results have been reported by previous studies hu et al 2020 reported a similar dm decline of 6 0 with one unit increase of ec e based on a 2 year field study using the simdualkc model on saline soils with different salinity levels in northwest china the difference in the reduction percentage was partially due to the different experimental setup used in the two studies soil salt content in the study of maas and grattan 1999 was mainly from saline water used for irrigation while in this study it was mainly from added salt into the soil we suspected that soil ec e in the root zone would be relatively higher for a longer time when irrigation was applied with saline water for several times during the growing period relative to the case that salt has been added at the start of a growing period although the two scenarios lead to the similar mean ec e during the entire growing period the regression of either dm or wue with ec e had a fairly large r 2 greater than 0 58 for any cut and the r 2 was actually larger than 0 8 for total dm in both years the large r 2 suggested that ec e is a good indicator for estimating alfalfa yield on saline soils in northwest china given that there was largely no significant interaction between water and salinity stress on alfalfa dm and wue in the region either increasing irrigation level or reducing ec e to a certain level would achieve an equivalent impact on alfalfa yield or wue 5 conclusions both water and salinity stress have significant effects on dm and wue of alfalfa while the interaction between them was found insignificant both dm and wue were found consistently decreasing with an increase in soil salinity and a decrease in applied irrigation amount simultaneous water and salinity stress led to a further reduction in alfalfa dm and wue relative to individual water or salinity stress at the same level alfalfa dm and wue were negatively and linearly related to mean soil ec e during the growth period with r 2 0 5 indicating that soil ec e could be used to estimate alfalfa yield and wue on saline soils of northwest china the findings would be helpful for evaluating the performance of some proposed management measures for alfalfa yield or wue improvement on saline soils in the region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10031,tillage combined with straw mulching is an effective water saving agricultural strategy in eastern central china a two year field experiment with four treatments including conventional tillage ct conventional tillage with straw mulching ct s no tillage nt and no tillage with straw mulching nt s was conducted on semihydromorphic soil the objective was to investigate how tillage with straw mulching affected the soil temperature water consumption photosynthetic rate pn grain yield soil temperature use efficiency tue and water productivity wp in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system the results indicated that straw mulching tended to increase the soil temperature before the wheat regreening stage and decrease the soil temperature during the following wheat growing season and throughout the maize growing season compared with ct the soil effective accumulated temperature eat under the nt s treatment significantly decreased by 4 8 but the annual et increased by 4 3 in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the pn and transpiration rate tr at the anthesis stage of wheat under the nt s treatment increased by 15 2 and 15 6 respectively and the leaf water use efficiency lwue during the growing season of maize increased by 11 3 as compared with that under ct treatment wheat yields decreased in the order of nt s nt ct and ct s during both experimental years and the average yield of maize under the nt s treatment increased by 27 2 compared with that under ct additionally wp values under the nt s treatment during both the wheat and maize seasons were 7 0 and 21 8 higher than those of the ct treatment p 0 05 respectively the annual yield tue and wp values under the nt s treatment were much higher than those under the other treatments therefore nt s treatment has a positive effect on yield and hydrothermal resource utilization in semihydromorphic soil in eastern central china keywords tillage with straw mulching soil temperature soil water consumption photosynthetic rate winter wheat summer maize rotation system 1 introduction the production of winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l plays an important role in food security in china where the sown areas of winter wheat and summer maize reached 24 2 and 35 4 million ha in 2016 respectively national statistical bureau of china 2017 henan province is one of the most important wheat and maize production regions in china with the primary plant pattern being the winter wheat summer maize rotation system however crop production in this region is currently limited by a water shortage caused by seasonal drought and the space time dislocation between precipitation supply and crop demand especially for winter wheat wu et al 2003 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 additionally excessive soil evaporation under traditional tillage treatments in henan province can deteriorate drought conditions zhang et al 2017 leading to a low water productivity no tillage combined with straw mulching has been considered an advanced agronomic technique to improve the soil structure six et al 2002 madari et al 2005 mohanty et al 2007 guo et al 2017 reduce soil water evaporation borghei et al 2008 cullum 2012 shao et al 2016 increase soil moisture schuller et al 2007 de vita et al 2007 and enhance the yield of wheat and maize and wue fuentes et al 2003 de vita et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 in rain fed regions compared with no tillage no tillage with straw mulching significantly increased the gain yield and wue lv et al 2010 yang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 because straw mulching decreased the soil evaporation loss from the soil surface chen et al 2007 dong et al 2018 reduced the surface runoff and increased the soil water infiltration baumhardt and lascano 1996 prosdocimi et al 2016 however compared with either no tillage or conservational tillage several studies found that the grain yield under no tillage with straw mulching decreased due to less effective water or lower soil temperature josa and agnès 2005 lv et al 2010 yang et al 2018 lower temperatures often delay seed germination slow crop seedling growth and may ultimately may reduce the yields of wheat and maize andrade et al 2010 dam et al 2005 gao et al 2009 however some results found that no tillage with straw mulching only decreased the soil temperature at noon and increased the soil temperature in the morning and evening decreasing the daily range of the soil temperature which is beneficial to crop yield especially under frost damage conditions kang et al 1999 liu et al 2005 a better understanding of the mechanism by which no tillage with straw mulching affects the soil temperature and improves the crop yield will be significant for developing water saving agriculture in henan province however most previous studies have focused on the effects of tillage on soil temperature dynamics the soil accumulated temperature and the accumulated temperature use efficiency during the crop growing stages in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system have not been adequately evaluated in practice tillage and mulching methods not only modify the soil hydrothermal conditions but also affect the photosynthetic characteristics of wheat and maize chen and hao 2015 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 photosynthesis is an important method for crop grain yield formation because 90 of crop production comes from photosynthetic matter liu et al 2012 some studies reported that no tillage with straw mulching enhanced wheat and maize s net photosynthesis rate pn and the final grain yield of wheat and maize in dry regions wang et al 2013 liu et al 2019 liu 2019 however yang et al 2018 found that no tillage combined with mulching reduced the pn of wheat leaves in the filling stage in brown loess soil compared with conventional tillage for the winter wheat summer maize rotation system conservation tillage and straw mulching increased the annual yield zhao et al 2014 yang et al 2017 ding et al 2018 however few studies have investigated how to improve the annual yield by comprehensively analyzing the dynamics of soil temperature water consumption and photosynthetic characteristics in winter wheat summer maize rotation systems moreover little information is available on the resource utilization of water soil temperature and light under tillage and mulching methods in winter maize rotation systems it was hypothesized that no tillage combined with straw mulching could improve resource utilization in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the objectives of this study were to i investigate characteristics of the soil temperature dynamic soil effective accumulated temperature and water consumption under different tillage methods ii identify the photosynthetic characteristics under different tillage methods and iii assess the effects of different tillage methods on crop yields and hydrothermal resource utilization in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system in henan province 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted from october 2014 to september 2016 at the tongxu long term experimental

design there were four tillage treatments including conventional tillage ct conventional tillage with straw mulching ct s no tillage nt and no tillage with straw mulching nt s randomly distributed in plots with three replicates for the ct treatment plowing with a rotavator and disc harrowing was used with a 15 cm tillage depth bai et al 2020 nt had no other tillage measures but disc harrowing was used before planting winter wheat wheat residues were removed after harvesting the ct s and nt s groups had the same tillage measures as ct and nt respectively and the soil surfaces of their plots

with the tillage practice soil depth and crop growing season figs 2 and 3 the average soil temperature of 0 25 cm was increased by straw mulching compared to the no mulching treatment at the tillering and wintering stages of wheat in 2015 2016 the average soil temperature of 0 25 cm under the ct s and nt s treatments was 66 7 and 83 3 at the tillering stage respectively which was significantly higher than that under ct at the wintering stage of wheat the values under the ct s and nt s treatments increased by 37 5 and 87 5 respectively compared with those under ct however the average soil temperature of 0 25 cm under the nt treatment was 25 lower than that under ct at the wintering stage of wheat during the growing stages of maize the average soil temperature under the nt s and nt treatments decreased by 46 3 and 22 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared with that under ct fig 3 3 1 2 soil effective accumulated temperature the soil effective accumulated temperature eat of wheat and maize in response to tillage varied with air temperature and days of crop growth table 1 on average the soil eat under the ct s nt and nt s treatments decreased during the whole growing season of winter wheat compared with that under ct in 2014 2015 the soil eat under the ct s nt and nt s treatments was 6 1 10 9 and 8 5 lower than that under ct respectively p 0 05 table 1 these values were not significantly different at the emergency seedling and tillering wintering stages of wheat among the four tillage methods however the values of eat under the nt s treatments slightly increased at the emergency and tillering wintering stages because the nt s treatment was delayed for 1 2 days during these stages of wheat compared with ct table 1 at the returning green jointing stage the soil eat under the nt s treatment significantly decreased by 10 2 over the two years as compared with that under ct during the maize growing seasons the soil eat varied with different growing stages and reached the highest values from the jointing to teaseling stages during the two years fig 4 the average soil eat of the two years under the ct s nt and nt s treatments at the emergency stage of the maize was 15 6 16 6 and 15 1 lower than that under ct respectively compared with ct the values under the ct s treatment at the jointing teaseling stage of maize significantly decreased by 5 6 and 6 5 in 2015 and 2016 respectively p 0 05 from the flowering to maturity stages the soil eat under the nt s treatment was 7 7 higher than that under ct in 2015 while it was significantly decreased by 2016 compared with that under ct 3 2 characteristics of crop et the annual et of the winter wheat summer maize system under ct s nt and nt s was higher than that under ct in both years although the values did not reach the level of significant difference p 0 05 table 2 in 2015 the annual et under ct s and nt s increased by 2 6 and 4 3 respectively compared with that under ct the et under the four tillage treatments had no significant difference over the two growing seasons of wheat compared with that under ct the et under the ct s nt and nt s treatments during the whole wheat growing season increased by 2 1 3 5 and 2 8 over the two years respectively table 2 during the whole maize growing season the et value in the 2016 maize season was higher than that in the 2015 maize growing season due to the higher precipitation in 2016 the et of straw mulching was higher than that of no straw mulching compared with ct the et under nt s was 4 3 and 6 4 higher than that under ct in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 2 3 3 characteristics of photosynthesis the values of the photosynthetic rate pn and transpiration rate tr under different tillage treatments varied with the sun radiation in different years and growing seasons of wheat and maize during the wheat growing season the pn and tr in 2014 2015 were higher than those in 2015 2016 fig 5 compared with ct the pn of winter wheat flag leaves under nt and nt s increased by 47 9 and 4 1 at the jointing stage and 5 9 and 11 3 at the anthesis stage in 2014 2015 in 2015 2016 the pn under the nt s treatments was 19 0 higher than that under ct at the anthesis stage p 0 05 moreover the tr values under the ct s and nt s treatments at the anthesis stage of wheat increased by 13 3 and 17 9 over the two years respectively compared with that under ct compared with ct pns and trs under nt and nt s treatments were higher at the jointing and anthesis stages of the maize growing season in 2015 fig 5 the pn and tr under the nt s treatment decreased by 20 and 30 at the jointing stage of maize but increased by 19 0 and 17 9 at the anthesis stage of the 2016 maize growing season respectively 3 4 crop productivity and resource utilization compared with the ct treatment the nt and nt s treatments significantly increased the wheat and summer maize yields as well as the annual grain production table 3 p 0 05 compared with the values under ct the wheat yield under the nt and nt s treatments increased by 6 4 and 13 3 respectively during the two growing seasons the annual average maize yield under nt and nt s increased by 25 6 and 27 8 respectively during the two growing seasons the annual grain productivity of winter wheat summer maize under the nt s treatment was higher than that under nt in both years furthermore compared to the values under ct the aboveground biomass of wheat under the nt s treatment increased by 13 1 in the 2015 2016 growing season and the nt s treatment significantly increased the aboveground biomass of maize in both years p 0 05 the annual soil temperature use efficiency tue and wp in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system were increased by the nt s treatment compared to the ct treatment tue showed no significant difference among the different tillage methods over the two growing seasons of winter wheat table 4 p 0 05 however the tue under the nt and nt s treatments was 33 2 and 38 4 higher than that under ct during the maize growing seasons over the two years respectively the wp under nt s was the highest among the four tillage treatments in both the wheat and maize seasons in 2014 2016 table 4 for the leaf water use efficiency lwue there was no significant difference among the four tillage treatments over the two growing seasons of wheat however the values under the nt s treatment were the highest among the four tillage treatments during the two maize growing seasons 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage and straw practices on the soil temperature soil temperature is one of the major factors influencing chemical action and transport of soil water and nutrients in soil and it also affects the seed germination and root growth and development gupta et al 1983 zheng et al 2020 tillage systems and straw mulching can affect the soil temperature by changing soil thermal properties moroizumi and horino 2002 gong et al 2003 several former studies find that conventional tillage exhibits higher soil temperatures than no tillage with straw mulch toshitsugu and haruhiko 2002 wang et al 2010 yang et al 2018 the reason is that the conventional tillage can reduce the soil bulk density compared to the no tillage treatment which creates more contact between solid particles of soil increases the surface area of soil particles and accelerates the soil thermal exchange song et al 2012 thus the soil temperature under conventional tillage changes more rapidly in this study we found that the soil temperature under the nt treatment was lower than that under ct during the wheat maize growing season furthermore compared with ct treatment the soil temperature at the depth of 0 25 cm soil layers under the nt s treatment increased during the tillering and wintering stages but decreased after the jointing stage of winter wheat this indicated that straw mulching could result in significant temperature increasing and temperature decreasing effects during the growing season ren 1997 this was similar to previous results sarkar and singh 2007 yang et al 2018 who reported that straw mulch effectively reduces the daily changes and annual variation in the soil temperature and result in soil temperature significant decreases in high air temperature environments but increases in low air temperature environments zhou 1997 sarkar and singh 2007 chen et al 2014 yang et al 2018 this might be attributed to that straw mulch forms a physical barrier between the soil and atmosphere which could not only block radiation from the sun and reduce longwave radiation but could also decrease the soil evaporation yu et al 2007 similarly in the present study the soil temperature under the nt s treatment also decreased during the growing stages of maize as compared with that under ct treatment due to the higher leaf area index lower thermal conductivity and slower rise of the soil temperature cox et al 1990 schinners et al 1994 yu et al 2007 soil effective accumulated temperature eat is affected by both of soil temperature and the growing days of crops chen et al 2007 investigated that straw mulch could reduce the soil temperature and led to a delay of winter wheat regreening by 3 7 days in the present study the soil eat under the nt s treatments during the whole growing season of winter wheat was 8 5 lower than that under ct in 2014 2015 this could be attributed to the combined effect of tillage and straw mulching on the soil temperature and the wheat growing days which still need further investigation 4 2 effect of tillage and straw practices on et the et of the crop growth was highly affected by the temporal distribution of the precipitation tillage and straw mulching treatments balwinder singh et al 2011a 2011b bu et al 2013 xue et al 2019 kuang et al 2020 the soil water consumption in wheat and maize are different due to the different precipitation during the growing season of wheat and maize the amount of soil water storage consumption accounts for the largest proportion of et in winter wheat followed by precipitation while summer maize mainly consumes water from precipitation kong et al 2014 ding et al 2018 found that when there was a relatively large amount of rainfall during any one period of winter wheat growth the soil evaporation correspondingly increased for soils that had not been mulched and decreased for mulched soils straw mulching has a significant effect on et due to improving the soil structure enhancing soil water storage and reducing soil evaporation de et al 1983 kong et al 2014 li et al 2017 zaman and choudhuri 1995 also found that the et of soil under straw mulching conditions was lower than that under no mulching treatment however some results reported that there was no effect of straw mulching on the total et lascano et al 1994 balwinder singh et al 2011a 2011b although they found that straw mulching suppressed soil evaporation but increased transpiration in the crop growing season li et al 2008 also found that straw mulching enhanced crop transpiration but lowered soil evaporation by reducing the latent heat flux this result caused a large amount of accumulated soil moisture to be absorbed by winter wheat in the later growing season no tillage combined with straw mulch has a better effect on soil moisture storage compared with ct no tillage combined with straw mulching improved soil storage reduced soil evaporation and showed a minimum of water consumption during the wheat growing season kong et al 2014 zhang et al 2002 reported that no tillage combined with straw mulching decreased the soil water consumption in the early growing stage of maize but increased the values in the latter growing stage and increased plant transpiration in this study the et during the vegetative growing season of wheat tended to be higher under nt s than under ct this result was consistent with the result of kong et al 2014 however we also found that et during the reproductive stages of wheat and maize was higher under nt s than under ct due to higher plant transpiration eberbach et al 2011 which was a result of greater yield or aboveground biomass table 3 in this study straw mulching increased the annual et in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system which indicated that straw mulching increased the water consumption compared with no mulching this finding is similar to the result of zhao et al 2014 4 3 effect of tillage and straw practices on photosynthesis tillage and straw mulching highly affect physiological processes and transpiration by regulating soil water wu et al 2008 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the physiological process and transpiration rates of crops depend on the soil water content at different crop growth stages cui et al 2015 liu et al 2016 several studies generally found that water scarcity during the anthesis stage can significantly decrease the pn yang et al 2000 liu et al 2016 in this study the nt s treatment at the anthesis stage increased the pn because both the no tillage treatment and straw mulching could decrease soil evaporation and improve soil water storage li et al 2017 ding et al 2018 when the soil water decreases the transpiration also decreases which makes crops have a short supply the decrease in the water content leads to the dehydration of cells which decreases the transport and transportation speed of photochemical products thus the photosynthetic rate reduced zhang 2014 similarly we also found that the results for pn were consistent with those for tr which is similar to the results of fan et al 2019 the higher photosynthetic rate after the anthesis of crops plays an important role in the transformation and accumulation of photosynthetic products and increases in grain yield wang et al 2013 the flag leaves of wheat are important parts where 30 50 of the grain yield comes from photosynthetic carbon substrate assimilation inoue et al 2004 xu and zhao 1995 in this study the pn of winter wheat flag leaves under nt s increased at the jointing and anthesis stages during the two years due to the higher soil water this result is consistent with li et al 2006 who reported that the net photosynthetic rates of no tillage mulching were significantly higher than those of traditional tillage in the middle and later stages of grouting 4 4 effect of tillage and straw practices on grain yields and resource utilization conservational tillage combined with straw mulching had a positive effect on grain yield due to effective temperature moderation and less soil evaporation li et al 2008 li et al 2013 du et al 2020 however kong et al 2014 found that no tillage combined with straw decreased the annual yield although this tillage treatment significantly decreased the water consumption in our study compared with ct the nt s treatment not only increased the biomass but also enhanced the grain yield of wheat and maize this was because no tillage with straw mulch improved the soil structure and water infiltration guo et al 2017 alleviated drastic changes in the temperature reduced water evaporation and increased root penetration to absorb soil moisture kovar et al 1992 tao et al 2015 dong et al 2018 which led to improved photosynthesis and yield zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2012 additionally yan et al 2017 and shen et al 2012 reported that straw mulching significantly increased the grain yields of summer maize by improving the number of kernels per row and the 1000 kernel weight due to greater leaf transpiration under these treatments li et al 2008 li et al 2013 and more water consumption which may be one of the reasons why straw mulching significantly improved the annual yield in the present study compared with ct treatment the average wheat and maize yield under the nt s treatment increased by 13 3 and 27 8 over the two growing seasons respectively while the maize yield significantly increased by 17 9 under ct s treatment that indicated that straw mulch has more positive effects in maize than wheat this could be attributed to the higher et during the maize growing season under straw mulch condition as compared with ct treatment and the intrinsic mechanism still need further investigation water productivity wp is the ratio of yield and et fernándeza et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the effects of no tillage and straw mulching on wp may be affected by the yield compared with ct no tillage improved the wp during the wheat growing season or the maize growing season on the north china plain yang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 kan et al 2020 meanwhile no tillage combined with straw mulching increased the wp due to the higher crop grain yield jin et al 2007 li et al 2008 in this study we also found that the nt s treatment significantly improved the wp and tue during the growing season of wheat and maize compared with ct due to the higher crop grain yield table 3 the lwue under the nt s treatment was higher than those under the other tillage methods during the maize growing seasons table 4 this result indicated that the nt s treatment produced a higher efficiency of soil water temperature and light resources 5 conclusion no tillage combined with straw mulching treatment has a positive effect on the soil temperature water consumption gain yield and hydrothermal resource utilization in winter wheat summer maize the soil temperature under nt s treatment increased before the wheat regreening stages while it decreased during the whole maize growing season as compared with that under ct and the soil effective accumulated temperature eat under the nt s treatment significantly decreased compared with ct the nt s treatment increased the annual et in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system and increased the pn at the anthesis stage of both wheat and maize furthermore the nt s treatment significantly not only increased the yield of wheat and maize but also improved the annual tue and wp in general no tillage combined with straw mulching is more beneficial for enhancing crop yields and improving hydrothermal resource utilization than

10031,tillage combined with straw mulching is an effective water saving agricultural strategy in eastern central china a two year field experiment with four treatments including conventional tillage ct conventional tillage with straw mulching ct s no tillage nt and no tillage with straw mulching nt s was conducted on semihydromorphic soil the objective was to investigate how tillage with straw mulching affected the soil temperature water consumption photosynthetic rate pn grain yield soil temperature use efficiency tue and water productivity wp in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system the results indicated that straw mulching tended to increase the soil temperature before the wheat regreening stage and decrease the soil temperature during the following wheat growing season and throughout the maize growing season compared with ct the soil effective accumulated temperature eat under the nt s treatment significantly decreased by 4 8 but the annual et increased by 4 3 in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the pn and transpiration rate tr at the anthesis stage of wheat under the nt s treatment increased by 15 2 and 15 6 respectively and the leaf water use efficiency lwue during the growing season of maize increased by 11 3 as compared with that under ct treatment wheat yields decreased in the order of nt s nt ct and ct s during both experimental years and the average yield of maize under the nt s treatment increased by 27 2 compared with that under ct additionally wp values under the nt s treatment during both the wheat and maize seasons were 7 0 and 21 8 higher than those of the ct treatment p 0 05 respectively the annual yield tue and wp values under the nt s treatment were much higher than those under the other treatments therefore nt s treatment has a positive effect on yield and hydrothermal resource utilization in semihydromorphic soil in eastern central china keywords tillage with straw mulching soil temperature soil water consumption photosynthetic rate winter wheat summer maize rotation system 1 introduction the production of winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l plays an important role in food security in china where the sown areas of winter wheat and summer maize reached 24 2 and 35 4 million ha in 2016 respectively national statistical bureau of china 2017 henan province is one of the most important wheat and maize production regions in china with the primary plant pattern being the winter wheat summer maize rotation system however crop production in this region is currently limited by a water shortage caused by seasonal drought and the space time dislocation between precipitation supply and crop demand especially for winter wheat wu et al 2003 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 additionally excessive soil evaporation under traditional tillage treatments in henan province can deteriorate drought conditions zhang et al 2017 leading to a low water productivity no tillage combined with straw mulching has been considered an advanced agronomic technique to improve the soil structure six et al 2002 madari et al 2005 mohanty et al 2007 guo et al 2017 reduce soil water evaporation borghei et al 2008 cullum 2012 shao et al 2016 increase soil moisture schuller et al 2007 de vita et al 2007 and enhance the yield of wheat and maize and wue fuentes et al 2003 de vita et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 in rain fed regions compared with no tillage no tillage with straw mulching significantly increased the gain yield and wue lv et al 2010 yang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 because straw mulching decreased the soil evaporation loss from the soil surface chen et al 2007 dong et al 2018 reduced the surface runoff and increased the soil water infiltration baumhardt and lascano 1996 prosdocimi et al 2016 however compared with either no tillage or conservational tillage several studies found that the grain yield under no tillage with straw mulching decreased due to less effective water or lower soil temperature josa and agnès 2005 lv et al 2010 yang et al 2018 lower temperatures often delay seed germination slow crop seedling growth and may ultimately may reduce the yields of wheat and maize andrade et al 2010 dam et al 2005 gao et al 2009 however some results found that no tillage with straw mulching only decreased the soil temperature at noon and increased the soil temperature in the morning and evening decreasing the daily range of the soil temperature which is beneficial to crop yield especially under frost damage conditions kang et al 1999 liu et al 2005 a better understanding of the mechanism by which no tillage with straw mulching affects the soil temperature and improves the crop yield will be significant for developing water saving agriculture in henan province however most previous studies have focused on the effects of tillage on soil temperature dynamics the soil accumulated temperature and the accumulated temperature use efficiency during the crop growing stages in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system have not been adequately evaluated in practice tillage and mulching methods not only modify the soil hydrothermal conditions but also affect the photosynthetic characteristics of wheat and maize chen and hao 2015 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 photosynthesis is an important method for crop grain yield formation because 90 of crop production comes from photosynthetic matter liu et al 2012 some studies reported that no tillage with straw mulching enhanced wheat and maize s net photosynthesis rate pn and the final grain yield of wheat and maize in dry regions wang et al 2013 liu et al 2019 liu 2019 however yang et al 2018 found that no tillage combined with mulching reduced the pn of wheat leaves in the filling stage in brown loess soil compared with conventional tillage for the winter wheat summer maize rotation system conservation tillage and straw mulching increased the annual yield zhao et al 2014 yang et al 2017 ding et al 2018 however few studies have investigated how to improve the annual yield by comprehensively analyzing the dynamics of soil temperature water consumption and photosynthetic characteristics in winter wheat summer maize rotation systems moreover little information is available on the resource utilization of water soil temperature and light under tillage and mulching methods in winter maize rotation systems it was hypothesized that no tillage combined with straw mulching could improve resource utilization in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the objectives of this study were to i investigate characteristics of the soil temperature dynamic soil effective accumulated temperature and water consumption under different tillage methods ii identify the photosynthetic characteristics under different tillage methods and iii assess the effects of different tillage methods on crop yields and hydrothermal resource utilization in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system in henan province 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted from october 2014 to september 2016 at the tongxu long term experimental

with the tillage practice soil depth and crop growing season figs 2 and 3 the average soil temperature of 0 25 cm was increased by straw mulching compared to the no mulching treatment at the tillering and wintering stages of wheat in 2015 2016 the average soil temperature of 0 25 cm under the ct s and nt s treatments was 66 7 and 83 3 at the tillering stage respectively which was significantly higher than that under ct at the wintering stage of wheat the values under the ct s and nt s treatments increased by 37 5 and 87 5 respectively compared with those under ct however the average soil temperature of 0 25 cm under the nt treatment was 25 lower than that under ct at the wintering stage of wheat during the growing stages of maize the average soil temperature under the nt s and nt treatments decreased by 46 3 and 22 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared with that under ct fig 3 3 1 2 soil effective accumulated temperature the soil effective accumulated temperature eat of wheat and maize in response to tillage varied with air temperature and days of crop growth table 1 on average the soil eat under the ct s nt and nt s treatments decreased during the whole growing season of winter wheat compared with that under ct in 2014 2015 the soil eat under the ct s nt and nt s treatments was 6 1 10 9 and 8 5 lower than that under ct respectively p 0 05 table 1 these values were not significantly different at the emergency seedling and tillering wintering stages of wheat among the four tillage methods however the values of eat under the nt s treatments slightly increased at the emergency and tillering wintering stages because the nt s treatment was delayed for 1 2 days during these stages of wheat compared with ct table 1 at the returning green jointing stage the soil eat under the nt s treatment significantly decreased by 10 2 over the two years as compared with that under ct during the maize growing seasons the soil eat varied with different growing stages and reached the highest values from the jointing to teaseling stages during the two years fig 4 the average soil eat of the two years under the ct s nt and nt s treatments at the emergency stage of the maize was 15 6 16 6 and 15 1 lower than that under ct respectively compared with ct the values under the ct s treatment at the jointing teaseling stage of maize significantly decreased by 5 6 and 6 5 in 2015 and 2016 respectively p 0 05 from the flowering to maturity stages the soil eat under the nt s treatment was 7 7 higher than that under ct in 2015 while it was significantly decreased by 2016 compared with that under ct 3 2 characteristics of crop et the annual et of the winter wheat summer maize system under ct s nt and nt s was higher than that under ct in both years although the values did not reach the level of significant difference p 0 05 table 2 in 2015 the annual et under ct s and nt s increased by 2 6 and 4 3 respectively compared with that under ct the et under the four tillage treatments had no significant difference over the two growing seasons of wheat compared with that under ct the et under the ct s nt and nt s treatments during the whole wheat growing season increased by 2 1 3 5 and 2 8 over the two years respectively table 2 during the whole maize growing season the et value in the 2016 maize season was higher than that in the 2015 maize growing season due to the higher precipitation in 2016 the et of straw mulching was higher than that of no straw mulching compared with ct the et under nt s was 4 3 and 6 4 higher than that under ct in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 2 3 3 characteristics of photosynthesis the values of the photosynthetic rate pn and transpiration rate tr under different tillage treatments varied with the sun radiation in different years and growing seasons of wheat and maize during the wheat growing season the pn and tr in 2014 2015 were higher than those in 2015 2016 fig 5 compared with ct the pn of winter wheat flag leaves under nt and nt s increased by 47 9 and 4 1 at the jointing stage and 5 9 and 11 3 at the anthesis stage in 2014 2015 in 2015 2016 the pn under the nt s treatments was 19 0 higher than that under ct at the anthesis stage p 0 05 moreover the tr values under the ct s and nt s treatments at the anthesis stage of wheat increased by 13 3 and 17 9 over the two years respectively compared with that under ct compared with ct pns and trs under nt and nt s treatments were higher at the jointing and anthesis stages of the maize growing season in 2015 fig 5 the pn and tr under the nt s treatment decreased by 20 and 30 at the jointing stage of maize but increased by 19 0 and 17 9 at the anthesis stage of the 2016 maize growing season respectively 3 4 crop productivity and resource utilization compared with the ct treatment the nt and nt s treatments significantly increased the wheat and summer maize yields as well as the annual grain production table 3 p 0 05 compared with the values under ct the wheat yield under the nt and nt s treatments increased by 6 4 and 13 3 respectively during the two growing seasons the annual average maize yield under nt and nt s increased by 25 6 and 27 8 respectively during the two growing seasons the annual grain productivity of winter wheat summer maize under the nt s treatment was higher than that under nt in both years furthermore compared to the values under ct the aboveground biomass of wheat under the nt s treatment increased by 13 1 in the 2015 2016 growing season and the nt s treatment significantly increased the aboveground biomass of maize in both years p 0 05 the annual soil temperature use efficiency tue and wp in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system were increased by the nt s treatment compared to the ct treatment tue showed no significant difference among the different tillage methods over the two growing seasons of winter wheat table 4 p 0 05 however the tue under the nt and nt s treatments was 33 2 and 38 4 higher than that under ct during the maize growing seasons over the two years respectively the wp under nt s was the highest among the four tillage treatments in both the wheat and maize seasons in 2014 2016 table 4 for the leaf water use efficiency lwue there was no significant difference among the four tillage treatments over the two growing seasons of wheat however the values under the nt s treatment were the highest among the four tillage treatments during the two maize growing seasons 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage and straw practices on the soil temperature soil temperature is one of the major factors influencing chemical action and transport of soil water and nutrients in soil and it also affects the seed germination and root growth and development gupta et al 1983 zheng et al 2020 tillage systems and straw mulching can affect the soil temperature by changing soil thermal properties moroizumi and horino 2002 gong et al 2003 several former studies find that conventional tillage exhibits higher soil temperatures than no tillage with straw mulch toshitsugu and haruhiko 2002 wang et al 2010 yang et al 2018 the reason is that the conventional tillage can reduce the soil bulk density compared to the no tillage treatment which creates more contact between solid particles of soil increases the surface area of soil particles and accelerates the soil thermal exchange song et al 2012 thus the soil temperature under conventional tillage changes more rapidly in this study we found that the soil temperature under the nt treatment was lower than that under ct during the wheat maize growing season furthermore compared with ct treatment the soil temperature at the depth of 0 25 cm soil layers under the nt s treatment increased during the tillering and wintering stages but decreased after the jointing stage of winter wheat this indicated that straw mulching could result in significant temperature increasing and temperature decreasing effects during the growing season ren 1997 this was similar to previous results sarkar and singh 2007 yang et al 2018 who reported that straw mulch effectively reduces the daily changes and annual variation in the soil temperature and result in soil temperature significant decreases in high air temperature environments but increases in low air temperature environments zhou 1997 sarkar and singh 2007 chen et al 2014 yang et al 2018 this might be attributed to that straw mulch forms a physical barrier between the soil and atmosphere which could not only block radiation from the sun and reduce longwave radiation but could also decrease the soil evaporation yu et al 2007 similarly in the present study the soil temperature under the nt s treatment also decreased during the growing stages of maize as compared with that under ct treatment due to the higher leaf area index lower thermal conductivity and slower rise of the soil temperature cox et al 1990 schinners et al 1994 yu et al 2007 soil effective accumulated temperature eat is affected by both of soil temperature and the growing days of crops chen et al 2007 investigated that straw mulch could reduce the soil temperature and led to a delay of winter wheat regreening by 3 7 days in the present study the soil eat under the nt s treatments during the whole growing season of winter wheat was 8 5 lower than that under ct in 2014 2015 this could be attributed to the combined effect of tillage and straw mulching on the soil temperature and the wheat growing days which still need further investigation 4 2 effect of tillage and straw practices on et the et of the crop growth was highly affected by the temporal distribution of the precipitation tillage and straw mulching treatments balwinder singh et al 2011a 2011b bu et al 2013 xue et al 2019 kuang et al 2020 the soil water consumption in wheat and maize are different due to the different precipitation during the growing season of wheat and maize the amount of soil water storage consumption accounts for the largest proportion of et in winter wheat followed by precipitation while summer maize mainly consumes water from precipitation kong et al 2014 ding et al 2018 found that when there was a relatively large amount of rainfall during any one period of winter wheat growth the soil evaporation correspondingly increased for soils that had not been mulched and decreased for mulched soils straw mulching has a significant effect on et due to improving the soil structure enhancing soil water storage and reducing soil evaporation de et al 1983 kong et al 2014 li et al 2017 zaman and choudhuri 1995 also found that the et of soil under straw mulching conditions was lower than that under no mulching treatment however some results reported that there was no effect of straw mulching on the total et lascano et al 1994 balwinder singh et al 2011a 2011b although they found that straw mulching suppressed soil evaporation but increased transpiration in the crop growing season li et al 2008 also found that straw mulching enhanced crop transpiration but lowered soil evaporation by reducing the latent heat flux this result caused a large amount of accumulated soil moisture to be absorbed by winter wheat in the later growing season no tillage combined with straw mulch has a better effect on soil moisture storage compared with ct no tillage combined with straw mulching improved soil storage reduced soil evaporation and showed a minimum of water consumption during the wheat growing season kong et al 2014 zhang et al 2002 reported that no tillage combined with straw mulching decreased the soil water consumption in the early growing stage of maize but increased the values in the latter growing stage and increased plant transpiration in this study the et during the vegetative growing season of wheat tended to be higher under nt s than under ct this result was consistent with the result of kong et al 2014 however we also found that et during the reproductive stages of wheat and maize was higher under nt s than under ct due to higher plant transpiration eberbach et al 2011 which was a result of greater yield or aboveground biomass table 3 in this study straw mulching increased the annual et in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system which indicated that straw mulching increased the water consumption compared with no mulching this finding is similar to the result of zhao et al 2014 4 3 effect of tillage and straw practices on photosynthesis tillage and straw mulching highly affect physiological processes and transpiration by regulating soil water wu et al 2008 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the physiological process and transpiration rates of crops depend on the soil water content at different crop growth stages cui et al 2015 liu et al 2016 several studies generally found that water scarcity during the anthesis stage can significantly decrease the pn yang et al 2000 liu et al 2016 in this study the nt s treatment at the anthesis stage increased the pn because both the no tillage treatment and straw mulching could decrease soil evaporation and improve soil water storage li et al 2017 ding et al 2018 when the soil water decreases the transpiration also decreases which makes crops have a short supply the decrease in the water content leads to the dehydration of cells which decreases the transport and transportation speed of photochemical products thus the photosynthetic rate reduced zhang 2014 similarly we also found that the results for pn were consistent with those for tr which is similar to the results of fan et al 2019 the higher photosynthetic rate after the anthesis of crops plays an important role in the transformation and accumulation of photosynthetic products and increases in grain yield wang et al 2013 the flag leaves of wheat are important parts where 30 50 of the grain yield comes from photosynthetic carbon substrate assimilation inoue et al 2004 xu and zhao 1995 in this study the pn of winter wheat flag leaves under nt s increased at the jointing and anthesis stages during the two years due to the higher soil water this result is consistent with li et al 2006 who reported that the net photosynthetic rates of no tillage mulching were significantly higher than those of traditional tillage in the middle and later stages of grouting 4 4 effect of tillage and straw practices on grain yields and resource utilization conservational tillage combined with straw mulching had a positive effect on grain yield due to effective temperature moderation and less soil evaporation li et al 2008 li et al 2013 du et al 2020 however kong et al 2014 found that no tillage combined with straw decreased the annual yield although this tillage treatment significantly decreased the water consumption in our study compared with ct the nt s treatment not only increased the biomass but also enhanced the grain yield of wheat and maize this was because no tillage with straw mulch improved the soil structure and water infiltration guo et al 2017 alleviated drastic changes in the temperature reduced water evaporation and increased root penetration to absorb soil moisture kovar et al 1992 tao et al 2015 dong et al 2018 which led to improved photosynthesis and yield zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2012 additionally yan et al 2017 and shen et al 2012 reported that straw mulching significantly increased the grain yields of summer maize by improving the number of kernels per row and the 1000 kernel weight due to greater leaf transpiration under these treatments li et al 2008 li et al 2013 and more water consumption which may be one of the reasons why straw mulching significantly improved the annual yield in the present study compared with ct treatment the average wheat and maize yield under the nt s treatment increased by 13 3 and 27 8 over the two growing seasons respectively while the maize yield significantly increased by 17 9 under ct s treatment that indicated that straw mulch has more positive effects in maize than wheat this could be attributed to the higher et during the maize growing season under straw mulch condition as compared with ct treatment and the intrinsic mechanism still need further investigation water productivity wp is the ratio of yield and et fernándeza et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the effects of no tillage and straw mulching on wp may be affected by the yield compared with ct no tillage improved the wp during the wheat growing season or the maize growing season on the north china plain yang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 kan et al 2020 meanwhile no tillage combined with straw mulching increased the wp due to the higher crop grain yield jin et al 2007 li et al 2008 in this study we also found that the nt s treatment significantly improved the wp and tue during the growing season of wheat and maize compared with ct due to the higher crop grain yield table 3 the lwue under the nt s treatment was higher than those under the other tillage methods during the maize growing seasons table 4 this result indicated that the nt s treatment produced a higher efficiency of soil water temperature and light resources 5 conclusion no tillage combined with straw mulching treatment has a positive effect on the soil temperature water consumption gain yield and hydrothermal resource utilization in winter wheat summer maize the soil temperature under nt s treatment increased before the wheat regreening stages while it decreased during the whole maize growing season as compared with that under ct and the soil effective accumulated temperature eat under the nt s treatment significantly decreased compared with ct the nt s treatment increased the annual et in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system and increased the pn at the anthesis stage of both wheat and maize furthermore the nt s treatment significantly not only increased the yield of wheat and maize but also improved the annual tue and wp in general no tillage combined with straw mulching is more beneficial for enhancing crop yields and improving hydrothermal resource utilization than

patterns of precipitation and elucidate the exposure of crops to water deficits based on farm locations across louisiana the study used a combination of principal component analysis pca and cluster analyses to conduct a spatial regionalization based on both precipitation totals and number of precipitation events sohoulande et al 2019 the food and agriculture organization fao cropwat 8 0 smith et al 2002 was used to estimate the water requirement of various seasonal crops including corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane under early and late planting scenarios in louisiana the

evaluation are intended to help farmers become better informed about crop water management decisions that can contribute to the propensity for enhancing crop water use efficiency this evaluation s outcomes seek to help farmers become better informed about crop water management decisions that can contribute to improved crop water use efficiency 2 data and method 2 1 data and study region the study region is the state of louisiana which is characterized by diverse land resource areas and land covers fig 1 fig 1 presents the spatial distribution of land covers and the major land resource areas across louisiana as demarcated by the natural resources conservation service at the united states department of agriculture usda nrcs 2006 table 1 summarizes their coverage percentages retrieved from the 2016 national land cover database jin et al 2019 louisiana encompasses a large part of the mississippi river delta but the climate and lands resources across the state allow farmers to grow a wide variety of seasonal crops in 2018 corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane represented 73 4 of the harvested acreage of field crops in louisiana usda nass 2021 annually the spatial distribution of these crops varies depending on a variety of factors including current crop prices winter weather conditions expected droughts during the crop season and possibly the need to rotate for allelopathic reasons as shown in table 1 the combination of wetlands i e woody wetlands emergent herbaceous wetlands and open water areas represent approximately 42 of louisiana land covers while cultivated crop areas represent 15 5 hence water resources are relatively abundant in many parts of louisiana but this abundance created a propensity for poor agricultural water management practices indeed kebede et al 2014 reported low water use efficiencies in southern louisiana agriculture they associated groundwater depletion with the continuous overdraft of water for irrigation wiser management of agricultural water in both rainfed and irrigated systems would enhance crop water use efficiency defined as the ratio between the crop evapotranspiration and the amount of water supplied by both irrigation and precipitation fernández et al 2020 in addition to the land covers and major land resource data used to generate fig 1 and table 1 the analyses in this study used two categories of data precipitation and crop water requirements the precipitation data were 0 5 gridded time series of seasonal precipitation totals and number of events with 71 grids created to cover the state for each grid the associated precipitation data spanned from 1988 to 2020 encompassing a standard climatological normal length i e 30 years wmo 2017 historical daily precipitation data from 635 land based stations were retrieved from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa database to generate the gridded time series fig 2 data from stations falling within the same grid were averaged daily to generate the grid level time series note that these land based stations generally present gaps in their historical precipitation records thus for each date of the time series the grid level daily precipitation calculation only considers the land based stations having a record for that date when none of the stations within a grid contained a record for a given day a weighted distance average of the nearest three stations outside the grids was used to fill the gap this process generated71 gap free gridded daily time series the grid level daily precipitation data were summed to obtain time series of seasonal precipitation totals based on the seasonal periods defined as december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son with some exceptions annual row crops grown in louisiana are planted in mam and harvested in son with critical growth periods typically occurring in jja thresholds of 5 mm 12 7 mm half inch and 25 4 mm 1 in were used to generate gridded time series of seasonal numbers of precipitation events according to sohoulande et al 2019 2014 2 2 precipitation regionalization the study s method included a spatial regionalization approach and a probability assessment of seasonal crop water requirements the spatial regionalization aimed to optimally determine regions that capture seasonal precipitation patterns across louisiana the regionalization approach was reported in detail by sohoulande et al 2019 and consisted of a combined pca and cluster analyses used as a variable reduction technique pca was applied separately to the 33 year gridded time series of seasonal precipitation totals and the number of precipitation events 5 mm the first six principal components pcs were retained as their eigenvalues i e the total amount of variance explained by a given pc were greater or equal to 1 0 kaiser 1958 for each of the 71 grids the six loading factors associated with the first six pcs were retained for the cluster analysis calculation of the loading factors given by eq 1 is based on both the eigenvalue and eigenvector 1 l o a d i n g f a c t o r e i g e n v e c t o r e i g e n v a l u e k means cluster analysis was conducted on the 71 grids with each grid having six loading factors to determine the optimum number of clusters k jaccard similarity indices were calculated for different values of k 2 k 12 given two clusters x and y the jaccard index formula given by eq 2 was used to evaluate the similarity between the clusters obtained based on seasonal precipitation totals and those obtained based on seasonal number of precipitation events 2 j a c c a r d i n d e x x y x y the higher jaccard index value corresponded to the optimum number of clusters and identified the precipitation regions a comparative analysis of seasonal precipitation patterns was carried out to evaluate differences between precipitation regions a paired wise student t test was conducted to compare djf mam jja and son precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm 12 7 mm and 25 4 mm the probability analyses used a non parametric kernel density estimator to approach the probability density function of seasonal precipitation probabilities of exceedance were thereafter calculated for different values of seasonal crop water requirements estimated using cropwat 8 0 under the climate conditions of the precipitation regions in louisiana the kernel density estimator f ˆ for a seasonal precipitation time series p with n elements was given by eqs 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 3 f ˆ p 1 n h o p t i

estimator p i was any value within the range of p σ was the standard deviation of p p was the center of any bin with h opt width and k was the gaussian kernel 2 3 crop water requirement estimates the study addressed crop water requirement estimates for five major crops grown in louisiana corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane for each crop the water requirement and irrigation need during the growing season were estimated using cropwat 8 0 smith et al 2002 the estimates from cropwat 8 0 used soil climate and crop data the climate in southern and northern louisiana were represented by the new orleans station latitude 29 98 n longitude 90 25 w and shreveport station latitude 32 46 n longitude 93 81 w respectively fig 2 note input climate variables required for cropwat 8 0 i e precipitation minimum temperature maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine duration solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration are available for both the new orleans and shreveport stations the cropwat 8 0 estimation of crop water requirement was based on crop evapotranspiration et c and it assumed no limitations e g salinity pests diseases weed fertility density on the crop growth for each crop the etc values at different growth stages were determined using the crop coefficient k c approach which established et c as the product of the potential evapotranspiration et o and k c as shown by eq 9 9 e t c k c e t 0 a summary of the k c values for corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane in cropwat 8 0 estimates is presented by table 2 given the diversity of soils in louisiana cropwat 8 0 was set using a medium soil condition i e loam soil which is given by the default cropwat 8 0 medium soil note cropwat 8 0 was set with no irrigation system allowing the estimate of irrigation water need as the difference between effective precipitation and crop water requirement effective precipitation estimates of cropwat 8 0 used usda soil conservation service method which is based on the eq 10 10 pr e e f f pr e 125 0 2 α pr e 125 f o r pr e 250 α m m pr e e f f 125 α 0 1 pr e f o r pr e 250 α m m where pre is the actual precipitation depth pre eff is the effective precipitation and α 3 is the 10 days cropwat 8 s correction factor the crop water requirements were estimated at a daily scale then totaled seasonally with each crop two planting scenarios including an early and late planting were considered based on common planting recommendations in louisiana the crop water requirement values were estimated separately for these two scenarios then used in a probability analysis 3 results 3 1 louisiana precipitation regions the combined pca and cluster analyses were conducted separately on the time series of seasonal precipitation total and number of precipitation events fig 3 show the eigenvalue s percentages of the first six pcs retained for the cluster analysis the pcs captured 86 and 84 of the variances in the seasonal precipitation total and number of precipitation events respectively table 3 summarizes the k means cluster analyses carried out with different values of k i e 2 k 12 for each value of k the similarity between the clusters based on total precipitation and those based on the number of events was estimated and reported as jaccard index values in table 3 the highest similarity was reached at the jaccard index of 0 99 which was the maximum value and corresponded to k 2 this outcome suggests that there are two distinct precipitation patterns for the state that emerged when independently considering both daily precipitation totals and number of events fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the grids associated with the clusters based on the total precipitation i e clusters 1 and 2 fig 4a and those based on number of events i e clusters a and b fig 4b in both cases one can associate one cluster to northern louisiana and the other to southern louisiana leading to the identification of two distinct precipitation regions for louisiana 3 2 comparative analysis of the seasonal precipitation patterns fig 5 presents the two louisiana precipitation regions with an overlay of contours that show the spatial distribution of annual precipitation totals fig 5a annual number of precipitation events 5 mm fig 5b events 12 7 mm fig 5c and events 25 4 mm fig 5d the contours of annual precipitation totals fig 5a show higher values in region 2 however these annual values often shade critical seasonal patterns which need to be elucidated for water management purposes hence a paired student t test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between the two regions seasonal precipitation patterns table 4 the results show significant differences for jja precipitation totals and number of events i e events 5 mm 12 7 mm 25 4 mm between the two precipitation regions however the statistical differences were not significant for djf mma and son precipitation variables between the two regions therefore one can assert that the jja precipitations drive the significant differences observed with the annual precipitation total and numbers of events i e 5 mm and 12 7 mm overall the northern louisiana precipitation region receives less precipitation during jja in average 319 8 mm 16 events 5 mm 8 events 12 7 mm and 3 events 25 4 mm compared to the southern louisiana precipitation region in average 511 2 mm 26 events 5 mm 13 events 12 7 mm and 5 events 25 4 mm this disparity between the two regions is likely to have critical impact on crop production because the growing period of major crops such as corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane overlap partially or entirely in the jja season further analyses needed to comprehend the exposure to water deficit for these crops include a probability assessment of the seasonal precipitation figs 6 and 7 present the kernel density estimates of precipitation totals and the number of events for the seasons defined as djf mam jja and son from a visual prospect the curves differ in shape skewness and kurtosis depending on the precipitation region and the season the curves corroborate the discrepancies reported in table 4 figs 6c and 8c highlight apparent differences in the shape of the jja precipitation variables distribution in fig 6c and c the jja curves of region 1 are relatively skewed and shifted to the left compared to region 2 these kernel density curves are approximations of the actual probability distributions of the seasonal precipitation and they will thereby be used to evaluate the crops exposure to water deficit in each of the two precipitation regions in louisiana 3 3 crops water requirements and probabilistic assessment of seasonal precipitation fig 8 summarizes crop water requirements and irrigation needs estimated using cropwat 8 0 in each precipitation region based on the scenarios of early and late planting of corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane the irrigation needs are the differences between the effective precipitation and crop water requirement estimates however in practice the actual irrigation water needs will be affected by the efficiency of the irrigation method in all cases crop water requirements are slightly higher in region 1 compared to region 2 and this can be explained by an overall higher atmospheric water demand in north louisiana average annual et 0 4 2 mm d 1 compared to south louisiana average annual et 0 3 8 mm d 1 however discrepancies in irrigation need i e water deficit are more the consequences of lower precipitation rates and higher atmospheric water demand in region 1 compared to region 2 during the growing season the crop water requirements vary depending on the plant s growth stage expressed by k c and et 0 variation this allowed an evaluation of the magnitude of the crop water demand with more details by using daily weekly or monthly time scales table 5 reports detailed estimates of the crop water demand based on seasonal periods djf mam jja and son these estimates were used as thresholds in the kernel density functions of precipitation totals described in fig 6 to determine the probabilities of exceeding based on different values of crop water requirements these probabilities indicate the chance that total precipitation exceeds crop water requirements in each region for individual crop lower probability values can be interpreted as a high exposure to crop water deficit and a requirement for irrigation when considering general field location and planting window fig 8 shows that both crop water requirement and water deficits i e irrigation need for each region vary depending on the planting scenario i e early late planting likewise the analysis presented in table 5 shows that the probability of crop exposure to water deficit depends on the planting scenario and not only the precipitation region 4 synthesis and discussion the study used principal component and cluster analyses to identify two significant precipitation regions in louisiana regionalization was based on seasonal precipitation totals and the number of events over the period 1988 2020 from a geographic standpoint the two precipitation regions were opposed as one location covers northern louisiana and the other region spans southern louisiana see fig 5 further statistical analyses of the seasonal precipitation patterns have exposed critical dissimilarity of both precipitation total and distribution of events in the two regions explicitly jja precipitation totals and distribution of events showed critical dissimilarities between the two regions these dissimilarities have implications on agricultural water management because the growing period of most common louisiana crops such as corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane overlap the jja season estimates of crop water requirements and irrigation needs for these crops under early and late planting scenarios confirmed the dissimilarities between the regions further analyses based on kernel density estimators elucidated crop exposure to water deficits overall the results enlighten crops exposure to water deficit across the state of louisiana the crop water deficit analyses can be used to inform farmers considering an investment in expanding irrigation capacity or increasing crop diversification over the last decade the fluctuation of agricultural commodities prices have led producers to try different crops in unconventional locations that have immediate implications for water management for instance sugarcane s production which was traditionally restricted to southwest louisiana has noticeably expanded northward and eastward due to the availability of irrigation capacity for drought periods this expansion is somewhat true for corn soybean cotton and sorghum which are often incorporated in crops rotation thus supplying a regionally specific evaluation of precipitation and crop water requirements including probabilities for requiring irrigation of major crops based on planting date was applicable to all farmers across the state the study aligns with previous studies which highlighted the need to enhance crop water use efficiency in louisiana gautam et al 2020 adusumilli et al 2016 kebede et al 2014 many farmers in louisiana adopted furrow irrigation because water availability was not an apparent issue in the state however furrow irrigation generally exacerbates nutrient runoff from fields to stream networks and nutrient leaching from the soil profile into the ground water yu et al 2008 poor water quality can directly impact aquatic life and water availability for other domestic recreational and industry uses besides agriculture borrok et al 2018 eldardiry et al 2016 in the long term the environmental impacts of poor water management practices may outweigh the marginal crop yield gains hence the tools reported in this study can be useful to enhance water resource management at the farm watershed and state levels at farm level understanding the probabilities of crops exposure to water deficit during the growing season could help a farmer to properly ponder the cost and benefits of adopting irrigation systems particularly the crop water deficit assessment can be used to inform farmers considering an investment in irrigation systems analyses of table 5 and fig 8 showed that the crops exposure to water deficit depended primarily on the precipitation region but also on the planting scenarios i e early late planting the farmer may consider the water need differences associated with the planting scenarios to enhance their water management practices at the watershed and state level the map of precipitation regions fig 4 could be a useful tool for implementing programs or propose policies aiming to promote environmental equity and water resources conservation these points of view align with previous studies which foresaw the seasonal fluctuation of surface water resources in louisiana as a key factor to consider for developing water management plans that promote agriculture sustainability in the state eldardiry et al 2016 kebede et al 2014 from another angle it is essential to recall that louisiana is prone to natural disasters such as short term and long term drought excessive rains and hurricanes that have caused substantial damages to state agriculture rahman et al 2017 guidry and pruitt 2012 during the past two decades each of these disasters has affected louisiana agriculture by causing crops failure and lowering productivity nevertheless these natural disasters are very unpredictable and beyond the scope of this study as fore indicated in the method section the precipitation regionalization procedure was first reported by sohoulande et al 2019 who developed and successfully applied it on the southeastern coastal plain of the united states the same procedure in this study showed its consistency since the disparities between the resulting precipitation regions were confirmed by statistics detecting significant differences between seasonal precipitation patterns a potential application of the results from this study include the ability to inform louisiana farmers on how their farm management decisions such as crop selections planting dates irrigation system investments can help to work toward sustainable crop production practices through enhanced crop water use efficiency in louisiana 5 conclusion over decades irrigation infrastructure in humid regions such as louisiana was selected based on the assumption of an abundance of water resources however this conception has led to poor water management practices with potential impacts on the environment as a result several authors raised sustainability concerns including overdrafting water for irrigation groundwater depletion and decline of water quality borrok et al 2018 eldardiry et al 2016 kebede et al 2014 strategies to improve irrigation efficiency in agriculture are now needed to sustain water resources conservation in louisiana from that prospective this study sought to develop data driven tools to support decision making in irrigation management across the state of louisiana these tools include a precipitation regionalization for louisiana and a detailed probabilistic assessment of crop exposure to water deficits based on scenarios of early and late planting the study discussed the potentiality of using these tools for decision support in crop water management at the farm watershed and state levels specifically the precipitation regions map and the probabilistic analyses can be used by extension services to inform farmers about crops exposure to water deficit depending on the location in louisiana in addition these decision support tools can be useful when making farm management decisions and implementing water management plans

eigenvalues i e the total amount of variance explained by a given pc were greater or equal to 1 0 kaiser 1958 for each of the 71 grids the six loading factors associated with the first six pcs were retained for the cluster analysis calculation of the loading factors given by eq 1 is based on both the eigenvalue and eigenvector 1 l o a d i n g f a c t o r e i g e n v e c t o r e i g e n v a l u e k means cluster analysis was conducted on the 71 grids with each grid having six loading factors to determine the optimum number of clusters k jaccard similarity indices were calculated for different values of k 2 k 12 given two clusters x and y the jaccard index formula given by eq 2 was used to evaluate the similarity between the clusters obtained based on seasonal precipitation totals and those obtained based on seasonal number of precipitation events 2 j a c c a r d i n d e x x y x y the higher jaccard index value corresponded to the optimum number of clusters and identified the precipitation regions a comparative analysis of seasonal precipitation patterns was carried out to evaluate differences between precipitation regions a paired wise student t test was conducted to compare djf mam jja and son precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm 12 7 mm and 25 4 mm the probability analyses used a non parametric kernel density estimator to approach the probability density function of seasonal precipitation probabilities of exceedance were thereafter calculated for different values of seasonal crop water requirements estimated using cropwat 8 0 under the climate conditions of the precipitation regions in louisiana the kernel density estimator f ˆ for a seasonal precipitation time series p with n elements was given by eqs 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 3 f ˆ p 1 n h o p t i

estimator p i was any value within the range of p σ was the standard deviation of p p was the center of any bin with h opt width and k was the gaussian kernel 2 3 crop water requirement estimates the study addressed crop water requirement estimates for five major crops grown in louisiana corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane for each crop the water requirement and irrigation need during the growing season were estimated using cropwat 8 0 smith et al 2002 the estimates from cropwat 8 0 used soil climate and crop data the climate in southern and northern louisiana were represented by the new orleans station latitude 29 98 n longitude 90 25 w and shreveport station latitude 32 46 n longitude 93 81 w respectively fig 2 note input climate variables required for cropwat 8 0 i e precipitation minimum temperature maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine duration solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration are available for both the new orleans and shreveport stations the cropwat 8 0 estimation of crop water requirement was based on crop evapotranspiration et c and it assumed no limitations e g salinity pests diseases weed fertility density on the crop growth for each crop the etc values at different growth stages were determined using the crop coefficient k c approach which established et c as the product of the potential evapotranspiration et o and k c as shown by eq 9 9 e t c k c e t 0 a summary of the k c values for corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane in cropwat 8 0 estimates is presented by table 2 given the diversity of soils in louisiana cropwat 8 0 was set using a medium soil condition i e loam soil which is given by the default cropwat 8 0 medium soil note cropwat 8 0 was set with no irrigation system allowing the estimate of irrigation water need as the difference between effective precipitation and crop water requirement effective precipitation estimates of cropwat 8 0 used usda soil conservation service method which is based on the eq 10 10 pr e e f f pr e 125 0 2 α pr e 125 f o r pr e 250 α m m pr e e f f 125 α 0 1 pr e f o r pr e 250 α m m where pre is the actual precipitation depth pre eff is the effective precipitation and α 3 is the 10 days cropwat 8 s correction factor the crop water requirements were estimated at a daily scale then totaled seasonally with each crop two planting scenarios including an early and late planting were considered based on common planting recommendations in louisiana the crop water requirement values were estimated separately for these two scenarios then used in a probability analysis 3 results 3 1 louisiana precipitation regions the combined pca and cluster analyses were conducted separately on the time series of seasonal precipitation total and number of precipitation events fig 3 show the eigenvalue s percentages of the first six pcs retained for the cluster analysis the pcs captured 86 and 84 of the variances in the seasonal precipitation total and number of precipitation events respectively table 3 summarizes the k means cluster analyses carried out with different values of k i e 2 k 12 for each value of k the similarity between the clusters based on total precipitation and those based on the number of events was estimated and reported as jaccard index values in table 3 the highest similarity was reached at the jaccard index of 0 99 which was the maximum value and corresponded to k 2 this outcome suggests that there are two distinct precipitation patterns for the state that emerged when independently considering both daily precipitation totals and number of events fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the grids associated with the clusters based on the total precipitation i e clusters 1 and 2 fig 4a and those based on number of events i e clusters a and b fig 4b in both cases one can associate one cluster to northern louisiana and the other to southern louisiana leading to the identification of two distinct precipitation regions for louisiana 3 2 comparative analysis of the seasonal precipitation patterns fig 5 presents the two louisiana precipitation regions with an overlay of contours that show the spatial distribution of annual precipitation totals fig 5a annual number of precipitation events 5 mm fig 5b events 12 7 mm fig 5c and events 25 4 mm fig 5d the contours of annual precipitation totals fig 5a show higher values in region 2 however these annual values often shade critical seasonal patterns which need to be elucidated for water management purposes hence a paired student t test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between the two regions seasonal precipitation patterns table 4 the results show significant differences for jja precipitation totals and number of events i e events 5 mm 12 7 mm 25 4 mm between the two precipitation regions however the statistical differences were not significant for djf mma and son precipitation variables between the two regions therefore one can assert that the jja precipitations drive the significant differences observed with the annual precipitation total and numbers of events i e 5 mm and 12 7 mm overall the northern louisiana precipitation region receives less precipitation during jja in average 319 8 mm 16 events 5 mm 8 events 12 7 mm and 3 events 25 4 mm compared to the southern louisiana precipitation region in average 511 2 mm 26 events 5 mm 13 events 12 7 mm and 5 events 25 4 mm this disparity between the two regions is likely to have critical impact on crop production because the growing period of major crops such as corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane overlap partially or entirely in the jja season further analyses needed to comprehend the exposure to water deficit for these crops include a probability assessment of the seasonal precipitation figs 6 and 7 present the kernel density estimates of precipitation totals and the number of events for the seasons defined as djf mam jja and son from a visual prospect the curves differ in shape skewness and kurtosis depending on the precipitation region and the season the curves corroborate the discrepancies reported in table 4 figs 6c and 8c highlight apparent differences in the shape of the jja precipitation variables distribution in fig 6c and c the jja curves of region 1 are relatively skewed and shifted to the left compared to region 2 these kernel density curves are approximations of the actual probability distributions of the seasonal precipitation and they will thereby be used to evaluate the crops exposure to water deficit in each of the two precipitation regions in louisiana 3 3 crops water requirements and probabilistic assessment of seasonal precipitation fig 8 summarizes crop water requirements and irrigation needs estimated using cropwat 8 0 in each precipitation region based on the scenarios of early and late planting of corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane the irrigation needs are the differences between the effective precipitation and crop water requirement estimates however in practice the actual irrigation water needs will be affected by the efficiency of the irrigation method in all cases crop water requirements are slightly higher in region 1 compared to region 2 and this can be explained by an overall higher atmospheric water demand in north louisiana average annual et 0 4 2 mm d 1 compared to south louisiana average annual et 0 3 8 mm d 1 however discrepancies in irrigation need i e water deficit are more the consequences of lower precipitation rates and higher atmospheric water demand in region 1 compared to region 2 during the growing season the crop water requirements vary depending on the plant s growth stage expressed by k c and et 0 variation this allowed an evaluation of the magnitude of the crop water demand with more details by using daily weekly or monthly time scales table 5 reports detailed estimates of the crop water demand based on seasonal periods djf mam jja and son these estimates were used as thresholds in the kernel density functions of precipitation totals described in fig 6 to determine the probabilities of exceeding based on different values of crop water requirements these probabilities indicate the chance that total precipitation exceeds crop water requirements in each region for individual crop lower probability values can be interpreted as a high exposure to crop water deficit and a requirement for irrigation when considering general field location and planting window fig 8 shows that both crop water requirement and water deficits i e irrigation need for each region vary depending on the planting scenario i e early late planting likewise the analysis presented in table 5 shows that the probability of crop exposure to water deficit depends on the planting scenario and not only the precipitation region 4 synthesis and discussion the study used principal component and cluster analyses to identify two significant precipitation regions in louisiana regionalization was based on seasonal precipitation totals and the number of events over the period 1988 2020 from a geographic standpoint the two precipitation regions were opposed as one location covers northern louisiana and the other region spans southern louisiana see fig 5 further statistical analyses of the seasonal precipitation patterns have exposed critical dissimilarity of both precipitation total and distribution of events in the two regions explicitly jja precipitation totals and distribution of events showed critical dissimilarities between the two regions these dissimilarities have implications on agricultural water management because the growing period of most common louisiana crops such as corn soybean cotton grain sorghum and sugarcane overlap the jja season estimates of crop water requirements and irrigation needs for these crops under early and late planting scenarios confirmed the dissimilarities between the regions further analyses based on kernel density estimators elucidated crop exposure to water deficits overall the results enlighten crops exposure to water deficit across the state of louisiana the crop water deficit analyses can be used to inform farmers considering an investment in expanding irrigation capacity or increasing crop diversification over the last decade the fluctuation of agricultural commodities prices have led producers to try different crops in unconventional locations that have immediate implications for water management for instance sugarcane s production which was traditionally restricted to southwest louisiana has noticeably expanded northward and eastward due to the availability of irrigation capacity for drought periods this expansion is somewhat true for corn soybean cotton and sorghum which are often incorporated in crops rotation thus supplying a regionally specific evaluation of precipitation and crop water requirements including probabilities for requiring irrigation of major crops based on planting date was applicable to all farmers across the state the study aligns with previous studies which highlighted the need to enhance crop water use efficiency in louisiana gautam et al 2020 adusumilli et al 2016 kebede et al 2014 many farmers in louisiana adopted furrow irrigation because water availability was not an apparent issue in the state however furrow irrigation generally exacerbates nutrient runoff from fields to stream networks and nutrient leaching from the soil profile into the ground water yu et al 2008 poor water quality can directly impact aquatic life and water availability for other domestic recreational and industry uses besides agriculture borrok et al 2018 eldardiry et al 2016 in the long term the environmental impacts of poor water management practices may outweigh the marginal crop yield gains hence the tools reported in this study can be useful to enhance water resource management at the farm watershed and state levels at farm level understanding the probabilities of crops exposure to water deficit during the growing season could help a farmer to properly ponder the cost and benefits of adopting irrigation systems particularly the crop water deficit assessment can be used to inform farmers considering an investment in irrigation systems analyses of table 5 and fig 8 showed that the crops exposure to water deficit depended primarily on the precipitation region but also on the planting scenarios i e early late planting the farmer may consider the water need differences associated with the planting scenarios to enhance their water management practices at the watershed and state level the map of precipitation regions fig 4 could be a useful tool for implementing programs or propose policies aiming to promote environmental equity and water resources conservation these points of view align with previous studies which foresaw the seasonal fluctuation of surface water resources in louisiana as a key factor to consider for developing water management plans that promote agriculture sustainability in the state eldardiry et al 2016 kebede et al 2014 from another angle it is essential to recall that louisiana is prone to natural disasters such as short term and long term drought excessive rains and hurricanes that have caused substantial damages to state agriculture rahman et al 2017 guidry and pruitt 2012 during the past two decades each of these disasters has affected louisiana agriculture by causing crops failure and lowering productivity nevertheless these natural disasters are very unpredictable and beyond the scope of this study as fore indicated in the method section the precipitation regionalization procedure was first reported by sohoulande et al 2019 who developed and successfully applied it on the southeastern coastal plain of the united states the same procedure in this study showed its consistency since the disparities between the resulting precipitation regions were confirmed by statistics detecting significant differences between seasonal precipitation patterns a potential application of the results from this study include the ability to inform louisiana farmers on how their farm management decisions such as crop selections planting dates irrigation system investments can help to work toward sustainable crop production practices through enhanced crop water use efficiency in louisiana 5 conclusion over decades irrigation infrastructure in humid regions such as louisiana was selected based on the assumption of an abundance of water resources however this conception has led to poor water management practices with potential impacts on the environment as a result several authors raised sustainability concerns including overdrafting water for irrigation groundwater depletion and decline of water quality borrok et al 2018 eldardiry et al 2016 kebede et al 2014 strategies to improve irrigation efficiency in agriculture are now needed to sustain water resources conservation in louisiana from that prospective this study sought to develop data driven tools to support decision making in irrigation management across the state of louisiana these tools include a precipitation regionalization for louisiana and a detailed probabilistic assessment of crop exposure to water deficits based on scenarios of early and late planting the study discussed the potentiality of using these tools for decision support in crop water management at the farm watershed and state levels specifically the precipitation regions map and the probabilistic analyses can be used by extension services to inform farmers about crops exposure to water deficit depending on the location in louisiana in addition these decision support tools can be useful when making farm management decisions and implementing water management plans

10033,computation of crop evapotranspiration etc is a necessary for irrigation planning and agricultural water management however etc is complex and dynamic depending on many meteorological variables so it is challenging to estimate accurately therefore artificial intelligence could be a method to overcome these complexities consequently the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance metric of four artificial intelligence algorithms including k nearest neighbor knn support vector machine svm random forest rf and adaptive boosting ab using eight different input combinations for daily sugar beet etc estimation the input combinations included daily data for crop coefficient maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation wind speed and maximum and minimum relative humidity the values were obtained from field experiments conducted at çumra konya in central anatolia turkey in 2012 and 2013 that focused on optimal water supply conditions for sugar beet production the performance metric of four artificial intelligence methods were compared with a soil water balanced model based on fao methodology all the artificial intelligence methods evaluated knn svm rf and ab provided satisfactory results with r2 in the range 0 799 0 992 mean squared error 0 048 1 273 mm d 1 root mean square error 0 219 1 128 mm d 1 and mean absolute error 0 156 0 832 mm d 1 the result show that the performance metrics of the artificial intelligence models get good performances even if the number of the input variables is applied less in the models among the input combinations the svm model with crop coefficient maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation and wind speed combination 5 shows better modelling accuracy than knn rf and ab models therefore the svm method is considered to be appropriate for estimation of daily sugar beet etc in semiarid region keywords adaptive boosting k nearest neighbor penman monteith equation random forest support vector machine 1 introduction over recent decades water resources worldwide have become increasingly under threat due to climate change population growth and economic development this has resulted in water scarcity and water quality deterioration in many regions of the world jovanovic et al 2020 this is particularly true for irrigation water with global water usage dominated by the agriculture sector suwaileh et al 2020 therefore it is imperative that water use in agriculture is managed to maximum benefit and minimum environmental damage this is particular critically in semiarid areas where the impact of water scarcity will be the greatest a good example of this challenge is irrigated sugar beet which is a globally important crop that is particularly vulnerable to the impact of water stress consequently advances made in optimizing irrigation of sugar beet will have much wider application given the scale of global sugar beet beta vulgaris production 275 mt from 4 8 mha faostat 2018 and the crop s sensitivity water stress optimal irrigation management is essential with turkey being the fifth largest producer of sugar beet 19 mt from 307 kha faostat 2018 and 40 of this production being in the semiarid konya basin topak et al 2016 water management of sugar beet is also a key issue for turkey water resources in the konya basin are limited by low precipitation and high evapotranspiration et consequently irrigation in this area is essential and demand on aquifers continues to grow productivity of sugar beet crops is strongly influenced by irrigation management morillo velarde 2010 and climatic conditions pidgeon et al 2001 with water stress impacting sugar beet yield sugar concentration and quality shrestha et al 2010 therefore it is imperative to estimate et to accurately manage irrigation of sugar beet to ensure economic yield and quality especially in arid and semiarid such as konya regions crop et etc is calculated from multiplying the reference et eto by the crop coefficient kc doorenbos and pruitt 1977 however estimating etc is difficult since it correlates with a number of meteorological and crop variables therefore it is nonlinear and has a complex structure many empirical equations have been suggested to estimate et from available meteorological data with inclusion of both the thermodynamic and aerodynamic components wu et al 2019 one well known eto method is the penman monteith fao pm which is the method suggested by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations as a standard method allen et al 1998 this method was evaluated under in different environment contexts and demonstrated to be superior to other empirical methods especially for the daily estimation garcia et al 2004 temesgen et al 2005 cai et al 2007 however application of the fao pm method has important limitations as this requires access to numerous meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed as model inputs fan et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 ferreira and da cunha 2020 ideally these inputs should have been recorded a site appropriate meteorological stations however for an area of interest there may only be limited or inferior quality data verifiable which would be a significant constraint for many locations around the world paredes et al 2018 fang et al 2020 therefore simplified empirical equations with less meteorological input data are used in these locations for example temperature based equations hargreaves and samani 1985 radiation based equations priestley and taylor 1972 and mass transfer based equations brockamp and wenner 1963 in addition estimation of eto is difficult using empirical equations due a complex and dynamic processes and it needs high quality site appropriate meteorological data therefore as an alternative modern mathematical methods including artificial intelligence models have successfully been employed to estimate eto with different combinations of meteorological data as indicated by the following examples antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 investigated ann model and empirical equations to estimate on daily eto in greece with the ann model providing acceptable performance fan et al 2019 compared light gradient boosting machine lightgbm with random forest rf and empirical equations hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert the lightgbm model estimated better than rf and the four empirical equations ferreira et al 2019 evaluated support vector machine svm and ann models for modeling eto in brazil with the ann model considered to provide satisfactory performance artificial intelligence models have been used to evaluate etc for barley garlic maize potato and wheat crops abyaneh et al 2011 studied adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and ann models comparing these with lysimetric data for predicting garlic etc and concluded that both two models are useful for this purpose hashemi and sepaskhah 2020 evaluated ann model and fao pm equation for estimation of barley etc they found that the ann model is showed better performance than fao pm equation saggi and jain 2020 used fuzzy genetic fg and regularization random forest rrf methods to estimate maize and wheat etc the fg and rrf models were found to be suitable for the estimation of maize and wheat etc shan et al 2020 applied multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model for estimation of maize etc in semiarid region and concluded that mars model is highly suitable for maize etc estimation even under lack of meteorological data this paper evaluated the performance metrics of four artificial intelligence methods for estimating sugar beet etc using limited meteorological data in comparison to the etc computed by the fao methodology using complete meteorological data the goal of this paper was not only to test the performance metrics of each artificial intelligence method relative to the other methods but also to estimate the etc values resulting from the use of different combinations of meteorological data relative to the fao methodology 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site experiment design and data collection the data of field experiment was collected during the crop growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 in çumra konya in the central anatolia region of turkey 37 33 70 n 32 47 20 e 1013 m daily weather data came from a station operated by the turkish meteorological organization in turkey 37 33 57 n 32 47 24 e 1014 m altitude data included daily maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin daily maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax rhmin global solar radiation rs and daily wind speed at 2 m above ground u2 the average tmax was 28 3 c in 2012 and 28 9 c in 2013 the average tmin was 12 8 c in 2012 and 12 8 c in 2013 average rs was 33 62 mj m2 d 1 in 2012 and 34 99 mj m2 d 1 in 2013 average rhmax was 68 3 in 2012 and 66 4 in 2013 average rhmin was 21 1 in 2012 and 21 7 in 2013 and average u2 was 1 11 m s 1 in 2012 and 1 12 m s 1 in 2013 based on köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the region is in semiarid climate with very hot dry summers and cold snowy winters the average annual total precipitation is 323 mm depending on long term data topak et al 2011 sugar beet cv stine was sown at 5 cm between plants and 45 cm between rows cv stine is one of the most preferred cultivars by farmers in the konya basin the sugar beet crops were fully irrigated in both years keeping the soil water in root zone in the range 35 40 available soil content with water uptake from the top 0 9 m of the soil profile surface drip irrigation laterals 16 mm were installed at 30 cm spacing further information about the field experiment can found in topak et al 2016 based on fao pm method reproduced below for clarity eto was estimated as 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference et mm d 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure function kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 es is saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is actual vapor pressure kpa and u2 is the mean daily wind speed m s 1 the sugar beet etc value was described as 2 e t c k c e t o where eto is reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 calculated by eq 1 and kc is crop coefficient the growing stages were observed during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 table 1 these stages were separated into four major periods as initial crop development mid season and late season stage these distinctions are essential for kc values to set corresponding growing stages the kcini fao 0 35 kcmid fao 1 20 and kcend fao 0 70 were taken from the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 the kc values of mid season and late season were required to adjust due to climate conditions of experimental site according to the following equations 3 k c m i d k c m i d f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 4 k c e n d k c e n d f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where kcmid fao 1 20 and kcend fao 0 70 are middle and end season crop coefficients for sugar beet crop h is the height of the sugar beet rhmin is the minimum relative humidity and u2 is the wind speed at 2 m above ground m s 1 from the experiment site 2 2 artificial intelligence methods in literature many artificial intelligence methods have been presented for et estimations among these methods knn svm and ab are performed the most effective tools among the data mining algorithms wu et al 2008 in this study these three methods knn svm and ab are used to compare the performance metrics of daily sugar beet etc estimation in respect to well known rf method the rf method is one of the widely adopted tree based ensemble methods which is also called traditional methods liu et al 2012 in summary the methods are explained in below 2 2 1 k nearest neighbor the k nearest neighbor knn was introduced by cover and hart 1967 which is commonly applied method among the data mining models wu et al 2008 also the knn has been used in previous studies for estimation of et feng and tian 2020 granata et al 2020 yamaç and todorovic 2020 the knn method is a nonparametric and lazy learning algorithm that requires no information on the primary data features to set the unknown sample to the k nearest samples therefore the method is effected from the irrelevant and redundant features however the method is easy to apply and also effective to use the method works as a new coming sample is categorized using one identified sample which is neighboring to the new coming sample this procedure depends on the metrics used for regression and classification purposes one of the most commonly known distance metrics is euclidean distance also called as the straight line distance therefore the euclidean distance equation was applied to estimate the value of etc in this study 2 2 2 support vector machine the support vector machine svm method was proposed by vapnik 1995 which is also one of the main methods of data mining wu et al 2008 likewise the svm is well known and widely used algorithms for estimation of et shrestha and shukla 2015 yao et al 2017 dou and yang 2018 fan et al 2018 tang et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 this method was used as a benchmarking in order to evaluate the performance metric of other artificial intelligence models evaluated in the study the svm is a supervised method that has the ability to solve the regression and classification problems due to its powerful capacity to focus on the complex nonlinear process of input variables it uses a set of kernel functions such as polynomial nonlinear linear sigmoid and radial basis function rbf these functions transform low dimensional input space into a higher dimensional space in this way the method has advantageous for solving nonlinear separation problems in this study among the kernel functions the rbf was used to estimate daily sugar beet etc due to its superior performance the previous studies showed that the rbf provided better performance in the estimation of et fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 tang et al 2018 2 2 3 random forest the random forest rf was introduced by breiman 2001 and has been applied in many studies for estimation of eto e g feng et al 2017a shiri 2018 da silva júnior et al 2019 fan et al 2019 however it appears not to have been used for the estimation of etc in any previous studies the rf is a supervised ensemble method that is applied both for solving regression and classification problems in reality the forest consist of trees and more trees the more robust the forest similarly the random forest method creates independent decision trees by selecting a training sample randomly after getting the prediction from each of the decision trees the final results are determined by averaging of all the trees for the regression problem however the final result is selected by all trees voting for the classification problem the rf has the ability to overcome the high dimensional data and strong nonlinear problems which reduces the overfitting by averaging the results feng et al 2017a 2 2 4 adaptive boosting the adaptive boosting ab model was first proposed by freund and schapire 1997 and is also a widely used data mining algorithm due to its simplified application and accurate estimation wu et al 2008 it is a supervised learning method and one of the first boosting algorithms to adapt for solving both classification and regression problems among the artificial intelligence methods the ab model decreases the noise data in features since it works according to the weak learner which is used to improve the performance ferreira et al 2020 the main idea of the model is that it trains first its weak classifiers individually and then ensembles many weak classifiers into a single strong classifier moreover it is combined with other artificial intelligence algorithms to boost the performance metrics of the ab model schapire 2013 in summary the ab model is a basic enhancing method of weak classification algorithms and this method improves data classification by decreasing variance and bias of the data through continuous training wu et al 2020 2 3 input combinations of meteorological data and performance evaluation as indicated in table 2 eight available input combinations based on crop coefficient maximum and minimum temperature were employed to evaluate the impacts of different meteorological variables on daily sugar beet etc estimation the eight input combinations of the artificial intelligence models can be seen in table 2 the standardization was done for all datasets to improve the modelling performance the standardization equation was used as follows 5 z i j x i̇ j μ s d where x i̇ j is the observation value µ is the average value and sd is the standard deviation value from the average all the daily observed dataset from growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 were separated into two subsets for training 70 and testing 30 also k fold cross validation was employed for the larger dataset the dataset were divided into 10 fold in this way it evaluated the predictive models by dividing to datasets into a training set for train and a testing set for evaluating fig 1 shows flowchart of the applied artificial intelligence models the performance metrics of artificial intelligence methods between observed and simulated etc values were assessed using the mean squared error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 which are described as 6 m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 7 r m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 8 m a e i 1 n e i o i n 9 r 2 1 0 ı 1 n o i e i 2 ı 1 n o i o 2 where ei and oi are estimated and observed values respectively o is the mean value of the observed values 3 results and discussion 3 1 adjustment of input variables detailed meteorological conditions for the sugar beet experimental site in the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 are shown in fig 2 these meteorological observations were largely as expected in both growing seasons tmax tmin and rs increased until the end of august then decreased until the end of the growing season the opposite trend was observed for rhmax and rhmin u2 fluctuated considerably during both growing seasons a correlation matrix between the input variables and etc is given in table 3 indicating that the highest correlation was observed between etc and kc 0 92 values therefore kc was added to all combinations as an input the second best correlation was observed between air temperature variables tmax and tmin and etc which were also the most correlated of the meteorological variables which is consistent with estimation of et by air temperature methods e g hargreaves and samani 1985 previously giving satisfactory results in arid and semiarid areas feng et al 2017b tabari and talaee 2011 the third highest correlation of 0 43 was between rs and etc this observation is reliable with the results of zhao et al 2010 who found that the temperature based method gave a better result than solar radiation based method in an arid area the fourth highest correlation of 0 31 was between etc and u2 similarly tabari et al 2013 found a high correlation between etc and u2 though less than for temperature and rs on the contrary negative correlation was obtained between relative humidity rhmax and rhmin and etc with the values of 0 48 and 0 33 respectively also abyaneh et al 2011 indicated the least correlation was between etc and relative humidity when estimating et stages of the sugar beet growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 are given in table 1 the growth periods were 172 d in 2012 and 148 d in 2013 the lengths of four major stages initial crop development mid season and late season were 25 40 60 and 47 d in 2012 and 20 38 60 and 30 d in 2013 according to the eqs 6 and 7 the kcmid and kcend values were calibrated considering to sugar beet height rhmin and u2 for the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 sugar beet height reached 0 5 m and was as reported by allen et al 1998 the calibrated values of kcmid and kcend were 1 24 and 0 74 for 2012 and 1 24 and 0 73 for 2013 respectively the modified kcmid and kcend were found close values with the in literature chegini et al 2010 found that kcmid of 1 12 in iran is slightly lower than those in the present study which will relate to the different agrometeorological conditions however ebrahimipak and ghalebi 2014 reported kcend of 0 70 for sugar beet crop which is reached close value in this study 3 2 performance of artificial intelligence methods the performance metrics of the four artificial intelligence methods for estimating daily sugar beet etc are presented in table 4 for the eight input combinations in training and testing subsets scatter plots of observed and simulated daily sugar beet etc values are presented in figs 3 6 for the knn svm rf and ab models respectively for the eight input combinations likewise fig 7 shows the box plots of daily sugar beet etc estimated by the knn svm rf and ab models for the eight input combinations input combinations are important in the accuracy of et estimation by artificial intelligence methods therefore the estimated daily sugar beet etc values varied significantly depending on models and input combinations table 2 all models gave accurate daily sugar beet etc estimates during training and testing with r2 mae rmse and mse ranging 0 799 0 988 0 156 0 832 mm d 1 0 219 1 128 mm d 1 and 0 048 1 273 mm d 1 respectively the advantage of these nonparametric methods in comparison to empirical methods is that they need no former and specific information about the correlation between internal variables to reach a result gocić et al 2015 yamaç et al 2020 in general with the testing subset the fifth combination with inputs of kc tmax tmin and rs performed best with the svm and ab models while the eighth combination with inputs of kc tmax tmin rhmax rhmin rs and u2 with rf and third combination with inputs of kc tmax tmin and rs performed best with the knn model the poorest performance was for the knn and svm models in the fourth combination and the rf and ab models in the first combination the knn model was reached the highest performance when k value was set to five the performance metrics for sugar beet etc when applying knn model with eight input combinations knn1 to knn8 was the poorest of the models when etc was estimated with kc tmax tmin rhmax rhmin data knn4 with r2 of 0 842 mae of 0 773 mm d 1 rmse of 1 002 mm d 1 and mse of 1 003 mm d 1 the estimation improved by than 45 for mse rmse and mae with the third combination with rs data along with tmax tmin and kc knn3 also for the testing subset this combination performed best of the knn models with r2 of 0 961 mae of 0 381 mm d 1 rmse of 0 500 mm d 1 and mse of 0 250 mm d 1 for the svm model the radial basis function was used as a kernel function to estimate sugar beet etc due to its better performance than other kernel functions for the testing subset the svm4 model with kc tmax tmin and rhmax rhmin gave the poorest performance with r2 of 0 892 mae of 0 650 mm d 1 rmse of 0 826 mm d 1 and mse of 0 682 mm d 1 a relevant improvement was obtained for the eighth combination when rs and u2 data were included in svm model with r2 of 0 985 mae of 0 233 rmse of 0 312 to mm d 1 and mse of 0 097 mm d 1 the svm model gave the best performance for sugar beet etc estimate with the fifth input combination including kc tmax tmin rs and u2 with r2 of 0 992 mae of 0 557 mm d 1 rmse of 0 699 mm d 1 and mse of 0 048 mm d 1 the rf model was obtained the best performance when the number of trees was fixed to 10 table 4 the model gave the poorest performance for the first combination with r2 of 0 848 mae of 0 753 mm d 1 rmse of 0 982 mm d 1 and mse of 0 964 mm d 1 the statistical indicators showed similar performance to the rf model for the second and sixth input combinations the highest performance was obtained for the rf8 with inputs of tmax tmin rhmax rhmin rs and u2 in the testing subset with r2 of 0 963 mae of 0 338 mm d 1 rmse of 0 485 mm d 1 and mse of 0 236 mm d 1 in this study a decision tree was used for boosting the ab model the most satisfactory result was obtained when the number of learning rates set to one and the number of estimators set to 50 table 4 the ab model performed best with the fifth input combination with r2 of 0 959 mae of 0 341 mm d 1 rmse of 0 510 mm d 1 and mse of 0 260 mm d 1 and the poorest performance was obtained with the first combination with r2 of 0 799 mae of 0 832 mm d 1 rmse of 1 128 mm d 1 and mse of 1 273 mm d 1 the scatter plots of estimated daily sugar beet etc values by knn svm rf and ab models with eight input combinations in the testing subset are shown in figs 3 6 the plotted data points generally correlated close to the identity line however the first and forth combinations for all applied artificial intelligence methods knn svm rf and ab produced more scattered estimates than the other combinations the sugar beet etc values estimated by with third fifth seventh and eighth combinations were closer to those observed etc values among the models the svm model data points were closer to the identity line this consistency showed that applied artificial intelligence methods using the third fifth seventh and eighth input combinations and the svm model provided acceptable estimation accuracy of daily sugar beet etc values fig 7 shows the box plots of observed daily sugar beet etc values estimated by knn svm rf and ab models for the eight input combinations during the testing subset the figures show that the distribution of the estimated daily sugar beet etc values were close to those observed etc values especially svm for the third fifth seventh and eighth combinations gave better estimation of for daily sugar beet etc than the other models which further confirmed the value of the svm model for accurately estimating daily sugar beet etc values therefore the svm model is recommended for its ability accurately estimating daily sugar beet etc the rf model gave the best estimation of etc when all input data were included rf8 several studies indicated that the artificial intelligence methods using complete input data provide the best performance for estimating of etc abyaneh et al 2011 used the anfis and ann models with complete meteorological data for garlic etc estimate in a semiarid area of iran similarly aghajanloo et al 2013 estimated ann neural network genetic algorithm and multivariate nonlinear regression models with complete meteorological data for potato etc estimate in northwestern iran however other artificial intelligence methods knn svm and ab gave the best estimation of sugar beet etc in the present study when input data were limited the performance of the knn3 model with kc tmax tmin and u2 was better than with any other input combinations likewise the svm and ab models with kc tmax tmin rs and u2 the fifth combination performed better than with other input combinations the performance metrics indicated that the etc estimation with knn svm and ab did not improve with complete data input this result confirmed by table 3 indicating correlation between the sugar beet etc and input variables the highest to lowest positive correlations were tmax tmin rs and u2 with etc whereas rhmax rhmin had negative correlations with etc in contrast the rf model gave a better result with complete input data these findings demonstrated that the rf model has the ability for improved performance even when an input variable not positively correlated to etc value is included the performance metrics obtained demonstrate satisfactory performance of knn svm rf and ab models for example the rf model with limited input variables had similar performance to the rrf model with complete data input saggi and jain 2020 the svm model with kc tmax tmin rs and u2 svm5 gave lesser rmse and mae values than the svm model with complete data input tang et al 2018 in the present study all the applied models gave lower mse and mae and higher r2 values in third fifth and eighth combinations compared to tcn dnn and lstm models with complete data input chen et al 2020 4 conclusions this study applied artificial intelligence methods to estimate sugar beet etc which are an essential variable for efficient irrigation management of this crop especially in water limited semiarid areas artificial intelligence methods have become increasingly important in agricultural water management these methods have the ability to be applied to smart irrigation approach using the newest technologies of sensor that collect data in real time the performance metrics of four artificial intelligence methods knn svm rf and ab were compared with eight combinations of meteorological data the overall result indicated that rs was more significant than the u2 rhmax and rhmin for daily sugar beet etc estimation in the semiarid area studied the knn svm and ab models obtained satisfactory daily sugar beet etc estimates with less meteorological input variables the highest performance was obtained for the fifth combination which included kc tmax tmin rs and u2 notably only the rf model performed best with a complete set of input data in this study sugar beet etc estimation was performed under optimal water intake and it was found that all the artificial intelligence methods gave satisfactory results even with limited meteorological input data this shows that these methods can be applied in areas where the meteorological data are limited however further studies should be conducted under a scenario of limited water supply where the area faces water scarcity due to a lack of water resources these findings will be important for better management of irrigation activities in the konya but will equally be of value when applied to different crops areas and environmental conditions

10033,computation of crop evapotranspiration etc is a necessary for irrigation planning and agricultural water management however etc is complex and dynamic depending on many meteorological variables so it is challenging to estimate accurately therefore artificial intelligence could be a method to overcome these complexities consequently the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance metric of four artificial intelligence algorithms including k nearest neighbor knn support vector machine svm random forest rf and adaptive boosting ab using eight different input combinations for daily sugar beet etc estimation the input combinations included daily data for crop coefficient maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation wind speed and maximum and minimum relative humidity the values were obtained from field experiments conducted at çumra konya in central anatolia turkey in 2012 and 2013 that focused on optimal water supply conditions for sugar beet production the performance metric of four artificial intelligence methods were compared with a soil water balanced model based on fao methodology all the artificial intelligence methods evaluated knn svm rf and ab provided satisfactory results with r2 in the range 0 799 0 992 mean squared error 0 048 1 273 mm d 1 root mean square error 0 219 1 128 mm d 1 and mean absolute error 0 156 0 832 mm d 1 the result show that the performance metrics of the artificial intelligence models get good performances even if the number of the input variables is applied less in the models among the input combinations the svm model with crop coefficient maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation and wind speed combination 5 shows better modelling accuracy than knn rf and ab models therefore the svm method is considered to be appropriate for estimation of daily sugar beet etc in semiarid region keywords adaptive boosting k nearest neighbor penman monteith equation random forest support vector machine 1 introduction over recent decades water resources worldwide have become increasingly under threat due to climate change population growth and economic development this has resulted in water scarcity and water quality deterioration in many regions of the world jovanovic et al 2020 this is particularly true for irrigation water with global water usage dominated by the agriculture sector suwaileh et al 2020 therefore it is imperative that water use in agriculture is managed to maximum benefit and minimum environmental damage this is particular critically in semiarid areas where the impact of water scarcity will be the greatest a good example of this challenge is irrigated sugar beet which is a globally important crop that is particularly vulnerable to the impact of water stress consequently advances made in optimizing irrigation of sugar beet will have much wider application given the scale of global sugar beet beta vulgaris production 275 mt from 4 8 mha faostat 2018 and the crop s sensitivity water stress optimal irrigation management is essential with turkey being the fifth largest producer of sugar beet 19 mt from 307 kha faostat 2018 and 40 of this production being in the semiarid konya basin topak et al 2016 water management of sugar beet is also a key issue for turkey water resources in the konya basin are limited by low precipitation and high evapotranspiration et consequently irrigation in this area is essential and demand on aquifers continues to grow productivity of sugar beet crops is strongly influenced by irrigation management morillo velarde 2010 and climatic conditions pidgeon et al 2001 with water stress impacting sugar beet yield sugar concentration and quality shrestha et al 2010 therefore it is imperative to estimate et to accurately manage irrigation of sugar beet to ensure economic yield and quality especially in arid and semiarid such as konya regions crop et etc is calculated from multiplying the reference et eto by the crop coefficient kc doorenbos and pruitt 1977 however estimating etc is difficult since it correlates with a number of meteorological and crop variables therefore it is nonlinear and has a complex structure many empirical equations have been suggested to estimate et from available meteorological data with inclusion of both the thermodynamic and aerodynamic components wu et al 2019 one well known eto method is the penman monteith fao pm which is the method suggested by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations as a standard method allen et al 1998 this method was evaluated under in different environment contexts and demonstrated to be superior to other empirical methods especially for the daily estimation garcia et al 2004 temesgen et al 2005 cai et al 2007 however application of the fao pm method has important limitations as this requires access to numerous meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed as model inputs fan et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 ferreira and da cunha 2020 ideally these inputs should have been recorded a site appropriate meteorological stations however for an area of interest there may only be limited or inferior quality data verifiable which would be a significant constraint for many locations around the world paredes et al 2018 fang et al 2020 therefore simplified empirical equations with less meteorological input data are used in these locations for example temperature based equations hargreaves and samani 1985 radiation based equations priestley and taylor 1972 and mass transfer based equations brockamp and wenner 1963 in addition estimation of eto is difficult using empirical equations due a complex and dynamic processes and it needs high quality site appropriate meteorological data therefore as an alternative modern mathematical methods including artificial intelligence models have successfully been employed to estimate eto with different combinations of meteorological data as indicated by the following examples antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 investigated ann model and empirical equations to estimate on daily eto in greece with the ann model providing acceptable performance fan et al 2019 compared light gradient boosting machine lightgbm with random forest rf and empirical equations hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert the lightgbm model estimated better than rf and the four empirical equations ferreira et al 2019 evaluated support vector machine svm and ann models for modeling eto in brazil with the ann model considered to provide satisfactory performance artificial intelligence models have been used to evaluate etc for barley garlic maize potato and wheat crops abyaneh et al 2011 studied adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and ann models comparing these with lysimetric data for predicting garlic etc and concluded that both two models are useful for this purpose hashemi and sepaskhah 2020 evaluated ann model and fao pm equation for estimation of barley etc they found that the ann model is showed better performance than fao pm equation saggi and jain 2020 used fuzzy genetic fg and regularization random forest rrf methods to estimate maize and wheat etc the fg and rrf models were found to be suitable for the estimation of maize and wheat etc shan et al 2020 applied multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model for estimation of maize etc in semiarid region and concluded that mars model is highly suitable for maize etc estimation even under lack of meteorological data this paper evaluated the performance metrics of four artificial intelligence methods for estimating sugar beet etc using limited meteorological data in comparison to the etc computed by the fao methodology using complete meteorological data the goal of this paper was not only to test the performance metrics of each artificial intelligence method relative to the other methods but also to estimate the etc values resulting from the use of different combinations of meteorological data relative to the fao methodology 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site experiment design and data collection the data of field experiment was collected during the crop growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 in çumra konya in the central anatolia region of turkey 37 33 70 n 32 47 20 e 1013 m daily weather data came from a station operated by the turkish meteorological organization in turkey 37 33 57 n 32 47 24 e 1014 m altitude data included daily maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin daily maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax rhmin global solar radiation rs and daily wind speed at 2 m above ground u2 the average tmax was 28 3 c in 2012 and 28 9 c in 2013 the average tmin was 12 8 c in 2012 and 12 8 c in 2013 average rs was 33 62 mj m2 d 1 in 2012 and 34 99 mj m2 d 1 in 2013 average rhmax was 68 3 in 2012 and 66 4 in 2013 average rhmin was 21 1 in 2012 and 21 7 in 2013 and average u2 was 1 11 m s 1 in 2012 and 1 12 m s 1 in 2013 based on köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the region is in semiarid climate with very hot dry summers and cold snowy winters the average annual total precipitation is 323 mm depending on long term data topak et al 2011 sugar beet cv stine was sown at 5 cm between plants and 45 cm between rows cv stine is one of the most preferred cultivars by farmers in the konya basin the sugar beet crops were fully irrigated in both years keeping the soil water in root zone in the range 35 40 available soil content with water uptake from the top 0 9 m of the soil profile surface drip irrigation laterals 16 mm were installed at 30 cm spacing further information about the field experiment can found in topak et al 2016 based on fao pm method reproduced below for clarity eto was estimated as 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference et mm d 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure function kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 es is saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is actual vapor pressure kpa and u2 is the mean daily wind speed m s 1 the sugar beet etc value was described as 2 e t c k c e t o where eto is reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 calculated by eq 1 and kc is crop coefficient the growing stages were observed during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 table 1 these stages were separated into four major periods as initial crop development mid season and late season stage these distinctions are essential for kc values to set corresponding growing stages the kcini fao 0 35 kcmid fao 1 20 and kcend fao 0 70 were taken from the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 the kc values of mid season and late season were required to adjust due to climate conditions of experimental site according to the following equations 3 k c m i d k c m i d f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 4 k c e n d k c e n d f a o 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where kcmid fao 1 20 and kcend fao 0 70 are middle and end season crop coefficients for sugar beet crop h is the height of the sugar beet rhmin is the minimum relative humidity and u2 is the wind speed at 2 m above ground m s 1 from the experiment site 2 2 artificial intelligence methods in literature many artificial intelligence methods have been presented for et estimations among these methods knn svm and ab are performed the most effective tools among the data mining algorithms wu et al 2008 in this study these three methods knn svm and ab are used to compare the performance metrics of daily sugar beet etc estimation in respect to well known rf method the rf method is one of the widely adopted tree based ensemble methods which is also called traditional methods liu et al 2012 in summary the methods are explained in below 2 2 1 k nearest neighbor the k nearest neighbor knn was introduced by cover and hart 1967 which is commonly applied method among the data mining models wu et al 2008 also the knn has been used in previous studies for estimation of et feng and tian 2020 granata et al 2020 yamaç and todorovic 2020 the knn method is a nonparametric and lazy learning algorithm that requires no information on the primary data features to set the unknown sample to the k nearest samples therefore the method is effected from the irrelevant and redundant features however the method is easy to apply and also effective to use the method works as a new coming sample is categorized using one identified sample which is neighboring to the new coming sample this procedure depends on the metrics used for regression and classification purposes one of the most commonly known distance metrics is euclidean distance also called as the straight line distance therefore the euclidean distance equation was applied to estimate the value of etc in this study 2 2 2 support vector machine the support vector machine svm method was proposed by vapnik 1995 which is also one of the main methods of data mining wu et al 2008 likewise the svm is well known and widely used algorithms for estimation of et shrestha and shukla 2015 yao et al 2017 dou and yang 2018 fan et al 2018 tang et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 this method was used as a benchmarking in order to evaluate the performance metric of other artificial intelligence models evaluated in the study the svm is a supervised method that has the ability to solve the regression and classification problems due to its powerful capacity to focus on the complex nonlinear process of input variables it uses a set of kernel functions such as polynomial nonlinear linear sigmoid and radial basis function rbf these functions transform low dimensional input space into a higher dimensional space in this way the method has advantageous for solving nonlinear separation problems in this study among the kernel functions the rbf was used to estimate daily sugar beet etc due to its superior performance the previous studies showed that the rbf provided better performance in the estimation of et fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 tang et al 2018 2 2 3 random forest the random forest rf was introduced by breiman 2001 and has been applied in many studies for estimation of eto e g feng et al 2017a shiri 2018 da silva júnior et al 2019 fan et al 2019 however it appears not to have been used for the estimation of etc in any previous studies the rf is a supervised ensemble method that is applied both for solving regression and classification problems in reality the forest consist of trees and more trees the more robust the forest similarly the random forest method creates independent decision trees by selecting a training sample randomly after getting the prediction from each of the decision trees the final results are determined by averaging of all the trees for the regression problem however the final result is selected by all trees voting for the classification problem the rf has the ability to overcome the high dimensional data and strong nonlinear problems which reduces the overfitting by averaging the results feng et al 2017a 2 2 4 adaptive boosting the adaptive boosting ab model was first proposed by freund and schapire 1997 and is also a widely used data mining algorithm due to its simplified application and accurate estimation wu et al 2008 it is a supervised learning method and one of the first boosting algorithms to adapt for solving both classification and regression problems among the artificial intelligence methods the ab model decreases the noise data in features since it works according to the weak learner which is used to improve the performance ferreira et al 2020 the main idea of the model is that it trains first its weak classifiers individually and then ensembles many weak classifiers into a single strong classifier moreover it is combined with other artificial intelligence algorithms to boost the performance metrics of the ab model schapire 2013 in summary the ab model is a basic enhancing method of weak classification algorithms and this method improves data classification by decreasing variance and bias of the data through continuous training wu et al 2020 2 3 input combinations of meteorological data and performance evaluation as indicated in table 2 eight available input combinations based on crop coefficient maximum and minimum temperature were employed to evaluate the impacts of different meteorological variables on daily sugar beet etc estimation the eight input combinations of the artificial intelligence models can be seen in table 2 the standardization was done for all datasets to improve the modelling performance the standardization equation was used as follows 5 z i j x i̇ j μ s d where x i̇ j is the observation value µ is the average value and sd is the standard deviation value from the average all the daily observed dataset from growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 were separated into two subsets for training 70 and testing 30 also k fold cross validation was employed for the larger dataset the dataset were divided into 10 fold in this way it evaluated the predictive models by dividing to datasets into a training set for train and a testing set for evaluating fig 1 shows flowchart of the applied artificial intelligence models the performance metrics of artificial intelligence methods between observed and simulated etc values were assessed using the mean squared error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 which are described as 6 m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 7 r m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 8 m a e i 1 n e i o i n 9 r 2 1 0 ı 1 n o i e i 2 ı 1 n o i o 2 where ei and oi are estimated and observed values respectively o is the mean value of the observed values 3 results and discussion 3 1 adjustment of input variables detailed meteorological conditions for the sugar beet experimental site in the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 are shown in fig 2 these meteorological observations were largely as expected in both growing seasons tmax tmin and rs increased until the end of august then decreased until the end of the growing season the opposite trend was observed for rhmax and rhmin u2 fluctuated considerably during both growing seasons a correlation matrix between the input variables and etc is given in table 3 indicating that the highest correlation was observed between etc and kc 0 92 values therefore kc was added to all combinations as an input the second best correlation was observed between air temperature variables tmax and tmin and etc which were also the most correlated of the meteorological variables which is consistent with estimation of et by air temperature methods e g hargreaves and samani 1985 previously giving satisfactory results in arid and semiarid areas feng et al 2017b tabari and talaee 2011 the third highest correlation of 0 43 was between rs and etc this observation is reliable with the results of zhao et al 2010 who found that the temperature based method gave a better result than solar radiation based method in an arid area the fourth highest correlation of 0 31 was between etc and u2 similarly tabari et al 2013 found a high correlation between etc and u2 though less than for temperature and rs on the contrary negative correlation was obtained between relative humidity rhmax and rhmin and etc with the values of 0 48 and 0 33 respectively also abyaneh et al 2011 indicated the least correlation was between etc and relative humidity when estimating et stages of the sugar beet growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 are given in table 1 the growth periods were 172 d in 2012 and 148 d in 2013 the lengths of four major stages initial crop development mid season and late season were 25 40 60 and 47 d in 2012 and 20 38 60 and 30 d in 2013 according to the eqs 6 and 7 the kcmid and kcend values were calibrated considering to sugar beet height rhmin and u2 for the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 sugar beet height reached 0 5 m and was as reported by allen et al 1998 the calibrated values of kcmid and kcend were 1 24 and 0 74 for 2012 and 1 24 and 0 73 for 2013 respectively the modified kcmid and kcend were found close values with the in literature chegini et al 2010 found that kcmid of 1 12 in iran is slightly lower than those in the present study which will relate to the different agrometeorological conditions however ebrahimipak and ghalebi 2014 reported kcend of 0 70 for sugar beet crop which is reached close value in this study 3 2 performance of artificial intelligence methods the performance metrics of the four artificial intelligence methods for estimating daily sugar beet etc are presented in table 4 for the eight input combinations in training and testing subsets scatter plots of observed and simulated daily sugar beet etc values are presented in figs 3 6 for the knn svm rf and ab models respectively for the eight input combinations likewise fig 7 shows the box plots of daily sugar beet etc estimated by the knn svm rf and ab models for the eight input combinations input combinations are important in the accuracy of et estimation by artificial intelligence methods therefore the estimated daily sugar beet etc values varied significantly depending on models and input combinations table 2 all models gave accurate daily sugar beet etc estimates during training and testing with r2 mae rmse and mse ranging 0 799 0 988 0 156 0 832 mm d 1 0 219 1 128 mm d 1 and 0 048 1 273 mm d 1 respectively the advantage of these nonparametric methods in comparison to empirical methods is that they need no former and specific information about the correlation between internal variables to reach a result gocić et al 2015 yamaç et al 2020 in general with the testing subset the fifth combination with inputs of kc tmax tmin and rs performed best with the svm and ab models while the eighth combination with inputs of kc tmax tmin rhmax rhmin rs and u2 with rf and third combination with inputs of kc tmax tmin and rs performed best with the knn model the poorest performance was for the knn and svm models in the fourth combination and the rf and ab models in the first combination the knn model was reached the highest performance when k value was set to five the performance metrics for sugar beet etc when applying knn model with eight input combinations knn1 to knn8 was the poorest of the models when etc was estimated with kc tmax tmin rhmax rhmin data knn4 with r2 of 0 842 mae of 0 773 mm d 1 rmse of 1 002 mm d 1 and mse of 1 003 mm d 1 the estimation improved by than 45 for mse rmse and mae with the third combination with rs data along with tmax tmin and kc knn3 also for the testing subset this combination performed best of the knn models with r2 of 0 961 mae of 0 381 mm d 1 rmse of 0 500 mm d 1 and mse of 0 250 mm d 1 for the svm model the radial basis function was used as a kernel function to estimate sugar beet etc due to its better performance than other kernel functions for the testing subset the svm4 model with kc tmax tmin and rhmax rhmin gave the poorest performance with r2 of 0 892 mae of 0 650 mm d 1 rmse of 0 826 mm d 1 and mse of 0 682 mm d 1 a relevant improvement was obtained for the eighth combination when rs and u2 data were included in svm model with r2 of 0 985 mae of 0 233 rmse of 0 312 to mm d 1 and mse of 0 097 mm d 1 the svm model gave the best performance for sugar beet etc estimate with the fifth input combination including kc tmax tmin rs and u2 with r2 of 0 992 mae of 0 557 mm d 1 rmse of 0 699 mm d 1 and mse of 0 048 mm d 1 the rf model was obtained the best performance when the number of trees was fixed to 10 table 4 the model gave the poorest performance for the first combination with r2 of 0 848 mae of 0 753 mm d 1 rmse of 0 982 mm d 1 and mse of 0 964 mm d 1 the statistical indicators showed similar performance to the rf model for the second and sixth input combinations the highest performance was obtained for the rf8 with inputs of tmax tmin rhmax rhmin rs and u2 in the testing subset with r2 of 0 963 mae of 0 338 mm d 1 rmse of 0 485 mm d 1 and mse of 0 236 mm d 1 in this study a decision tree was used for boosting the ab model the most satisfactory result was obtained when the number of learning rates set to one and the number of estimators set to 50 table 4 the ab model performed best with the fifth input combination with r2 of 0 959 mae of 0 341 mm d 1 rmse of 0 510 mm d 1 and mse of 0 260 mm d 1 and the poorest performance was obtained with the first combination with r2 of 0 799 mae

are shown in figs 3 6 the plotted data points generally correlated close to the identity line however the first and forth combinations for all applied artificial intelligence methods knn svm rf and ab produced more scattered estimates than the other combinations the sugar beet etc values estimated by with third fifth seventh and eighth combinations were closer to those observed etc values among the models the svm model data points were closer to the identity line this consistency showed that applied artificial intelligence methods using the third fifth seventh and eighth input combinations and the svm model provided acceptable estimation accuracy of daily sugar beet etc values fig 7 shows the box plots of observed daily sugar beet etc values estimated by knn svm rf and ab models for the eight input combinations during the testing subset the figures show that the distribution of the estimated daily sugar beet etc values were close to those observed etc values especially svm for the third fifth seventh and eighth combinations gave better estimation of for daily sugar beet etc than the other models which further confirmed the value of the svm model for accurately estimating daily sugar beet etc values therefore the svm model is recommended for its ability accurately estimating daily sugar beet etc the rf model gave the best estimation of etc when all input data were included rf8 several studies indicated that the artificial intelligence methods using complete input data provide the best performance for estimating of etc abyaneh et al 2011 used the anfis and ann models with complete meteorological data for garlic etc estimate in a semiarid area of iran similarly aghajanloo et al 2013 estimated ann neural network genetic algorithm and multivariate nonlinear regression models with complete meteorological data for potato etc estimate in northwestern iran however other artificial intelligence methods knn svm and ab gave the best estimation of sugar beet etc in the present study when input data were limited the performance of the knn3 model with kc tmax tmin and u2 was better than with any other input combinations likewise the svm and ab models with kc tmax tmin rs and u2 the fifth combination performed better than with other input combinations the performance metrics indicated that the etc estimation with knn svm and ab did not improve with complete data input this result confirmed by table 3 indicating correlation between the sugar beet etc and input variables the highest to lowest positive correlations were tmax tmin rs and u2 with etc whereas rhmax rhmin had negative correlations with etc in contrast the rf model gave a better result with complete input data these findings demonstrated that the rf model has the ability for improved performance even when an input variable not positively correlated to etc value is included the performance metrics obtained demonstrate satisfactory performance of knn svm rf and ab models for example the rf model with limited input variables had similar performance to the rrf model with complete data input saggi and jain 2020 the svm model with kc tmax tmin rs and u2 svm5 gave lesser rmse and mae values than the svm model with complete data input tang et al 2018 in the present study all the applied models gave lower mse and mae and higher r2 values in third fifth and eighth combinations compared to tcn dnn and lstm models with complete data input chen et al 2020 4 conclusions this study applied artificial intelligence methods to estimate sugar beet etc which are an essential variable for efficient irrigation management of this crop especially in water limited semiarid areas artificial intelligence methods have become increasingly important in agricultural water management these methods have the ability to be applied to smart irrigation approach using the newest technologies of sensor that collect data in real time the performance metrics of four artificial intelligence methods knn svm rf and ab were compared with eight combinations of meteorological data the overall result indicated that rs was more significant than the u2 rhmax and rhmin for daily sugar beet etc estimation in the semiarid area studied the knn svm and ab models obtained satisfactory daily sugar beet etc estimates with less meteorological input variables the highest performance was obtained for the fifth combination which included kc tmax tmin rs and u2 notably only the rf model performed best with a complete set of input data in this study sugar beet etc estimation was performed under optimal water intake and it was found that all the artificial intelligence methods gave satisfactory results even with limited meteorological input data this shows that these methods can be applied in areas where the meteorological data are limited however further studies should be conducted under a scenario of limited water supply where the area faces water scarcity due to a lack of water resources these findings will be important for better management of irrigation activities in the konya but will equally be of value when applied to different crops areas and environmental conditions

10034,optimization of nitrogen n fertigation is a formidable challenge involving complex interactions between water and n uptake and their effects on crop production numerical models can be useful in studying the interaction of multiple variables like those found in mechanistic simulations of n fertigation strategies the physical aspects can often be accurately represented in soil plant atmosphere continuum models while the biological factors lag due to their oversimplification when optimizing n fertigation using numerical models it is essential to consider the effects of n and water stresses on the plant size and corresponding feedback on potential transpiration and n uptake the hydrus 2d 3d model was modified to allow for active uptake and decay of multiple solutes and reduce potential transpiration due to a limitation in n uptake subsequently we calibrated and validated the model with a dataset that consisted of 3 nitrate no3 concentration and 6 irrigation levels a total of 18 distinct treatments used to fertigate cucumber plants grown in lysimeters the calibration was based on the treatment that received the highest n fertigation the model was validated by testing its ability to accurately reduce potential n uptake and transpiration in water and n deficiency cases simulations showed that the n stress function could explain 82 of the reduction in transpiration measured in the experimental setup the sensitivity analysis evaluating the effects of the root shape and distribution parameters by increasing and decreasing their values by 20 showed that these parameters had little impact on the results following its validation the model was used to determine the optimal n concentration in irrigation water and the optimal n application amount to obtain maximal yield with minimal n loss the optimal irrigation water no3 n concentration and seasonal no3 n application were determined to be 75 mg l 1 and 40 mg m 2 respectively graphical abstract ga1

applications wang et al 2019 and is correlated to the size of the world population erisman et al 2008 the need for nitrogen n fertilizer to meet the growing global food demand and the environmental concerns associated with no3 leaching thompson et al 2020 have led to the recognition that many of the world s sustainability goals can be achieved by optimizing agricultural n use houlton et al 2019 among the agricultural crops horticultural crops are prone to the highest no3 losses due to high fertilizer application rates and their relatively shallow root zone padilla et al 2018 fertigation fertilizer application through irrigation water has been demonstrated to maximize plant n uptake while minimizing no3 leaching dahan et al 2014 groenveld et al 2019 matching the n supply to the n demand in space and time is a complex problem that depends on many factors including the plant water and n demand the root distribution the soil hydraulic and solute transport properties the n concentration of the irrigation water the timing of the fertigation and the total amount of water and n applied while simple analytical models of yield response to n application are helpful cerrato and blackmer 1990 they often give contradicting results concerning optimal n application groenveld et al 2019 and only address the total amount of n that should be applied gallardo et al 2020 with larger data sets more complex analytical models can be developed głąb et al 2020 but these lack the flexibility to be applied to different crops or environmental conditions the complex interactions in space and time of the variables mentioned above make the optimization of n fertigation a highly non linear problem which requires numerical models to approximate a solution azad et al 2020 an increase in computer processing power and availability of detailed datasets offers the possibility of opening up empirical black boxes in numerical models so that processes can be described in an increasingly mechanistic fashion and in greater detail a more mechanistic model will be relevant to a wider variety of plants and will be flexible to changes in the soil type or irrigation frequency several models have been developed to describe n leaching from agricultural systems the dndc model simulates crop growth and development as well as carbon c and n biogeochemistry in agricultural ecosystems he et al 2019 the coup model is a versatile platform of different modules that can be used to simulate a wide range of n transformations including plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi he et al 2020 a limitation of these models is that they are one dimensional one dimensional models are suitable to model only vegetations horizontally invariant such as pasture eshel and beeckman 2013 however even in grass fields lateral dimensions have to be considered under certain conditions such as with sloping land or land with urine patches left by grazing cattle snow et al 2017 while multiple dimensions significantly increase the computational time required for simulations they are often essential to describe the complexity of irrigated agricultural systems that are not horizontally invariant russo et al 2013 single root models simulate the root system as a cylinder taking up water and nutrients from the soil volume around it an advantage of such models is that flow and transport through the soil and across the root membrane can be calculated separately yielding a more mechanistic formulation eshel and beeckman 2013 mcmurtrie and näsholm 2018 however the difficulty of upscaling the results of such models is a disadvantage roose and schnepf 2008 particularly when studying processes at the root zone scale to simulate solute uptake by roots the solute s movement to the root surface rengel 1993 the root growth and the demand controlled aspect of uptake should be considered hopmans and bristow 2002 while the first two factors are receiving increasing attention in models like r swms javaux et al 2008 schröder et al 2013 the third one i e the demand control aspect has seen limited implementation in 3d models an n limited plant can increase n uptake by increasing the uptake per surface area or increasing the total root area it is possible to estimate each of these pathways contributions using detailed models such as r swms in combination with measured data however the simultaneous consideration of all of these three factors is limited due to many parameters required rengel 1993 and the difficulty of determining them roose and schnepf 2008 the passage of nutrients from the soil solution into the plant can be described by passive or active mechanisms which refer to the mass flow of nutrients into roots with water taken up for transpiration or against energy gradients respectively barber 1962 estimated passive uptake by multiplying the volume of transpired water with the nutrient s mean concentration in the bulk soil solution however this method may overestimate an actual ion supply by water mass flow jungk 2002 epstein and hagen 1952 proposed using the michaelis menten model to describe the characteristics of individual membrane carriers involved in active nutrient uptake the uptake rate per root area differs according to the root order rewald et al 2011 the root order changes as roots grow and there is potential compensation of reduced nutrient uptake from nutrient poor areas by increased uptake from less nutrient stressed areas of the root zone rubio and lynch 2007 the macroscopic numerical model hydrus 2d 3d considers transient water flow solute transport and compensated plant root water and nutrient uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 these are calculated as a function of soil hydraulic properties irrigation salinity and amount root distribution potential evapotranspiration and potential nutrient uptake all of which are described in detail in the model technical and user manuals šejna et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2018b the water flow algorithm in hydrus 2d 3d has been widely tested and used for different applications šimůnek et al 2016 including root water uptake zhu et al 2009 n transport and uptake bristow et al 2020 gärdenäs et al 2005 karandish and šimůnek 2017 tao et al 2021 wang et al 2014 and the effects of salinity phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 shouse et al 2011 skaggs et al 2006 wang and baerenklau 2014 linked crop yield to relative transpiration and n uptake in the dataset they generated with hydrus 1d using a function of pang and letey 1998 levers and schwabe 2017 took this a step further by calculating the instantaneous yield reduction by comparing potential and actual water and passive n uptake throughout the growing season instead of only at the end using a modified version of hydrus 1d rezaei et al 2017 used a plant growth model lingra n wolf 2012 to determine the effect of n stress on the plant s potential uptake which was then fed back to hydrus 1d the effects of limited nutrient uptake on growth i e a transpiration reduction have not yet been implemented in the standard version of hydrus because biomass accumulation is a function of both transpiration and n uptake and determines their potential rates these processes should be linked so that stress in either process affects the other s potential rate although the active nutrient uptake function was implemented into the hydrus 2d 3d model more than ten years ago it has only been validated for nh4 uptake in flooded rice paddies li et al 2015 yang et al 2017 while it is understood that nitrate no3 uptake by plant roots can be described by michaelis menten kinetics tischner and kaiser 2007 all published hydrus simulations validated with no3 uptake data do so using the passive uptake mechanism only this might be due to the lack of a function in the model that reduces plant growth due to n stress representing a formidable research gap in modeling n transport and uptake our research objective is to validate the combined passive active and compensated no3 uptake functions in hydrus 2d 3d using measured data while considering a function that reduces potential transpiration due to n stress subsequently we demonstrate the use of this model as a tool for optimizing n fertigation in terms of n use efficiency nue yield and no3 leaching 2 methods 2 1 field experiment and measurements 2 1 1 experimental design the data used to calibrate and validate the model was taken from groenveld et al 2019 where a more detailed description of the experimental setup can be found the effluent water of three recirculating aquaculture systems with no3 n concentrations of 30 60 and 90 mg l 1 named a30 a60 and a90 respectively were used to fertigate six lysimeters per each n treatment three cucumber plants spaced 40 cm apart were grown in each lysimeter in a single row each lysimeter was 100 cm long 50 cm wide and 20 cm deep the growing medium used was perlite perlite 206 agrikal israel whose grain size distribution is listed in table 1 aside from n all other nutrients were kept at equal concentrations in all treatments irrigation water was cooled to 24 c and applied through a 6 mm tube to the base of each of the three plants at a combined flow rate of 0 67 mm min drainage water was collected and weighed daily transpiration was calculated by subtracting drainage from irrigation ignoring a possible change in the root zone water content tripler et al 2012 each lysimeter had a unique irrigation regime a multiple of measured transpiration irrigation transpiration i t between 1 and 5 overall there were 18 distinct fertigation treatments of cucumber plants grown in perlite media fig 1a because plant transpiration determined irrigation while the no3 concentration remained the same n fertigation was indirectly also a function of plant transpiration 2 1 2 measurements and analysis irrigation water was sampled daily and drainage water of all 18 lysimeters three times a week to measure the electrical conductivity ec dds 120w bante instruments china and no3 n concentration reflectoquant nitrate test 116971 merck kgaa germany and orion star a214 thermo fisher scientific ma usa ripe cucumbers were harvested daily starting 20 days after transplanting dat cucumbers were weighed individually for each of the three plants in each plot all plants were destructively harvested at 40 dat the dry biomass of fruits stems and leaves was measured and then tested for n content oea chns flash 2000 thermo fisher scientific ma usa the water and n mass balance components included a precise record of the amounts of water applied their concentrations each fertigation event s timing and daily records of transpiration and no3 leached out of the lysimeter the growth rate and yield of the cucumber plants were recorded daily the total uptake of n and its distribution in different plant parts was determined at the end of the experiment once the experiment was terminated the root zone was cut into three blocks of equal sizes perlite was washed off the roots through a 3 mm sieve and the roots were then dried and weighed the root n content was not measured but an estimated value of 5 was used for all treatments in subsequent calculations groenveld et al 2019 the amounts of n taken up by the plants and drained out of the root zone as no3 are reported for each of the 18 treatments as a function of the amount of fertigated no3 n in fig 1b the difference between the amount of n fertigated and the sum of n taken up and drained is assumed to be due to emissions of gaseous forms of n 2 1 3 parameter estimation experiments the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured with the falling head method wever et al 2004 using 20 cm cores of perlite in transparent columns with a 15 cm diameter the columns were slowly wetted from below to prevent the trapping of air in the columns the time it took for a ponded layer of 15 cm of water to drop 12 cm was measured four times for three different columns filled with perlite at a bulk density of 0 06 g cm 3 a retention curve was obtained using a pvc column of 11 cm in diameter and 100 cm in length that was cut into 5 cm slices the slices were stacked to form a column that was sealed airtight with plastic tape the column was packed with perlite at the same density as in the greenhouse experiment 0 06 g cm 3 and gradually wetted from below over a 24 h period to ensure that the air was pushed out of the column subsequently the entire column was removed from the water bath placed on an electronic scale and covered with a lid to eliminate evaporation the mass readings were recorded over time with decreasing frequency as less water drained out of the column when the drainage water flux stopped after a few days and the column was assumed to be at a hydrostatic state the 5 cm slices were cut off the column wrapped in a silver foil and weighed these slices were then dried at 105 c and reweighed resulting in a retention curve consisting of 20 pairs of height and volumetric water content raij et al 2016 this experiment was repeated four times breakthrough curves were obtained for all 18 plots to determine the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities λ l and λ t of the growing media used irrigation water was applied in 3 l pulses at three evenly spaced locations in the plot s centerline where the plants would later be located all plots were flushed two days with saline irrigation water used in all experiments ec 2 28 0 15 ds m 1 then on the third day they were irrigated with five 3 l pulses of distilled water ec 0 11 0 05 ds m 1 after which irrigation continued with saline water as before after every 3 l irrigation pulse drainage water was collected for all 18 plots and its electrical conductivity was measured 2 2 modeling 2 2 1 model description hydrus 2d 3d describes unsaturated flow using the richards equation solute transport using the convection dispersion equation and solute transformation using first order decay reactions potential plant water and nutrient uptakes are specified in hydrus 2d 3d as input time variable boundary conditions distributed across the root zone according to a root density distribution over time the root distribution can be fixed entered as an array of values described using a logistic growth function šimůnek et al 2018a or linked to various environmental factors hartmann et al 2017 potential water uptake can be reduced due to drought and salinity stresses however these stress effects do not accumulate over time in the current version of hydrus 2d 3d nutrient uptake is considered as passive or active mechanisms active uptake is described by a modified version of the michaelis menten equation 1 a a s s min k m s s min a p where a a is the actual active solute uptake rate mg day 1 a p is the potential active solute uptake rate which is the remainder of total potential uptake after subtracting passive uptake mg day 1 s is the substrate concentration mg cm 2 s min is the minimal concentration for active uptake mg cm 2 and k m mg cm 2 is the michaelis menten coefficient which is equal to the substrate concentration corresponding to half of the maximum solute uptake rate jungk 2002 the maximum solute uptake rate and the k m parameter for the michaelis menten model are usually determined based on solute uptake per root length or area using a dimensionless root distribution makes it possible to cancel these root area units kim and lieth 2012 scaled the maximum solute uptake rate in their model to the total plant requirement by multiplying the michaelis menten equation by the plant dry matter over time sands and smethurst 1995 also linked the maximum solute uptake rate linearly to the plant water uptake rate active solute uptake can be limited by limited uptake of water šimůnek and hopmans 2009 2 a p t max r p t t ac t t p t p a t 0 where a p is potential active uptake mg day 1 at a certain point in time t r p is potential solute

they can be converted to cm3 by multiplying by the plot s length compensation of water or solute uptake in a less stressed area of the root zone can be enabled according to the degree determined by the user 2 2 2 domain geometry and fixed boundary conditions a two dimensional flow domain 18 cm deep and 25 cm wide was discretized using a finite element mesh of 350 nodes with smaller elements at the points where water entered and left the domain lazarovitch et al 2005 fig 2 as the discretization had a large effect on the mass balance error the number of nodes was optimized to minimize the whole data set s mass balance error the left side of the domain forms a line of symmetry in the middle of the plot exactly under the dripline and the plant s base considered as line features the distance between plants in the lysimeter was 40 cm and the drainage holes in the drainage trench at the bottom of the lysimeter were spaced at 15 cm emitters at the dripline were spaced at 40 cm which resulted in a small overlap of the wetting patterns kandelous et al 2011 a time variable flux boundary condition was used to represent the ponded area under the irrigation water emitter drainage outflow at the bottom occurred through a 0 5 cm wide seepage face boundary condition the sides of the lysimeter were represented by a no flow boundary condition fig 2 2 2 3 input parameters model specific parameters are required to describe water flow solute transport and transformations and root water and solute uptake the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 was used to describe soil hydraulic properties and hysteresis was not considered retc 6 02 van genuchten et al 1991 was used to determine the saturated water content ɵ s residual water content ɵ r and the shape parameters α and n for solute transport the crank nicholson scheme was used for time weighting and galerkin finite element scheme was used for space weighting the molecular diffusion coefficient is usually negligible in soils radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 and was therefore set to zero for the perlite medium used the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities λ l and λ t were calculated from collected breakthrough curves using the inverse mode of hydrus 2d 3d the irrigation water amount and salinity were used as the time variable boundary conditions at the top of the domain the drainage water electrical conductivity measured after each irrigation pulse was used as the data for the inverse solution the dispersivity was determined as the average value of the 18 plots the s shaped water stress function van genuchten 1987 was used to represent water stress with parameters p 50 of 200 cm and p w3 of 3 this relatively high value for the p 50 parameter was used to ensure high sensitivity to water stress the typical value for horticultural crops is lower groenveld et al 2013 the s shaped salinity stress function van genuchten and hoffman 1984 was used to model the transpiration response to salinity with a c 50 value of 3 ds m 1 and a p s3 value of 3 these values are typical for cucumber maas and hoffman 1977 the interaction between salinity and water stresses was considered multiplicative the osmotic coefficient φ was set to 1 as the irrigation water salinity units ds m 1 were the same as those of the stress response function šejna et al 2018 the maximum possible n concentration of water taken up by the roots for passive uptake was set at 1000 mg l 1 to allow for unlimited passive uptake the k m parameter of the michaelis menten equation eq 1 for no3 n was assumed to be 1 mg l 1 which is at the lower end of the 0 3 6 mg l 1 range reported for high affinity transport systems of no3 n in horticultural crops le bot and adamowicz 2006 2 2 4 time variable boundary conditions the time variable boundary conditions consisted of the measured amounts of irrigation water with specified no3 n concentrations unique for every 18 treatments we used the highest measured transpiration and n uptake plot 1 treatment a90 i t 3 2 as potential transpiration and n uptake for all treatments as n uptake was only measured at the end of the season potential n uptake was distributed throughout the season at a fixed ratio in relation to measured transpiration as total transpiration was measured in daily increments potential transpiration was fixed throughout 12 h of daylight and set to zero at nighttime the initial conditions were not precisely known since the plots had already received fertigation for two weeks before transplanting to eliminate the effect of starting simulations with homogenous water and solute distributions in the root zone water contents and solute concentrations 5 dat were inserted as initial conditions as transpiration was still minimal while the decay reactions were already taking place the root zone density distribution was described according to a formula developed by vrugt et al 2001 3 b x z 1 z z m 1 x x m e p z z m z z p x x m x x where b is the spatial distribution of the root density in two dimensions x z z m and x m are the maximal vertical and horizontal rooting distances from the base of the plant respectively which were the limits of the lysimeter cm z and x are the depth and radius of the maximal uptake intensity estimated at 5 cm each and p z and p x are dimensionless shape parameters that describe the non symmetry in root water uptake in two dimensions x z the root growth rate g r x z was estimated as 1 cm day 1 in the x and z directions until the lysimeter s edge was reached the root zone distribution and growth rate in the experiment were unknown and were thus estimated an increase in root growth due to n deficiency observed in the measured data at 40 dat groenveld et al 2019 was not considered in these simulations 2 2 5 model modification the hydrus 2d 3d model version 3 01 was modified to enable solute transformations and active uptake simultaneously three solutes are considered the first solute acts like a tracer to represent salinity the second solute represents n in the form of no3 which can be taken up by the plant roots drain out of the root zone or decay into a daughter product which was the third solute that represents a gaseous denitrification product no n2o or n2 nutrient uptake can be passive or active and denitrification is considered the first order reaction with a rate constant k d an additional formulation was implemented to consider the reduction in potential transpiration as a function of n stress considered as a ratio of actual and potential cumulative n uptake until that time that was calculated at every time step 4 t p new t p input r a r p where t p new is adjusted potential transpiration cm2 day 1 tp input is maximal potential transpiration of unstressed plants cm2 day 1 entered as input and r a r p is relative n uptake this is based on the understanding that relative transpiration is a linear function of the relative growth rate de wit 1958 which is a linear function of the relative n addition rate ingestad 1982 2 2 6 comparison with measured data data analysis the simulated results of water flow and solute transport were converted into units of mm and g m 2 respectively to facilitate the comparison to measured data as transpiration and n leaching fluxes were measured on a near daily basis the root mean square error rmse was calculated for these 2 data sets over time to assess the deviation between simulated and measured data for each treatment 5 rmse i n o m 2 n where o and m are observed and simulated values and n the number of data pairs when rmse values of measurements with different units were compared i e transpiration mm and leached n g m 2 they were normalized nrmse by dividing the rmse value by the corresponding maximal measured value of each data set to compare cumulative simulated and measured data across all treatments a linear reduction of the modeled data as a function of the measured data was compared with the 1 1 line the coefficient of determination r 2 refers to the fit of the modelled data to the linear reduction model 2 2 7 calibration some parameters could be estimated or calculated based on measured data others were taken from the literature and some were calibrated using the hydrus model the calibration was carried out using data from the plot that received the highest fertigation plot 1 treatment a90 i t 3 2 see fig 1 the objective function for the calibration of optimized parameters was defined as an average of the nrmse values for transpiration and leached n the parameters were sequentially optimized by trial and error preserving the value of previously optimized parameters this leaves the possibility that a change in a subsequently optimized parameter could change the optimal value of a previously optimized parameter 2 2 8 validation after determining the optimal parameters for the data from the plot that received the highest fertigation the other 17 plots were run with the same parameters to validate the function that reduces potential transpiration as a function of n uptake eq 4 the linear regression of the cumulative modeled data was compared with the 1 1 line of the measured data the rmse of transpiration and leached n over time were compared for each treatment 2 2 9 calculation of active uptake to calculate the contribution of active n uptake to total n uptake the hydrus 2d 3d simulations were run with and without active uptake enabled and stopped at the end of each daily time step the difference in n uptake between the two simulations was considered the active uptake contribution the simulation was continued in this manner till the end of the season with the results of the active uptake enabled simulation for the previous day used as the initial conditions for the subsequent day cumulative active uptake was divided by cumulative total uptake and reported as a percentage for each treatment these values were compared with a percentage of active uptake u act calculated according to a modified version of the barber 1962 calculation 6 u act u tot n av t tot u tot 100 where u tot is total nutrient uptake g n av is the spatiotemporal average nutrient concentration of the soil solution g l 1 and t tot is total transpiration l 2 2 10 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of all 18 simulations to individual parameters was demonstrated by running the simulations with all parameters fixed but increasing and decreasing the analyzed parameter by 20 the studied parameters included z x p z and p x which describe the root zone density distribution eq 3 the first order degradation rate constant k d the michaelis menten coefficient k m from eq 1 and the solute and water uptake compensation parameters ω c and ω c the results were analyzed by comparing the slope and intercept of the cumulative transpiration and n leaching data to the 1 1 line and the average nrmse of transpiration and leached n 2 2 11 optimization in fertigation of horticultural crops the factors most easily controlled by the grower are the amount of irrigation water its fertilizer concentration and the irrigation frequency as in the experimental setup the irrigation frequency was a function of the amount of applied irrigation water distributed evenly throughout the day in pulses of 1 min duration at a rate of 0 67 mm min the other environmental conditions such as potential transpiration and n uptake the media type and irrigation water salinity were the same as in the experiment described above the calibrated and validated model was used to find the optimal combination of n concentration in irrigation water and the total n applied the optimal combination should be close to the highest measured transpiration and n uptake with the lowest amount of n lost to leaching or gaseous emissions water and n use efficiencies wue and nue were defined as the amounts of water transpired or n taken up divided by the amount applied nue is a measure that can be used to compare the n use between different agricultural systems van groenigen et al 2010 however since minimizing the n application maximizes the nue an objective function in optimizing fertilizer application demands including a condition or constraint that a certain percentage of the maximal yield has to be achieved 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameters estimated from experimental data 3 1 1 hydraulic parameters the water content as a function of the pressure head for perlite is shown with the standard deviation in fig 3 the hydraulic parameters determined using the retc 6 02 software van genuchten et al 1991 are reported in table 2 and these were used to model the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head van genuchten 1980 fig 3 the retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of sand and loam soils from the carsel and parrish catalog 1988 are plotted in the same graph for comparison besides ensuring a well aerated root zone the large pore volume of perlite gives it an additional water holding capacity in the range of pressure heads most relevant under frequent irrigation the hydraulic conductivity of perlite at saturation was 943 cm day 1 and decreased rapidly with small increases in pressure head similar to sand but less pronounced raviv et al 2002 though the richards equation was developed to describe water flow through unsaturated soil it has also been used to model water flow in perlite li and babcock 2015 palla et al 2009 sandoval et al 2017 3 1 2 solute transport parameters the measured and simulated breakthrough curve data are shown in fig 4 the average λ l and λ t estimated were 7 9 and 0 0001 cm respectively table 2 the ratio of the λ t to the depth of the domain 7 9 cm 18 cm 0 44 is much higher than that recommended for field scale experiments in the literature which is usually only 0 1 gelhar 1986 however kim et al 2002 found a ratio of 0 3 for a conservative tracer in an unconfined sandy aquifer similarly boudreau et al 2009 reported an average ratio of 0 43 for a bromide tracer in pure sphagnum peat media 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 calibration the parameters optimized to fit measured data from the lysimeter with the highest fertigation treatment are listed as calibrated in table 2 water compensation ω c was not required and could thus be kept at 1 no compensation some n uptake compensation ω s was needed as nrmse decreased for ω s values between 1 0 and 0 9 but remained the same for further decreases of ω s the first order rate parameter k d was tested for a range of values and a distinct minimum of nrmse was found at k d 0 2 the n and water fluxes as a function of time for the calibrated simulation are shown in fig 5 simulated leached n was similar to measured values rmse 0 166 g day 1 simulated transpiration was almost perfect rmse 0 003 mm day 1 3 2 2 validation simulated cumulative transpiration and leached n are compared with the measured data in fig 6a and 6c respectively without a function to reduce potential transpiration due to a limitation in n uptake eq 4 simulated transpiration would remain 180 mm in all treatments and drop only slightly for the low i t ratio when transpiration would be reduced due to drought and salinity stress fig 1a the slope of the linear reduction of simulated transpiration is 0 82 r 2 0 976 fig 6a indicating that the n stress explains most but not all transpiration reduction the remaining reduction could still be due to the n stress which increases plant sensitivity to other stresses such as nutritional imbalance salinity or drought however this hypothesis is not supported by research combining salinity and n stress shenker et al 2003 increasing n stress led to a larger proportion of n being assigned to the roots groenveld et al 2019 which is biomass that is not involved in transpiration while it would be possible to include such mechanisms into the model this would require a more complex plant model to be implemented into the hydrus 2d 3d software with a slope of 0 99 r 2 0 954 simulated n uptake matched measured uptake well fig 6b n uptake in all simulations could not be higher than potential n uptake taken from the highest fertigation treatment n fertigation was reduced incrementally so that the nue increased in lower treatments until the plant took up almost all applied n the amount of leached n was slightly underestimated for the plots that received higher rates of fertigation getting the slope of 0 86 r 2 0 976 fig 6c simulated gaseous n emissions resulting from denitrification were lower than n missing from the n mass balance in the higher n application range with a slope of 0 46 fig 6d in the lower fertigation range the emissions were higher and in general the correlation of the linear fit to the modeled data was lower r 2 0 46 the rmse for transpiration and leached n are shown in fig 7c and 7d respectively they were low for all treatments and for both variables for transpiration the rmse increased slightly with increasing n stress the rmse for leached n decreased linearly with a reduction in leached n likely because the amounts of leached n became exceedingly small 3 2 3 active and passive uptake pathways the percentages of active n uptake of total n uptake simulated by hydrus 2d 3d and calculated according to barber 1962 eq 6 are shown in fig 8 when n is not a limiting factor fertigated n 40 mg m 2 passive uptake is overestimated by the barber calculation as was pointed out previously by jungk 2002 this underestimation of active uptake becomes more significant under deficit n fertigation 40 mg m 2 where the hydrus 2d 3d simulations show that active uptake increases with increasing n stress while a calculation according to barber shows the opposite the difference is due to the consideration of spatiotemporal n distribution by hydrus 2d 3d instead of using the single value for the soil solution n concentration used by barber 3 2 4 sensitivity analysis a 20 change in the parameters describing the shape of the root zone z x p x p z had only a very small effect on the results and did not improve the fit of measured to modeled data table 3 the solute uptake compensation ω s was 0 9 in these simulations which could explain the lack of sensitivity of leached n to the root zone shape parameters the low sensitivity of the simulated results to the root zone density distribution indicates that the lack of root data in this experimental setup is not critical a 20 change in the k m parameter had little impact on the simulated results the k m value used in the simulations was 1 mg l 1 compared to a range of values from 0 3 m to 6 mg l 1 found in the literature le bot and adamowicz 2006 the 20 change did not take the k m value out of this range and likely this parameter will only affect the simulation results when a larger change is implemented lowering of the k d parameter resulted in reduced gaseous n emissions and proportionally higher n leaching this improved the fit of the n leaching data but reduced the fit of the transpiration data the nrmse was also reduced slightly indicating that the k d parameter optimized based on the entire data may not be suitable for all treatments this may be due to changes in root zone aeration with changes in irrigation regimes increasing the solute uptake compensation reducing ω s improved the fit of the transpiration data but decreased the fit of leached n the water uptake compensation factor ω c could only be reduced since the max value of 1 was used in all simulations no compensation doing so did not improve the fit of measured data and increased the nrmse table 3 3 2 5 optimization the optimal n application under the described conditions while achieving 99 7 of the maximal yield was determined to be 40 g m 2 with an irrigation water n concentration of 75 mg l 1 this resulted in 3 0 g m 2 of n lost as gaseous emissions 6 1 g m 2 of n leaching below the root zone the nue of 0 73 and the wue of 0 34 the n fluxes transpiration nue and wue for an n application range of 30 50 g m 2 are shown for the irrigation water n concentration of 75 mg l 1 and compared with those of 45 and 105 mg l 1 fig 8 when an n application rate is below 40 g m 2 higher irrigation water n concentrations lead to more n uptake fig 8a the highest n concentration did not produce maximum transpiration as the reduced amount of irrigation water and reduced irrigation frequency limited transpiration fig 8b this reduction in transpiration also reduced active n uptake according to eq 2 plant n uptake was slightly lower for the irrigation water concentration of 105 mg l 1 than 75 mg l 1 at the n application rate of 40 mg m 2 fig 8a under deficit n application below 40 mg m 2 transpiration remained the highest for the 75 mg l 1 n concentration the n emissions were higher for the higher n application concentrations whereas the amount of leached n was higher for the lower n concentrations fig 9cd the n emissions can be in any form of gaseous n the fraction of these gaseous forms that pose an environmental threat is unknown the leached n is all in the form of no3 and thus its cost as a loss of n and environmental impacts can be evaluated the nue differs in the lower n application range but is the same for all n concentrations when the n application is higher than 42 g m 2 fig 8e there are however large differences in the wue as the lower n concentrations require more water to be applied to achieve the same n application fig 8f 4 conclusions reducing potential transpiration due to a limitation in n uptake in a modified version of the hydrus 2d 3d model could explain 82 of the reduction in transpiration measured in a cucumber fertigation experiment with 18 fertigation rates when an active uptake of no3 was considered without the n stress reduction function eq 4 simulated transpiration would remain the same for all fertigation treatments which was not the case in the experiments demonstrating the necessity for such a function to model n fate and transport accurately the hydrus 2d 3d simulations showed that the percentage of active n uptake increased with n stress in contrast to a calculation based on a spatiotemporal averaged root zone n concentration increased spatiotemporal resolution of the water and solute distribution in the root zone by hydrus 2d 3d allows for more precise quantification of the amount of solute transported by mass flow or diffusion the sensitivity of simulated results to the spatial distribution of the roots in the small domain studied was low which indicates that the lack of measured root distribution data is not critical the model was then used to determine the optimal n fertigation concentration and rate for cucumbers grown in perlite under given transpiration conditions and n demand over time addressing the combined effect of drought and n stress on potential transpiration and n uptake allows for more realistic n fertigation modeling this is essential when determining the optimal fertigation strategy declaration of competing interest

10034,optimization of nitrogen n fertigation is a formidable challenge involving complex interactions between water and n uptake and their effects on crop production numerical models can be useful in studying the interaction of multiple variables like those found in mechanistic simulations of n fertigation strategies the physical aspects can often be accurately represented in soil plant atmosphere continuum models while the biological factors lag due to their oversimplification when optimizing n fertigation using numerical models it is essential to consider the effects of n and water stresses on the plant size and corresponding feedback on potential transpiration and n uptake the hydrus 2d 3d model was modified to allow for active uptake and decay of multiple solutes and reduce potential transpiration due to a limitation in n uptake subsequently we calibrated and validated the model with a dataset that consisted of 3 nitrate no3 concentration and 6 irrigation levels a total of 18 distinct treatments used to fertigate cucumber plants grown in lysimeters the calibration was based on the treatment that received the highest n fertigation the model was validated by testing its ability to accurately reduce potential n uptake and transpiration in water and n deficiency cases simulations showed that the n stress function could explain 82 of the reduction in transpiration measured in the experimental setup the sensitivity analysis evaluating the effects of the root shape and distribution parameters by increasing and decreasing their values by 20 showed that these parameters had little impact on the results following its validation the model was used to determine the optimal n concentration in irrigation water and the optimal n application amount to obtain maximal yield with minimal n loss the optimal irrigation water no3 n concentration and seasonal no3 n application were determined to be 75 mg l 1 and 40 mg m 2 respectively graphical abstract ga1

applications wang et al 2019 and is correlated to the size of the world population erisman et al 2008 the need for nitrogen n fertilizer to meet the growing global food demand and the environmental concerns associated with no3 leaching thompson et al 2020 have led to the recognition that many of the world s sustainability goals can be achieved by optimizing agricultural n use houlton et al 2019 among the agricultural crops horticultural crops are prone to the highest no3 losses due to high fertilizer application rates and their relatively shallow root zone padilla et al 2018 fertigation fertilizer application through irrigation water has been demonstrated to maximize plant n uptake while minimizing no3 leaching dahan et al 2014 groenveld et al 2019 matching the n supply to the n demand in space and time is a complex problem that depends on many factors including the plant water and n demand the root distribution the soil hydraulic and solute transport properties the n concentration of the irrigation water the timing of the fertigation and the total amount of water and n applied while simple analytical models of yield response to n application are helpful cerrato and blackmer 1990 they often give contradicting results concerning optimal n application groenveld et al 2019 and only address the total amount of n that should be applied gallardo et al 2020 with larger data sets more complex analytical models can be developed głąb et al 2020 but these lack the flexibility to be applied to different crops or environmental conditions the complex interactions in space and time of the variables mentioned above make the optimization of n fertigation a highly non linear problem which requires numerical models to approximate a solution azad et al 2020 an increase in computer processing power and availability of detailed datasets offers the possibility of opening up empirical black boxes in numerical models so that processes can be described in an increasingly mechanistic fashion and in greater detail a more mechanistic model will be relevant to a wider variety of plants and will be flexible to changes in the soil type or irrigation frequency several models have been developed to describe n leaching from agricultural systems the dndc model simulates crop growth and development as well as carbon c and n biogeochemistry in agricultural ecosystems he et al 2019 the coup model is a versatile platform of different modules that can be used to simulate a wide range of n transformations including plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi he et al 2020 a limitation of these models is that they are one dimensional one dimensional models are suitable to model only vegetations horizontally invariant such as pasture eshel and beeckman 2013 however even in grass fields lateral dimensions have to be considered under certain conditions such as with sloping land or land with urine patches left by grazing cattle snow et al 2017 while multiple dimensions significantly increase the computational time required for simulations they are often essential to describe the complexity of irrigated agricultural systems that are not horizontally invariant russo et al 2013 single root models simulate the root system as a cylinder taking up water and nutrients from the soil volume around it an advantage of such models is that flow and transport through the soil and across the root membrane can be calculated separately yielding a more mechanistic formulation eshel and beeckman 2013 mcmurtrie and näsholm 2018 however the difficulty of upscaling the results of such models is a disadvantage roose and schnepf 2008 particularly when studying processes at the root zone scale to simulate solute uptake by roots the solute s movement to the root surface rengel 1993 the root growth and the demand controlled aspect of uptake should be considered hopmans and bristow 2002 while the first two factors are receiving increasing attention in models like r swms javaux et al 2008 schröder et al 2013 the third one i e the demand control aspect has seen limited implementation in 3d models an n limited plant can increase n uptake by increasing the uptake per surface area or increasing the total root area it is possible to estimate each of these pathways contributions using detailed models such as r swms in combination with measured data however the simultaneous consideration of all of these three factors is limited due to many parameters required rengel 1993 and the difficulty of determining them roose and schnepf 2008 the passage of nutrients from the soil solution into the plant can be described by passive or active mechanisms which refer to the mass flow of nutrients into roots with water taken up for transpiration or against energy gradients respectively barber 1962 estimated passive uptake by multiplying the volume of transpired water with the nutrient s mean concentration in the bulk soil solution however this method may overestimate an actual ion supply by water mass flow jungk 2002 epstein and hagen 1952 proposed using the michaelis menten model to describe the characteristics of individual membrane carriers involved in active nutrient uptake the uptake rate per root area differs according to the root order rewald et al 2011 the root order changes as roots grow and there is potential compensation of reduced nutrient uptake from nutrient poor areas by increased uptake from less nutrient stressed areas of the root zone rubio and lynch 2007 the macroscopic numerical model hydrus 2d 3d considers transient water flow solute transport and compensated plant root water and nutrient uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 these are calculated as a function of soil hydraulic properties irrigation salinity and amount root distribution potential evapotranspiration and potential nutrient uptake all of which are described in detail in the model technical and user manuals šejna et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2018b the water flow algorithm in hydrus 2d 3d has been widely tested and used for different applications šimůnek et al 2016 including root water uptake zhu et al 2009 n transport and uptake bristow et al 2020 gärdenäs et al 2005 karandish and šimůnek 2017 tao et al 2021 wang et al 2014 and the effects of salinity phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 shouse et al 2011 skaggs et al 2006 wang and baerenklau 2014 linked crop yield to relative transpiration and n uptake in the dataset they generated with hydrus 1d using a function of pang and letey 1998 levers and schwabe 2017 took this a step further by calculating the instantaneous yield reduction by comparing potential and actual water and passive n uptake throughout the growing season instead of only at the end using a modified version of hydrus 1d rezaei et al 2017 used a plant growth model lingra n wolf 2012 to determine the effect of n stress on the plant s potential uptake which was then fed back to hydrus 1d the effects of limited nutrient uptake on growth i e a transpiration reduction have not yet been implemented in the standard version of hydrus because biomass accumulation is a function of both transpiration and n uptake and determines their potential rates these processes should be linked so that stress in either process affects the other s potential rate although the active nutrient uptake function was implemented into the hydrus 2d 3d model more than ten years ago it has only been validated for nh4 uptake in flooded rice paddies li et al 2015 yang et al 2017 while it is understood that nitrate no3 uptake by plant roots can be described by michaelis menten kinetics tischner and kaiser 2007 all published hydrus simulations validated with no3 uptake data do so using the passive uptake mechanism only this might be due to the lack of a function in the model that reduces plant growth due to n stress representing a formidable research gap in modeling n transport and uptake our research objective is to validate the combined passive active and compensated no3 uptake functions in hydrus 2d 3d using measured data while considering a function that reduces potential transpiration due to n stress subsequently we demonstrate the use of this model as a tool for optimizing n fertigation in terms of n use efficiency nue yield and no3 leaching 2 methods 2 1 field experiment and measurements 2 1 1 experimental design the data used to calibrate and validate the model was taken from groenveld et al 2019 where a more detailed description of the experimental setup can be found the effluent water of three recirculating aquaculture systems with no3 n concentrations of 30 60 and 90 mg l 1 named a30 a60 and a90 respectively were used to fertigate six lysimeters per each n treatment three cucumber plants spaced 40 cm apart were grown in each lysimeter in a single row each lysimeter was 100 cm long 50 cm wide and 20 cm deep the growing medium used was perlite perlite 206 agrikal israel whose grain size distribution is listed in table 1 aside from n all other nutrients were kept at equal concentrations in all treatments irrigation water was cooled to 24 c and applied through a 6 mm tube to the base of each of the three plants at a combined flow rate of 0 67 mm min drainage water was collected and weighed daily transpiration was calculated by subtracting drainage from irrigation ignoring a possible change in the root zone water content tripler et al 2012 each lysimeter had a unique irrigation regime a multiple of measured transpiration irrigation transpiration i t between 1 and 5 overall there were 18 distinct fertigation treatments of cucumber plants grown in perlite media fig 1a because plant transpiration determined irrigation while the no3 concentration remained the same n fertigation was indirectly also a function of plant transpiration 2 1 2 measurements and analysis irrigation water was sampled daily and drainage water of all 18 lysimeters three times a week to measure the electrical conductivity ec dds 120w bante instruments china and no3 n concentration reflectoquant nitrate test 116971 merck kgaa germany and orion star a214 thermo fisher scientific ma usa ripe cucumbers were harvested daily starting 20 days after transplanting dat cucumbers were weighed individually for each of the three plants in each plot all plants were destructively harvested at 40

record of the amounts of water applied their concentrations each fertigation event s timing and daily records of transpiration and no3 leached out of the lysimeter the growth rate and yield of the cucumber plants were recorded daily the total uptake of n and its distribution in different plant parts was determined at the end of the experiment once the experiment was terminated the root zone was cut into three blocks of equal sizes perlite was washed off the roots through a 3 mm sieve and the roots were then dried and weighed the root n content was not measured but an estimated value of 5 was used for all treatments in subsequent calculations groenveld et al 2019 the amounts of n taken up by the plants and drained out of the root zone as no3 are reported for each of the 18 treatments as a function of the amount of fertigated no3 n in fig 1b the difference between the amount of n fertigated and the sum of n taken up and drained is assumed to be due to emissions of gaseous forms of n 2 1 3 parameter estimation experiments the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured with the falling head method wever et al 2004 using 20 cm cores of perlite in transparent columns with a 15 cm diameter the columns were slowly wetted from below to prevent the trapping of air in the columns the time it took for a ponded layer of 15 cm of water to drop 12 cm was measured four times for three different columns filled with perlite at a bulk density of 0 06 g cm 3 a retention curve was obtained using a pvc column of 11 cm in diameter and 100 cm in length that was cut into 5 cm slices the slices were stacked to form a column that was sealed airtight with plastic tape the column was packed with perlite at the same density as in the greenhouse experiment 0 06 g cm 3 and gradually wetted from below over a 24 h period to ensure that the air was pushed out of the column subsequently the entire column was removed from the water bath placed on an electronic scale and covered with a lid to eliminate evaporation the mass readings were recorded over time with decreasing frequency as less water drained out of the column when the drainage water flux stopped after a few days and the column was assumed to be at a hydrostatic state the 5 cm slices were cut off the column wrapped in a silver foil and weighed these slices were then dried at 105 c and reweighed resulting in a retention curve consisting of 20 pairs of height and volumetric water content raij et al 2016 this experiment was repeated four times breakthrough curves were obtained for all 18 plots to determine the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities λ l and λ t of the growing media used irrigation water was applied in 3 l pulses at three evenly spaced locations in the plot s centerline where the plants would later be located all plots were flushed two days with saline irrigation water used in all experiments ec 2 28 0 15 ds m 1 then on the third day they were irrigated with five 3 l pulses of distilled water ec 0 11 0 05 ds m 1 after which irrigation continued with saline water as before after every 3 l irrigation pulse drainage water was collected for all 18 plots and its electrical conductivity was measured 2 2 modeling 2 2 1 model description hydrus 2d 3d describes unsaturated flow using the richards equation solute transport using the convection dispersion equation and solute transformation using first order decay reactions potential plant water and nutrient uptakes are specified in hydrus 2d 3d as input time variable boundary conditions distributed across the root zone according to a root density distribution over time the root distribution can be fixed entered as an array of values described using a logistic growth function šimůnek et al 2018a or linked to various environmental factors hartmann et al 2017 potential water uptake can be reduced due to drought and salinity stresses however these stress effects do not accumulate over time in the current version of hydrus 2d 3d nutrient uptake is considered as passive or active mechanisms active uptake is described by a modified version of the michaelis menten equation 1 a a s s min k m s s min a p where a a is the actual active solute uptake rate mg day 1 a p is the potential active solute uptake rate which is the remainder of total potential uptake after subtracting passive uptake mg day 1 s is the substrate concentration mg cm 2 s min is the minimal concentration for active uptake mg cm 2 and k m mg cm 2 is the michaelis menten coefficient which is equal to the substrate concentration corresponding to half of the maximum solute uptake rate jungk 2002 the maximum solute uptake rate and the k m parameter for the michaelis menten model are usually determined based on solute uptake per root length or area using a dimensionless root distribution makes it possible to cancel these root area units kim and lieth 2012 scaled the maximum solute uptake rate in their model to the total plant requirement by multiplying the michaelis menten equation by the plant dry matter over time sands and smethurst 1995 also linked the maximum solute uptake rate linearly to the plant water uptake rate active solute uptake can be limited by limited uptake of water šimůnek and hopmans 2009 2 a p t max r p t t ac t t p t p a t 0 where a p is potential active uptake mg day 1 at a certain point in time t r p is potential solute

they can be converted to cm3 by multiplying by the plot s length compensation of water or solute uptake in a less stressed area of the root zone can be enabled according to the degree determined by the user 2 2 2 domain geometry and fixed boundary conditions a two dimensional flow domain 18 cm deep and 25 cm wide was discretized using a finite element mesh of 350 nodes with smaller elements at the points where water entered and left the domain lazarovitch et al 2005 fig 2 as the discretization had a large effect on the mass balance error the number of nodes was optimized to minimize the whole data set s mass balance error the left side of the domain forms a line of symmetry in the middle of the plot exactly under the dripline and the plant s base considered as line features the distance between plants in the lysimeter was 40 cm and the drainage holes in the drainage trench at the bottom of the lysimeter were spaced at 15 cm emitters at the dripline were spaced at 40 cm which resulted in a small overlap of the wetting patterns kandelous et al 2011 a time variable flux boundary condition was used to represent the ponded area under the irrigation water emitter drainage outflow at the bottom occurred through a 0 5 cm wide seepage face boundary condition the sides of the lysimeter were represented by a no flow boundary condition fig 2 2 2 3 input parameters model specific parameters are required to describe water flow solute transport and transformations and root water and solute uptake the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 was used to describe soil hydraulic properties and hysteresis was not considered retc 6 02 van genuchten et al 1991 was used to determine the saturated water content ɵ s residual water content ɵ r and the shape parameters α and n for solute transport the crank nicholson scheme was used for time weighting and galerkin finite element scheme was used for space weighting the molecular diffusion coefficient is usually negligible in soils radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 and was therefore set to zero for the perlite medium used the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities λ l and λ t were calculated from collected breakthrough curves using the inverse mode of hydrus 2d 3d the irrigation water amount and salinity were used as the time variable boundary conditions at the top of the domain the drainage water electrical conductivity measured after each irrigation pulse was used as the data for the inverse solution the dispersivity was determined as the average value of the 18 plots the s shaped water stress function van genuchten 1987 was used to represent water stress with parameters p 50 of 200 cm and p w3 of 3 this relatively high value for the p 50 parameter was used to ensure high sensitivity to water stress the typical value for horticultural crops is lower groenveld et al 2013 the s shaped salinity stress function van genuchten and hoffman 1984 was used to model the transpiration response to salinity with a c 50 value of 3 ds m 1 and a p s3 value of 3 these values are typical for cucumber maas and hoffman 1977 the interaction between salinity and water stresses was considered multiplicative the osmotic coefficient φ was set to 1 as the irrigation water salinity units ds m 1 were the same as those of the stress response function šejna et al 2018 the maximum possible n concentration of water taken up by the roots for passive uptake was set at 1000 mg l 1 to allow for unlimited passive uptake the k m parameter of the michaelis menten equation eq 1 for no3 n was assumed to be 1 mg l 1 which is at the lower end of the 0 3 6 mg l 1 range reported for high affinity transport systems of no3 n in horticultural crops le bot and adamowicz 2006 2 2 4 time variable boundary conditions the time variable boundary conditions consisted of the measured amounts of irrigation water with specified no3 n concentrations unique for every 18 treatments we used the highest measured transpiration and n uptake plot 1 treatment a90 i t 3 2 as potential transpiration and n uptake for all treatments as n uptake was only measured at the end of the season potential n uptake was distributed throughout the season at a fixed ratio in relation to measured transpiration as total transpiration was measured in daily increments potential transpiration was fixed throughout 12 h of daylight and set to zero at nighttime the initial conditions were not precisely known since the plots had already received fertigation for two weeks before transplanting to eliminate the effect of starting simulations with homogenous water and solute distributions in the root zone water contents and solute concentrations 5 dat were inserted as initial conditions as transpiration was still minimal while the decay reactions were already taking place the root zone density distribution was described according to a formula developed by vrugt et al 2001 3 b x z 1 z z m 1 x x m e p z z m z z p x x m x x where b is the spatial distribution of the root density in two dimensions x z z m and x m are the maximal vertical and horizontal rooting distances from the base of the plant respectively which were the limits of the lysimeter cm z and x are the depth and radius of the maximal uptake intensity estimated at 5 cm each and p z and p x are dimensionless shape parameters that describe the non symmetry in root water uptake in two dimensions x z the root growth rate g r x z was estimated as 1 cm day 1 in the x and z directions until the lysimeter s edge was reached the root zone distribution and growth rate in the experiment were unknown and were thus estimated an increase in root growth due to n deficiency observed in the measured data at 40 dat groenveld et al 2019 was not considered in these simulations 2 2 5 model modification the hydrus 2d 3d model version 3 01 was modified to enable solute transformations and active uptake simultaneously three solutes are considered the first solute acts like a tracer to represent salinity the second solute represents n in the form of no3 which can be taken up by the plant roots drain out of the root zone or decay into a daughter product which was the third solute that represents a gaseous denitrification product no n2o or n2 nutrient uptake can be passive or active and denitrification is considered the first order reaction with a rate constant k d an additional formulation was implemented to consider the reduction in potential transpiration as a function of n stress considered as a ratio of actual and potential cumulative n uptake until that time that was calculated at every time step 4 t p new t p input r a r p where t p new is adjusted potential transpiration cm2 day 1 tp input is maximal potential transpiration of unstressed plants cm2 day 1 entered as input and r a r p is relative n uptake this is based on the understanding that relative transpiration is a linear function of the relative growth rate de wit 1958 which is a linear function of the relative n addition rate ingestad 1982 2 2 6 comparison with measured data data analysis the simulated results of water flow and solute transport were converted into units of mm and g m 2 respectively to facilitate the comparison to measured data as transpiration and n leaching fluxes were measured on a near daily basis the root mean square error rmse was calculated for these 2 data sets over time to assess the deviation between simulated and measured data for each treatment 5 rmse i n o m 2 n where o and m are observed and simulated values and n the number of data pairs when rmse values of measurements with different units were compared i e transpiration mm and leached n g m 2 they were normalized nrmse by dividing the rmse value by the corresponding maximal measured value of each data set to compare cumulative simulated and measured data across all treatments a linear reduction of the modeled data as a function of the measured data was compared with the 1 1 line the coefficient of determination r 2 refers to the fit of the modelled data to the linear reduction model 2 2 7 calibration some parameters could be estimated or calculated based on measured data others were taken from the literature and some were calibrated using the hydrus model the calibration was carried out using data from the plot that received the highest fertigation plot 1 treatment a90 i t 3 2 see fig 1 the objective function for the calibration of optimized parameters was defined as an average of the nrmse values for transpiration and leached n the parameters were sequentially optimized by trial and error preserving the value of previously optimized parameters this leaves the possibility that a change in a subsequently optimized parameter could change the optimal value of a previously optimized parameter 2 2 8 validation after determining the optimal parameters for the data from the plot that received the highest fertigation the other 17 plots were run with the same parameters to validate the function that reduces potential transpiration as a function of n uptake eq 4 the linear regression of the cumulative modeled data was compared with the 1 1 line of the measured data the rmse of transpiration and leached n over time were compared for each treatment 2 2 9 calculation of active uptake to calculate the contribution of active n uptake to total n uptake the hydrus 2d 3d simulations were run with and without active uptake enabled and stopped at the end of each daily time step the difference in n uptake between the two simulations was considered the active uptake contribution the simulation was continued in this manner till the end of the season with the results of the active uptake enabled simulation for the previous day used as the initial conditions for the subsequent day cumulative active uptake was divided by cumulative total uptake and reported as a percentage for each treatment these values were compared with a percentage of active uptake u act calculated according to a modified version of the barber 1962 calculation 6 u act u tot n av t tot u tot 100 where u tot is total nutrient uptake g n av is the spatiotemporal average nutrient concentration of the soil solution g l 1 and t tot is total transpiration l 2 2 10 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of all 18 simulations to individual parameters was demonstrated by running the simulations with all parameters fixed but increasing and decreasing the analyzed parameter by 20 the studied parameters included z x p z and p x which describe the root zone density distribution eq 3 the first order degradation rate constant k d the michaelis menten coefficient k m from eq 1 and the solute and water uptake compensation parameters ω c and ω c the results were analyzed by comparing the slope and intercept of the cumulative transpiration and n leaching data to the 1 1 line and the average nrmse of transpiration and leached n 2 2 11 optimization in fertigation of horticultural crops the factors most easily controlled by the grower are the amount of irrigation water its fertilizer concentration and the irrigation frequency as in the experimental setup the irrigation frequency was a function of the amount of applied irrigation water distributed evenly throughout the day in pulses of 1 min duration at a rate of 0 67 mm min the other environmental conditions such as potential transpiration and n uptake the media type and irrigation water salinity were the same as in the experiment described above the calibrated and validated model was used to find the optimal combination of n concentration in irrigation water and the total n applied the optimal combination should be close to the highest measured transpiration and n uptake with the lowest amount of n lost to leaching or gaseous emissions water and n use efficiencies wue and nue were defined as the amounts of water transpired or n taken up divided by the amount applied nue is a measure that can be used to compare the n use between different agricultural systems van groenigen et al 2010 however since minimizing the n application maximizes the nue an objective function in optimizing fertilizer application demands including a condition or constraint that a certain percentage of the maximal yield has to be achieved 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameters estimated from experimental data 3 1 1 hydraulic parameters the water content as a function of the pressure head for perlite is shown with the standard deviation in fig 3 the hydraulic parameters determined using the retc 6 02 software van genuchten et al 1991 are reported in table 2 and these were used to model the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head van genuchten 1980 fig 3 the retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of sand and loam soils from the carsel and parrish catalog 1988 are plotted in the same graph for comparison besides ensuring a well aerated root zone the large pore volume of perlite gives it an additional water holding capacity in the range of pressure heads most relevant under frequent irrigation the hydraulic conductivity of perlite at saturation was 943 cm day 1 and decreased rapidly with small increases in pressure head similar to sand but less pronounced raviv et al 2002 though the richards equation was developed to describe water flow through unsaturated soil it has also been used to model water flow in perlite li and babcock 2015 palla et al 2009 sandoval et al 2017 3 1 2 solute transport parameters the measured and simulated breakthrough curve data are shown in fig 4 the average λ l and λ t estimated were 7 9 and 0 0001 cm respectively table 2 the ratio of the λ t to the depth of the domain 7 9 cm 18 cm 0 44 is much higher than that recommended for field scale experiments in the literature which is usually only 0 1 gelhar 1986 however kim et al 2002 found a ratio of 0 3 for a conservative tracer in an unconfined sandy aquifer similarly boudreau et al 2009 reported an average ratio of 0 43 for a bromide tracer in pure sphagnum peat media 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 calibration the parameters optimized to fit measured data from the lysimeter with the highest fertigation treatment are listed as calibrated in table 2 water compensation ω c was not required and could thus be kept at 1 no compensation some n uptake compensation ω s was needed as nrmse decreased for ω s values between 1 0 and 0 9 but remained the same for further decreases of ω s the first order rate parameter k d was tested for a range of values and a distinct minimum of nrmse was found at k d 0 2 the n and water fluxes as a function of time for the calibrated simulation are shown in fig 5 simulated leached n was similar to measured values rmse 0 166 g day 1 simulated transpiration was almost perfect rmse 0 003 mm day 1 3 2 2 validation simulated cumulative transpiration and leached n are compared with the measured data in fig 6a and 6c respectively without a function to reduce potential transpiration due to a limitation in n uptake eq 4 simulated transpiration would remain 180 mm in all treatments and drop only slightly for the low i t ratio when transpiration would be reduced due to drought and salinity stress fig 1a the slope of the linear reduction of simulated transpiration is 0 82 r 2 0 976 fig 6a indicating that the n stress explains most but not all transpiration reduction the remaining reduction could still be due to the n stress which increases plant sensitivity to other stresses such as nutritional imbalance salinity or drought however this hypothesis is not supported by research combining salinity and n stress shenker et al 2003 increasing n stress led to a larger proportion of n being assigned to the roots groenveld et al 2019 which is biomass that is not involved in transpiration while it would be possible to include such mechanisms into the model this would require a more complex plant model to be implemented into the hydrus 2d 3d software with a slope of 0 99 r 2 0 954 simulated n uptake matched measured uptake well fig 6b n uptake in all simulations could not be higher than potential n uptake taken from the highest fertigation treatment n fertigation was reduced incrementally so that the nue increased in lower treatments until the plant took up almost all applied n the amount of leached n was slightly underestimated for the plots that received higher rates of fertigation getting the slope of 0 86 r 2 0 976 fig 6c simulated gaseous n emissions resulting from denitrification were lower than n missing from the n mass balance in the higher n application range with a slope of 0 46 fig 6d in the lower fertigation range the emissions were higher and in general the correlation of the linear fit to the modeled data was lower r 2 0 46 the rmse for transpiration and leached n are shown in fig 7c and 7d respectively they were low for all treatments and for both variables for transpiration the rmse increased slightly with increasing n stress the rmse for leached n decreased linearly with a reduction in leached n likely because the amounts of leached n became exceedingly small 3 2 3 active and passive uptake pathways the percentages of active n uptake of total n uptake simulated by hydrus 2d 3d and calculated according to barber 1962 eq 6 are shown in fig 8 when n is not a limiting factor fertigated n 40 mg m 2 passive uptake is overestimated by the barber calculation as was pointed out previously by jungk 2002 this underestimation of active uptake becomes more significant under deficit n fertigation 40 mg m 2 where the hydrus 2d 3d simulations show that active uptake increases with increasing n stress while a calculation according to barber shows the opposite the difference is due to the consideration of spatiotemporal n distribution by hydrus 2d 3d instead of using the single value for the soil solution n concentration used by barber 3 2 4 sensitivity analysis a 20 change in the parameters describing the shape of the root zone z x p x p z had only a very small effect on the results and did not improve the fit of measured to modeled data table 3 the solute uptake compensation ω s was 0 9 in these simulations which could explain the lack of sensitivity of leached n to the root zone shape parameters the low sensitivity of the simulated results to the root zone density distribution indicates that the lack of root data in this experimental setup is not critical a 20 change in the k m parameter had little impact on the simulated results the k m value used in the simulations was 1 mg l 1 compared to a range of values from 0 3 m to 6 mg l 1 found in the literature le bot and adamowicz 2006 the 20 change did not take the k m value out of this range and likely this parameter will only affect the simulation results when a larger change is implemented lowering of the k d parameter resulted in reduced gaseous n emissions and proportionally higher n leaching this improved the fit of the n leaching data but reduced the fit of the transpiration data the nrmse was also reduced slightly indicating that the k d parameter optimized based on the entire data may not be suitable for all treatments this may be due to changes in root zone aeration with changes in irrigation regimes increasing the solute uptake compensation reducing ω s improved the fit of the transpiration data but decreased the fit of leached n the water uptake compensation factor ω c could only be reduced since the max value of 1 was used in all simulations no compensation doing so did not improve the fit of measured data and increased the nrmse table 3 3 2 5 optimization the optimal n application under the described conditions while achieving 99 7 of the maximal yield was determined to be 40 g m 2 with an irrigation water n concentration of 75 mg l 1 this resulted in 3 0 g m 2 of n lost as gaseous emissions 6 1 g m 2 of n leaching below the root zone the nue of 0 73 and the wue of 0 34 the n fluxes transpiration nue and wue for an n application range of 30 50 g m 2 are shown for the irrigation water n concentration of 75 mg l 1 and compared with those of 45 and 105 mg l 1 fig 8 when an n application rate is below 40 g m 2 higher irrigation water n concentrations lead to more n uptake fig 8a the highest n concentration did not produce maximum transpiration as the reduced amount of irrigation water and reduced irrigation frequency limited transpiration fig 8b this reduction in transpiration also reduced active n uptake according to eq 2 plant n uptake was slightly lower for the irrigation water concentration of 105 mg l 1 than 75 mg l 1 at the n application rate of 40 mg m 2 fig 8a under deficit n application below 40 mg m 2 transpiration remained the highest for the 75 mg l 1 n concentration the n emissions were higher for the higher n application concentrations whereas the amount of leached n was higher for the lower n concentrations fig 9cd the n emissions can be in any form of gaseous n the fraction of these gaseous forms that pose an environmental threat is unknown the leached n is all in the form of no3 and thus its cost as a loss of n and environmental impacts can be evaluated the nue differs in the lower n application range but is the same for all n concentrations when the n application is higher than 42 g m 2 fig 8e there are however large differences in the wue as the lower n concentrations require more water to be applied to achieve the same n application fig 8f 4 conclusions reducing potential transpiration due to a limitation in n uptake in a modified version of the hydrus 2d 3d model could explain 82 of the reduction in transpiration measured in a cucumber fertigation experiment with 18 fertigation rates when an active uptake of no3 was considered without the n stress reduction function eq 4 simulated transpiration would remain the same for all fertigation treatments which was not the case in the experiments demonstrating the necessity for such a function to model n fate and transport accurately the hydrus 2d 3d simulations showed that the percentage of active n uptake increased with n stress in contrast to a calculation based on a spatiotemporal averaged root zone n concentration increased spatiotemporal resolution of the water and solute distribution in the root zone by hydrus 2d 3d allows for more precise quantification of the amount of solute transported by mass flow or diffusion the sensitivity of simulated results to the spatial distribution of the roots in the small domain studied was low which indicates that the lack of measured root distribution data is not critical the model was then used to determine the optimal n fertigation concentration and rate for cucumbers grown in perlite under given transpiration conditions and n demand over time addressing the combined effect of drought and n stress on potential transpiration and n uptake allows for more realistic n fertigation modeling this is essential when determining the optimal fertigation strategy declaration of competing interest
